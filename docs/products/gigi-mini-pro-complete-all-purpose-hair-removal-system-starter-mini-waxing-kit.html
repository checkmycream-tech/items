    <ol>
            <li>I use it to wax client&#x27;s, and it does the job perfectly.</li>

            <li>What a great deal!!!</li>
            <li>excellent</li>
            <li>The strips also that come with it are not the best because when you put it on the wax seeps through the strip and gets all over your hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best option to save money, if you visit spas to get your hair removed.</li>

            <li>and I consider it a good investment.</li>
            <li>but, I didn&#x27;t get a good impression.</li>
            <li>The wax isn&#x27;t good quality.</li>
            <li>wax warmer looks to be made with good materials and works</li>
            <li>I used it 2 times and still good thnx.</li>
            <li>Good quality and comes with everything it says.</li>
            <li>and it was a good price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this product before and loved it.</li>
            <li>Works really good.</li>
            <li>Also this kit didn&#x27;t come with good instructions.  </li>
            <li>think if I had it to do again, I would just  buy the wax warmer,  a GOOD wax, &amp; the linen strips separately.  </li>
            <li>This product is good...</li>
            <li>I actually loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>Loved it Just like the one at school</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it is good because it includes everything at one box.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in good time.  </li>
            <li>Good one, I like it, I am using it since one year no issues yet, I can recommend it ...</li>
            <li>The kit offered a lot of product at a good deal money-wise.</li>
            <li>i absolutely loved this wax set...</li>
            <li>A good product for touch ups.</li>
            <li>Works good but wish it got hotter.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good buy.  </li>
            <li>and it does a good job</li>
            <li>Good product loved it .</li>
            <li>When I got on my orders page to return, I found out I cannot return the item as it is &amp;#34;hazardous materials.&amp;#34; Good to know since I was going to put this material on my face.</li>
            <li>The warmer and the applicators are good.</li>
            <li>you get a good warmer anywhere</li>
            <li>I received my order today and the product isn&#x27;t in good condition.</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>The heater heats up nicely and the strips and applicators are great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good machine</li>
            <li>Nice set for great price.</li>
            <li>Good unit</li>
            <li>Price was good.</li>
            <li>but i have not falled  loved with this product ...</li>
            <li>, good buy</li>
            <li>Do remember that the wax will not get every hair and you will need to invest in a magnifying mirror and a good pair of tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not think this is a good hair removal method to use on yourself.</li>
            <li>I applied a good bit of olive oil and patiently rubbed it in to get the wax off.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>A very nice kit all in all, would have been nice if they included the wax off or told you that you had to have it</li>

            <li>Very high quality and great price!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>It is an amazing buy for the price and comes with sufficient wax strips and applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>, the kit is attractive, the instructions detailed and there are a nice assortment of lotions/creams/etc.  </li>

            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>This kit is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing kit.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be like the kind of wax used in a salon, but guess what it was not.  </li>
            <li>This kit does a good job for the most part.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own bikini waxing for years in Argentina.</li>
            <li>so hopefully with a good wax and maybe figuring out a better technique, it will work out well.</li>
            <li>Nice product, works well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this until scrolling through amazon and thought that would be really nice to have.</li>
            <li>Instructions on how to use the machine would have been nice, they assume you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>(dripped on the nice wood floor)</li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have handheld directions.  </li>
            <li>I liked that it came in a kit</li>
            <li>My sister just got the unit and it cost her $30, so it was nice to get the sticks and cloths and some of the lotions as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just plug it in, wait for it to warm and use.</li>
            <li>I liked that this product came with all required things for waxing as listed in pictures.</li>
            <li>kit came well packaged in a nice box.  </li>
            <li>All Purpose Honee, 14-Ounces]] because it got good reviews and it looked the most like what got used on us at the spa.  </li>
            <li>and then wash with warm soapy water&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Included is a nice amount of muslin strips-</li>
            <li>One thing that is nice about the warmer is that it has a control on it so that you can control the heat setting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest, before a waxing session, make sure you have: Motrin (30 minutes before), Pre-Hon, Numbing Spray, Powder (cornstarch will work), lots of strips and spatulas, oil, cooling gel, mirror, towels, a good movie, and lots of patience!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion which come with are really nice.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what kind of wax it was</li>
            <li>I kind of wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this...</li>
            <li>So I just went out and got the honey kind.  </li>
            <li>honestly, I can&#x27;t think of any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>The wax is really nice too</li>
            <li>You should go to Sallys to purchase your own wax.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this WONDERFUL product i use it all the time</li>
            <li>buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>and i never waxed my own eyebrows</li>
            <li>i was so amazed at having my own wax kit and it had everything in it....</li>
            <li>I can do them when I want in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazons policy is: \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had to buy my own.  </li>
            <li>The wax stayed kind of sticky when spreading in my opinion but did the job.</li>
            <li>It was like nice density as well.</li>
            <li>After like 2 times doing my own brows</li>
            <li>I can do it when I need to in my own home.</li>
            <li>She loves the warmer and says it&#x27;s a nice starter kit.</li>
            <li>and now she can do her own waxing.</li>
            <li>she prefer her own</li>
            <li>I wanted to do my own eyebrows after paying folks $8 to do them at salons.  </li>
            <li>no complaints really, this is a great start up kit!</li>
            <li>the warm the strip in</li>
            <li>The  machine  is really  nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit takes about 30 minutes to warm up the wax.  </li>
            <li>looks good - all cute and decent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Package didn&#x27;t come with wax removal lotion of any kind.</li>
            <li>Having my own warmer has saved me money and time.</li>
            <li>Nice looking, well built</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you are familiar with waxing.  </li>
            <li>SO worth it!!!</li>
            <li>I received the product in very good conditions and very fast.</li>
            <li>very nice i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Great product, great instruction, very professional for the home</li>
            <li>Be prepared to purchase more waxing cloth strips if this is used often as the kit does not come with very many.</li>
            <li>The wife loved it works great came on time thanks</li>
            <li>the warmer works well and everything included in the kit is good quality and the instruction manual is easy to follow.</li>

            <li>best one so far!</li>
            <li>It is one of the most effective wax I have used.</li>
            <li>it is amazing and gigi wax is incredibly smooth and it doesnt hurt!</li>
            <li>I am happy that I got my money worth.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still in use and works great definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>the end this turned into a great success and we will be saving a ton of money.  </li>
            <li>THE GIGI MINI PRO PROFESSIONAL EPILATION KIT IS WONDERFUL.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if there were more strips.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to be able to use this at home.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it even more if a wax removal cream was included,</li>
            <li>Would have liked to have more sticks included.  </li>
            <li>We are beginners and have had great success with it.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best home waxing kit that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love it so nice everything.</li>
            <li>Works great and so much for the cost, saves me a whole lot of money to do myself and the products that come with are great!</li>
            <li>This is professional grade stuff and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>The machine is tacky and is hallow and has no rigidness, you could warm up the honey with much more simpler methods.</li>
            <li>I love this kit it was for a nice price.</li>
            <li>I have not used it yet, but I am sure it will be nice &amp; it came with everything needed.</li>
            <li>easy to use!</li>
            <li>love, love ,love this!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times now, and love it more and more each time I use it!</li>
            <li>It is good but too much to clean after I finished waxing.</li>
            <li>Loved the very thorough guide that came with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;Number of splints/cloths seemed fair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic to just be able to quickly &amp; easily do ur own in the comfort of ur own home whenever u want.</li>
            <li>This kit is actually pretty great.</li>
            <li>I did get a full refund though and it does work good</li>
            <li>I thought this was too good to be true, as the price under 40 bucks seemed unreal for what you get.  </li>
            <li>a very detailed manual to assist on waxing in spots</li>
            <li>so it is very important to check the temp before putting on your face or</li>
            <li>Awesome kit for the price, make sure you order right the right wax for what your waxing, I wanted to use for the nose</li>
            <li>I got my product today and it came quite quickly and that was good.  </li>
            <li>but if your already using warm wax its just as easy.</li>
            <li>I thought I could save some money by getting my own waxing kit, but either the pros make it look so easy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>how actually EASY it was to wax my own brows.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for this affordable, incredible, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;home product availability.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to use and remove, so creamy, so nice, love it.</li>
            <li>The pot is super cute and I loved the products except creme wax.</li>
            <li>Love my waxing kit.</li>
            <li>This does not come with it. :)</li>
            <li>but I need more practice with it</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Wish the instructions where better.</li>
            <li>great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>That being said, I love being able to wax at home</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it was frozen when I got it.</li>
            <li>It is, mostly.</li>
            <li>hopefully I will have better luck&lt;</li>
            <li>It is OK, but will not buy this again</li>
            <li>I love using this to wax my eyebrows, underarms and bikini area.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you are storing it away and in a place where it won&#x27;t be accidentally tipped over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>and I love GiGi brand.</li>
            <li>I has always usted bee wax that is more liquid.</li>
            <li>I simply love this product.  </li>
            <li>But I think with practice and those extra tools, it&#x27;ll work perfectly!</li>
            <li>it would have been alot more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better at it</li>
            <li>I recommend buying the honey wax too since it works better on the eye brows and lip.</li>
            <li>They tend to work better than the ones that come with the kit.</li>
            <li>It would be better if they included the waxing powder instead.</li>
            <li>All  the items that come in the kit are more than what you need.</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit and after using I am glad I made the investment.</li>
            <li>Overall I feel I now have the best method to remove hair</li>
            <li>no matter how many showers you take.  </li>
            <li>One more thing.. NEVER reapply wax to already waxed skin as it will cause burns.</li>
            <li>x 3/4\\&quot;]] because it looked the most like the spatula that they used at the spa</li>
            <li>I love love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Gigi Mini Pro Waxing kit.</li>
            <li>Love love love my Gigi mini pro waxing kit!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>You just need some more practice with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve already used one tin of the All-Purpose wax so I&#x27;ll be picking up some more soon.</li>
            <li>every using this, however, I will now be able to do this.</li>
            <li>but this product is great and it really works.</li>
            <li>this product is just OK</li>
            <li>I love it, for the price of this you can wax your eyebrows 5 times and it pays for itself.</li>
            <li>it removed my hair for sure</li>
            <li>I threw it out and am looking forward to using the kit with a better wax.  </li>
            <li>and then they discontinued my favorite brand</li>
            <li>I noticed some reviews where people weren&#x27;t sure what they&#x27;re for.</li>
            <li>I can not explain how much i love it.</li>
            <li>I am in love with my waxing kit :) I would def.</li>
            <li>I use it to wax my eyebrows, upper lip and under arms and it works awesome</li>
            <li>Love it, and will save a ton of money over the years by not paying others to do the waxing.</li>
            <li>A great product and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Fabulous kit!</li>
            <li>I can say definitively that THIS system is the easiest AND most painless bikini wax</li>
            <li>raving- here are the specifics of what I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wanted to warn you. :)</li>
            <li>But it has more things that they use at beauty salon.  </li>
            <li>5 stars! :)</li>
            <li>YOU WILL NEED more wax strips before you know it</li>
            <li>Got for a gift and they love it</li>
            <li>Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the Gigi Waxing kit.</li>
            <li>I like official WAX much better.</li>

            <li>like is too many</li>
            <li>I love my waxing kit.  </li>

            <li>I bought them for my daughters, and they love it.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>But overall, it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wax that is included with the kit is best used on your legs or back.</li>
            <li>We have been able to wax any areas</li>
            <li>Great kit, works really well.</li>
            <li>so I feel confident about doing this myself.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and have for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li>So if you know you also use more than one type you might want to take that into consideration.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to cover work area with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;the items inside look of great quality, I really like that</li>
            <li>I love the pro wax.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but didn&#x27;t like cream wax that came with would prefer honey wax and cloth in place of muslin.</li>
            <li>fantastic!</li>
            <li>I am really glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.  </li>
            <li>It comes with clear instructions, a good amount of product, and looks good.  </li>

            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>wax. :-)</li>
            <li>saved even more money and the strips that i cut are way better than the store bought ones.</li>
            <li>the longer the better.</li>
            <li>I love this mini waxing kit.....</li>
            <li>but you may want to purchase a better quality wax.</li>
            <li>I then saw Gini Pro Waxing Kit and decided to give this one more try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SURE TO HAVE BABY OIL</li>
            <li>I put the collar around the top of the wax can</li>
            <li>Used the day I received waxer couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for beginners like myself.</li>
            <li>this was such a great deal and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Have used honey wax which I felt was a better wax than this...</li>
            <li>Make sure you won&#x27;t yank it all off) or</li>
            <li>Love the product line and kit.</li>
            <li>but I had to buy one in store for more because after that I didn&#x27;t have time to have it sent and get here before Christmas.</li>
            <li>....sounds like it might work better</li>
            <li>Authentic.</li>
            <li>My step daughter tells me it is better then</li>
            <li>The kit is ok - the wax that comes with</li>
            <li>This is way more convenient then having to go out and get my eyebrows done.  </li>
            <li>so glad I got this set.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the usage instructions or you&#x27;ll both end up a sticky ball.</li>
            <li>Searching for better wax.</li>
            <li>Just love this.</li>
            <li>love GiGi products.</li>
            <li>Gum would work better.</li>
            <li>Love the lavender cream wax instead of the sticky Gigi honee</li>
            <li>I did purchase the honey wax separate and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the footprint of the appliance, the temperature control and the directions.</li>
            <li>Just stir and use the outer most liquid.</li>
            <li>I found it safe to use because it doesn&#x27;t burn at all.  </li>
            <li>but when I start to removing the wax with the strips the wax was staying on my skin and most off the hair also.</li>
            <li>It said that is safe to use it on the face</li>
            <li>make sure that the wax is the GIGI honee.</li>
            <li>I love my kit.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this item and I love it for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Alternatives - There are better alternatives for me.</li>
            <li>The wax warmer itself is excellent, the creme wax is nice but kind of messy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>love all the products that came with it</li>
            <li>Better off using ductape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes with most every thing that you need and did not catch on fire.</li>
            <li>I really love my waxer.</li>
            <li>The top to my gigi mini pro was cracked when it was received.</li>
            <li>I like being able to wax at home.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend these and many more GiGi products to everyone!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try out this warmer system.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend and a great cheap buy!</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve had my eyebrows and lips waxed in salons and although I can kind of tell what they are doing--I am not at all a pro at this kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>The wax is nice and warm, not too hot.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to buy a special kind of wax when I run out of gigis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is really awesome and easy to use, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>It got here on time, everything seemed pretty good.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Time witch was good look exactly.</li>
            <li>Do not let wax cool before removing strip, remove while still warm.</li>
            <li>She uses it all the time on clients and is always telling me how it was one of the best birthday gifts she&#x27;s received in a long time.</li>
            <li>The product itself works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good-</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m pretty good at it now.</li>
            <li>I do not like the strips that come with it, but it is easy to find more.</li>
            <li>: use a really thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;The heater is great, so maybe the best is to just buy the heater and get the wax somewhere else.</li>
            <li>I would rather use plastic instead to save money and its very easy to clean using baby oil and bar soap.</li>
            <li>This product is great, the shipping was pretty good too and it was professionally packaged as well.</li>
            <li>I seemed to be able to figure this out just fine -</li>
            <li>This is a great product with clear instructions.</li>
            <li>The creme wax is great for sensitive skin and you wont break out which is always a plus for me.</li>
            <li>learned at the spa that the most important thing is to moisturize and exfoliate in the days afterwards.  </li>
            <li>they have a video tutorial (about 30 minutes long), which, although the quality of the video itself wasn&#x27;t that great, it was nice to see the waxing process itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but that makes it great for sensitive areas like eyebrows and under arms..</li>
            <li>Also kit doesn&#x27;t include two of the most important products - surface cleaner to remove wax from counter and wax removing solvent for skin</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s for sensitive skin which is great of you</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews and really hope that when I make a purchase I won&#x27;t get ripped off with a cheap product, and I can honestly say that my highest expectations were made!</li>
            <li>have course hairs and once done baby smooth :)</li>
            <li>The unit it self is still a good one, but this one has all kinds of creams and lotions for you skin, but that is not the best, cause I only use what doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Item arrived fast and it was good product</li>
            <li>Loved it and use it very often.</li>
            <li>It was good in lots of ways but some ways not some much</li>
            <li>This machine warms up fairly quickly and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Other than that the warmer works perfect.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I looked on other sites and this was the best.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow directions.  </li>
            <li>but anyone can easily manage hair removing.</li>
            <li>Easy pull off with wax</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast, perfectly packaged, nothing damaged, so far...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and affordable and after using it 2 times, it pays for itself.</li>
            <li>I found this extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;Sure Clean&#x27; countertop remover is supposed to take wax off of floors, tables, wherever you accidentally blotched it.  </li>
            <li>This product is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>The directions are easy to understand.</li>
            <li>The instruction manual was easy to understand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so convenient &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wax was easy to use, easy to rip off.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy for me to wax them.</li>
            <li>My purchase was delivered very quick.  </li>
            <li>Everything was so easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li>It was painless and easy.</li>
            <li>The waxing strips are strong and don&#x27;t tear easily when you pull.</li>
            <li>I also like that the products are easily found on amazon.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, has everything you need to get started.</li>
            <li>Here are the steps I do to make it easy for me to wax:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>SO easy-</li>
            <li>Easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, easy to get started.  </li>
            <li>If you read the direction booklet it comes with though it&#x27;s SO easy</li>
            <li>and I found this kit easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the next time around will be great for both legs.</li>
            <li>Easy setup.</li>
            <li>Easy to take care of and cheaper than going to the salon.</li>
            <li>The kit is easy to use, and the wax works</li>
            <li>Everything is good, but this wax in particular is way to sticky and seeps through the canvas strips so it gets all over your fingers in the process.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred a regular wax.&lt;br /&gt;The wax warmer is great and it does warm up the wax fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s why I strongly dislike this product:&lt;br</li>
            <li>I strongly prefer my Braun epilator to at-home waxing.</li>
            <li>I use a mixture of olive oil and castor oil, mostly because it is what I use on my face and it&#x27;s right there in the bathroom :)</li>
            <li>The inside of the truck got pretty warm during the move and the wax looks like it exploded from the heat.</li>
            <li>This is my first time waxing and buying my own products to wax.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience doing my own at-home waxing.</li>
            <li>well stays warm or hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure paint thinner would have worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine except for the wax it was way to sticky for my taste.</li>
            <li>Awesome got it during black Friday .</li>
            <li>and they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>It sets up easily and the honee is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have fairly fine hair though</li>
            <li>but otherwise it was fine.  </li>
            <li>The warmer and everything else seems to work fine</li>
            <li>It worked fine for her</li>
            <li>The waxer works fine, but the wax that came with it is a nightmare.</li>
            <li>Seemed to be fine cloths to use with the cream</li>
            <li>Use a hydrophilic oil (not included) quickly remove wax safely from skin without scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you let the wax get very hot before your apply it to your skin, unless you want to scrub it off.</li>
            <li>It is very economical and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is the most economical, painless, easy way there is.</li>
            <li>professional, space saving wax warmer ,easy to use ,good size and has lotions and accessories included</li>
            <li>I was a little bit worried about the creme wax that came with the package, but I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>I just purchased a hard melting wax, now I am very happy : )</li>
            <li>that just didn&#x27;t work and I always ended up taking huge bits of skin off or something</li>
            <li>The warmer &amp; skin products are great, however I purchased a different wax &amp; strips.</li>
            <li>This is a great kit for someone that does not want to spend a ton of money going to a salon for waxing especially today when it&#x27;s so pricey.</li>
            <li>am so happy to have FINALLY found something that works!</li>
            <li>I do like the smell of the GIGI product lines, but for what I need, this kit doesn&#x27;t fit my life style.</li>
            <li>But the warmer and kit just look and feel cheap.</li>
            <li>It said shipping was free</li>
            <li>and I have to say this kit is fabulous.</li>
            <li>My legs are as smooth as always after a run to the spa.</li>
            <li>and I got the warmer, free honee wax, 100 free muslin strips, for 25 bucks.</li>
            <li>AT A COMFORTABLE TEMPERATURE</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d fortunately buy another one</li>
            <li>However, I won&#x27;t be brave enough to try it on brows.</li>
            <li>it works great, and saves me a lot of money, I have 2 teenage girls</li>
            <li>Shipped fast looks nice</li>
            <li>I contacted GIGI about where to purchase another lid and they sent me one for free.</li>
            <li>The product would have worth with a better wax.</li>
            <li>When I get brave enough I will wax my eyebrows....</li>
            <li>once u get comfortable with it</li>
            <li>Very stick &amp; stringy and not too effective.</li>
            <li>Their sticks that they send are great - only problem was at the time I ran out (about a year after owning this)</li>
            <li>Skin remained perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>instructions were simple and great.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>and I was comfortable with that.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great kit</li>
            <li>im saving so much money doing my own browwaxing</li>
            <li>The Creme wax doesn&#x27;t wax good enough - I had to spend more money buying the Honee wax.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful kit for first timers and long gone are the days of overpriced spa waxing.</li>
            <li>A thin layer of warm wax works best while pulling the skin taut.</li>
            <li>With this I was able to do my whole face, love it, didn&#x27;t I already say that.</li>
            <li>I am okay with not being able to wax my legs though since I really just wanted the kit for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Although my hair is blonde, I just have too much fuzz and waxing it off is WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more and the price is right.</li>
            <li>The wax warmer and the rest of the supplies were very good except for the pink wax they send you with it!</li>
            <li>Banana Boat Aloe Vera Sun Burn Relief Gel, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]] , but I&#x27;m sure there are other products that would work just great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was also happy that so many other things came with the kit in abundance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very sticky!!!</li>
            <li>Wax is a bit messy, drips all over if not careful, but over all it is a good product, perfect for intended use</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s fairly easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and cleans up quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use with lots of accessories.  </li>
            <li>Cleanup has always been fairly easy and quick.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and even my very first eyebrow waxing was a succes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Love my waxing kit, works well and warms up fast!</li>
            <li>because I prefer the original wax over the cream it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>you aren&#x27;t familiar</li>
            <li>Everything came in, and I&#x27;m so excited to use this.....</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>Got this in the mail yesterday and my lady was excited to use it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Working in small areas works best.</li>
            <li>but I recommend buying more of the strips and applicators if you know you&#x27;re going to be doing a lot at first.</li>
            <li>My first experience waving with Gigi, was interesting.</li>
            <li>I love this product, you have to know how use it, but Its not complicated, juts follow the instructions</li>
            <li>Definately worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>I am excited about it</li>
            <li>everything else on it is worth the money!</li>
            <li>Just scrape the wax off when they&#x27;re real hot.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the GiGi Mini Pro Waxing Kit.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased with this product and so excited that I have it!</li>
            <li>: I make sure to use the pre-wax cleaner first, (so the skin is clean of any oils and bacteria)</li>
            <li>works great and will save me money in the long run!</li>
            <li>The Clean Colars are a must if wax gets into the switch it will ruin the machine.</li>
            <li>Would have liked it better if it had been shipped properly to me and not leaked everywhere in the box.  </li>
            <li>clean area using rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li>/&gt;10) clean area again with rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li>I would also recommend picking up some wax residue remover for the skin and pre clean to clean the skin off along with the oil that keeps the wax from sticking to the skin.</li>
            <li>Went and bought a different kind of wax, and is much better now.</li>
            <li>It makes clean up</li>
            <li>The kit comes with many things that you may or may not find useful, but are completely worth the price of this kit.</li>
            <li>But if set on a single unit, this is a GREAT kit to invest in.</li>
            <li>The wax tends to be more stringy when you try to get a large area at once.</li>
            <li>right!</li>
            <li>The hair came right off!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first few times we ever got waxed we&#x27;d take painkillers (ibuprofen worked best for us)</li>
            <li>Wow this was amazing will shop again thank you</li>
            <li>So glad to finally get a great home product with professional results!&lt;br</li>
            <li>good starter kit...buy a different wax though..</li>
            <li>Good overall.</li>
            <li>recommend it to everyone who know how to wax haha. :)</li>
            <li>I still have a ways to go before I am a full on pro at this.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel good having to rewax the same spot to remove hair</li>
            <li>and you want to be able to take it off if you make a mistake without ripping off your whole eyebrow.</li>
            <li>Now im ready for waxed :-)</li>
            <li>Although idk how to use it fully yet, just for the face aspect I really like it:)</li>
            <li>WAX SUCKS DOESNT PULL OFF A HAIR, BEST BET IS TO GUY WAX FROM SALLYS BEAUTY SUPPLY</li>
            <li>I have never been good at this, so only did my mustache, maybe bikini line.</li>
            <li>Overall good product, but wish I had known to order the accessory items in advance.</li>
            <li>facial wax smells good.. no fumes.</li>
            <li>Just be prepared, and you&#x27;ll love this as much as I do.before you pull.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Just be prepared, and you&#x27;ll love this as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Good luck trying to open the wax in order to heat it up without making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have to say many thanks</li>
            <li>The only good things about this is the heater and the sticks used to place the wax.</li>
            <li>I am sending this back, did not do a good job on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It is not painful.</li>
            <li>At this temperature, you will not have to blow on the stick to cool it before placing it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The wax didn&#x27;t burn my face and it really does work for more than six weeks.</li>
            <li>The warmer itself is very straight forward and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The strips are nice because they can easily be ripped to different sizes.</li>
            <li>But once you read through the directions, its pretty easy to remember.  </li>
            <li>though is that it was pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works pretty good on fine facial hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, comes with SO much stuff!</li>
            <li>However, it washed off pretty easily, so over all I give it 4 stars</li>
            <li>The product is very effective but sticky - you need to be careful not to get them on your fingers.  </li>
            <li>In general it is ok!</li>
            <li>Works great but amber dome came in pieces probably due to packaging.</li>
            <li>Other than the packaging, this is a great beginners&#x27; kit.</li>
            <li>Other then that It&#x27;s a great set.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that they did give sample bottles of the other waxing products.</li>
            <li>It s super convenient.</li>
            <li>Had a mild plastic smell for a moment, but went away quickly.</li>
            <li>It warms quickly.</li>
            <li>Might want to purchase more of the waxing sticks and fiber strips because they don&#x27;t have many if you using your waxer daily</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super sticky, it doesn&#x27;t stick well with the clothes they provide, and it just seeps through the cloth.</li>
            <li>but it went away quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the cream wax much better than the regular honey wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using GiGi waxes for years, and the pink wax this comes with is the best for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The price is an extra bonus and I am very happy I finally ordered it!</li>
            <li>I always seem to need a quick waxing two hours before we go somewhere.  </li>
            <li>I like that it came with many strips and wooden spatula things of many sizes.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>melts the wax quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love it... very professional and clean</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and bought this product with not a little trepidation because even the most positive reviews stated that doing a bikini wax on yourself was challenging.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot to melt the wax.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This wax gets VERY HOT</li>
            <li>Thank u very much!</li>
            <li>wait for wax to cool and then store, clean of spatula with hot water, rub baby oil on hands to remove wax</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and really takes care of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>I mean why not put your best most reliable wax in this mini professional kit</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it and it is very easy and simple to use.</li>
            <li>Love my new GiGi Mini Waxing Kit , I used it on my eye brows and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;s live without this set - the wax is better than what I had been using (the honey one)</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I expected and is a great product.</li>
            <li>I also bought a brazilian wax and an all-purpose honee, but I actually really like the creme wax that came with the kit, and it is really easy to work with (in my opinion).</li>
            <li>Very sticky, did not come off face easy.  </li>
            <li>It was a lot to take in at first!</li>
            <li>If you follow what the CD says exactly!</li>
            <li>it got it and wax my brows haha!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I am to picky for this kind of mess.  :-)</li>
            <li>I received my kit today and as most people do with new items, I opened it right away and prepared to use it.</li>
            <li>Use a little wax at a time, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Gets really messy but it works great.  </li>
            <li>I did both sides of my lip no prob, applied the soothing lotion on, and 20 minutes later it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Not enough fabric comes with the kit, it ran out too soon, but the wax and product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I got on YouTube and watched a few videos on &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; and I do a great job each time.</li>
            <li>The hair on my chin wasn&#x27;t quite long enough for it, but it did my eyebrows beautifully, after I figured out that cooling time is really important for this wax.</li>
            <li>Over all, the kit is worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>I ordered this kit for my own personal use not for a business.  </li>
            <li>It is probably a lot of product for my own personal use, but I figured it will pay for itself in about 6-7 uses.  </li>
            <li>, i have always used wax my entire life, and i have never faced this kind of problem.</li>
            <li>I had every intention to put this to use and get my money worth out of it.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a lot of useful stuff</li>
            <li>Nice personal unit; takes practice to do correctly</li>
            <li>This stuff was really runny and didn&#x27;t do as good a job as regular wax.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth $100 anyways, In my opinion.</li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>(optional, but I found it useful)</li>
            <li>Lol the only thing I have to say is I chose sensitive wax</li>
            <li>Worth every Pennie.</li>
            <li>yeah at the end of the day it is worth it.</li>
            <li>or this thing isn&#x27;t worth the buy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky, messy and \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; is not the greatest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already done $100 worth of waxing with this kit (eyebrows, lip, bikini, legs, armpits).</li>
            <li>The variety of edge applicators are so useful.</li>
            <li>I go to a salon for bikini waxing but after waxing my legs I am going to try my own bikini area next.</li>
            <li>Definitley worth trying.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s the case, go have a professional do it and make sure you are up it.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>, you can&#x27;t beat Avon&#x27;s skin-so-soft(hey, it works on labels)a little on a cotton ball and every bit of wax comes right off, and it smells better than mineral oil!!</li>
            <li>Cheap cheap wax that doesn&#x27;t harden enough to pull the hair out evenly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>My set arrived pretty quickly and i had a chance to try it this weekend.</li>
            <li>it heats up pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li>The lotions they gave for after wax wasn&#x27;t able to clean up what&#x27;s left on my legs</li>
            <li>Other then that I find everything to be good.</li>
            <li>Other than this problem, the product was in good working order.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if maybe I&#x27;m not doing something right</li>
            <li>right before you throw it in the frying pan.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Wax seeps right through.</li>
            <li>I even thought about retuning it right away.</li>
            <li>I bought some paper ones right away.</li>
            <li>It might be I didn&#x27;t do the right thing for underarm hair removal.</li>
            <li>Do it right, no pain...</li>
            <li>Thw price was right</li>
            <li>And i totally recommend using oil to clean up as its super easy.</li>
            <li>I followed the simple heating instructions, used the prep lotion first, and applied the warm wax to one side of my lip.</li>
            <li>this is a great starter kit for a professional or home use, just be sure you know how to properly wax if you aren&#x27;t a professional you can really hurt yourself.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to use this for anything but facial hair removal or very easy to pull hair...</li>
            <li>Excellent kit, like most of you I have been waxing myself for years but had gotten tired of the cheap wax that they sell in walmart or other stores</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a great way to save money on your monthly waxes, this is definitely the route to go--just watch a few YouTube videos before removing the hair :)</li>
            <li>Nice kit takes long to heat up though.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to warm up.</li>
            <li>Heat up time is kind of long - but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to start using my new waxing kit!</li>
            <li>Mine came in good condition except the plastic lid was cracked because it was placed upside down in the box.</li>
            <li>I love it - just need a little more practice.</li>
            <li>The new cream wax is FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>Cost me 44 bucks with free 2 day shipping i used my new amazon prime student membership.</li>
            <li>It works just as I had hoped; the directions were clear and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>All in all its a great bundle for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Good and professional machine works as same as salon waxing.</li>
            <li>The indicator light really helps to let you know when the wax is ready to be used.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s a few more tips for ya to save money :)</li>
            <li>The cream wax is not very good but the rest of the package is great.</li>
            <li>but mostly we were going on what we learned from the nice lady who usually does it for us in addition to the very helpful advice in the reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it very much yet, so</li>
            <li>I very much like the warmer, but the wax is just rotten.</li>
            <li>Creme wax is made for sensitive skin and baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>The wax is PERFECT, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Come to find out, after cleaning the old one, it works perfectly fine which I gifted to my younger sister, SCORE!</li>
            <li>I love my new Gigi Mini Professional waxing kit!  </li>
            <li>I found that more hair came off if I only did about a 2 in by 2 in area of my face at a time.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I&#x27;ve seen used in the salon.  </li>
            <li>(if you know how to use hot wax).</li>
            <li>I waited 30 minutes to heat the wax didn&#x27;t get hot at all</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t hot</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
            <li>First off, this kit gives you creme wax with muslin strips......</li>
            <li>it was much higher just for the warmer.</li>
            <li>And I couldn&#x27;t figure out exactly where to put the resting bars.</li>
            <li>Now had I read these reviews first</li>
            <li>The kit was pretty neat.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that it should come with more strips and the wax off lotion.</li>
            <li>was my first waxing pot..</li>
            <li>The wax was the perfect temp and not that difficult to use at all.</li>
            <li>This worked ok, except my skin felt gross after wards.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t too hot on my skin.</li>
            <li>I first tested it on my arm.</li>
            <li>I was a first timer</li>
            <li>vegetable oil most definitely did</li>
            <li>This product is exactly how it sems.</li>
            <li>It does get hot</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really well worth it</li>
            <li>I bought this kit primarily so that I could stop spending so much on professional Brazilian waxing.  </li>
            <li>It comes with applicator sticks, warmer collars and the cloth strips but not as many as the individual packets have.</li>
            <li>but it is a bit tricky at first.</li>
            <li>but that is because I wasn&#x27;t all the uniform with my technique since this is my first time</li>
            <li>I would recommend having more muslin on hand because what comes in the kit isn&#x27;t enough if you are doing legs, arms, bikini etc... in one sitting.</li>
            <li>It does exactly as it claim to do.</li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive at first--</li>
            <li>, IT DOES NOT GET TOO HOT.</li>
            <li>I love the waxing effects (softness, no stubble, no daily shaving . . . .</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>that guides you through first timers waxing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for that tip when i purchased it!</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve been waxing myself with NADS</li>
            <li>And, let me add, this was my first bikini wax since well</li>
            <li>The wax pulls off the skin EXACTLY as described in the tutorial DVD.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package the top of the machine was cracked in 3 different places..</li>
            <li>More for salon use instead of personal use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to turn it on to melt the wax, since I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would start a fire or short</li>
            <li>The wax does not work well if it gets too hot and to liquid</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>that I would have to go with him to the nail shop more often so he could get them done in private room.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use, but the heating machine works well!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used all the different bottles of pre/post-wax stuff, but I do love the cooling gel and</li>
            <li>i was a first time user...</li>
            <li>This kit comes with a lot but first timers shouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li>but she definitely needs more practice.</li>
            <li>So much came with it!</li>
            <li>the wax was not too hot at all.</li>
            <li>it just startled me at first.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never done it maybe get a friend to help at first or ask them at the salon to show you how to wax and then just mimic that.</li>
            <li>when i ran out of the wooden sticks &amp; muslin strips i just went to Sally&#x27;s and bought more.</li>
            <li>has been exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>, this does exactly what it says it does...</li>
            <li>First of all, WAX IS STICKY!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was told that cortisone cream may help after the first time of waxing as it can help reduce the redness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was told that cortisone cream may help after the first time of waxing as it can help reduce the redness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wash my face first.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what exactly came in the kit, because the description only lists:</li>
            <li>, the wax wasnt even hot to start.</li>
            <li>This wax spreads pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this has been my first try with waxing at home</li>
            <li>This kit was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Works well for my back, but works even better for my butt (any area with crevices and valleys)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for my eyebrows and upper lip.  </li>
            <li>The wax worked for me the first time but didn&#x27;t work well after that.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>After years I still have most of the wax left</li>
            <li>/&gt;Facial waxing is not difficult.  </li>
            <li>First off the Post Wax purple concealer had exploded in the box when I opened it so all of the bottles were covered with purple concealer.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a sensitivity to temperatures and my skin doesn&#x27;t scream if it&#x27;s a tad too hot</li>
            <li>It came with a nice booklet on the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; wax the areas of the body but not much instructions on the warmer itself.  </li>
            <li>turn it on a little over an hour before you want to use it, and you have warm wax to get off your mustache or chin hairs quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a good starter kit - I appreciated the tips in previous reviews about needing  baby powder and wax off.  </li>
            <li>Great for small jobs!</li>
            <li>I love it, the hair comes off clean and smooth, just dont apply wax thickly.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if they had included mineral oil, instead of the other bottles.  </li>
            <li>The was last a long time for many, many uses.</li>
            <li>They stand up easily but also fall down easily.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much use for any of the other little bottles of stuff that came with the kit (except the sure clean, which I used most of in my first clean up!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product and good deal if you get the kit, especially if you&#x27;re doing simple waxing (like for eyebrows and upper lip)or if you are just beginning.</li>
            <li>the less on the stick the better!</li>
            <li>This kit is exactly what i wanted, very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Maybe if your pain tolerance is higher, then waxing will not bother you so much.</li>
            <li>Kit comes with pretty much everything you need.  </li>
            <li>(BTW- you can use pretty much any oil-</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I am admittedly a complete novice at waxing</li>
            <li>It comes in handy when necessary although it&#x27;s not very user friendly.</li>
            <li>Very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy enough to use, and the results, where I put the wax, worked.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and actually painless.</li>
            <li>The item itself (the first time i ordered it) came in broken, they don&#x27;t do a great job of wrapping it to protect it from damage during shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy, simple, and cost efficient.</li>
            <li>Product overall is easy to use and will save you plenty of salon visits, saving you money,</li>
            <li>I find that this wax isn&#x27;t as strong as the regular wax</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a sticky substance that gets everywhere and doesn&#x27;t even have the waxing effect of being strong enough to even pull peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>Try not to spill any on the outter casing though, it&#x27;s a major pain to clean up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to have a warmer with a single temperature setting.</li>
            <li>but does not provide instruction as to what certain parts (rest bars) are used for.</li>
            <li>After I finished, I have a large collection of cloth strips with wax on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, however, following the instruction can be very complicate it.</li>
            <li>have not had the problem that others have had with the included strips leaving fuzz (not sure if they meant fuzz from the muslin or fuzz as in fine baby hairs) and found them to be very useful with just the right amount of grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I waxed my first leg I left a few hairs but the second leg is beautiful!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair on my cheeks and above my lip that I am trying to rid myself of.</li>
            <li>The Creme Wax that is included worked fine for me as I was only waxing my eyebrows and lip..</li>
            <li>The machine seems fine, but the wax it comes with never actually works.</li>
            <li>Pull toward the middle of the lip (opposite direction of wax application) Make sure to pull quickly and you can hold the edge of your skin before you pull.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>It works pretty decent.</li>
            <li>So this little item comes in handy.</li>
            <li>This may sound obvious, but make certain you store it upright without any tilt at all.  </li>
            <li>I had another wax kit with the hard wax and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The wax only does a &amp;#34;so, so&amp;#34; job as it is exceptionally sticky and not really hard enough to do the job well.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to not have to warm this up in the microwave every few minutes.</li>
            <li>Now I need to check if that&#x27;s real in a week.</li>
            <li>My wax was ready in about 20 mins.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this warmer.</li>
            <li>but it was very suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It comes with an instructional book which was very helpful to have.</li>
            <li>very disappointed​</li>
            <li>but I much prefer the creme.  </li>
            <li>The creme wax is VERY sticky, so sticky that it glued the container shut.</li>
            <li>I was using the Sally Hanson microwave wax and it works much much</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use all the products included then is it really a deal?</li>
            <li>but, did remove hair very well</li>
            <li>INCREDIBLY FAST SHIPPING.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really order stuff online kux ion trust</li>
            <li>I decided after much research and review reading to try out the GiGi mini pro waxing kit.</li>
            <li>The warmer heated fast (about 30 minutes)</li>
            <li>It still worked really well though.</li>
            <li>It was more than I expected loveeeee it</li>
            <li>Very convient.</li>
            <li>I was looking for real wax, not this chemical junk</li>
            <li>I had to throw so much out.</li>
            <li>The handbook is very instructional and explanatory.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Also it is important to remove the hair in the direction it grows which can be tricky because they don&#x27;t all grow in the same direction (on the face).</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot, Gigi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it are really needed--just the pre-waxing one and the cooling gel.</li>
            <li>i was very dissapointed with the quality of the product</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been paying at a salon for about 6 months now but at $200 a visit (we both get waxed and try to give a generous tip) and it adds up fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll repeat a tip that I&#x27;ve read several times because I think it&#x27;s important.  </li>
            <li>But the whole package is a steal.</li>
            <li>instruction manual that is included is very informational and even provides examples as to how to wax (i.e. eyebrows, lip, chin,</li>
            <li>It came fast.</li>
            <li>I really wanted beach ready legs this summer</li>
            <li>i spend the whole night</li>
            <li>THE WAX WARMER IS VERY COMPACT, SO IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE UP MUCH SPACE</li>
            <li>it took the wax off, and several rub downs with olive oil, and then a shower to be completely free of residue.  </li>
            <li>This wax is very \\&quot;gentle\\</li>
            <li>It heats up in just 15 minutes and does the job very well.</li>
            <li>Really sticky</li>
            <li>The wax here is like a cream, it gets really liquid</li>
            <li>For the amount that I used on my cheeks, I won&#x27;t need to buy any more wax for quite some time, and the pain was minimal.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really rate the product as this was a gift.  </li>
            <li>This works really well on my hair</li>
            <li>I works, I really like the results.  </li>
            <li>his grow so much faster than mine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to STOP waxing for now, until I find something that really works in taking the excess off of my skin.</li>
            <li>I will save so much money with this.</li>
            <li>The wax goes straight through them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sticky and gets everywhere if you don&#x27;t peel correctly.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much easier to use.</li>
            <li>After trying several drugstore types of waxing kits available and experiencing never-ending frustration we decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>always, shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>Has everything it shows and works very well.</li>
            <li>my daughter really likes this</li>
            <li>it comes with written instructions (which I admit I didn&#x27;t really read) and an instructional (kinda) dvd.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like shelling out $12 just to get my eyebrows waxed.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell of the cream wax, but it came with it so might as well use it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Product reviews were really helpful.</li>
            <li>I needed it really didn&#x27;t hurt that much.</li>
            <li>I now have a whole nail kit, and now a wax kit</li>
            <li>For a home kit, it works better than expected.  </li>
            <li>So much cheaper than going to a salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li>It was scattered all over inside the package and it is very sticky.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it..</li>
            <li>: I pre-cut my muslin strips ahead of time and have them ready to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really sticky)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really sticky)</li>
            <li>so she wouldn&#x27;t have to spend so much money at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like this kit.</li>
            <li>Like most girls/women I&#x27;ve spent money lots of money on waxing, hair remover, eyebrow perfecting tools  </li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to wax themselves rather than spending 1/2 a fortune on a salon wax.</li>
            <li>and I was really nervous to try this for the first&lt;br /&gt;time ever.  </li>
            <li>Watch a couple of the demos and you&#x27;ll be ready.</li>
            <li>I am very dissappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care for the creme wax.</li>
            <li>I really like this kit</li>
            <li>It is better than the pink one.</li>
            <li>I tried Nads when I was a teenager, and that was much easier and cleaner to use than this waxing</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried this product, because I was curious to see if it would work for me.</li>
            <li>I really enoy My GiGi Mini Pro Waxing Kit.</li>
            <li>The wax warmer heats up fast and the kit comes with everything needed.</li>
            <li>and we could not get it to remove hair no matter much we tried.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find out that the creme wax that was included in the kit is made especially for sensitive skin (which I have).</li>
            <li>The only thing I can&#x27;t do is my own back</li>
            <li>but the supplied soft wax is more than enough.</li>
            <li>It is sure to pick up all of the hair if you&#x27;re using it for upper lip wax, legs, eyebrows (seek professional help in the beginning.</li>
            <li>Always handy, just plug it, wait for a few minutes and use.</li>
            <li>Very economical since the price of the kit would cost the same as one trip to the waxing salon.</li>
            <li>The wax doesn&#x27;t take too long to heat up and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I love the creme wax that comes with this kit, and bought other types but didn&#x27;t like them as much.</li>
            <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li>I had several towels ready for clean up.</li>
            <li>i love when  put on the wax it doesnt burn me like other wax.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning: I moved and placed the kit into its original box inside a larger box and put it in the uhaul.</li>
            <li>Now, for the skin, and areas other than the waxing spot....not quite sure.</li>
            <li>Other than that seems to be ok</li>
            <li>The creme wax isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the Dark Honee for coarse hair wax.  </li>
            <li>warmer is good but wax cream is not good</li>
            <li>They go pretty far.</li>
            <li>My last kit came with a how-to booklet full of waxing tips.  </li>
            <li>think anyone who has not waxed before, should try a professional first to get an idea of how to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now, I understand waxing is supposed to be messy, but I knocked off two points mainly because this &#x27;all purpose kit&#x27; did not come with the second most important ingredient...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping I can cut that down with more practice.</li>
            <li>More items with it than expected!!</li>
            <li>I would just recommend buying a different wax if you have more sensitive skin and also making sure you have oil to apply on the skin right after it&#x27;s been waxed to prevent little red bumps or ingrown hairs from occurring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only about half way through the wax that came with it - so it lasts an incredible long time.  </li>
            <li>It works just like the salon and with a little more practice it will be so much easier.</li>
            <li>Which more or less has the consistency of melted play-do.</li>
            <li>I would prefer less bottled product and more applicators in the set.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more gental on the skin less bumps and breakouts</li>
            <li>The cloth sucks but great starting kit</li>
            <li>I needed to do my eyebrows mainly.</li>
            <li>think the main problem is the wax itself....</li>
            <li>I have been to multiple places, tried numerous waxes, and have been botched so many times</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes me about 2 hours to do a decent job on my legs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great kit, my only complaint would be that they should include wax remover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s main ingredient is Mineral Oil, so</li>
            <li>The lid for this product is kind of fragile, so be careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li>I had an hour of free time and decided to use this to wax pretty much my entire face- side burns, upper lip, eye brows.</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin when it comes to waxing and the wax that came with the kit was just what I needed!</li>
            <li>The kit comes with soft wax for sensitive skin, so maybe that wax wasn&#x27;t right for what I was doing.</li>
            <li>and maybe I just heated it to high</li>
            <li>put Honee wax in warmer, plug in and set to high as instructed and set a timer for 12 min (instructions recommend 10-15)&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend this brand and product.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly, I highly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li>This will save me tons of time and money, highly recommend</li>
            <li>so I try to keep the heat of the wax as high as I can handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is small and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>apply a little more baby oilto moisturize</li>
            <li>but I wish it worked a little better.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this kit is relatively easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>The wax does not remove easy from skin and basically has to wear itself off your skin due to the fact that its gooey and removes nothing.</li>
            <li>Would be nice to see this bundled with hard wax as well</li>
            <li>, it was hard to find more of the exact brand.  </li>
            <li>But included wax is not much messy it very sticky, I have to use oil to remove it.</li>
            <li>and you have these huge pink globs all over your body and fingers, and no amount of soap</li>
            <li>I ended throwing the whole thing out and getting  professional laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>I used the cleanser that came with the kit, then applied the baby powder,applied the wax to my skin,applied the strip the  results were perfect but it wax painful as ish.</li>
            <li>Go to the GIGI website under Waxing Videos and watch the DVD online its an old 1970&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s video but its still very informative.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try the soft wax and didn&#x27;t like it as much.  </li>
            <li>the top part was cracked and the wax was really messy</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t remove much hair the first pass so in spite of the warning not to apply twice in the same area you have to if you want the hair gone.</li>
            <li>I will try it a few more times; it appears to be too sticky.</li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>apply muslin strip and rub firmly to make sure it sticks well</li>
            <li>I do love some of the creams that came with it, I would not have purchased them separately, but now I will buy a few of them.</li>
            <li>Although I have not seen it, she is very pleased and feels she has enough of the product to last a long time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure my hair was long enough.</li>
            <li>sure to not spill the wax or you will have trouble cleaning it off of surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>sure to not spill the wax or you will have trouble cleaning it off of surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No matter what wax you use, the lotions and gels are useful, as well as the wooden sticks to spread the wax with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they just said that it was &#x27;normal&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It took 5 days for my skin get to almost normal.</li>
            <li>I have used this system quite a few times and love it.  </li>
            <li>It is generally a very sticky, stringy wax and if you don&#x27;t hold your skin tight and pull fast when removing the strips, it wont pull off clean, but might leave residue and won&#x27;t remove all the hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait ti get other wax to fine tune the process.</li>
            <li>Works well and has enough supplies to begin waxing right away.</li>
            <li>I know after waxing a few times, you can get the hair to not grow back at all, so I am going to grin and bare the pain and try to do this a few more times to see if I can get rid of the hair for good.</li>
            <li>This wax is not only a sticky mess that requires a special cleaner (had to use 420 cleaner and grundge off to clean up).</li>
            <li>live in a dorm</li>
            <li>I live in what seems like no mans land.</li>
            <li>Will purchase a new unit, but not a Gigi.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this kit.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m new at this, but I can&#x27;t seem to pull off all of the hair either.</li>
            <li>I will buy a new one soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to waxing (doing it myself that is), but I couldn&#x27;t pass up the price on this kit.  </li>
            <li>Well I decided it was still easier on me and my skin to buy a new unit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this type of wax</li>
            <li>this helps some of you who are new to waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>this helps some of you who are new to waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>I can see how this product could be intimidating if you are new to the waxing world.</li>
            <li>I made sure to put the lid on the container of wax on very tightly so nothing would spill.</li>
            <li>For a clean, smooth finish, apply a thin layer for waxing(the strip holds more firmly).</li>
            <li>I used a sheet of paper to put the used wax strips on for easier clean up but there was absolutely no mess.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Luv this tiny machine, it heats up super fast and the can of wax is going to last me</li>
            <li>DO NOT wax for your face with this kind of wax, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the wax type or waxing your face in general--</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was not sure if this wax would be suitable for my skin type.</li>
            <li>Shipped earlier than expected :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be wrong to write the whole kit out - the wax warmer is good.</li>
            <li>The warmer is great and the accessories package is nice but the wax is horrible!  </li>
            <li>when i ran out of collars i just traced the old one on a thick piece of paper and cut my own.</li>
            <li>I love my little GiGi pot!</li>
            <li>Other than that, this set is very worth it.</li>
            <li>never waxed before, instructions were very clear.</li>
            <li>Everything was very clear on how to use it too.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised by the number of complaints about this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very professional and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>As far as actually waxing - it takes a lot of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li>I would steer clear!</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I have not had any issues with this product (hooooray!)</li>
            <li>Definitely need to be aware of dripping wax, but the kit comes with gaurds for the warmer.  </li>
            <li>That is a pretty big deal when you&#x27;re finished</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the wax doesn&#x27;t stay hot enough</li>
            <li>Even my 16 year old knows how to  use it!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>My loyalty as a frequent Amazon customer just may come to end!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why so many people complain about removing the wax.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I ripped an entire layer of skin off my cheek when first using this.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact same kit my hairdresser has to do her waxes with.</li>
            <li>This same kit is sold from other retailers  for much much more.  </li>
            <li>My only concern is that my girlfriend might like it too much!</li>
            <li>This is the EXACT same thing they have at the nail salons for eyebrow waxing, and they got it for $40?!</li>
            <li>I used to go pretty regularly to get waxed.  </li>
            <li>NEVER HAVE TO PAY A PROFESSIONAL FOR WAXING AGAIN!</li>
            <li>After years of paying to have my eyebrows waxed, I now can get the exact same results at home.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;often enough to have consistently groomed brows.  </li>
            <li>This product was returned by the buyer because it did not get hot enough for the wax that it came with!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and relatively little pain.</li>
            <li>This thing takes 40 minutes to get ready to use (20 mins on high, 20 mins on low).  </li>
            <li>MAKE SURE you let the wax cool long enough, and don&#x27;t get impatient like I did, before you pull the strip.</li>
            <li>The wax is very sticky and it&#x27;s easy have a big mess</li>
            <li>Waxing is less &amp;#34;painful,&amp;#34; but waxing was messy, more time consuming (start to finish with clean up), less effective (I have patches of hair), and takes up less space.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, it was a hot mess.</li>
            <li>: Before I even turn the unit on, I put a piece of paper under the heater that is large enough to cover any drips that may happen.</li>
            <li>I might give this to someone just starting out because it&#x27;s a cute little kit</li>
            <li>I will consider buying one of the hard waxes to see if that works better for me.</li>
            <li>..Had to purchase the hard wax and love that one.</li>
            <li>If you are planning to buy and use this product, make sure to buy the hard wax on the side...</li>
            <li>If you decide to purchase this kit, just make sure that you purchase the Honey hard wax.</li>
            <li>you are planning on doing sensitive areas, be sure to buy the hard Brazilian wax from GiGi.</li>
            <li>I bought the new on for a Christmas present and it got here in a decent amount of Time.</li>
            <li>To make matters worse, I am stuff with bright red waxing marks on my face for an hour, and I didn&#x27;t even wax any hair!!!</li>
            <li>Use clear honey colored wax preferably the brazillian one where you don&#x27;t need strips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more painful too doing something yourself but you will get used to it in no time :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more painful too doing something yourself but you will get used to it in no time :)</li>
            <li>It even arrived early.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This wax is supposed to be for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Im 40 years old and have done it all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The cream wax is supposed to be for an all purpose use and for sensitive skin which is what I need.  </li>
            <li>You really get your money back after just a couple uses.</li>
            <li>The product does all it said it would, you do not need to be a professional to use it.</li>
            <li>professional.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and every time I leave a salon I usually have huge red bumps.</li>
            <li>It always hurts when I get it done professionally</li>
            <li>The gig was for sensitive.</li>
            <li>When I received this product the wax was old and not harden.</li>
            <li>Also, for those who complain that it didn&#x27;t remove any hair, apply wax in the direction of your hair growth, press the cloth strip over the wax and smooth firmly in the direction of your hair growth.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never been waxed before, go get it done by a professional.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s invaluable to know what you&#x27;re in for as far as pain goes as well as to watch technique.  </li>
            <li>Ask lots of questions about how to do it or why the professional is doing things the way</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s had no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as baby oil.</li>
            <li>Pulled the strip taut, and yanked as fast as I possibly could.</li>
            <li>I got the one for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So naturally I continued to wax everything else.</li>
            <li>The product came with a 14 oz wax and it is made for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; but let me tell you it works so well and does the job.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say is that the wax is very runny ... unless you can learn to manipulate</li>
            <li>I use this Professional Kit at home, but remember I am a professional.  </li>
            <li>The pre-wax oil completely protects the skin, helps reduce discomfort during waxing, and leaves the skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>It says it works on sensitive skin and my skin completely broke out.</li>
            <li>I get waxed often and salons and ihaveno allergies nor do I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It has paid for itself several times over in how much we have saved over the years.</li>
            <li>The liquids don&#x27;t really seem necessary, but saved me trying whole bottles and then finding them not necessary.</li>
            <li>I ripped off a tad bit of skin because I&#x27;ve NEVER been to a professional waxer and had no idea what I was doing.</li>
            <li>like a complete set...</li>
            <li>Also, for those who don&#x27;t like using soft wax, don&#x27;t get this kit since it comes with it.</li>
            <li>Wax was so soft it dripped on the counter.</li>
            <li>They should have told me that they cannot respect their customers and I could have taken the product from another part and not waste two months from my time.</li>
            <li>I am used to using the Deplieve wax but wanted to give this a try after reading the reviews &amp; that it was for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to waxing the bikini line or sensitive areas since I just shave</li>
            <li>I appreciate the wax that was included (sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>i let it heat up for at least an hour or more.</li>
            <li>I went soft wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ready about 45-60 minutes after starting it up.  </li>
            <li>I wonder how this kit compares to a professional salon kit?  </li>
            <li>, I was very please with all the extra items in the box.</li>
            <li>it takes a long time to get the wax hot.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked</li>
            <li>Never had it done professionally, but I feel like a pro it went so well.</li>
            <li>The kit comes complete with everything except wax remover</li>
            <li>Professional results</li>
            <li>(Thanks a million to the reviewer who said I could use regular cooking oil to remove wax).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The drive to get eyebrows waxed just isn&#x27;t worth the gas spent.</li>
            <li>I bought the wax machine a few months ago, and still have a ton of waxing strips left :)</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sticky crap all over everything is a non-issue this way.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with it.</li>
            <li>At least her first attempt was on her arm and not one her eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li>but the wax it comes with is fantastic for regular waxing, there is a video on YouTube for other waxing and instructions on which wax to buy.</li>
            <li>Product is great, however the lid was broken, I didn&#x27;t return it due to the lid, I just taped it together</li>
            <li>Overall, the kit does what it is designed to do and is easy to use if you can deal with the mess.</li>
            <li>I mention this only because I don&#x27;t think that particular product comes as part of the kit.</li>
            <li>The instructions suggest heating the wax on high for 25 min then moving the temp to low.</li>
            <li>heat 15-25 minutes on high then drop to low.)</li>
            <li>The wax not only removes hair but exfoliates as well, leaving you with sensitive new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be a little more satisfied and it came with a bunch of useless creams gels and so on.  </li>
            <li>tear away quickly in direction away from the direction the hairs are growing in holding the skin tight to avoid / minimize bruising and irritation</li>
            <li>but I tried twice to wax and it only made a huge sticky mess.</li>
            <li>I am very unhappy about my arms and bought this primarily to wax them in the privacy of my own home.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend buying extra muslin, since the kit only comes with a certain amount.</li>
            <li>apply a little scentless baby oil to the area so that the wax doesn&#x27;t irritate or stick to the skin too much - not too much or else</li>
            <li>Simple baby oil and a quick washing with your regular mild facial cleanser will take care of any residue that you were not able to blot off with the muslin strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I had a new one, but the item still works so I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>This product was purchased for personal in home use and will last a super long time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this product, I can hardly stop smiling about it!</li>
            <li>The wax takes a long time to be hot enough to work well.</li>
            <li>I give it four stars only because there are things you don&#x27;t need included, and things you really need left out of this kit.</li>
            <li>The top was cracked, the pink goop is messy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still visit the spa to visit our teacher and since I&#x27;m not sure if I want to trust my eyebrows to a first timer, but the bills for waxing will be much lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to wax for at least 3 mos prior b/c</li>
            <li>I had ordered them not knowing and would have much preferred to order extra muslin or sticks for the same money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The presentation is good and it really works...is not that painful.</li>
            <li>I would have to agree with some of the other reviews I read about this wax -- it is VERY sticky!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i feel most of the bottles they gave were pretty much useless because i only use the pre-wax cleanser which is some anti bacterial stuff u put on before waxing (just in case</li>
            <li>Once the wax heats up to a certain point, it becomes harder to avoid drips.</li>
            <li>okay, the wax doesn&#x27;t work on tough hair..</li>
            <li>The warmer, Gigi creme wax (more on that in a sec), drip collars, 100 small and 100 large muslin waxing strips, the small, med, and large application sticks, pre-hon, slow-grow, lotion, cooling gel, and concealer.</li>
            <li>I am not sure I will use all of the little bottles of product, bu the pre cleaner and post cooling gel are nice.</li>
            <li>Right now in the process of deciding between getting an additional double or a second single.</li>
            <li>It was a general kit for all types of waxing.</li>
            <li>Only used it 2 times so far....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised I still have eyebrows left.</li>
            <li>My skin comes out and the portions become complete red.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I got the wax for sensitive skin, I should have gotten the regular.  </li>
            <li>You can barely get it off of your skin.</li>
            <li>But, it is simple (my 9 year old helps me).</li>
            <li>i had been taking time out of my busy schedule to get my brows &amp; upper lip waxed at a salon every two weeks for YEARS!!</li>
            <li>The instruction manual is for commercial hair removal, leading me to believe this could be used in a professional salon.  </li>
            <li>The glue was very sticky, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was getting hot enough.  </li>
            <li>but we apparently wanted &amp;#34;Hard Wax&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>But I had no such problems with this product and would recommend it for people with sensitive skin to give this a try and see if you like it.</li>
            <li>but I did not like the wax that it came with, once it melts its very watery and its pink.</li>
            <li>Oh well, back to tweezers and professional waxing.</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give a better review is for the fact that my lid to go over the wax was broken completely when it arrived.</li>
            <li>MY TOP WAS BROKEN WHEN THEY SHIPPED IT TO ME</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another tip is that it&#x27;s okay to apply the wax sparingly / thin.  </li>
            <li>&quot; unfortunately does not pull out the hair as effectively.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use it because the lid was broken at arrival</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that the box it arrived in was smushed which made giving it as a gift a little cringe worthy.</li>
            <li>I recommend rubbing your hands down in oil or wearing gloves, the wax is pretty sticky.  </li>
            <li>Kit comes with more or less all you need including a few collars.</li>
            <li>You need to read the instruction manual and follow directions, and it will be a little messy the first time around, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>the other hand, the delivery on this item was very faster than I expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wax is extremely sticky and I can&#x27;t get it off my face or hands without really scrubbing and using some lotion.  </li>
            <li>The wax is also hard to clean off your skin.</li>
            <li>I will instruct as much persons as I can to be very careful when buying from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow I can&#x27;t believe all the stuff you get in this kit for such a low price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really used much of the extra stuff that comes with -</li>
            <li>I do agree that half of the bottles are useless and that it should have come with powder, and wax-off, but other than that, pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>There was a little stinging at first with the cooling gel</li>
            <li>Iove the waxing kit as a whole but the cream wax is not worth wasting your time with.</li>
            <li>Larger than it looks and definitely larger than I expected, up too much counter space.</li>
            <li>recently i started buying popsicle sticks at the dollar store &amp; cutting my own cotton strips out of an old pillow case.</li>
            <li>Update: used 5 times for whole body, used a half of wax and all stripes, but wax replacements are in bed bath and beyond or online</li>
            <li>The Pink Cr&amp;egrave;me Wax that it comes with can go from solid to messy real quick due to</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t forgotten that you were getting ready to wax by then, you can finally get down to business.  </li>
            <li>I also trimmed down the strip I was going to be using to wax my upper lip as it was really</li>
            <li>The wax was quite thick and it was very hot</li>
            <li>Everything (Wax, sticks, cloth, warmer, instructions, extra bottles of stuff you dont really need..) are all included and it still costs less than one salon session.</li>
            <li>Comes with a fine oil (thin) to put on before waxing.</li>
            <li>rest of the kit is a little too much.</li>
            <li>I bought the large roll to do my legs, but there is enough in the kit to do your eyebrows a few</li>
            <li>set it on high for 25 minutes then down to</li>
            <li>but I have to leave it on high to be affective, even though it says you can turn it down to low after it heats up.</li>
            <li>it don&#x27;t remove any hair, the warmer is good but could have gotten that separate if I had just read some of the bad reviews</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> excellent</li>
            <li> The strips also that come with it are not the best because when you put it on the wax seeps through the strip and gets all over your hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best option to save money, if you visit spas to get your hair removed.</li>

            <li> and I consider it a good investment.</li>
            <li> but, I didn&#x27;t get a good impression.</li>
            <li> The wax isn&#x27;t good quality.</li>
            <li> wax warmer looks to be made with good materials and works</li>
            <li> I used it 2 times and still good thnx.</li>
            <li> Good quality and comes with everything it says.</li>
            <li> and it was a good price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product before and loved it.</li>
            <li> Works really good.</li>
            <li> Also this kit didn&#x27;t come with good instructions.  </li>
            <li> think if I had it to do again, I would just  buy the wax warmer,  a GOOD wax, &amp; the linen strips separately.  </li>
            <li> This product is good...</li>
            <li> I actually loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good buy</li>
            <li> Loved it Just like the one at school</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it is good because it includes everything at one box.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in good time.  </li>
            <li> Good one, I like it, I am using it since one year no issues yet, I can recommend it ...</li>
            <li> The kit offered a lot of product at a good deal money-wise.</li>
            <li> i absolutely loved this wax set...</li>
            <li> A good product for touch ups.</li>
            <li> Works good but wish it got hotter.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good buy.  </li>
            <li> and it does a good job</li>
            <li> Good product loved it .</li>
            <li> When I got on my orders page to return, I found out I cannot return the item as it is &amp;#34;hazardous materials.&amp;#34; Good to know since I was going to put this material on my face.</li>
            <li> The warmer and the applicators are good.</li>
            <li> you get a good warmer anywhere</li>
            <li> I received my order today and the product isn&#x27;t in good condition.</li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> The heater heats up nicely and the strips and applicators are great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good machine</li>
            <li> Nice set for great price.</li>
            <li> Good unit</li>
            <li> Price was good.</li>
            <li> but i have not falled  loved with this product ...</li>
            <li> , good buy</li>
            <li> Do remember that the wax will not get every hair and you will need to invest in a magnifying mirror and a good pair of tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not think this is a good hair removal method to use on yourself.</li>
            <li> I applied a good bit of olive oil and patiently rubbed it in to get the wax off.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> A very nice kit all in all, would have been nice if they included the wax off or told you that you had to have it</li>
            <li> The kit is awesome well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s great for my at home waxing.</li>
            <li> Wax was very cheap and would not come off my skin!</li>
            <li> I love the cr&amp;eacute;me wax, this wax is great on my legs and face.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product and all of the items that came with it.  </li>
            <li> We were very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love the kit, great price.  </li>
            <li> It will give you the best chance of success at home.</li>
            <li> Loved it works amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a good product, but I&#x27;m still learning the fundamental of doing my own eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It was awesome seeing the hair just come right off.</li>
            <li> sure you have something on hand to remove leftover wax from the skin!  </li>
            <li> Stick with it because you get better with practice...and a glass of wine doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
            <li> ALL OF THE LOTIONS AND ACCESSORIES MAKE THIS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT FOR BEGINNERS AND SEASONED PROFESSIONALS.</li>
            <li> We love this waxer!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I love this kit!</li>

            <li> It is an amazing buy for the price and comes with sufficient wax strips and applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing starter kit with basically everything you need.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing.  </li>
            <li> , the kit is attractive, the instructions detailed and there are a nice assortment of lotions/creams/etc.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> This kit is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing kit.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be like the kind of wax used in a salon, but guess what it was not.  </li>
            <li> This kit does a good job for the most part.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own bikini waxing for years in Argentina.</li>
            <li> so hopefully with a good wax and maybe figuring out a better technique, it will work out well.</li>
            <li> Nice product, works well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this until scrolling through amazon and thought that would be really nice to have.</li>
            <li> Instructions on how to use the machine would have been nice, they assume you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> (dripped on the nice wood floor)</li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have handheld directions.  </li>
            <li> I liked that it came in a kit</li>
            <li> My sister just got the unit and it cost her $30, so it was nice to get the sticks and cloths and some of the lotions as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just plug it in, wait for it to warm and use.</li>
            <li> I liked that this product came with all required things for waxing as listed in pictures.</li>
            <li> kit came well packaged in a nice box.  </li>
            <li> All Purpose Honee, 14-Ounces]] because it got good reviews and it looked the most like what got used on us at the spa.  </li>
            <li> and then wash with warm soapy water&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Included is a nice amount of muslin strips-</li>
            <li> One thing that is nice about the warmer is that it has a control on it so that you can control the heat setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest, before a waxing session, make sure you have: Motrin (30 minutes before), Pre-Hon, Numbing Spray, Powder (cornstarch will work), lots of strips and spatulas, oil, cooling gel, mirror, towels, a good movie, and lots of patience!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lotion which come with are really nice.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what kind of wax it was</li>
            <li> I kind of wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this...</li>
            <li> So I just went out and got the honey kind.  </li>
            <li> honestly, I can&#x27;t think of any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> The wax is really nice too</li>
            <li> You should go to Sallys to purchase your own wax.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this WONDERFUL product i use it all the time</li>
            <li> buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> and i never waxed my own eyebrows</li>
            <li> i was so amazed at having my own wax kit and it had everything in it....</li>
            <li> I can do them when I want in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazons policy is: \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had to buy my own.  </li>
            <li> The wax stayed kind of sticky when spreading in my opinion but did the job.</li>
            <li> It was like nice density as well.</li>
            <li> After like 2 times doing my own brows</li>
            <li> I can do it when I need to in my own home.</li>
            <li> She loves the warmer and says it&#x27;s a nice starter kit.</li>
            <li> and now she can do her own waxing.</li>
            <li> she prefer her own</li>
            <li> I wanted to do my own eyebrows after paying folks $8 to do them at salons.  </li>
            <li> no complaints really, this is a great start up kit!</li>
            <li> the warm the strip in</li>
            <li> The  machine  is really  nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit takes about 30 minutes to warm up the wax.  </li>
            <li> looks good - all cute and decent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Package didn&#x27;t come with wax removal lotion of any kind.</li>
            <li> Having my own warmer has saved me money and time.</li>
            <li> Nice looking, well built</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you are familiar with waxing.  </li>
            <li> SO worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I received the product in very good conditions and very fast.</li>
            <li> very nice i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product, great instruction, very professional for the home</li>
            <li> Be prepared to purchase more waxing cloth strips if this is used often as the kit does not come with very many.</li>
            <li> The wife loved it works great came on time thanks</li>
            <li> the warmer works well and everything included in the kit is good quality and the instruction manual is easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Super happy.</li>

            <li> Make sure you get more collars!</li>
            <li> best one so far!</li>
            <li> It is one of the most effective wax I have used.</li>
            <li> it is amazing and gigi wax is incredibly smooth and it doesnt hurt!</li>
            <li> I am happy that I got my money worth.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still in use and works great definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> the end this turned into a great success and we will be saving a ton of money.  </li>
            <li> THE GIGI MINI PRO PROFESSIONAL EPILATION KIT IS WONDERFUL.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if there were more strips.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to be able to use this at home.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it even more if a wax removal cream was included,</li>
            <li> Would have liked to have more sticks included.  </li>
            <li> We are beginners and have had great success with it.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best home waxing kit that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love it so nice everything.</li>
            <li> Works great and so much for the cost, saves me a whole lot of money to do myself and the products that come with are great!</li>
            <li> This is professional grade stuff and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The machine is tacky and is hallow and has no rigidness, you could warm up the honey with much more simpler methods.</li>
            <li> I love this kit it was for a nice price.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet, but I am sure it will be nice &amp; it came with everything needed.</li>
            <li> easy to use!</li>
            <li> love, love ,love this!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times now, and love it more and more each time I use it!</li>
            <li> It is good but too much to clean after I finished waxing.</li>
            <li> Loved the very thorough guide that came with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;Number of splints/cloths seemed fair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic to just be able to quickly &amp; easily do ur own in the comfort of ur own home whenever u want.</li>
            <li> This kit is actually pretty great.</li>
            <li> I did get a full refund though and it does work good</li>
            <li> I thought this was too good to be true, as the price under 40 bucks seemed unreal for what you get.  </li>
            <li> a very detailed manual to assist on waxing in spots</li>
            <li> so it is very important to check the temp before putting on your face or</li>
            <li> Awesome kit for the price, make sure you order right the right wax for what your waxing, I wanted to use for the nose</li>
            <li> I got my product today and it came quite quickly and that was good.  </li>
            <li> but if your already using warm wax its just as easy.</li>
            <li> I thought I could save some money by getting my own waxing kit, but either the pros make it look so easy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> how actually EASY it was to wax my own brows.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for this affordable, incredible, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;home product availability.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to use and remove, so creamy, so nice, love it.</li>
            <li> The pot is super cute and I loved the products except creme wax.</li>
            <li> Love my waxing kit.</li>
            <li> This does not come with it. :)</li>
            <li> but I need more practice with it</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Wish the instructions where better.</li>
            <li> great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> That being said, I love being able to wax at home</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it was frozen when I got it.</li>
            <li> It is, mostly.</li>
            <li> hopefully I will have better luck&lt;</li>
            <li> It is OK, but will not buy this again</li>
            <li> I love using this to wax my eyebrows, underarms and bikini area.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you are storing it away and in a place where it won&#x27;t be accidentally tipped over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> and I love GiGi brand.</li>
            <li> I has always usted bee wax that is more liquid.</li>
            <li> I simply love this product.  </li>
            <li> But I think with practice and those extra tools, it&#x27;ll work perfectly!</li>
            <li> it would have been alot more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better at it</li>
            <li> I recommend buying the honey wax too since it works better on the eye brows and lip.</li>
            <li> They tend to work better than the ones that come with the kit.</li>
            <li> It would be better if they included the waxing powder instead.</li>
            <li> All  the items that come in the kit are more than what you need.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit and after using I am glad I made the investment.</li>
            <li> Overall I feel I now have the best method to remove hair</li>
            <li> no matter how many showers you take.  </li>
            <li> One more thing.. NEVER reapply wax to already waxed skin as it will cause burns.</li>
            <li> x 3/4\\&quot;]] because it looked the most like the spatula that they used at the spa</li>
            <li> I love love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Gigi Mini Pro Waxing kit.</li>
            <li> Love love love my Gigi mini pro waxing kit!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> You just need some more practice with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve already used one tin of the All-Purpose wax so I&#x27;ll be picking up some more soon.</li>
            <li> every using this, however, I will now be able to do this.</li>
            <li> but this product is great and it really works.</li>
            <li> this product is just OK</li>
            <li> I love it, for the price of this you can wax your eyebrows 5 times and it pays for itself.</li>
            <li> it removed my hair for sure</li>
            <li> I threw it out and am looking forward to using the kit with a better wax.  </li>
            <li> and then they discontinued my favorite brand</li>
            <li> I noticed some reviews where people weren&#x27;t sure what they&#x27;re for.</li>
            <li> I can not explain how much i love it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with my waxing kit :) I would def.</li>
            <li> I use it to wax my eyebrows, upper lip and under arms and it works awesome</li>
            <li> Love it, and will save a ton of money over the years by not paying others to do the waxing.</li>
            <li> A great product and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Fabulous kit!</li>
            <li> I can say definitively that THIS system is the easiest AND most painless bikini wax</li>
            <li> raving- here are the specifics of what I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wanted to warn you. :)</li>
            <li> But it has more things that they use at beauty salon.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars! :)</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NEED more wax strips before you know it</li>
            <li> Got for a gift and they love it</li>
            <li> Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the Gigi Waxing kit.</li>
            <li> I like official WAX much better.</li>
            <li> Sally Hanson wax worked much better for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> like is too many</li>
            <li> I love my waxing kit.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I was impressed by the deal but dissappointed by its use.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my daughters, and they love it.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> But overall, it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wax that is included with the kit is best used on your legs or back.</li>
            <li> We have been able to wax any areas</li>
            <li> Great kit, works really well.</li>
            <li> so I feel confident about doing this myself.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and have for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> So if you know you also use more than one type you might want to take that into consideration.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to cover work area with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> /&gt;the items inside look of great quality, I really like that</li>
            <li> I love the pro wax.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but didn&#x27;t like cream wax that came with would prefer honey wax and cloth in place of muslin.</li>
            <li> fantastic!</li>
            <li> I am really glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  </li>
            <li> It comes with clear instructions, a good amount of product, and looks good.  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my eyebrows</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> wax. :-)</li>
            <li> saved even more money and the strips that i cut are way better than the store bought ones.</li>
            <li> the longer the better.</li>
            <li> I love this mini waxing kit.....</li>
            <li> but you may want to purchase a better quality wax.</li>
            <li> I then saw Gini Pro Waxing Kit and decided to give this one more try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SURE TO HAVE BABY OIL</li>
            <li> I put the collar around the top of the wax can</li>
            <li> Used the day I received waxer couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for beginners like myself.</li>
            <li> this was such a great deal and my daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Have used honey wax which I felt was a better wax than this...</li>
            <li> Make sure you won&#x27;t yank it all off) or</li>
            <li> Love the product line and kit.</li>
            <li> but I had to buy one in store for more because after that I didn&#x27;t have time to have it sent and get here before Christmas.</li>
            <li> ....sounds like it might work better</li>
            <li> Authentic.</li>
            <li> My step daughter tells me it is better then</li>
            <li> The kit is ok - the wax that comes with</li>
            <li> This is way more convenient then having to go out and get my eyebrows done.  </li>
            <li> so glad I got this set.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the usage instructions or you&#x27;ll both end up a sticky ball.</li>
            <li> Searching for better wax.</li>
            <li> Just love this.</li>
            <li> love GiGi products.</li>
            <li> Gum would work better.</li>
            <li> Love the lavender cream wax instead of the sticky Gigi honee</li>
            <li> I did purchase the honey wax separate and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the footprint of the appliance, the temperature control and the directions.</li>
            <li> Just stir and use the outer most liquid.</li>
            <li> I found it safe to use because it doesn&#x27;t burn at all.  </li>
            <li> but when I start to removing the wax with the strips the wax was staying on my skin and most off the hair also.</li>
            <li> It said that is safe to use it on the face</li>
            <li> make sure that the wax is the GIGI honee.</li>
            <li> I love my kit.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this item and I love it for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Alternatives - There are better alternatives for me.</li>
            <li> The wax warmer itself is excellent, the creme wax is nice but kind of messy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> love all the products that came with it</li>
            <li> Better off using ductape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes with most every thing that you need and did not catch on fire.</li>
            <li> I really love my waxer.</li>
            <li> The top to my gigi mini pro was cracked when it was received.</li>
            <li> I like being able to wax at home.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend these and many more GiGi products to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try out this warmer system.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend and a great cheap buy!</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve had my eyebrows and lips waxed in salons and although I can kind of tell what they are doing--I am not at all a pro at this kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> The wax is nice and warm, not too hot.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to buy a special kind of wax when I run out of gigis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is really awesome and easy to use, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li> It got here on time, everything seemed pretty good.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Time witch was good look exactly.</li>
            <li> Do not let wax cool before removing strip, remove while still warm.</li>
            <li> She uses it all the time on clients and is always telling me how it was one of the best birthday gifts she&#x27;s received in a long time.</li>
            <li> The product itself works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good-</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m pretty good at it now.</li>
            <li> I do not like the strips that come with it, but it is easy to find more.</li>
            <li> : use a really thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;The heater is great, so maybe the best is to just buy the heater and get the wax somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I would rather use plastic instead to save money and its very easy to clean using baby oil and bar soap.</li>
            <li> This product is great, the shipping was pretty good too and it was professionally packaged as well.</li>
            <li> I seemed to be able to figure this out just fine -</li>
            <li> This is a great product with clear instructions.</li>
            <li> The creme wax is great for sensitive skin and you wont break out which is always a plus for me.</li>
            <li> learned at the spa that the most important thing is to moisturize and exfoliate in the days afterwards.  </li>
            <li> they have a video tutorial (about 30 minutes long), which, although the quality of the video itself wasn&#x27;t that great, it was nice to see the waxing process itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that makes it great for sensitive areas like eyebrows and under arms..</li>
            <li> Also kit doesn&#x27;t include two of the most important products - surface cleaner to remove wax from counter and wax removing solvent for skin</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s for sensitive skin which is great of you</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and really hope that when I make a purchase I won&#x27;t get ripped off with a cheap product, and I can honestly say that my highest expectations were made!</li>
            <li> have course hairs and once done baby smooth :)</li>
            <li> The unit it self is still a good one, but this one has all kinds of creams and lotions for you skin, but that is not the best, cause I only use what doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Item arrived fast and it was good product</li>
            <li> Loved it and use it very often.</li>
            <li> It was good in lots of ways but some ways not some much</li>
            <li> This machine warms up fairly quickly and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Other than that the warmer works perfect.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I looked on other sites and this was the best.</li>
            <li> Easy to follow directions.  </li>
            <li> but anyone can easily manage hair removing.</li>
            <li> Easy pull off with wax</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, perfectly packaged, nothing damaged, so far...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and affordable and after using it 2 times, it pays for itself.</li>
            <li> I found this extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Sure Clean&#x27; countertop remover is supposed to take wax off of floors, tables, wherever you accidentally blotched it.  </li>
            <li> This product is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> The directions are easy to understand.</li>
            <li> The instruction manual was easy to understand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wax was easy to use, easy to rip off.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy for me to wax them.</li>
            <li> My purchase was delivered very quick.  </li>
            <li> Everything was so easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li> It was painless and easy.</li>
            <li> The waxing strips are strong and don&#x27;t tear easily when you pull.</li>
            <li> I also like that the products are easily found on amazon.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, has everything you need to get started.</li>
            <li> Here are the steps I do to make it easy for me to wax:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> SO easy-</li>
            <li> Easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, easy to get started.  </li>
            <li> If you read the direction booklet it comes with though it&#x27;s SO easy</li>
            <li> and I found this kit easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the next time around will be great for both legs.</li>
            <li> Easy setup.</li>
            <li> Easy to take care of and cheaper than going to the salon.</li>
            <li> The kit is easy to use, and the wax works</li>
            <li> Everything is good, but this wax in particular is way to sticky and seeps through the canvas strips so it gets all over your fingers in the process.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a regular wax.&lt;br /&gt;The wax warmer is great and it does warm up the wax fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s why I strongly dislike this product:&lt;br</li>
            <li> I strongly prefer my Braun epilator to at-home waxing.</li>
            <li> I use a mixture of olive oil and castor oil, mostly because it is what I use on my face and it&#x27;s right there in the bathroom :)</li>
            <li> The inside of the truck got pretty warm during the move and the wax looks like it exploded from the heat.</li>
            <li> This is my first time waxing and buying my own products to wax.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience doing my own at-home waxing.</li>
            <li> well stays warm or hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure paint thinner would have worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li> and it worked fine except for the wax it was way to sticky for my taste.</li>
            <li> Awesome got it during black Friday .</li>
            <li> and they work just fine.  </li>
            <li> It sets up easily and the honee is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have fairly fine hair though</li>
            <li> but otherwise it was fine.  </li>
            <li> The warmer and everything else seems to work fine</li>
            <li> It worked fine for her</li>
            <li> The waxer works fine, but the wax that came with it is a nightmare.</li>
            <li> Seemed to be fine cloths to use with the cream</li>
            <li> Use a hydrophilic oil (not included) quickly remove wax safely from skin without scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure you let the wax get very hot before your apply it to your skin, unless you want to scrub it off.</li>
            <li> It is very economical and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very useful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the most economical, painless, easy way there is.</li>
            <li> professional, space saving wax warmer ,easy to use ,good size and has lotions and accessories included</li>
            <li> I was a little bit worried about the creme wax that came with the package, but I think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I just purchased a hard melting wax, now I am very happy : )</li>
            <li> that just didn&#x27;t work and I always ended up taking huge bits of skin off or something</li>
            <li> The warmer &amp; skin products are great, however I purchased a different wax &amp; strips.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for someone that does not want to spend a ton of money going to a salon for waxing especially today when it&#x27;s so pricey.</li>
            <li> am so happy to have FINALLY found something that works!</li>
            <li> I do like the smell of the GIGI product lines, but for what I need, this kit doesn&#x27;t fit my life style.</li>
            <li> But the warmer and kit just look and feel cheap.</li>
            <li> It said shipping was free</li>
            <li> and I have to say this kit is fabulous.</li>
            <li> My legs are as smooth as always after a run to the spa.</li>
            <li> and I got the warmer, free honee wax, 100 free muslin strips, for 25 bucks.</li>
            <li> AT A COMFORTABLE TEMPERATURE</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d fortunately buy another one</li>
            <li> However, I won&#x27;t be brave enough to try it on brows.</li>
            <li> it works great, and saves me a lot of money, I have 2 teenage girls</li>
            <li> Shipped fast looks nice</li>
            <li> I contacted GIGI about where to purchase another lid and they sent me one for free.</li>
            <li> The product would have worth with a better wax.</li>
            <li> When I get brave enough I will wax my eyebrows....</li>
            <li> once u get comfortable with it</li>
            <li> Very stick &amp; stringy and not too effective.</li>
            <li> Their sticks that they send are great - only problem was at the time I ran out (about a year after owning this)</li>
            <li> Skin remained perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> instructions were simple and great.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> and I was comfortable with that.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great kit</li>
            <li> im saving so much money doing my own browwaxing</li>
            <li> The Creme wax doesn&#x27;t wax good enough - I had to spend more money buying the Honee wax.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful kit for first timers and long gone are the days of overpriced spa waxing.</li>
            <li> A thin layer of warm wax works best while pulling the skin taut.</li>
            <li> With this I was able to do my whole face, love it, didn&#x27;t I already say that.</li>
            <li> I am okay with not being able to wax my legs though since I really just wanted the kit for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is blonde, I just have too much fuzz and waxing it off is WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more and the price is right.</li>
            <li> The wax warmer and the rest of the supplies were very good except for the pink wax they send you with it!</li>
            <li> Banana Boat Aloe Vera Sun Burn Relief Gel, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]] , but I&#x27;m sure there are other products that would work just great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was also happy that so many other things came with the kit in abundance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very sticky!!!</li>
            <li> Wax is a bit messy, drips all over if not careful, but over all it is a good product, perfect for intended use</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s fairly easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and cleans up quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use with lots of accessories.  </li>
            <li> Cleanup has always been fairly easy and quick.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and even my very first eyebrow waxing was a succes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Love my waxing kit, works well and warms up fast!</li>
            <li> because I prefer the original wax over the cream it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> you aren&#x27;t familiar</li>
            <li> Everything came in, and I&#x27;m so excited to use this.....</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail yesterday and my lady was excited to use it.  </li>
            <li> I love it and thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Working in small areas works best.</li>
            <li> but I recommend buying more of the strips and applicators if you know you&#x27;re going to be doing a lot at first.</li>
            <li> My first experience waving with Gigi, was interesting.</li>
            <li> I love this product, you have to know how use it, but Its not complicated, juts follow the instructions</li>
            <li> Definately worth it!</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I am excited about it</li>
            <li> everything else on it is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Just scrape the wax off when they&#x27;re real hot.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the GiGi Mini Pro Waxing Kit.</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased with this product and so excited that I have it!</li>
            <li> : I make sure to use the pre-wax cleaner first, (so the skin is clean of any oils and bacteria)</li>
            <li> works great and will save me money in the long run!</li>
            <li> The Clean Colars are a must if wax gets into the switch it will ruin the machine.</li>
            <li> Would have liked it better if it had been shipped properly to me and not leaked everywhere in the box.  </li>
            <li> clean area using rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> /&gt;10) clean area again with rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> I would also recommend picking up some wax residue remover for the skin and pre clean to clean the skin off along with the oil that keeps the wax from sticking to the skin.</li>
            <li> Went and bought a different kind of wax, and is much better now.</li>
            <li> It makes clean up</li>
            <li> The kit comes with many things that you may or may not find useful, but are completely worth the price of this kit.</li>
            <li> But if set on a single unit, this is a GREAT kit to invest in.</li>
            <li> The wax tends to be more stringy when you try to get a large area at once.</li>
            <li> right!</li>
            <li> The hair came right off!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first few times we ever got waxed we&#x27;d take painkillers (ibuprofen worked best for us)</li>
            <li> Wow this was amazing will shop again thank you</li>
            <li> So glad to finally get a great home product with professional results!&lt;br</li>
            <li> good starter kit...buy a different wax though..</li>
            <li> Good overall.</li>
            <li> recommend it to everyone who know how to wax haha. :)</li>
            <li> I still have a ways to go before I am a full on pro at this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel good having to rewax the same spot to remove hair</li>
            <li> and you want to be able to take it off if you make a mistake without ripping off your whole eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Now im ready for waxed :-)</li>
            <li> Although idk how to use it fully yet, just for the face aspect I really like it:)</li>
            <li> WAX SUCKS DOESNT PULL OFF A HAIR, BEST BET IS TO GUY WAX FROM SALLYS BEAUTY SUPPLY</li>
            <li> I have never been good at this, so only did my mustache, maybe bikini line.</li>
            <li> Overall good product, but wish I had known to order the accessory items in advance.</li>
            <li> facial wax smells good.. no fumes.</li>
            <li> Just be prepared, and you&#x27;ll love this as much as I do.before you pull.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Just be prepared, and you&#x27;ll love this as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Good luck trying to open the wax in order to heat it up without making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have to say many thanks</li>
            <li> The only good things about this is the heater and the sticks used to place the wax.</li>
            <li> I am sending this back, did not do a good job on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It is not painful.</li>
            <li> At this temperature, you will not have to blow on the stick to cool it before placing it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The wax didn&#x27;t burn my face and it really does work for more than six weeks.</li>
            <li> The warmer itself is very straight forward and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The strips are nice because they can easily be ripped to different sizes.</li>
            <li> But once you read through the directions, its pretty easy to remember.  </li>
            <li> though is that it was pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works pretty good on fine facial hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, comes with SO much stuff!</li>
            <li> However, it washed off pretty easily, so over all I give it 4 stars</li>
            <li> The product is very effective but sticky - you need to be careful not to get them on your fingers.  </li>
            <li> In general it is ok!</li>
            <li> Works great but amber dome came in pieces probably due to packaging.</li>
            <li> Other than the packaging, this is a great beginners&#x27; kit.</li>
            <li> Other then that It&#x27;s a great set.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that they did give sample bottles of the other waxing products.</li>
            <li> It s super convenient.</li>
            <li> Had a mild plastic smell for a moment, but went away quickly.</li>
            <li> It warms quickly.</li>
            <li> Might want to purchase more of the waxing sticks and fiber strips because they don&#x27;t have many if you using your waxer daily</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super sticky, it doesn&#x27;t stick well with the clothes they provide, and it just seeps through the cloth.</li>
            <li> but it went away quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the cream wax much better than the regular honey wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using GiGi waxes for years, and the pink wax this comes with is the best for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The price is an extra bonus and I am very happy I finally ordered it!</li>
            <li> I always seem to need a quick waxing two hours before we go somewhere.  </li>
            <li> I like that it came with many strips and wooden spatula things of many sizes.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> melts the wax quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love it... very professional and clean</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and bought this product with not a little trepidation because even the most positive reviews stated that doing a bikini wax on yourself was challenging.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This wax gets VERY HOT</li>
            <li> Thank u very much!</li>
            <li> wait for wax to cool and then store, clean of spatula with hot water, rub baby oil on hands to remove wax</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and really takes care of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I mean why not put your best most reliable wax in this mini professional kit</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it and it is very easy and simple to use.</li>
            <li> Love my new GiGi Mini Waxing Kit , I used it on my eye brows and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;s live without this set - the wax is better than what I had been using (the honey one)</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I expected and is a great product.</li>
            <li> I also bought a brazilian wax and an all-purpose honee, but I actually really like the creme wax that came with the kit, and it is really easy to work with (in my opinion).</li>
            <li> Very sticky, did not come off face easy.  </li>
            <li> It was a lot to take in at first!</li>
            <li> If you follow what the CD says exactly!</li>
            <li> it got it and wax my brows haha!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I am to picky for this kind of mess.  :-)</li>
            <li> I received my kit today and as most people do with new items, I opened it right away and prepared to use it.</li>
            <li> Use a little wax at a time, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Gets really messy but it works great.  </li>
            <li> I did both sides of my lip no prob, applied the soothing lotion on, and 20 minutes later it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Not enough fabric comes with the kit, it ran out too soon, but the wax and product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I got on YouTube and watched a few videos on &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; and I do a great job each time.</li>
            <li> The hair on my chin wasn&#x27;t quite long enough for it, but it did my eyebrows beautifully, after I figured out that cooling time is really important for this wax.</li>
            <li> Over all, the kit is worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit for my own personal use not for a business.  </li>
            <li> It is probably a lot of product for my own personal use, but I figured it will pay for itself in about 6-7 uses.  </li>
            <li> , i have always used wax my entire life, and i have never faced this kind of problem.</li>
            <li> I had every intention to put this to use and get my money worth out of it.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a lot of useful stuff</li>
            <li> Nice personal unit; takes practice to do correctly</li>
            <li> This stuff was really runny and didn&#x27;t do as good a job as regular wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth $100 anyways, In my opinion.</li>
            <li> Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li> (optional, but I found it useful)</li>
            <li> Lol the only thing I have to say is I chose sensitive wax</li>
            <li> Worth every Pennie.</li>
            <li> yeah at the end of the day it is worth it.</li>
            <li> or this thing isn&#x27;t worth the buy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky, messy and \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; is not the greatest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already done $100 worth of waxing with this kit (eyebrows, lip, bikini, legs, armpits).</li>
            <li> The variety of edge applicators are so useful.</li>
            <li> I go to a salon for bikini waxing but after waxing my legs I am going to try my own bikini area next.</li>
            <li> Definitley worth trying.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s the case, go have a professional do it and make sure you are up it.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t beat Avon&#x27;s skin-so-soft(hey, it works on labels)a little on a cotton ball and every bit of wax comes right off, and it smells better than mineral oil!!</li>
            <li> Cheap cheap wax that doesn&#x27;t harden enough to pull the hair out evenly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> My set arrived pretty quickly and i had a chance to try it this weekend.</li>
            <li> it heats up pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li> The lotions they gave for after wax wasn&#x27;t able to clean up what&#x27;s left on my legs</li>
            <li> Other then that I find everything to be good.</li>
            <li> Other than this problem, the product was in good working order.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe I&#x27;m not doing something right</li>
            <li> right before you throw it in the frying pan.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Wax seeps right through.</li>
            <li> I even thought about retuning it right away.</li>
            <li> I bought some paper ones right away.</li>
            <li> It might be I didn&#x27;t do the right thing for underarm hair removal.</li>
            <li> Do it right, no pain...</li>
            <li> Thw price was right</li>
            <li> And i totally recommend using oil to clean up as its super easy.</li>
            <li> I followed the simple heating instructions, used the prep lotion first, and applied the warm wax to one side of my lip.</li>
            <li> this is a great starter kit for a professional or home use, just be sure you know how to properly wax if you aren&#x27;t a professional you can really hurt yourself.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to use this for anything but facial hair removal or very easy to pull hair...</li>
            <li> Excellent kit, like most of you I have been waxing myself for years but had gotten tired of the cheap wax that they sell in walmart or other stores</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a great way to save money on your monthly waxes, this is definitely the route to go--just watch a few YouTube videos before removing the hair :)</li>
            <li> Nice kit takes long to heat up though.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to warm up.</li>
            <li> Heat up time is kind of long - but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to start using my new waxing kit!</li>
            <li> Mine came in good condition except the plastic lid was cracked because it was placed upside down in the box.</li>
            <li> I love it - just need a little more practice.</li>
            <li> The new cream wax is FABULOUS.</li>
            <li> Cost me 44 bucks with free 2 day shipping i used my new amazon prime student membership.</li>
            <li> It works just as I had hoped; the directions were clear and it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> All in all its a great bundle for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Good and professional machine works as same as salon waxing.</li>
            <li> The indicator light really helps to let you know when the wax is ready to be used.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s a few more tips for ya to save money :)</li>
            <li> The cream wax is not very good but the rest of the package is great.</li>
            <li> but mostly we were going on what we learned from the nice lady who usually does it for us in addition to the very helpful advice in the reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it very much yet, so</li>
            <li> I very much like the warmer, but the wax is just rotten.</li>
            <li> Creme wax is made for sensitive skin and baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> The wax is PERFECT, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Come to find out, after cleaning the old one, it works perfectly fine which I gifted to my younger sister, SCORE!</li>
            <li> I love my new Gigi Mini Professional waxing kit!  </li>
            <li> I found that more hair came off if I only did about a 2 in by 2 in area of my face at a time.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I&#x27;ve seen used in the salon.  </li>
            <li> (if you know how to use hot wax).</li>
            <li> I waited 30 minutes to heat the wax didn&#x27;t get hot at all</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t hot</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
            <li> First off, this kit gives you creme wax with muslin strips......</li>
            <li> it was much higher just for the warmer.</li>
            <li> And I couldn&#x27;t figure out exactly where to put the resting bars.</li>
            <li> Now had I read these reviews first</li>
            <li> The kit was pretty neat.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it should come with more strips and the wax off lotion.</li>
            <li> was my first waxing pot..</li>
            <li> The wax was the perfect temp and not that difficult to use at all.</li>
            <li> This worked ok, except my skin felt gross after wards.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t too hot on my skin.</li>
            <li> I first tested it on my arm.</li>
            <li> I was a first timer</li>
            <li> vegetable oil most definitely did</li>
            <li> This product is exactly how it sems.</li>
            <li> It does get hot</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really well worth it</li>
            <li> I bought this kit primarily so that I could stop spending so much on professional Brazilian waxing.  </li>
            <li> It comes with applicator sticks, warmer collars and the cloth strips but not as many as the individual packets have.</li>
            <li> but it is a bit tricky at first.</li>
            <li> but that is because I wasn&#x27;t all the uniform with my technique since this is my first time</li>
            <li> I would recommend having more muslin on hand because what comes in the kit isn&#x27;t enough if you are doing legs, arms, bikini etc... in one sitting.</li>
            <li> It does exactly as it claim to do.</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive at first--</li>
            <li> , IT DOES NOT GET TOO HOT.</li>
            <li> I love the waxing effects (softness, no stubble, no daily shaving . . . .</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> that guides you through first timers waxing.</li>
            <li> Thanks for that tip when i purchased it!</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve been waxing myself with NADS</li>
            <li> And, let me add, this was my first bikini wax since well</li>
            <li> The wax pulls off the skin EXACTLY as described in the tutorial DVD.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package the top of the machine was cracked in 3 different places..</li>
            <li> More for salon use instead of personal use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to turn it on to melt the wax, since I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would start a fire or short</li>
            <li> The wax does not work well if it gets too hot and to liquid</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> that I would have to go with him to the nail shop more often so he could get them done in private room.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use, but the heating machine works well!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the different bottles of pre/post-wax stuff, but I do love the cooling gel and</li>
            <li> i was a first time user...</li>
            <li> This kit comes with a lot but first timers shouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> but she definitely needs more practice.</li>
            <li> So much came with it!</li>
            <li> the wax was not too hot at all.</li>
            <li> it just startled me at first.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never done it maybe get a friend to help at first or ask them at the salon to show you how to wax and then just mimic that.</li>
            <li> when i ran out of the wooden sticks &amp; muslin strips i just went to Sally&#x27;s and bought more.</li>
            <li> has been exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> , this does exactly what it says it does...</li>
            <li> First of all, WAX IS STICKY!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was told that cortisone cream may help after the first time of waxing as it can help reduce the redness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was told that cortisone cream may help after the first time of waxing as it can help reduce the redness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wash my face first.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what exactly came in the kit, because the description only lists:</li>
            <li> , the wax wasnt even hot to start.</li>
            <li> This wax spreads pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this has been my first try with waxing at home</li>
            <li> This kit was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Works well for my back, but works even better for my butt (any area with crevices and valleys)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I use it mostly for my eyebrows and upper lip.  </li>
            <li> The wax worked for me the first time but didn&#x27;t work well after that.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> After years I still have most of the wax left</li>
            <li> /&gt;Facial waxing is not difficult.  </li>
            <li> First off the Post Wax purple concealer had exploded in the box when I opened it so all of the bottles were covered with purple concealer.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a sensitivity to temperatures and my skin doesn&#x27;t scream if it&#x27;s a tad too hot</li>
            <li> It came with a nice booklet on the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; wax the areas of the body but not much instructions on the warmer itself.  </li>
            <li> turn it on a little over an hour before you want to use it, and you have warm wax to get off your mustache or chin hairs quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a good starter kit - I appreciated the tips in previous reviews about needing  baby powder and wax off.  </li>
            <li> Great for small jobs!</li>
            <li> I love it, the hair comes off clean and smooth, just dont apply wax thickly.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if they had included mineral oil, instead of the other bottles.  </li>
            <li> The was last a long time for many, many uses.</li>
            <li> They stand up easily but also fall down easily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much use for any of the other little bottles of stuff that came with the kit (except the sure clean, which I used most of in my first clean up!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product and good deal if you get the kit, especially if you&#x27;re doing simple waxing (like for eyebrows and upper lip)or if you are just beginning.</li>
            <li> the less on the stick the better!</li>
            <li> This kit is exactly what i wanted, very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Maybe if your pain tolerance is higher, then waxing will not bother you so much.</li>
            <li> Kit comes with pretty much everything you need.  </li>
            <li> (BTW- you can use pretty much any oil-</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I am admittedly a complete novice at waxing</li>
            <li> It comes in handy when necessary although it&#x27;s not very user friendly.</li>
            <li> Very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy enough to use, and the results, where I put the wax, worked.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and actually painless.</li>
            <li> The item itself (the first time i ordered it) came in broken, they don&#x27;t do a great job of wrapping it to protect it from damage during shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy, simple, and cost efficient.</li>
            <li> Product overall is easy to use and will save you plenty of salon visits, saving you money,</li>
            <li> I find that this wax isn&#x27;t as strong as the regular wax</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a sticky substance that gets everywhere and doesn&#x27;t even have the waxing effect of being strong enough to even pull peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Try not to spill any on the outter casing though, it&#x27;s a major pain to clean up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to have a warmer with a single temperature setting.</li>
            <li> but does not provide instruction as to what certain parts (rest bars) are used for.</li>
            <li> After I finished, I have a large collection of cloth strips with wax on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, however, following the instruction can be very complicate it.</li>
            <li> have not had the problem that others have had with the included strips leaving fuzz (not sure if they meant fuzz from the muslin or fuzz as in fine baby hairs) and found them to be very useful with just the right amount of grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I waxed my first leg I left a few hairs but the second leg is beautiful!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair on my cheeks and above my lip that I am trying to rid myself of.</li>
            <li> The Creme Wax that is included worked fine for me as I was only waxing my eyebrows and lip..</li>
            <li> The machine seems fine, but the wax it comes with never actually works.</li>
            <li> Pull toward the middle of the lip (opposite direction of wax application) Make sure to pull quickly and you can hold the edge of your skin before you pull.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> It works pretty decent.</li>
            <li> So this little item comes in handy.</li>
            <li> This may sound obvious, but make certain you store it upright without any tilt at all.  </li>
            <li> I had another wax kit with the hard wax and loved it.  </li>
            <li> The wax only does a &amp;#34;so, so&amp;#34; job as it is exceptionally sticky and not really hard enough to do the job well.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to not have to warm this up in the microwave every few minutes.</li>
            <li> Now I need to check if that&#x27;s real in a week.</li>
            <li> My wax was ready in about 20 mins.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this warmer.</li>
            <li> but it was very suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It comes with an instructional book which was very helpful to have.</li>
            <li> very disappointed​</li>
            <li> but I much prefer the creme.  </li>
            <li> The creme wax is VERY sticky, so sticky that it glued the container shut.</li>
            <li> I was using the Sally Hanson microwave wax and it works much much</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use all the products included then is it really a deal?</li>
            <li> but, did remove hair very well</li>
            <li> INCREDIBLY FAST SHIPPING.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really order stuff online kux ion trust</li>
            <li> I decided after much research and review reading to try out the GiGi mini pro waxing kit.</li>
            <li> The warmer heated fast (about 30 minutes)</li>
            <li> It still worked really well though.</li>
            <li> It was more than I expected loveeeee it</li>
            <li> Very convient.</li>
            <li> I was looking for real wax, not this chemical junk</li>
            <li> I had to throw so much out.</li>
            <li> The handbook is very instructional and explanatory.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Also it is important to remove the hair in the direction it grows which can be tricky because they don&#x27;t all grow in the same direction (on the face).</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot, Gigi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it are really needed--just the pre-waxing one and the cooling gel.</li>
            <li> i was very dissapointed with the quality of the product</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been paying at a salon for about 6 months now but at $200 a visit (we both get waxed and try to give a generous tip) and it adds up fast.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll repeat a tip that I&#x27;ve read several times because I think it&#x27;s important.  </li>
            <li> But the whole package is a steal.</li>
            <li> instruction manual that is included is very informational and even provides examples as to how to wax (i.e. eyebrows, lip, chin,</li>
            <li> It came fast.</li>
            <li> I really wanted beach ready legs this summer</li>
            <li> i spend the whole night</li>
            <li> THE WAX WARMER IS VERY COMPACT, SO IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE UP MUCH SPACE</li>
            <li> it took the wax off, and several rub downs with olive oil, and then a shower to be completely free of residue.  </li>
            <li> This wax is very \\&quot;gentle\\</li>
            <li> It heats up in just 15 minutes and does the job very well.</li>
            <li> Really sticky</li>
            <li> The wax here is like a cream, it gets really liquid</li>
            <li> For the amount that I used on my cheeks, I won&#x27;t need to buy any more wax for quite some time, and the pain was minimal.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really rate the product as this was a gift.  </li>
            <li> This works really well on my hair</li>
            <li> I works, I really like the results.  </li>
            <li> his grow so much faster than mine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to STOP waxing for now, until I find something that really works in taking the excess off of my skin.</li>
            <li> I will save so much money with this.</li>
            <li> The wax goes straight through them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sticky and gets everywhere if you don&#x27;t peel correctly.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much easier to use.</li>
            <li> After trying several drugstore types of waxing kits available and experiencing never-ending frustration we decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> always, shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> Has everything it shows and works very well.</li>
            <li> my daughter really likes this</li>
            <li> it comes with written instructions (which I admit I didn&#x27;t really read) and an instructional (kinda) dvd.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like shelling out $12 just to get my eyebrows waxed.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell of the cream wax, but it came with it so might as well use it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Product reviews were really helpful.</li>
            <li> I needed it really didn&#x27;t hurt that much.</li>
            <li> I now have a whole nail kit, and now a wax kit</li>
            <li> For a home kit, it works better than expected.  </li>
            <li> So much cheaper than going to a salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li> It was scattered all over inside the package and it is very sticky.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it..</li>
            <li> : I pre-cut my muslin strips ahead of time and have them ready to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really sticky)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really sticky)</li>
            <li> so she wouldn&#x27;t have to spend so much money at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like this kit.</li>
            <li> Like most girls/women I&#x27;ve spent money lots of money on waxing, hair remover, eyebrow perfecting tools  </li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to wax themselves rather than spending 1/2 a fortune on a salon wax.</li>
            <li> and I was really nervous to try this for the first&lt;br /&gt;time ever.  </li>
            <li> Watch a couple of the demos and you&#x27;ll be ready.</li>
            <li> I am very dissappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care for the creme wax.</li>
            <li> I really like this kit</li>
            <li> It is better than the pink one.</li>
            <li> I tried Nads when I was a teenager, and that was much easier and cleaner to use than this waxing</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried this product, because I was curious to see if it would work for me.</li>
            <li> I really enoy My GiGi Mini Pro Waxing Kit.</li>
            <li> The wax warmer heats up fast and the kit comes with everything needed.</li>
            <li> and we could not get it to remove hair no matter much we tried.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to find out that the creme wax that was included in the kit is made especially for sensitive skin (which I have).</li>
            <li> The only thing I can&#x27;t do is my own back</li>
            <li> but the supplied soft wax is more than enough.</li>
            <li> It is sure to pick up all of the hair if you&#x27;re using it for upper lip wax, legs, eyebrows (seek professional help in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Always handy, just plug it, wait for a few minutes and use.</li>
            <li> Very economical since the price of the kit would cost the same as one trip to the waxing salon.</li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t take too long to heat up and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love the creme wax that comes with this kit, and bought other types but didn&#x27;t like them as much.</li>
            <li> Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li> I had several towels ready for clean up.</li>
            <li> i love when  put on the wax it doesnt burn me like other wax.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning: I moved and placed the kit into its original box inside a larger box and put it in the uhaul.</li>
            <li> Now, for the skin, and areas other than the waxing spot....not quite sure.</li>
            <li> Other than that seems to be ok</li>
            <li> The creme wax isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the Dark Honee for coarse hair wax.  </li>
            <li> warmer is good but wax cream is not good</li>
            <li> They go pretty far.</li>
            <li> My last kit came with a how-to booklet full of waxing tips.  </li>
            <li> think anyone who has not waxed before, should try a professional first to get an idea of how to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, I understand waxing is supposed to be messy, but I knocked off two points mainly because this &#x27;all purpose kit&#x27; did not come with the second most important ingredient...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping I can cut that down with more practice.</li>
            <li> More items with it than expected!!</li>
            <li> I would just recommend buying a different wax if you have more sensitive skin and also making sure you have oil to apply on the skin right after it&#x27;s been waxed to prevent little red bumps or ingrown hairs from occurring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only about half way through the wax that came with it - so it lasts an incredible long time.  </li>
            <li> It works just like the salon and with a little more practice it will be so much easier.</li>
            <li> Which more or less has the consistency of melted play-do.</li>
            <li> I would prefer less bottled product and more applicators in the set.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more gental on the skin less bumps and breakouts</li>
            <li> The cloth sucks but great starting kit</li>
            <li> I needed to do my eyebrows mainly.</li>
            <li> think the main problem is the wax itself....</li>
            <li> I have been to multiple places, tried numerous waxes, and have been botched so many times</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes me about 2 hours to do a decent job on my legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great kit, my only complaint would be that they should include wax remover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s main ingredient is Mineral Oil, so</li>
            <li> The lid for this product is kind of fragile, so be careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li> I had an hour of free time and decided to use this to wax pretty much my entire face- side burns, upper lip, eye brows.</li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin when it comes to waxing and the wax that came with the kit was just what I needed!</li>
            <li> The kit comes with soft wax for sensitive skin, so maybe that wax wasn&#x27;t right for what I was doing.</li>
            <li> and maybe I just heated it to high</li>
            <li> put Honee wax in warmer, plug in and set to high as instructed and set a timer for 12 min (instructions recommend 10-15)&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend this brand and product.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly, I highly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> This will save me tons of time and money, highly recommend</li>
            <li> so I try to keep the heat of the wax as high as I can handle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is small and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> apply a little more baby oilto moisturize</li>
            <li> but I wish it worked a little better.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this kit is relatively easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The wax does not remove easy from skin and basically has to wear itself off your skin due to the fact that its gooey and removes nothing.</li>
            <li> Would be nice to see this bundled with hard wax as well</li>
            <li> , it was hard to find more of the exact brand.  </li>
            <li> But included wax is not much messy it very sticky, I have to use oil to remove it.</li>
            <li> and you have these huge pink globs all over your body and fingers, and no amount of soap</li>
            <li> I ended throwing the whole thing out and getting  professional laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> I used the cleanser that came with the kit, then applied the baby powder,applied the wax to my skin,applied the strip the  results were perfect but it wax painful as ish.</li>
            <li> Go to the GIGI website under Waxing Videos and watch the DVD online its an old 1970&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s video but its still very informative.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try the soft wax and didn&#x27;t like it as much.  </li>
            <li> the top part was cracked and the wax was really messy</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t remove much hair the first pass so in spite of the warning not to apply twice in the same area you have to if you want the hair gone.</li>
            <li> I will try it a few more times; it appears to be too sticky.</li>
            <li> Is this normal?</li>
            <li> apply muslin strip and rub firmly to make sure it sticks well</li>
            <li> I do love some of the creams that came with it, I would not have purchased them separately, but now I will buy a few of them.</li>
            <li> Although I have not seen it, she is very pleased and feels she has enough of the product to last a long time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure my hair was long enough.</li>
            <li> sure to not spill the wax or you will have trouble cleaning it off of surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> sure to not spill the wax or you will have trouble cleaning it off of surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No matter what wax you use, the lotions and gels are useful, as well as the wooden sticks to spread the wax with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and they just said that it was &#x27;normal&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It took 5 days for my skin get to almost normal.</li>
            <li> I have used this system quite a few times and love it.  </li>
            <li> It is generally a very sticky, stringy wax and if you don&#x27;t hold your skin tight and pull fast when removing the strips, it wont pull off clean, but might leave residue and won&#x27;t remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait ti get other wax to fine tune the process.</li>
            <li> Works well and has enough supplies to begin waxing right away.</li>
            <li> I know after waxing a few times, you can get the hair to not grow back at all, so I am going to grin and bare the pain and try to do this a few more times to see if I can get rid of the hair for good.</li>
            <li> This wax is not only a sticky mess that requires a special cleaner (had to use 420 cleaner and grundge off to clean up).</li>
            <li> live in a dorm</li>
            <li> I live in what seems like no mans land.</li>
            <li> Will purchase a new unit, but not a Gigi.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this kit.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m new at this, but I can&#x27;t seem to pull off all of the hair either.</li>
            <li> I will buy a new one soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing (doing it myself that is), but I couldn&#x27;t pass up the price on this kit.  </li>
            <li> Well I decided it was still easier on me and my skin to buy a new unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this type of wax</li>
            <li> this helps some of you who are new to waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> this helps some of you who are new to waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> I can see how this product could be intimidating if you are new to the waxing world.</li>
            <li> I made sure to put the lid on the container of wax on very tightly so nothing would spill.</li>
            <li> For a clean, smooth finish, apply a thin layer for waxing(the strip holds more firmly).</li>
            <li> I used a sheet of paper to put the used wax strips on for easier clean up but there was absolutely no mess.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Luv this tiny machine, it heats up super fast and the can of wax is going to last me</li>
            <li> DO NOT wax for your face with this kind of wax, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the wax type or waxing your face in general--</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was not sure if this wax would be suitable for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Shipped earlier than expected :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be wrong to write the whole kit out - the wax warmer is good.</li>
            <li> The warmer is great and the accessories package is nice but the wax is horrible!  </li>
            <li> when i ran out of collars i just traced the old one on a thick piece of paper and cut my own.</li>
            <li> I love my little GiGi pot!</li>
            <li> Other than that, this set is very worth it.</li>
            <li> never waxed before, instructions were very clear.</li>
            <li> Everything was very clear on how to use it too.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised by the number of complaints about this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very professional and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> As far as actually waxing - it takes a lot of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> I would steer clear!</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I have not had any issues with this product (hooooray!)</li>
            <li> Definitely need to be aware of dripping wax, but the kit comes with gaurds for the warmer.  </li>
            <li> That is a pretty big deal when you&#x27;re finished</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the wax doesn&#x27;t stay hot enough</li>
            <li> Even my 16 year old knows how to  use it!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> My loyalty as a frequent Amazon customer just may come to end!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why so many people complain about removing the wax.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I ripped an entire layer of skin off my cheek when first using this.  </li>
            <li> This is the exact same kit my hairdresser has to do her waxes with.</li>
            <li> This same kit is sold from other retailers  for much much more.  </li>
            <li> My only concern is that my girlfriend might like it too much!</li>
            <li> This is the EXACT same thing they have at the nail salons for eyebrow waxing, and they got it for $40?!</li>
            <li> I used to go pretty regularly to get waxed.  </li>
            <li> NEVER HAVE TO PAY A PROFESSIONAL FOR WAXING AGAIN!</li>
            <li> After years of paying to have my eyebrows waxed, I now can get the exact same results at home.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;often enough to have consistently groomed brows.  </li>
            <li> This product was returned by the buyer because it did not get hot enough for the wax that it came with!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and relatively little pain.</li>
            <li> This thing takes 40 minutes to get ready to use (20 mins on high, 20 mins on low).  </li>
            <li> MAKE SURE you let the wax cool long enough, and don&#x27;t get impatient like I did, before you pull the strip.</li>
            <li> The wax is very sticky and it&#x27;s easy have a big mess</li>
            <li> Waxing is less &amp;#34;painful,&amp;#34; but waxing was messy, more time consuming (start to finish with clean up), less effective (I have patches of hair), and takes up less space.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it was a hot mess.</li>
            <li> : Before I even turn the unit on, I put a piece of paper under the heater that is large enough to cover any drips that may happen.</li>
            <li> I might give this to someone just starting out because it&#x27;s a cute little kit</li>
            <li> I will consider buying one of the hard waxes to see if that works better for me.</li>
            <li> ..Had to purchase the hard wax and love that one.</li>
            <li> If you are planning to buy and use this product, make sure to buy the hard wax on the side...</li>
            <li> If you decide to purchase this kit, just make sure that you purchase the Honey hard wax.</li>
            <li> you are planning on doing sensitive areas, be sure to buy the hard Brazilian wax from GiGi.</li>
            <li> I bought the new on for a Christmas present and it got here in a decent amount of Time.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I am stuff with bright red waxing marks on my face for an hour, and I didn&#x27;t even wax any hair!!!</li>
            <li> Use clear honey colored wax preferably the brazillian one where you don&#x27;t need strips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more painful too doing something yourself but you will get used to it in no time :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more painful too doing something yourself but you will get used to it in no time :)</li>
            <li> It even arrived early.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This wax is supposed to be for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Im 40 years old and have done it all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cream wax is supposed to be for an all purpose use and for sensitive skin which is what I need.  </li>
            <li> You really get your money back after just a couple uses.</li>
            <li> The product does all it said it would, you do not need to be a professional to use it.</li>
            <li> professional.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and every time I leave a salon I usually have huge red bumps.</li>
            <li> It always hurts when I get it done professionally</li>
            <li> The gig was for sensitive.</li>
            <li> When I received this product the wax was old and not harden.</li>
            <li> Also, for those who complain that it didn&#x27;t remove any hair, apply wax in the direction of your hair growth, press the cloth strip over the wax and smooth firmly in the direction of your hair growth.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never been waxed before, go get it done by a professional.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s invaluable to know what you&#x27;re in for as far as pain goes as well as to watch technique.  </li>
            <li> Ask lots of questions about how to do it or why the professional is doing things the way</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s had no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as baby oil.</li>
            <li> Pulled the strip taut, and yanked as fast as I possibly could.</li>
            <li> I got the one for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So naturally I continued to wax everything else.</li>
            <li> The product came with a 14 oz wax and it is made for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; but let me tell you it works so well and does the job.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is that the wax is very runny ... unless you can learn to manipulate</li>
            <li> I use this Professional Kit at home, but remember I am a professional.  </li>
            <li> The pre-wax oil completely protects the skin, helps reduce discomfort during waxing, and leaves the skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It says it works on sensitive skin and my skin completely broke out.</li>
            <li> I get waxed often and salons and ihaveno allergies nor do I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It has paid for itself several times over in how much we have saved over the years.</li>
            <li> The liquids don&#x27;t really seem necessary, but saved me trying whole bottles and then finding them not necessary.</li>
            <li> I ripped off a tad bit of skin because I&#x27;ve NEVER been to a professional waxer and had no idea what I was doing.</li>
            <li> like a complete set...</li>
            <li> Also, for those who don&#x27;t like using soft wax, don&#x27;t get this kit since it comes with it.</li>
            <li> Wax was so soft it dripped on the counter.</li>
            <li> They should have told me that they cannot respect their customers and I could have taken the product from another part and not waste two months from my time.</li>
            <li> I am used to using the Deplieve wax but wanted to give this a try after reading the reviews &amp; that it was for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to waxing the bikini line or sensitive areas since I just shave</li>
            <li> I appreciate the wax that was included (sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> i let it heat up for at least an hour or more.</li>
            <li> I went soft wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ready about 45-60 minutes after starting it up.  </li>
            <li> I wonder how this kit compares to a professional salon kit?  </li>
            <li> , I was very please with all the extra items in the box.</li>
            <li> it takes a long time to get the wax hot.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked</li>
            <li> Never had it done professionally, but I feel like a pro it went so well.</li>
            <li> The kit comes complete with everything except wax remover</li>
            <li> Professional results</li>
            <li> (Thanks a million to the reviewer who said I could use regular cooking oil to remove wax).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The drive to get eyebrows waxed just isn&#x27;t worth the gas spent.</li>
            <li> I bought the wax machine a few months ago, and still have a ton of waxing strips left :)</li>
            <li> Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sticky crap all over everything is a non-issue this way.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> At least her first attempt was on her arm and not one her eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li> but the wax it comes with is fantastic for regular waxing, there is a video on YouTube for other waxing and instructions on which wax to buy.</li>
            <li> Product is great, however the lid was broken, I didn&#x27;t return it due to the lid, I just taped it together</li>
            <li> Overall, the kit does what it is designed to do and is easy to use if you can deal with the mess.</li>
            <li> I mention this only because I don&#x27;t think that particular product comes as part of the kit.</li>
            <li> The instructions suggest heating the wax on high for 25 min then moving the temp to low.</li>
            <li> heat 15-25 minutes on high then drop to low.)</li>
            <li> The wax not only removes hair but exfoliates as well, leaving you with sensitive new</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be a little more satisfied and it came with a bunch of useless creams gels and so on.  </li>
            <li> tear away quickly in direction away from the direction the hairs are growing in holding the skin tight to avoid / minimize bruising and irritation</li>
            <li> but I tried twice to wax and it only made a huge sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy about my arms and bought this primarily to wax them in the privacy of my own home.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend buying extra muslin, since the kit only comes with a certain amount.</li>
            <li> apply a little scentless baby oil to the area so that the wax doesn&#x27;t irritate or stick to the skin too much - not too much or else</li>
            <li> Simple baby oil and a quick washing with your regular mild facial cleanser will take care of any residue that you were not able to blot off with the muslin strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I had a new one, but the item still works so I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for personal in home use and will last a super long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this product, I can hardly stop smiling about it!</li>
            <li> The wax takes a long time to be hot enough to work well.</li>
            <li> I give it four stars only because there are things you don&#x27;t need included, and things you really need left out of this kit.</li>
            <li> The top was cracked, the pink goop is messy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still visit the spa to visit our teacher and since I&#x27;m not sure if I want to trust my eyebrows to a first timer, but the bills for waxing will be much lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to wax for at least 3 mos prior b/c</li>
            <li> I had ordered them not knowing and would have much preferred to order extra muslin or sticks for the same money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The presentation is good and it really works...is not that painful.</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with some of the other reviews I read about this wax -- it is VERY sticky!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i feel most of the bottles they gave were pretty much useless because i only use the pre-wax cleanser which is some anti bacterial stuff u put on before waxing (just in case</li>
            <li> Once the wax heats up to a certain point, it becomes harder to avoid drips.</li>
            <li> okay, the wax doesn&#x27;t work on tough hair..</li>
            <li> The warmer, Gigi creme wax (more on that in a sec), drip collars, 100 small and 100 large muslin waxing strips, the small, med, and large application sticks, pre-hon, slow-grow, lotion, cooling gel, and concealer.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I will use all of the little bottles of product, bu the pre cleaner and post cooling gel are nice.</li>
            <li> Right now in the process of deciding between getting an additional double or a second single.</li>
            <li> It was a general kit for all types of waxing.</li>
            <li> Only used it 2 times so far....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised I still have eyebrows left.</li>
            <li> My skin comes out and the portions become complete red.</li>
            <li> and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I got the wax for sensitive skin, I should have gotten the regular.  </li>
            <li> You can barely get it off of your skin.</li>
            <li> But, it is simple (my 9 year old helps me).</li>
            <li> i had been taking time out of my busy schedule to get my brows &amp; upper lip waxed at a salon every two weeks for YEARS!!</li>
            <li> The instruction manual is for commercial hair removal, leading me to believe this could be used in a professional salon.  </li>
            <li> The glue was very sticky, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was getting hot enough.  </li>
            <li> but we apparently wanted &amp;#34;Hard Wax&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> But I had no such problems with this product and would recommend it for people with sensitive skin to give this a try and see if you like it.</li>
            <li> but I did not like the wax that it came with, once it melts its very watery and its pink.</li>
            <li> Oh well, back to tweezers and professional waxing.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give a better review is for the fact that my lid to go over the wax was broken completely when it arrived.</li>
            <li> MY TOP WAS BROKEN WHEN THEY SHIPPED IT TO ME</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another tip is that it&#x27;s okay to apply the wax sparingly / thin.  </li>
            <li> &quot; unfortunately does not pull out the hair as effectively.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use it because the lid was broken at arrival</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the box it arrived in was smushed which made giving it as a gift a little cringe worthy.</li>
            <li> I recommend rubbing your hands down in oil or wearing gloves, the wax is pretty sticky.  </li>
            <li> Kit comes with more or less all you need including a few collars.</li>
            <li> You need to read the instruction manual and follow directions, and it will be a little messy the first time around, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> the other hand, the delivery on this item was very faster than I expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wax is extremely sticky and I can&#x27;t get it off my face or hands without really scrubbing and using some lotion.  </li>
            <li> The wax is also hard to clean off your skin.</li>
            <li> I will instruct as much persons as I can to be very careful when buying from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow I can&#x27;t believe all the stuff you get in this kit for such a low price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used much of the extra stuff that comes with -</li>
            <li> I do agree that half of the bottles are useless and that it should have come with powder, and wax-off, but other than that, pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> There was a little stinging at first with the cooling gel</li>
            <li> Iove the waxing kit as a whole but the cream wax is not worth wasting your time with.</li>
            <li> Larger than it looks and definitely larger than I expected, up too much counter space.</li>
            <li> recently i started buying popsicle sticks at the dollar store &amp; cutting my own cotton strips out of an old pillow case.</li>
            <li> Update: used 5 times for whole body, used a half of wax and all stripes, but wax replacements are in bed bath and beyond or online</li>
            <li> The Pink Cr&amp;egrave;me Wax that it comes with can go from solid to messy real quick due to</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t forgotten that you were getting ready to wax by then, you can finally get down to business.  </li>
            <li> I also trimmed down the strip I was going to be using to wax my upper lip as it was really</li>
            <li> The wax was quite thick and it was very hot</li>
            <li> Everything (Wax, sticks, cloth, warmer, instructions, extra bottles of stuff you dont really need..) are all included and it still costs less than one salon session.</li>
            <li> Comes with a fine oil (thin) to put on before waxing.</li>
            <li> rest of the kit is a little too much.</li>
            <li> I bought the large roll to do my legs, but there is enough in the kit to do your eyebrows a few</li>
            <li> set it on high for 25 minutes then down to</li>
            <li> but I have to leave it on high to be affective, even though it says you can turn it down to low after it heats up.</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t remove any hair, the warmer is good but could have gotten that separate if I had just read some of the bad reviews</li>
            <li> There is gel to use before using the wax, cooling gel afterwards and several other gels which are useful depending on whether you go with hard or soft wax.  </li>
            <li> I learned that you need to take only a small tiny tiny amount of wax on your spatula and it becomes mess free.</li>
            <li> The directions are decent, but I still haven&#x27;t figured out what the little metal bar things are for.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I had to clean off the soft wax everywhere in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Luckily it didn&#x27;t ruin the unit, bit did waste half of the wax.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend using this for armpit hair or other sensitive areas of the body.</li>
            <li> The product description is not right and it does not say anywhere on product if it is for complete body or only for bikini areas.</li>
            <li> in mind that this is a hard wax product and what little residue remains does not come off easily without using the GIGI oil remover.</li>
            <li> the negative side, which is a minor point, but one that I think is worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li> The sticky residue it leaves behind, it&#x27;s nothing a dash of baby oil can&#x27;t clean up.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that the wax needs to be on for a long time for it to melt properly</li>
            <li> 1 Wax warmer, 10 petite applicators, 1 large accu-edge applicators, 10 small accu-edge applicators, but the kit</li>
            <li> The hair has to be a little longer than normal for this to work well.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t cut up the muslin strips, which is highly recommended so there isn&#x27;t a lot of waste.</li>
            <li> low.&lt;br /&gt;The cream wax is hard to manipulate at first</li>
            <li> When I used this kit at first time, I guess I applied \\&quot;hard wax amount\\&quot; to skin, and of course nothing came off after I swiped with muslin cloth.</li>
            <li> This set came with enough supplies to last me for a very long time even if I waxed once a month.</li>
            <li> The kit came with everything it claimed but the wax is super thick pepto pink</li>
            <li> The cream wax did not grip a single hair my hair is very coarse from shaving ever since i was a teen.</li>
            <li> The was makes a big mess and is really hard to clean off of your skin.</li>
            <li> B0000VLETU Ateco Small Sized Straight Spatula 4 1/2\\</li>
            <li> Only issue is that it take too long to heat up.  </li>
            <li> Oh btw, I used Nads back in the day for a long time the wax and the strips</li>
            <li> It last a long time.</li>
            <li> anyway long story short.</li>
            <li> This will definitely save me money in the long run.  </li>
            <li> She loves it and the amount of wax that comes with it will last forever as long as you keep your treatments to every couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> The little bottles are unnecessary because non of them help to make it better.</li>
            <li> It became really sticky very messy to deal with also</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to using wax, i would suggest covering any surfaces the warmer lays on with something because it can get messy.</li>
            <li> LOVE this kit, and it&#x27;s not fair to fault the wax, when it&#x27;s usually the user that is having problems.</li>
            <li> LOVE this kit, and it&#x27;s not fair to fault the wax, when it&#x27;s usually the user that is having problems.</li>
            <li> I am contemplating returning the machine after several tries or maybe I will try different wax.</li>
            <li> The kit is complete with enough supplies for a few waxes.</li>
            <li> cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I am in love, I hate going to a salon to get waxed when I&#x27;m perfectly capable of doing it my self.</li>
            <li> We are guessing that the item was stored upside down in a hot truck for delivery and the wax melted and stuck firmly to the lid.</li>
            <li> my lid to my new wax warmer is fully cracked in HALF!</li>
            <li> As far as mess goes, its wax.</li>
            <li> You just have to be patient, get the wax to the right temperature, a thin layer, let it set for a moment, place the muslin over the wax and take a deep breath when you pull.  </li>
            <li> Same product at local beauty supply only half the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy at first</li>
            <li> Instead of using the wooden applicator sticks I used a small plastic spatula from my old George Foreman grill.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to set.  </li>
            <li> I have hirsutism and have spent years paying others to wax me or spending hours plucking every hair out of my face, and I finally decided I would save myself time AND money and buy myself a wax warmer.</li>
            <li> Seems like it takes the wax a really long time to melt.</li>
            <li> so i spent forever trying to get the left over wax off.</li>
            <li> The warmer doesn&#x27;t take long to heat.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;12) try not to sweat for the rest of the day (or as long as possible)&lt;br /&gt;13)</li>
            <li> I spent an HOUR trying to do one and finally gave up.  </li>
            <li> YES, beware of the wax and try not to get it on anything around the area, such as sinks, floors.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really get thin and clear as expected.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional</li>
            <li> I am not a professional in any way.</li>
            <li> I usually spent $16 every time I went for waxing so after the third use this has paid for itself.</li>
            <li> It takes a  long time to heat up as well.</li>
            <li> a long time, I wish it was truly a MINI pot like</li>
            <li> Messy, just go to the Salon and have a professional do it.</li>
            <li> Messy to work with and did not remove hair completely.  </li>
            <li> Its seriously like glue--impossible to get off and makes a huge mess!</li>
            <li> useless, the wax is very soft and does not pull out hair very well</li>
            <li> I get other small lotions in the kit, but I really don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> Since using this I now only remove hair every other week and my skin is healing from the shaving abuse.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Gigi Facial Honee along with this kit because of some of the other reviews concerning the creme wax.</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesnt come with &amp;#34;wax off&amp;#34; so I had to scrub my hands and table for way too long!</li>
            <li> And the he powder vs the other supplies such as after lotion I could do without!</li>
            <li> writing my personal opinion and experience with this kit and will not purchase GIGI anything like this again.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t give this other as the gift I was gonna give either.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re waxing armpits I would highly recommend you buy GIGI Brazilian Hard Wax instead</li>
            <li> The is good but not great, because you have to play with the temperature and you may get it wrong.</li>
            <li> And it pulled every single hair out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like the wax (soft) that was included in the order.  </li>
            <li> Why should I use really dark foundation lotion for a white skin, after I wax???</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve, and if you are not careful it can be messy but it is not the Mini Pro fault.</li>
            <li> This is my third unit, the other two, people moved and spilled hot wax on the unit it self and made them a serious mess.</li>
            <li> though the wax included is for sensitive skin, I experience itching and a slight discomfort around my eyebrows– but that goes away within a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally decided to cut down the wax cost and ordered this.</li>
            <li> I am able to get even the little hard to get chin hairs that most cold waxes leave behind.</li>
            <li> Soft wax is very messy.</li>
            <li> It was an easy fix with some crazy glue...</li>
            <li> My parents paid around a hundred bucks for it at the local Sally&#x27;s, and I got it for way less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Giving a product less stars because you didn&#x27;t read the product description properly or don&#x27;t understand how to use it makes no sense.</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to point out the lack of professionalism coming from Central Cosmetic and now, unfortunately from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wax doesn&#x27;t get as hot and thin as it should which makes it harder to use</li>
            <li> Wow what a mess!!  </li>
            <li> One downside is I&#x27;ve definitely made a mess with it</li>
            <li> It last forever and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a mess.</li>
            <li> The entire package was a mess.</li>
            <li> Next, I take rubbing alcohol and wipe over areas about to be waxed, then put a little bit of baby powder on.  </li>
            <li> I must say hard wax is my preference over soft</li>
            <li> that well you should probably go for the hard wax this brand offers.</li>
            <li> The wax warmer and all the supplies are great but the pink wax itself is horrible.</li>
            <li> This is kind of stupid</li>
            <li> It was a pink wax.</li>
            <li> The pink creme wax that comes with this kit is a dream, I used it under arms, bikini, face, legs.</li>
            <li> This product comes with a wide variety of items but, not with the items you need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s this grey-brown makeup type stuff, I just don&#x27;t see how it would work for anyone&#x27;s skin tone and is rather arbitrarily included.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not happy about this whole kit.</li>
            <li> but it only took a few of the hairs not all of them.</li>
            <li> It was like Icy Hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The third thing I disliked is that some of the products sent in the kit, I won&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but problem with the pink &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but i still have wax leftovers on my skin, i spent 4-5 hours removing the wax leftovers</li>
            <li> I think the only thing missing is wax remover.</li>
            <li> The pink wax it comes with does not remove hair well at all and is really rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> honestly, the only disappointment I had was the broken lid, everything else was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think which is pink--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen pink wax before</li>
            <li> It turned out to be 15 minutes before the wax was ready, and I think the manufacturer could give the consumer an approximate time...</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li> The kit came with the pink cream wax.</li>
            <li> Package arrived in correct size and in shorter time phrase than expected.</li>
            <li> The big things I noticed that were missing was there had been a dvd of info in the sally&#x27;s one that wasn&#x27;t in this box</li>
            <li> All the extras are also a plus but honestly not really neccesary.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser can be replaced with alchol and the post gel can be replaced with oil.(baby or any kitchen oil).  </li>
            <li> The microwavable wax is easier to use than the pink wax.</li>
            <li> because after 3 tries I have given up the idea of using&lt;br /&gt;it on my lip.  </li>
            <li> I had bitter experiences at the parlour that after waxing I would have bruises all over my skin</li>
            <li> a lot of broken hairs on my legs, and didn&#x27;t find it removed much at all in my armpits.</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands of dollars going to salons for eyebrow, bikini and leg waxing.  </li>
            <li> The wax that it comes with does not really wax too well</li>
            <li> This product is good, but I hated the pink wax that came with the kit.  </li>
            <li> The warmer is a little sticky from the wax and it is difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a smart thing to do.</li>
            <li> I used one of the creams that came with the kit (sorry, I forget which one I used, but it was what was recommended in the instruction manual), and the leftover wax came right off.  </li>
            <li> I pull the strip off and am left with a gunky mess on my face!  </li>
            <li> It turned out to be a big gooey sticky mess!</li>
            <li> I am curious to try other kinds of wax too.</li>
            <li> This created several bruises and raw skin.  </li>
            <li> It is very messy, very sticky and hard to take off even with oil.</li>
            <li> With three different types of wax, all of which I use at the same time (for different areas) it is a bit inconvenient to have to stop and wait for a second tin to melt.</li>
            <li> I spent 50 bucks on this!</li>
            <li> I wish they had included wax-off instead of the other lotions and gels</li>
            <li> I would suggest having baby oil and powder in hand to prep your skin for waxing and use the oil to remove any wax from skin and other areas.</li>
            <li> Honee wax separately after reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> but I think this was due to user error rather than the kit itself).</li>
            <li> Purchase the other that is recommended in what others bought.</li>
            <li> I followed the advice of the other posters and got the wax off for skin which works when followed by soap and water.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> other things we ended up using are rubbing alcohol and scentless baby oil both of which we already had at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can definitely attest to this since I&#x27;m lazy and wanted to see if it made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first based on the reviews</li>
            <li> I had to do tiny little sections just to get a little hair off.</li>
            <li> Rubbing alcohol works for getting it off other surfaces.</li>
            <li> The wax is extremely sticky.</li>
            <li> It may also be due to the warmer setting issue.</li>
            <li> As soon as I peel it off, I notice it took absolutely no hairs off!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;4.To reiterate other reviews</li>
            <li> other things</li>
            <li> The lid had to be discarded due to damage it received to remove it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how other women&#x27;s hair is.</li>
            <li> You will need to get other strips from like Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and i waxed all the other places....</li>
            <li> Also, the post wax concealer is pretty useless.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use any of the other lotions that came with this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Melted wax is extremely sticky, which is why it takes your hair off</li>
            <li> stir the wax, dip my stick in and use a small amount and wave it for just a second and apply the wax in the direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> I do the other side.</li>
            <li> I do the other side.</li>
            <li> Simple, small and manageable to use.</li>
            <li> Other than that..</li>
            <li> Had to purchase some unwoven strips that are due to arrive today.</li>
            <li> I followed the product instructions, and I also listened to some of the advice I read in other product reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i agree with the other reviewers there are 2 things messing which are powder and oil, i bought baby powder and baby oil</li>
            <li> - I was very careful.</li>
            <li> It was ok, messy, the waxing strips were bad cloth and flimsy.</li>
            <li> It took about 30 minutes for the wax to melt but after that it was easy to apply and it wasn&#x27;t as painful as I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up enough to make the wax thin enough to spread evenly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only way it would be messy is if you make it messy.</li>
            <li> For as many awful reviews as the creme wax is getting, I was pleasantly surprised by it.</li>
            <li> heater was good but the wax is horrible, it was the pink one that says creme wax.</li>
            <li> My other complaint was that it left a sticky residue all over my face and hands.</li>
            <li> Left half the hair and was very harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> When u wax with the sinsative wax theres left over wax that is extremely hard to get off.</li>
            <li> There is a substantial difference in the irritation and painful in grown hairs that occur without moisturizing and the smooth sailing that accompanies exfoliating and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Was not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that for all the prep solutions and extras that come in the kit</li>
            <li> This was not fun.</li>
            <li> I even can do it by myself, at least my legs, just buy extra fabric because seem</li>
            <li> Use the Dark Honee for thicker hair like underarm, legs or bikini.</li>
            <li> then this product is not worth even to put 50 bucks.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the packaging: when my kit arrived, the lid was smashed into about a million pieces and some of the lotions were leaking.</li>
            <li> The kit does not come with body/skin wax remover which is really annoying, so make sure you order some in addition to the kit.</li>
            <li> All of the waxes can be messy, if you are inexperienced, but you can always use oil to remove the wax from unwanted areas.</li>
            <li> i wanted to use the slow grower but decided not to, only because my hair hasn&#x27;t grown yet when i waxed it.</li>
            <li> The heat temperature of the wax was at low when I started to slow down on the wax</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the cover was cracked in half.  </li>
            <li> Put some newspaper down to cover your work surfaces, use the drip collars, and just roll it all up and throw it away when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> instead I tried witches hazel to remove the excess \\&quot;glue\\&quot; from \\&quot;down there\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> turn down the heater&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didnt put  any paper towels or hand towels down because I didnt plan to make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The system is so so but the wax that comes in it is 4 thumbs down.</li>
            <li> Extremely unsatisfied!</li>
            <li> Such a waste of time!!</li>
            <li> I used very little and didn&#x27;t miss or break a single hair</li>
            <li> I prefer hard wax over soft, but I just ended up buying a tub of hard wax before I checked out.</li>
            <li> since i only use a very small dab</li>
            <li> Half off.</li>
            <li> I have previous experience with a waxing pot</li>
            <li> Heats up the wax in like 20 mins for me, maybe even less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not possible from a serious company to take measures after almost two months.</li>
            <li> And at the end, I noticed the wax container slightly got split at the bottom and leaked into the warmer - not a lot but a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve ordered this over a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> and then put it in the unit and heat it for about a half an hour before I use it.</li>
            <li> I typically wax eyebrows/lip/chin.  </li>
            <li> After I reviewed all youtube tutorials online, I started using less amount and thinner layer on skin, and swipe the cloth faster.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this in Sallys beauty supply store and returned it since the price was about 50% cheaper here.</li>
            <li> the Honee wax(which is less sticky).</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine using all of the wax in less than a year.</li>
            <li> Half the price tha.</li>
            <li> Repurchased the Gigi warmer and wooden spatulas  and then bought Cirepil blue wax and haven&#x27;t been sorry once.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the wax in this kit is the wrong kind or what I did wrong, but I had trouble removing any hair from my legs.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expected, what wasn&#x27;t expected was the failure of this product.</li>
            <li> so I was hopeful that the comments about the mess and not pulling the hair out would be based on operator error.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess</li>
            <li> Not True.</li>
            <li> my room becomes mess whenever i use it ..</li>
            <li> It was a mess and the wax is so sticky.</li>
            <li> Also, if you don&#x27;t heat the wax up to the hottest temp, you don&#x27;t have all the mess of wax dripping everywhere.</li>
            <li> The wax is a straight-up mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read another reviews and apparently the secret is to use some baby powder...</li>
            <li> I would suggest an eppilator to those who are looking for a less messy method of hair removal.</li>
            <li> but i would like to get something less sticky and messy soon.</li>
            <li> Some of the bottles leaked a little bit in shipping --&amp;#62; 4 stars.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to go purchase all the little things I needed.  </li>
            <li> Still, a little Vaseline on a cotton bud will do the job.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it all that messy as long as you aren&#x27;t putting a big glob of wax on the stick and trying to put the wax somewhere difficult like the jawline.  </li>
            <li> Wish the kit came with a little wax off product.</li>
            <li> You have to have a little background knowledge before you can start waxing.</li>
            <li> This little at home wax kit basically pays for it self.</li>
            <li> But if other people are saying it is messy, you need to believe it because I am saying it too!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try to save a little money and do my brows myself.  </li>
            <li> The Dark Honee can be used all over and it gets all the hair in one pull!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because the wax that came is a pink one that say that is for sensitive skin but is the opposite.</li>
            <li> I like it but a little messy.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be!!!</li>
            <li> I spent over 60 dollars on waxing kit and it hardly works.</li>
            <li> When I think of the hundreds of dollars I&#x27;ve spent getting my upper lip waxed at a fancy salon all these years, it makes me sad that I haven&#x27;t found Gigi sooner.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of spending money getting facial waxes.  </li>
            <li> if not seems like I just wasted my money</li>
            <li> I bought this to avoid having to spend the money on lip waxing and eyebrow waxing every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> There were a few things I disliked about this product, so I&#x27;ll start there.  </li>
            <li> once I use it a few times.  </li>
            <li> (I had to get a tooth brush out and scrub for about 5 minutes to get a few blotches off my</li>
            <li> I have never used something so messy and ineffective.  </li>
            <li> Like others have mention, the wax is to thin and does not remove course hair properly.</li>
            <li> People say it&#x27;s messy.  </li>
            <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy this kit YEARS ago instead of enduring the pain and poor results of using NADS or shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when it was opened on Christmas and used for the first time, the lid on the hot wax was very difficult to remove and my daughter ended up getting wax all over her hands which was very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> received this item yestarday, the lid ( red colour) is broken.</li>
            <li> The instruction book that it comes with is not entirely detailed.</li>
            <li> she have round marks on her hand.</li>
            <li> It took a few months to get it</li>
            <li> I fire this thing up every week when I see a few hairs growing in on my brows and wham bam in 3 minutes</li>
            <li> Also, the trial bottles are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> give or take a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am having trouble using this product.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit after going to the salon a few times for a Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li> but this product dried out my skin and pulled it</li>
            <li> Lets just say that was an epic fail.  </li>
            <li> Can be quite messy and you&#x27;ll still need to use your tweezer afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a waste of money to buy this kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a few uses it will pay for itself.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have too much trouble with the strips it came with and any problems I did have with the strips</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> I am not an expert, but am learning a few tricks as I go.  </li>
            <li> but it is so messy</li>
            <li> The kit costs less than one brazilian wax!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how to use half of them</li>
            <li> I really think that the particular wax that comes with this kit is particularly awful.  </li>
            <li> If anything it makes them stiff and sticky so that I can then pluck them with tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I followed instructions and on several attempts I would pull the strip and the wax would remain on the skin while the strip painfully pulled up with only half the wax but no hair.  </li>
            <li> You will have a sticky mess otherwise!</li>
            <li> I have used wax kits before and didn&#x27;t have so much mess!</li>
            <li> NEVER what a mess!</li>
            <li> Avoid a mess!  </li>
            <li> Each cloth has \\&quot;too many\\&quot; small threads which creates mess and hard to clean too. :(</li>
            <li> The warmer takes a very long time to heat up the container and you need to stir it throughout the warming otherwise you will have molten wax around the edge with a majority of cold wax in the middle.</li>
            <li> The bad part is even though it was &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;, the whole thing had been used and the lid cover was broke in half.</li>
            <li> After spending 3 hours to wax a few small areas and a addition hour in the shower to remove the stick i am repacking and returning.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of the cream wax that they sent, because it is very messy....</li>
            <li> I know how painful waxing the upper lip is, and I wasn&#x27;t looking forward to it, nor did I think I was \\&quot;professional\\&quot; enough to know how to wax,</li>
            <li> Ok so Waxing can be messy, I get that, however this is THE worst!</li>
            <li> I overall like the machine but the wax that came with the machine I am not happy with it is not like the one they use in the salons its thick and doesnt seem to grab the hairs and a lot remains on the skin after you pull it.</li>
            <li> Other then the horrible wax the machine works fine</li>
            <li> Do I need practice or is this not a good kit for waxing other places than the face?  </li>
            <li> the pink stuff sucks!</li>
            <li> Very messy and not easy to use,</li>
            <li> The cream wax is a little hard to get to work though.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the product to be so messy and hard to remove</li>
            <li> When you use the product, do small sections at a time.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t waste your money on wax-off!</li>
            <li> /&gt;why would they even give me such HORRIBLE WAX and such a LOW TEMP WARMER</li>
            <li> I like the warmer, the creme wax and all small lotion bottles.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m not sure if it is lack of experience or the wax</li>
            <li> removes hair (but for me I had bruise all over and burn marks sadly (maybe try a different wax)</li>
            <li> I just bought the kit today and was anxious to try it out.</li>
            <li> No more paying others to wax the brows and elsewhere.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to do a bikini wax, this creme wax is definitely the wrong wax to use.  </li>
            <li> Also the kit comes with all these bottles of cremes and such that you don&#x27;t need and fails to give you the powder and wax remover that you do need.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried kits in the past (microwavable ones)</li>
            <li> I usually get at the salon after she&#x27;s finished with me.</li>
            <li> was a gift for our granddaughter, not sure how she likes it</li>
            <li> No more than usual.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!</li>
            <li> but SO MESSY AND STICKY!</li>
            <li> not sure if it was the wax or the strips, but did not remove hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> My parents bought the same kit as a Christmas gift and unfortunately was tipped on</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> No more butt hair for me</li>
            <li> The wax not a favorite but ordered honey wax instead</li>
            <li> i usually turn the machine on to just over medium.</li>
            <li> and then I use a small amount of baby powder over the area to be waxed.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am anxious to try the hardening wax that doesn&#x27;t require strips</li>
            <li> It usually takes about 30 minutes for the wax to heat up.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what prompted me to not to buy this product forever ago.</li>
            <li> magically - no break out at all.</li>
            <li> if you dont know how to use it, or you have small siblings that can ruin it then, don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Love the melting pot but the wax is TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> am not even sure if it&#x27;s just me who has this terrible time trying to apply the wax and remove it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very messy as everyone states</li>
            <li> It worked but it was very messy.</li>
            <li> found the cream wax to be very messy and not all that effective.&lt;br /&gt;Had</li>
            <li> not its fault but very messy (as noted)...  </li>
            <li> , the wax didn&#x27;t remove none of the hair of my legs at all, and the wax was very messy.</li>
            <li> I found the wax very difficult to work with and it just left a large painful mess.  </li>
            <li> This process can create a real mess.  </li>
            <li> Can be messy and hard to remove from wood tables (not a product complaint, user error).  </li>
            <li> After a few minutes of prepping myself mentally (these things always tend to have something go wrong)</li>
            <li> The lid to the warmer came broken in half.</li>
            <li> Warmer is fine, wax is terrible.  </li>
            <li> It is hard as well.</li>
            <li> I also bought the hard wax that doesn&#x27;t require strips</li>
            <li> The cream wax is to hard to work with.</li>
            <li> However, I did order hard wax, powder, and wax off seperately.</li>
            <li> Hard to use.</li>
            <li> I should have chosen the version with honey or hard wax and paper strips.</li>
            <li> The wax leaves hardly ANY stubble.</li>
            <li> It was a big painful mess</li>
            <li> I was used to using hard wax without strips.  </li>
            <li> One other small thing is the kit comes with all of these booklets and lotions and sprays etc random stuff but DOESNT come with a wax removing oil...</li>
            <li> I had to go to sally&#x27;s beauty supply to purchase the GIGI Brazilian No Strips Needed Hard Wax.</li>
            <li> I still had too use the muslin strips with the hard wax.</li>
            <li> and I ordered the hard wax to see how it works since I&#x27;ve had that done before.</li>
            <li> Im going to get the hard wax,</li>
            <li> I would suggest that u buy the GiGi hard wax for that.</li>
            <li> u pull a hair too hard and it bleed and prevent from getting infected).</li>
            <li> my fault cause it was hard for me to use the wax I might have piled the wax on too thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting waxed for at least 10 years and been using the strips for my upper-lips etc.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say the kit is missing is the Azulene oil (sorry if I spelled that wrong), so I would advise you to go</li>
            <li> I lot of reviews complained about the creams it comes with.</li>
            <li> put some towels on the bed in case I got clumsy and dripped wax where I wasn&#x27;t supposed to</li>
            <li> (at least that we could see).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sticks to your skin and is not effective at pulling all the hair off.  </li>
            <li> I noticed all the reviews on this kit complained about the wax.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think people write negative reviews just for the sake of it.</li>
            <li> so I have saved at least $100 a month not going to salons.</li>
            <li> Has already paid at least 1/3 of itself.</li>
            <li> but it sucks I would not recommend</li>
            <li> The directions are a bit confusing and the directions for the wax are on the bottom of the can so read before you heat it up.  </li>
            <li> We were going to the salon and paying at least $40.00 every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It was too late for me to return it.</li>
            <li> the wax they sent with it is to thick for the face and feet</li>
            <li> the slow grow oil.</li>
            <li> this kit comes with thick paper &amp;#34;collars&amp;#34; that u put around the can of wax before u drop it in the machine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Downside- difficult to remove and the creams/lotions that it come along with are not very useful</li>
            <li> not sure if I will like it or not!</li>
            <li> I suggest using very small amounts on your eyebrows and just slowly move around the shape.</li>
            <li> I mean I have areas with hair still on them</li>
            <li> I must be doing something wrong with this aweful pink wax!  </li>
            <li> After you have done everything, the wax is terrible to clean up.  </li>
            <li> bought this wax set after seeing it tried out by  youtube blogger not impressed ... residue sucks and left my skin with a terrible rash for a week straight</li>
            <li> Also, the wax had adhered to the lid of the container making it very difficult to open.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too hard for you just buy the hard wax!</li>
            <li> It was nothing serious...</li>
            <li> I also find it ridiculous that it claims to be a (KIT) and yet in order to use it you have to go out and purchase the powder and oil in order to even start.</li>
            <li> The rest bars that come with the kit are a little difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> This is irritating because once the wax hardens on your skin it is really hard to get it off.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the lid was cracked on delivery.</li>
            <li> The muslin strips are not good quality either.  </li>
            <li> However the wax that it brings is not good.</li>
            <li> just wish the set came with honey wax instead of cream wax which is so runny and not good for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The wax is a little messy, but not to bad.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair get the hard wax instead otherwise the wax will from the kit be useless.</li>
            <li> This product sucks !</li>
            <li> It was very hard to remove.  </li>
            <li> Not very happy with that!</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money!!!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> After years of pulling off wax and getting skin burns, tweezing each and every hair on my chin and upper lip, painful and time consuming, I was looking at the expensive (read $299</li>
            <li> Another secret</li>
            <li> It came broken.</li>
            <li> Came with broken amber lid...</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to save on waxing, the wax itself is poor.</li>
            <li> I never got to use this product because it was broken</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of spending $50 on bikini waxes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatley the lid was cracked and broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> It is very sticky and makes it very annoying to wax.</li>
            <li> So if you are not happy with the product I can assure you</li>
            <li> the lid was broken...</li>
            <li> When I used the wax, it pulled off layers of skin and left bloody sores on my skin.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t pull anything off when using the strips and the wax goes through the thin strips it comes with</li>
            <li> Beware of broken merchandise.</li>
            <li> When it arrived the lid was broken into pieces.</li>
            <li> 4stars cause the lid cover was broken when arrived.</li>
            <li> but when I received this wax kit, I came to find the brown plastic lid which covers the wax container was broken.</li>
            <li> This item was delivered with a broken lid and because it is a GiGi Mini Pro Waxing Kit that contains wax and lotions, I can&#x27;t return it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> now I am stuck with a broken product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no big deal just annoying.</li>
            <li> No where in the booklet does it give an approximate time for the heating of the wax.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, it is somewhat irritating to my skin.  </li>
            <li> After waxing, I applied antibiotic ointment (thinly) over my arms and face and</li>
            <li> the wax paper is thin and you can feel the wax seeping through.</li>
            <li> The lid for my wax warmer is broken.</li>
            <li> Tried using it for bikini and underarms and it doesn&#x27;t harden correctly, even after letting set for 5 min with very thin layer, and hardly pulls out any hairs.</li>
            <li> up with 2 because I could cancel the other on time.&lt;br /&gt;Had bad experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously in the wrong business</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> I agree with others who said that stupid concealer is useless and that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> It was SO MUCH LESS painful than my salon waxes.</li>
            <li> I was frustrated and thought it&#x27;s the worst at first because I had been using hard wax all times before.</li>
            <li> I have received this item, but unfortunately, it has been broken.</li>
            <li> Rated 2 stars because the warmer and spatulas  worked like a charm but all the other items were crap.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed that this kit didn&#x27;t include the pre epilation powder..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to get off your skin (use baby oil for this!)</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m spending some time in the US, I figured I could still do it, and avoid the expensive</li>
            <li> the texture seems like glue, and it&#x27;s really difficult to remove it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kit was expensive but had I bought all the items seperatly</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had nasty teen wolfs lined up at my dorm for chest waxes ever since I made this purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also include a bunch of creams that are useless.</li>
            <li> you buy this kit, buy whatever wax remover the company sells as well, or trust me, you will be sorry.  </li>
            <li> This kit is expensive and doesn&#x27;t give you what you want.</li>
            <li> but i failed..</li>
            <li> what she wanted, sorry i am not a wordy person that goes on and on and on and on and on</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> wth ths useless</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Horrible reviews is simply because you do not know how to use the product.</li>
            <li> well however the wax that&#x27;s included is almost useless.</li>
            <li> The wax is a bit difficult to work with, but it works.</li>
            <li> However, I have tried twice, and both failed.</li>
            <li> The products it came with are useless (to me).</li>
            <li> The problem I had was breaking out in horrible red bumps.</li>
            <li> very poor equipment</li>
            <li> This comes with very poor directions, ensure you have something underneath it to catch all the gooey sticky dripping bc</li>
            <li> The wax was very poor quality and made my skin irritated.</li>
            <li> I thought it was hard wax.. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> But when it was delivered to me the lid to the waxing pot was broken :(</li>
            <li> The cream wax was awful leaving me a sticky mess and didn&#x27;t remove the hair.</li>
            <li> It is an awkward task though.  </li>
            <li> and now I know what a chicken feels like</li>
            <li> what a disappointment.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> The wax cream is awful and messy.</li>
            <li> I am so mad</li>
            <li> IT IS HORRIBLE buy a kit that comes with honey wax or hard wax etc</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It sticks to everything, gets everywhere and is impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li> also came with a broken cover.., very disappointed</li>
            <li> Do I need to explain how bad that burned?</li>
            <li> I feel that the bad reviews were probably because of inexperience.</li>
            <li> ~$40 for a DIY experiment didn&#x27;t seem like a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was so bad.  </li>
            <li> The wax is so bad and so sticky.</li>
            <li> I scoured the reviews before buying it and still decided to buy it with the bad reviews....</li>
            <li> and none of the bad reviews make any sense.</li>
            <li> Any who, I&#x27;ve had bad results after waxing the face--red bumps and itchy.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am a bit frustrated with it.</li>
            <li> Having 3 girls, I couldn&#x27;t afford to get their eyebrows waxed at a salon every 3 weeks and tweezing took forever and was painful.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t start to say the num of times I have wished I never bought this disastrous kit!&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> I was sick of paying $20 every two weeks to go to the salon.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed and would not recommend for brazillian.</li>
            <li> It has a weird consistency and it is awfully sticky.</li>
            <li> smh, I&#x27;m highly disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ugh! So inconvenient!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> A lot of you are disappointed with the wax, trust me I understand.</li>
            <li> I just hate this wax ....</li>
            <li> HATE it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I really hate it.</li>
            <li> the wax is awful, it was painful and innefective.</li>
            <li> Everything bad that anyone has to say is addressed in the booklet!</li>
            <li> The waxing cream is awful :(</li>
            <li> very bad it stuck to my daughter  skin and pilled the skin off.</li>
            <li> even if I kept it covered.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed and am stuck with the product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was very disappointed to see this as was I.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> WAS I EVER WRONG!!!</li>
            <li> And the worst part is that you cannot return this product .It</li>
            <li> The wax was not wax but probably was some synthetic cement, horrible experience.</li>
            <li> but as everyone else stated the wax that comes with the product is absolutely HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> It looks horrible when I am dome with waxing.</li>
            <li> The creme wax it comes with is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Wax that came with kit was horrible.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the strips that supplied are awful!</li>
            <li> it is so horrible, well guess what YOU CAN&#x27;T!!</li>
            <li> The wax that came with it is HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> I am really disgusted with this company.  </li>
            <li> are terrible.</li>
            <li> The worst feeling.</li>
            <li> Worst waxing kit I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible experience at a salon and decided to try at home waxing.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried to use.  </li>
            <li> The woven strips are horrible as the wax seeped through and got my hands all sticky.</li>
            <li> This product was horrible.</li>
            <li> It was horrible trying to get it off of my skin.</li>
            <li> However, the wax that came with it HORRIBLE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love my waxing kit. I use it to wax client&#x27;s, and it does the job perfectly. Gets very hot to melt the wax.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my face. I have fine hair on my cheeks and above my lip that I am trying to rid myself of. This is waxing, so there is pain when you pull the strip off with the hair attached to it. I have a low tolerance of pain, so this bothered me a lot. Maybe if your pain tolerance is higher, then waxing will not bother you so much. My other complaint was that it left a sticky residue all over my face and hands. I thought the kit contained everything I needed, but it did not have the wax off solution in it. (This is sold separately.) After trying rubbing alcohol, vinegar, hydrogen peroxide and finally hand lotion, the stickiness finally came off. I have ordered some of the wax off and will try the product again. I know after waxing a few times, you can get the hair to not grow back at all, so I am going to grin and bare the pain and try to do this a few more times to see if I can get rid of the hair for good. When you use the product, do small sections at a time. I found that more hair came off if I only did about a 2 in by 2 in area of my face at a time.</li>
            <li> The Creme wax doesn&#x27;t wax good enough - I had to spend more money buying the Honee wax. Also the muslin strips are terrible!&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this waxing kit.</li>
            <li> Love my waxing kit, works well and warms up fast! Comes with everything you need to get started. I would recommend you buy the wax removal though. This does not come with it. :)</li>
            <li> I thought this would be like the kind of wax used in a salon, but guess what it was not.  It takes a long time to set.  I got a chemical burn from this product.  I think I am going to throw it away.  I will not use it again.  I do not recommend anyone else to use this product.  The was makes a big mess and is really hard to clean off of your skin.</li>
            <li> The cloth sucks but great starting kit</li>
            <li> Now I need to check if that&#x27;s real in a week. In any case she asked me if I would use it but..nahhh I&#x27;m just scared to think about that.</li>
            <li> good starter kit...buy a different wax though..the cream wax doesnt work</li>
            <li> It is one of the most effective wax I have used. It is an amazing buy for the price and comes with sufficient wax strips and applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside- difficult to remove and the creams/lotions that it come along with are not very useful</li>
            <li> This kit does a good job for the most part. The wax takes a long time to be hot enough to work well. It comes with lots of potions and lotions for the skin for use before and after waxing. Be prepared to purchase more waxing cloth strips if this is used often as the kit does not come with very many.</li>
            <li> For the price of just one waxing I now can wax anytime I want.  It is exactly what I&#x27;ve seen used in the salon.  No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> It is good but too much to clean after I finished waxing. It is hard as well. I will go bake to honey one and not cream one.</li>
            <li> Only used it 2 times so far....but I need more practice with it that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Product was not as ordered. It was advertised as brazillian wax kit. It was a general kit for all types of waxing. I was disappointed and would not recommend for brazillian.</li>
            <li> works great, i have save hundreds on waxing</li>
            <li> MY TOP WAS BROKEN WHEN THEY SHIPPED IT TO ME AND ONE OF THE BOTTLES WAS OPEN. PASS THE SHIPPING DISASTER THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Wish the instructions where better. Good overall.</li>
            <li> great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It was as described. I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> The product description is not right and it does not say anywhere on product if it is for complete body or only for bikini areas. And the worst part is that you cannot return this product .It also came with a broken cover.., very disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this after I moved to a tiny town with no esthetician in site. I needed to do my eyebrows mainly. I have tried this kit two times now and each time the wax does NOT even remove ONE DARN HAIR...not one! I am so mad I spent 50 bucks on this!</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price! Delivary was on point as well thank you!</li>
            <li> I am not pro at waxing. I&#x27;ve been getting waxed for at least 10 years and been using the strips for my upper-lips etc. So i have an idea how it&#x27;s done. I finally decided to cut down the wax cost and ordered this. My set arrived pretty quickly and i had a chance to try it this weekend. It s super convenient. My wax was ready in about 20 mins. Yes it is sticky, but its wax and should be sticky. The lotions they gave for after wax wasn&#x27;t able to clean up what&#x27;s left on my legs so i had to use baby oil. And i totally recommend using oil to clean up as its super easy.</li>
            <li> Gets really messy but it works great.  Bring extra towels.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Easy to follow directions.  Kit comes with pretty much everything you need.  I would recommend this product.  It pays for itself.</li>
            <li> Love my new GiGi Mini Waxing Kit , I used it on my eye brows and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> The wax was not wax but probably was some synthetic cement, horrible experience. Never again...</li>
            <li> Great product. Good Price!!!</li>
            <li> This product is good, but I hated the pink wax that came with the kit.  I had to replace it with the honee wax.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of spending money getting facial waxes.  It works just as I had hoped; the directions were clear and it&#x27;s easy to use.  It would have been nice if they had included mineral oil, instead of the other bottles.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own bikini waxing for years in Argentina. As I&#x27;m spending some time in the US, I figured I could still do it, and avoid the expensive salons.&lt;br /&gt;I think the main problem is the wax itself.... the texture seems like glue, and it&#x27;s really difficult to remove it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read another reviews and apparently the secret is to use some baby powder... Another secret: use a really thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;The heater is great, so maybe the best is to just buy the heater and get the wax somewhere else.</li>
            <li> system worked well but did not include the wax remover - don&#x27;t forget this if you buy this system</li>
            <li> Does the job and everything I needed came in the box.</li>
            <li> This was just the product I needed in my salon... I am able to get even the little hard to get chin hairs that most cold waxes leave behind. This wax gets VERY HOT but I would recommend this product to any salon owner or even for home use (if you know how to use hot wax). Thank You Amazon.com</li>
            <li> It came broken. It didn&#x27;t have the honey wax I was expecting. It was a pink wax.</li>
            <li> The cream wax is not very good but the rest of the package is great.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This kit has almost everything you will need to start waxing at home. I used baby powder as dusting powder. I wish they had included wax-off instead of the other lotions and gels</li>
            <li> Came with broken amber lid...I sent an e-mail to company, but no reply.  Haven&#x27;t used it very much yet, so not sure if I will like it or not!</li>
            <li> Wow I can&#x27;t believe all the stuff you get in this kit for such a low price! What a great deal!!! It even arrived early.</li>
            <li> It got here on time, everything seemed pretty good. The day i got it i tried it and it worked fine except for the wax it was way to sticky for my taste. The second time that i was going to use it which was about a week from when i got it, the warmer did not turn on!!!</li>
            <li> I think the value is there - warmer, sticks, strips, lots of creams and a jar of wax.  I followed instructions and on several attempts I would pull the strip and the wax would remain on the skin while the strip painfully pulled up with only half the wax but no hair.  This created several bruises and raw skin.  This has happened both times I have waxed my lip - but only on one side.  This has also happened on several spots when I waxed my arm.  I think I will try honey wax.  That being said, I love being able to wax at home so hopefully with a good wax and maybe figuring out a better technique, it will work out well.</li>
            <li> Have used this product a number of times very successfully.  My one caveat - make sure you have something on hand to remove leftover wax from the skin!  You don&#x27;t want to have to try and scrub off the leftovers.  Use a hydrophilic oil (not included) quickly remove wax safely from skin without scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Nice product, works well. My only gripe is that the box it arrived in was smushed which made giving it as a gift a little cringe worthy.</li>
            <li> I really like this warmer. I have hirsutism and have spent years paying others to wax me or spending hours plucking every hair out of my face, and I finally decided I would save myself time AND money and buy myself a wax warmer. One of my oldest friends is a cosmetologist and I asked her what I should get and she said Gigi. So I found this &amp;#34;pro kit&amp;#34; and for $36 the price couldn&#x27;t be beat for what came included. The warmer, Gigi creme wax (more on that in a sec), drip collars, 100 small and 100 large muslin waxing strips, the small, med, and large application sticks, pre-hon, slow-grow, lotion, cooling gel, and concealer. It was a lot to take in at first! But having read reviews before I bought, I knew I would need baby powder and baby oil (don&#x27;t waste your money on wax-off! Baby oil gets wax off of anything.) So I already had some. I have sensitive skin so I got the ones with aloe and vitamin e from J&amp;J.&lt;br /&gt;The wax took a while to heat up, but its February in Vermont so I&#x27;m sure it was frozen when I got it. Had a mild plastic smell for a moment, but went away quickly. This wax is supposed to be for sensitive skin so I was hopeful that the comments about the mess and not pulling the hair out would be based on operator error. It is, mostly. The hair has to be a little longer than normal for this to work well. The hair on my chin wasn&#x27;t quite long enough for it, but it did my eyebrows beautifully, after I figured out that cooling time is really important for this wax. MAKE SURE you let the wax cool long enough, and don&#x27;t get impatient like I did, before you pull the strip. As far as mess goes, its wax. Its supposed to stick to everything it touches. Put some newspaper down to cover your work surfaces, use the drip collars, and just roll it all up and throw it away when you&#x27;re done. Sticky crap all over everything is a non-issue this way.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very happy with it. I give it four stars only because there are things you don&#x27;t need included, and things you really need left out of this kit. Powder and wax remover instead of concealer and lotion maybe?</li>
            <li> All i can say is i am please with my purchase and i love it one of my best buy thanks!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> excellent I don&#x27;t know what I did before I had this, once you read the manual and know how to wax it is amazing and gigi wax is incredibly smooth and it doesnt hurt!</li>
            <li> The kit came with everything it claimed but the wax is super thick pepto pink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also I waited 30 minutes to heat the wax didn&#x27;t get hot at all so I waited an hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even have to blow the wax it wasn&#x27;t hot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i think the wax may be the problem so a purchased the honey wax hopefully I will have better luck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but if not seems like I just wasted my money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;why would they even give me such HORRIBLE WAX and such a LOW TEMP WARMER</li>
            <li> I overall like the machine but the wax that came with the machine I am not happy with it is not like the one they use in the salons its thick and doesnt seem to grab the hairs and a lot remains on the skin after you pull it. I am contemplating returning the machine after several tries or maybe I will try different wax. The strips also that come with it are not the best because when you put it on the wax seeps through the strip and gets all over your hands. I have to say I am a bit frustrated with it.</li>
            <li> It is OK, but will not buy this again</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time and I loved it. It&#x27;s the best option to save money, if you visit spas to get your hair removed. I agree it does help if you have extra hands but anyone can easily manage hair removing. If you follow what the CD says exactly! I am happy that I got my money worth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to save on waxing, the wax itself is poor. The strips don&#x27;t remove all wax. The warmer &amp; skin products are great, however I purchased a different wax &amp; strips. Should have just bought the warmer.</li>
            <li> Awesome got it during black Friday . Half off. Works great.  Used it before vacation to Puerto vallarta works like at the ones in a pro spa.</li>
            <li> Pefect size. Doesn&#x27;t get too hot you burn your skin when waxing.</li>
            <li> Used tips in comments for legs and bikini, no problems at all. Will be purchasing refreshments later if run out of wax/ lotions. Update: used 5 times for whole body, used a half of wax and all stripes, but wax replacements are in bed bath and beyond or online</li>
            <li> Best waxing Kit ever! i love when  put on the wax it doesnt burn me like other wax. its perfect tempture! works great! easy to use!</li>
            <li> Was an opened bottle of concealer that leaked but looked like it was tried to be cleaned up before shipping to me.&lt;br /&gt;None of the mini bottles had sanitary seals on them. Who knows if they were used before.&lt;br /&gt;You would think a waxing kit is a simple purchase but it was very suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;I should of just bought it at the local beauty supply. Was not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy the Warmer and then get your supplies at a beauty supply where you can inspect them yourself.</li>
            <li> the top part was cracked and the wax was really messy</li>
            <li> I work for a salon and purchased this after kit after we had purchased one for the salon. It was cheaper here than with our salon discount at a salon supply distributor. I love this product and it&#x27;s great for my at home waxing. Comes with directions.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for someone that does not want to spend a ton of money going to a salon for waxing especially today when it&#x27;s so pricey. This kit comes with everything you need to wax any part of your body. It&#x27;s great that it includes the essentials because you don&#x27;t have to go and buy each thing separately. I would suggest having baby oil and powder in hand to prep your skin for waxing and use the oil to remove any wax from skin and other areas. This machine warms up fairly quickly and is very easy to use. I love using this to wax my eyebrows, underarms and bikini area. It&#x27;s a little messy at first but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s fairly easy and quick. It&#x27;s a great kit for a great price. I&#x27;ve bought this kit quite a while ago and it&#x27;s still in use and works great definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wax was very cheap and would not come off my skin! I had to try everything else to get the way off. NEVER AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> The kit arrived with everything discribed. I ordered the Wax Off, wax remover and all purpose Honee wax separately after reading other reviews. I like that the warmer has an adjustable temperature setting. It warms quickly. The Clean Colars are a must if wax gets into the switch it will ruin the machine. If you are someone who can stand self waxing this is the kit to purchase. I have not used the Creme Wax. I have watched videos that instruct you to use baby powder first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the purchase and I consider it a good investment.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to not have to warm this up in the microwave every few minutes. I do not like the strips that come with it, but it is easy to find more. Results are great once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Easy pull off with wax</li>
            <li> This is a great product with clear instructions. It comes with an instructional book which was very helpful to have. Especially for someone like me who bought on to save on salon wax treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this kit for over 6 months now. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with heating or burning. The instructions suggest heating the wax on high for 25 min then moving the temp to low. Which works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some advisory: once heated the wax will not fully harden. I don&#x27;t know if maybe I&#x27;m not doing something right or if that&#x27;s just how it is. Either way it has not been a problem. Just make sure you are storing it away and in a place where it won&#x27;t be accidentally tipped over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is great! Amazing starter kit with basically everything you need. However it does not include a &amp;#34;wax off &amp;#34; bottle as you think it would. I didn&#x27;t realize this until scrolling through amazon and thought that would be really nice to have. The kit that I bought comes with creme wax. Which more or less has the consistency of melted play-do. This is irritating because once the wax hardens on your skin it is really hard to get it off. Hence why it would be awesome for a wax remover gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether I am happy with this purchase and would recommend it</li>
            <li> The waxing cream is awful :( very disappointed​</li>
            <li> Excellent kit, like most of you I have been waxing myself for years but had gotten tired of the cheap wax that they sell in walmart or other stores that just doesn&#x27;t get the job done! After purchasing this and reading the instructions I have found that this is everything I asked for. The creme wax is great for sensitive skin and you wont break out which is always a plus for me. The only thing I would say the kit is missing is the Azulene oil (sorry if I spelled that wrong), so I would advise you to go an get some baby oil it works, for me, just as well as the Azulene oil.</li>
            <li> All I can say is GO BUY THIS!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all different methods of in home hair removal, Im 40 years old and have done it all.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to have FINALLY found something that works! The pink creme wax that comes with this kit is a dream, I used it under arms, bikini, face, legs. It is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> I brought this kit on October 20/2013, cause I was trying to wax at home the wax cream is s*** it don&#x27;t remove any hair, the warmer is good but could have gotten that separate if I had just read some of the bad reviews</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because it needs a powder to remove the humidity and an oil to remove the wax. It&#x27;s very nice and good quality.</li>
            <li> Seems like it takes the wax a really long time to melt.</li>
            <li> I like the warmer, the creme wax and all small lotion bottles. Only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is the \\&quot;cloth strips\\&quot; included in the kit. Each cloth has \\&quot;too many\\&quot; small threads which creates mess and hard to clean too. :(</li>
            <li> First off, this kit gives you creme wax with muslin strips...... The strips with this wax should be non woven cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I am in love, I hate going to a salon to get waxed when I&#x27;m perfectly capable of doing it my self. The wax is PERFECT, a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used honey wax before but I much prefer the creme.  I saw this same kit at Sally&#x27;s for almost double the price!! Love love love</li>
            <li> Loooooove! I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and I love GiGi brand. The products are excellent quality, the pot is great for working at home or in the salon, and this kit comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and at a great price!  Prices this at a local beauty store and it was much higher just for the warmer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that the wax is so creamy. I has always usted bee wax that is more liquid. But The warmer works great and everything included in the kit is great</li>
            <li> This product comes with a wide variety of items but, not with the items you need. Instructions on how to use the machine would have been nice, they assume you know what you&#x27;re doing. The creme wax is VERY sticky, so sticky that it glued the container shut. Also, they make refrences to products you need that they don&#x27;t include such as powder. I never got to use this product because it was broken but, I didn&#x27;t get a good impression.</li>
            <li> I simply love this product.  It has given me the opportunity to remove unwanted eyebrow hairs.  Easy to use and cleans up quickly.</li>
            <li> Its just as described. Might want to purchase more of the waxing sticks and fiber strips because they don&#x27;t have many if you using your waxer daily</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I am admittedly a complete novice at waxing myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this because I was tired of spending $50 on bikini waxes. The kit has almost everything you&#x27;ll need for a full-on bikini wax, but not quite. To do this, you&#x27;ll need in addition:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baby powder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wax off (for skin, not surface)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have rated it 5 stars but I feel that the powder and wax removing lotion should have been included. Maybe in place of the concealer? It&#x27;s this grey-brown makeup type stuff, I just don&#x27;t see how it would work for anyone&#x27;s skin tone and is rather arbitrarily included. FYI, the Cool-off gel burns like the dickens if there are any cuts or if your skin is abraded from the wax. And I couldn&#x27;t figure out exactly where to put the resting bars. But I think with practice and those extra tools, it&#x27;ll work perfectly!</li>
            <li> Item arrived fast and it was good product</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money!!!  I tried using the wax that comes with it and no hair was removed at all!!!!!!  I was using the Sally Hanson microwave wax and it works much much better.&lt;br /&gt;The strips that come in this kit didn&#x27;t work at all.  I also bought the hard wax that doesn&#x27;t require strips but I was told to use them well guess what the wax wouldn&#x27;t stick to them.  I&#x27;m going to try and return this to the store.  I&#x27;m really not happy about this whole kit.</li>
            <li> This is truly a great kit. I&#x27;ve used it on both my eyebrows and bikini area and it worked well both times. It&#x27;s fully loaded with a thorough instruction manual, pre wax hon, post wax cooling gel, post was concealer, etc. The wax doesn&#x27;t take too long to heat up and is easy to apply. One downside is I&#x27;ve definitely made a mess with it (dripped on the nice wood floor) but I think this was due to user error rather than the kit itself). I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try self waxing for quite some time. I decided to go with this kit by reccomendation of my local beauty supply store. The kit was expensive but had I bought all the items seperatly it would have been alot more. If I don&#x27;t use all the products included then is it really a deal? The warmer is great but I have to leave it on high to be affective, even though it says you can turn it down to low after it heats up. The cream wax is supposed to be for an all purpose use and for sensitive skin which is what I need.  However I&#x27;m not sure if it is lack of experience or the wax but it only took a few of the hairs not all of them. I tried on my chin and underarms with the same results. I will try a different wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is the kit does not come with baby powder or anything to remove the wax. Now had I read these reviews first I would have tried oil instead I tried witches hazel to remove the excess \\&quot;glue\\&quot; from \\&quot;down there\\&quot;.  Do I need to explain how bad that burned? It was like Icy Hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So GIGi use your product to see what we do and don&#x27;t need...we need powder and wax remover for our skin and I think a different wax I mean why not put your best most reliable wax in this mini professional kit right!</li>
            <li> The kit was pretty neat. It did come with everything you need for waxing at home. Although the mini size items weren&#x27;t much, it&#x27;s a great trial size. Although I&#x27;m not to fond of the cream  because I prefer the original wax over the cream it gets the job done. Over all, the kit is worth it for the price. Happy pulling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to start using my new waxing kit! Delivery was fast, perfectly packaged, nothing damaged, so far...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This thing takes 40 minutes to get ready to use (20 mins on high, 20 mins on low).  If you haven&#x27;t forgotten that you were getting ready to wax by then, you can finally get down to business.  After you have done everything, the wax is terrible to clean up.  None of the products seem to un-stick the spills.  The best thing I found to do it was baby oil.  I do like the smell of the GIGI product lines, but for what I need, this kit doesn&#x27;t fit my life style.</li>
            <li> Salon services can be spendy so I thought I would save some money and buy the kit to do it myself.  The kit costs less than one brazilian wax!  My skin is sensitive and I have not had any issues with this product (hooooray!) It is an awkward task though.  I know what I am doing but lets face it, you just can&#x27;t always reach where you need to get.  I would recommend going to the salon to get the job done then using this for maintenance to up keep your look following that.  Stick with it because you get better with practice...and a glass of wine doesn&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
            <li> removes hair (but for me I had bruise all over and burn marks sadly (maybe try a different wax) I had it on low when I wax but still had burn marks and bruise but, did remove hair very well</li>
            <li> I think this kit is great...I love the cr&amp;eacute;me wax, this wax is great on my legs and face. My only problem is that it should come with more strips and the wax off lotion. Other then that I find everything to be good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the wax that came with it, but like the item.</li>
            <li> INCREDIBLY FAST SHIPPING.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first waxing pot..&lt;br /&gt;It came with everything I needed to start immediatly.&lt;br /&gt;Plus some extra&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;And a very detailed manual to assist on waxing in spots you aren&#x27;t familiar with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a dorm and I&#x27;ve had nasty teen wolfs lined up at my dorm for chest waxes ever since I made this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made me back the money I spent on it in nearly a week.</li>
            <li> This product was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves it.Said it was best Christmas gift ever.Also I thought it was a great price.</li>
            <li> It works great. The cream wax is a little hard to get to work though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of my GiGi wax. I&#x27;m a licensed Esti and just wanted something simple for home use. this was way to messy and left to much residue. I might give this to someone just starting out because it&#x27;s a cute little kit but I would recommended they get a different brand of wax to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this to avoid having to spend the money on lip waxing and eyebrow waxing every few weeks.  It was a 45 dollar mistake.  I can never get any hair off, and end up tweezing. To make matters worse, I am stuff with bright red waxing marks on my face for an hour, and I didn&#x27;t even wax any hair!!! DON&#x27;T BUY THIS! The creme wax does nothing. You need regular wax!!! Keep looking!!!!!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Great buy! Some of the bottles leaked a little bit in shipping --&amp;#62; 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit for my own personal use not for a business.  I was very pleased with the product and all of the items that came with it.  I would have to agree with some of the other reviews I read about this wax -- it is VERY sticky!  But, I had some baby oil and I had no problems getting the left-over wax to come off the skin.  It is probably a lot of product for my own personal use, but I figured it will pay for itself in about 6-7 uses.  I was pleased to find out that the creme wax that was included in the kit is made especially for sensitive skin (which I have).</li>
            <li> The wax isn&#x27;t good quality.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best i love it got it and wax my brows haha!! recommend it to everyone who know how to wax haha. :)</li>
            <li> This wax kit has everything you need to get the job done. You really get your money back after just a couple uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife, and she is very happy with it. she used to pay to get the hair removed and now she can do it by herself and my help in some areas :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the wax warmer looks to be made with good materials and works excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;greeting from Costa Rica.</li>
            <li> The kit does its job but as everyone else stated the wax that comes with the product is absolutely HORRIBLE it&#x27;s super sticky, it doesn&#x27;t stick well with the clothes they provide, and it just seeps through the cloth. Other then the horrible wax the machine works fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this product, I can hardly stop smiling about it! I just bought the kit today and was anxious to try it out. I just finished doing my navel area and both eyebrows and they look/feel amazing! The wax was the perfect temp and not that difficult to use at all. I suggest using very small amounts on your eyebrows and just slowly move around the shape. The instuction booklet was helpful as well. I am so looking forward to doing a bikini wax and eventually my underarms. This is a wonderful kit for first timers and long gone are the days of overpriced spa waxing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really order stuff online kux ion trust it but it got here in a day but that&#x27;s with speedin it up n I used it 2 times and still good thnx.</li>
            <li> The product does all it said it would, you do not need to be a professional to use it. Came in record time. We were very pleased.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I expected and is a great product. Great value and would suggest this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the kit, great price.  Would have liked it better if it had been shipped properly to me and not leaked everywhere in the box.  Luckily it didn&#x27;t ruin the unit, bit did waste half of the wax.</li>
            <li> The wax did not get all the hair off. I had to wax several times in one spot to get all the hair, which left bruises. I do not recommend at home waxing.</li>
            <li> The wax warmer and all the supplies are great but the pink wax itself is horrible. It has a weird consistency and it is awfully sticky. It also doesn&#x27;t remove much hair the first pass so in spite of the warning not to apply twice in the same area you have to if you want the hair gone. I had never had this type of wax before but I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have previous experience with a waxing pot so I think that is why I knew how to operate it so well. I feel that the bad reviews were probably because of inexperience. I thought the wax worked great. Overall very pleased with this product and so excited that I have it!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been very impressed with this product, the wax kit remover.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use and we save money by not having to go to&lt;br /&gt;a professional. Thanks for this affordable, incredible, easy to use&lt;br /&gt;home product availability.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve had my eyebrows and lips waxed in salons and although I can kind of tell what they are doing--I am not at all a pro at this kind of thing.  I got my product today and it came quite quickly and that was good.  There were a few things I disliked about this product, so I&#x27;ll start there.  The instructions on how to operate the wax heater were on the bottom of the heater.  This is kind of stupid considering you are placing a can of wax which will heat up in there.  It would have been nice to have handheld directions.  But once you read through the directions, its pretty easy to remember.  Secondly, I think they should have included the stuff to get wax off your face.  I used vaseline.  This worked ok, except my skin felt gross after wards.  The third thing I disliked is that some of the products sent in the kit, I won&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did like though is that it was pretty easy to use.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better at it once I use it a few times.  The hair came right off!  Awesome.  I liked that it came in a kit and I didn&#x27;t have to go purchase all the little things I needed.  The price is amazing.  My sister just got the unit and it cost her $30, so it was nice to get the sticks and cloths and some of the lotions as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great buy.  I would recommend it to anyone wanting to do this at home. It&#x27;s easy and affordable and after using it 2 times, it pays for itself.</li>
            <li> I have been going to get the majority of my body waxed for years. I have been to multiple places, tried numerous waxes, and have been botched so many times I&#x27;m surprised I still have eyebrows left. I decided after much research and review reading to try out the GiGi mini pro waxing kit. I was pleasantly surprised. The kit comes with everything you need to get started. I have pretty sensitive skin and every time I leave a salon I usually have huge red bumps. The wax that comes with this kit is great. It worked well for my both my legs and my face. I found this extremely easy to use. I have never done waxing prior to this but if you just follow the directions and try to be as neat as possible it works well. I lot of reviews complained about the creams it comes with. I like the prepping cream and to get the wax off after I just used coconut oil. The warmer heated fast (about 30 minutes) and it wasn&#x27;t too hot on my skin. One of the best things about doing this myself is it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. It always hurts when I get it done professionally and I didn&#x27;t feel anything when I did it. Over all great product. I will never pay some else to wax me ever again!</li>
            <li> Everything came in, and I&#x27;m so excited to use this.....everything came perfect! Except for one thing...my lid to my new wax warmer is fully cracked in HALF! smh, I&#x27;m highly disappointed but honestly I can&#x27;t complain with the price!</li>
            <li> It works great. Very easy to use. Just plug it in, wait for it to warm and use. Very economical since the price of the kit would cost the same as one trip to the waxing salon. It will save you a lot of money. The was last a long time for many, many uses.</li>
            <li> A very nice kit all in all, would have been nice if they included the wax off or told you that you had to have it</li>
            <li> very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome! Unfortunatley the lid was cracked and broken when I got it. It still worked really well though. I recommend buying the honey wax too since it works better on the eye brows and lip.</li>
            <li> It was more than I expected loveeeee it</li>
            <li> I like the product and do plan on keeping it. However, it doesn&#x27;t come with everything required for waxing. You need to buy baby powder and some sort of oil before you start waxing. Additionally, when I received by kit the lid for the warmer was cracked. It was an easy fix with some crazy glue... But the warmer and kit just look and feel cheap. I would recommend purchasing additional waxing strips that aren&#x27;t cloth. They tend to work better than the ones that come with the kit.</li>
            <li> Very convient. I live in what seems like no mans land. The drive to get eyebrows waxed just isn&#x27;t worth the gas spent. But definitely do not like the cream wax that came with Kit. Purchase the other that is recommended in what others bought. The cream wax is to hard to work with.</li>
            <li> The top was cracked, the pink goop is messy.  I was looking for real wax, not this chemical junk</li>
            <li> The wax warmer and the rest of the supplies were very good except for the pink wax they send you with it! It is very sticky and makes it very annoying to wax. I spilled it in the box and it stuck to everything in it. I had to throw so much out. I suggest the Gigi honee wax.</li>
            <li> Worth it! Loved it and use it very often. Definitely recommend it to anyone not wanting to go out for waxing!</li>
            <li> the wax is awful, it was painful and innefective. i still had hair on my legs and it doesnt come with wax remover so i spent forever trying to get the left over wax off.</li>
            <li> I liked that this product came with all required things for waxing as listed in pictures. But included wax is not much messy it very sticky, I have to use oil to remove it.</li>
            <li> The wax did not suit me. My skin comes out and the portions become complete red. It looks horrible when I am dome with waxing.</li>
            <li> Package. Came on. Time witch was good look exactly. How it looks in the pic everything. Come with it .....but what I did not like was that it only was supposed. To cost $40 and some change. Because. It said shipping was free but they charged. Me. $46&amp;some change for shipping then when. I finally. Used the product. It was easy. To put together. And the wax that they sent with. The gig was for sensitive. Skin but when. I being to. Wax myself. I first tested it on my arm. It came out Well but then I put it on my uperlip. It became really sticky very messy to deal with also the wax did not want to come off my lip even Tho I followed. The institution. For it so I do like the heating. Part but the wax they sent with it is to thick for the face and feet</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.  It was very easy to use and worked like you were at the salon.  Definitely need to be aware of dripping wax, but the kit comes with gaurds for the warmer.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit because I was too terrified to go to a salon and get a bikini wax. I was a first timer and I have to say this kit is fabulous. However, I did order hard wax, powder, and wax off seperately. I must say hard wax is my preference over soft so I definitely recommend ordering the extra stuff. I would certainly recommend these and many more GiGi products to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Dislike. Soft wax is very messy. Hard to use. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> When I received this product the wax was old and not harden. I returned it immediately!</li>
            <li> Luv this tiny machine, it heats up super fast and the can of wax is going to last me forevA. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a while. It paid for itself within 3 months of me not going to the shop for my waxing!</li>
            <li> Has everything needed.  I&#x27;m not sure I like the wax (soft) that was included in the order.  I will try it a few more times; it appears to be too sticky.</li>
            <li> Good quality and comes with everything it says. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Nice kit takes long to heat up though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to heat up enough to make the wax thin enough to spread evenly. They also include a bunch of creams that are useless. It would be better if they included the waxing powder instead.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, and it works really great!  The warmer doesn&#x27;t take long to heat.  All  the items that come in the kit are more than what you need. The handbook is very instructional and explanatory.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit and after using I am glad I made the investment. I had been shaving and noticed my skin was suffering because of it. I also found the more I shaved, the more I had to shave, a vicious cycle. Since using this I now only remove hair every other week and my skin is healing from the shaving abuse. I followed the advice of the other posters and got the wax off for skin which works when followed by soap and water. Also it is important to remove the hair in the direction it grows which can be tricky because they don&#x27;t all grow in the same direction (on the face). A thin layer of warm wax works best while pulling the skin taut. The instruction book has great tips for successful application. Overall I feel I now have the best method to remove hair and I can maintain it myself without enormous salon costs.</li>
            <li> I tested this out today, and it does indeed work.  However, the &#x27;wax&#x27; is so sticky that as soon as it dries it will not come off your skin no matter how many showers you take.  Now, I understand waxing is supposed to be messy, but I knocked off two points mainly because this &#x27;all purpose kit&#x27; did not come with the second most important ingredient...the wax removal oil.  What were they thinking not including a means of actually removing the wax?  That is a pretty big deal when you&#x27;re finished and you have these huge pink globs all over your body and fingers, and no amount of soap will take it off.  Another reviewer on here saved me by mentioning cooking oil will take it off...vegetable oil most definitely did and now I know what a chicken feels like right before you throw it in the frying pan.  Thanks a lot, Gigi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this kit, buy whatever wax remover the company sells as well, or trust me, you will be sorry.  Other than that, the kit is attractive, the instructions detailed and there are a nice assortment of lotions/creams/etc.  The &#x27;Sure Clean&#x27; countertop remover is supposed to take wax off of floors, tables, wherever you accidentally blotched it.  Using this, it did not work well at all (I had to get a tooth brush out and scrub for about 5 minutes to get a few blotches off my sink)...I&#x27;m sure paint thinner would have worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised by the number of complaints about this product and I also noticed that the biggest gripe is the creme wax that comes in the starter kit. That is why it&#x27;s called a starter kit, it doesn&#x27;t include EVERYTHING. Please read up on which product is best suited for your skin and hair type. Creme wax is made for sensitive skin and baby fine hair. Also, for those who complain that it didn&#x27;t remove any hair, apply wax in the direction of your hair growth, press the cloth strip over the wax and smooth firmly in the direction of your hair growth. Lastly, remove strip quickly opposite direction of hair growth. Do not let wax cool before removing strip, remove while still warm. One more thing.. NEVER reapply wax to already waxed skin as it will cause burns. The wax not only removes hair but exfoliates as well, leaving you with sensitive new skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read all instructions before using to prevent disasters.</li>
            <li> It has to be on for at least4-6 hours to get the wax at perfect temperature. The wax that comes with it isnt all that great.</li>
            <li> This product is really easy to use. I don&#x27;t think all of the bottles that come with it are really needed--just the pre-waxing one and the cooling gel. You will need some baby powder if you are doing bikini waxes and olive oil or something like that to help remove the wax that is left over.</li>
            <li> This is a very good waxer.  Having 3 girls, I couldn&#x27;t afford to get their eyebrows waxed at a salon every 3 weeks and tweezing took forever and was painful.  The directions are easy to understand. After one use it has paid for itself. Baby oil is a must for getting the excess wax off after waxing.</li>
            <li> I spent over 60 dollars on waxing kit and it hardly works. i was very dissapointed with the quality of the product</li>
            <li> This product is exactly how it sems. No more paying others to wax the brows and elsewhere. Very simple and easy to use. Comes with everything needed.</li>
            <li> The heat temperature of the wax was at low when I started to slow down on the wax then all of a sudden the wax bubbled which I&#x27;ve never seen before then exploded everywhere. Needless to say, I had to clean off the soft wax everywhere in my bathroom. Is this normal?</li>
            <li> Awesome kit for the price, make sure you order right the right wax for what your waxing, I wanted to use for the nose and maybe I just heated it to high but the wax it comes with is fantastic for regular waxing, there is a video on YouTube for other waxing and instructions on which wax to buy.</li>
            <li> Works well and has enough supplies to begin waxing right away.</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail yesterday and my lady was excited to use it.  We&#x27;ve been paying at a salon for about 6 months now but at $200 a visit (we both get waxed and try to give a generous tip) and it adds up fast.  ~$40 for a DIY experiment didn&#x27;t seem like a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our kit came well packaged in a nice box.  The instruction manual was easy to understand but mostly we were going on what we learned from the nice lady who usually does it for us in addition to the very helpful advice in the reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to get the [[ASIN:B0030ZRS9I GiGi All Purpose Honee, 14-Ounces]] because it got good reviews and it looked the most like what got used on us at the spa.  In addition we got a [[ASIN:B0000VLETU Ateco Small Sized Straight Spatula 4 1/2\\&quot; x 3/4\\&quot;]] because it looked the most like the spatula that they used at the spa and it was a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other things we ended up using are rubbing alcohol and scentless baby oil both of which we already had at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steps we took:&lt;br /&gt;1)  put some towels on the bed in case I got clumsy and dripped wax where I wasn&#x27;t supposed to&lt;br /&gt;2)  put Honee wax in warmer, plug in and set to high as instructed and set a timer for 12 min (instructions recommend 10-15)&lt;br /&gt;3)  clean area using rubbing alcohol&lt;br /&gt;4)  apply a little scentless baby oil to the area so that the wax doesn&#x27;t irritate or stick to the skin too much - not too much or else the wax won&#x27;t stick to the hairs as well&lt;br /&gt;5)  turn down the heater&lt;br /&gt;6)  use cleaned spatula to apply the wax in the direction of the hairs (we started with an underarm)&lt;br /&gt;7)  apply muslin strip and rub firmly to make sure it sticks well&lt;br /&gt;8)  tear away quickly in direction away from the direction the hairs are growing in holding the skin tight to avoid / minimize bruising and irritation&lt;br /&gt;9)  repeat 6-8 until all the hair is gone in the area&lt;br /&gt;10) clean area again with rubbing alcohol&lt;br /&gt;11) apply a little more baby oilto moisturize&lt;br /&gt;12) try not to sweat for the rest of the day (or as long as possible)&lt;br /&gt;13) wait for wax to cool and then store, clean of spatula with hot water, rub baby oil on hands to remove wax (I have no idea why this works but it does) and then wash with warm soapy water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We learned at the spa that the most important thing is to moisturize and exfoliate in the days afterwards.  This does an incredible amount to prevent in grown hairs.  I can definitely attest to this since I&#x27;m lazy and wanted to see if it made a difference.  There is a substantial difference in the irritation and painful in grown hairs that occur without moisturizing and the smooth sailing that accompanies exfoliating and moisturizing.  We&#x27;re fans of [[ASIN:B002Y26RVI Banana Boat Aloe Vera Sun Burn Relief Gel, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]] , but I&#x27;m sure there are other products that would work just great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip is that it&#x27;s okay to apply the wax sparingly / thin.  It still works great.  I used very little and didn&#x27;t miss or break a single hair (at least that we could see).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few times we ever got waxed we&#x27;d take painkillers (ibuprofen worked best for us) 1/2 an hour before to reduce the pain and swelling, but we&#x27;re quite used to the feeling now so don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end this turned into a great success and we will be saving a ton of money.  I&#x27;ll still visit the spa to visit our teacher and since I&#x27;m not sure if I want to trust my eyebrows to a first timer, but the bills for waxing will be much lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll repeat a tip that I&#x27;ve read several times because I think it&#x27;s important.  If you&#x27;ve never been waxed before, go get it done by a professional.  It&#x27;s invaluable to know what you&#x27;re in for as far as pain goes as well as to watch technique.  Ask lots of questions about how to do it or why the professional is doing things the way s/he does.  It will give you the best chance of success at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product before and loved it. Just bought it again for a salon I&#x27;m running. It does get hot so it is very important to check the temp before putting on your face or anywhere else you plan on waxing. Works really good.</li>
            <li> I love love this product. I was skeptical at first based on the reviews but it&#x27;s really well worth it and I have no regrets. If the cream wax doesn&#x27;t work well for you, you can always get another wax. But the whole package is a steal. I love it and thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Gigi Mini Pro Waxing kit. As soon as my kit was delivered- I immediately opened it and started to set it up; I wanted to use it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction manual that is included is very informational and even provides examples as to how to wax (i.e. eyebrows, lip, chin, arms)- but does not provide instruction as to what certain parts (rest bars) are used for. I also looked on the GiGi website for instruction- they have a video tutorial (about 30 minutes long), which, although the quality of the video itself wasn&#x27;t that great, it was nice to see the waxing process itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the instruction manual, it kept referring to GiGi Powder? The powder is not included in this kit and has to be purchased seperately. The Creme Wax that is included worked fine for me as I was only waxing my eyebrows and lip..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included is a nice amount of muslin strips- I also trimmed down the strip I was going to be using to wax my upper lip as it was really wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the tools I used to help in the process:&lt;br /&gt;1. Scissors (to trim the muslin strips)&lt;br /&gt;2. Cotton Balls (to apply the before and after products)</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;pink\\&quot; type of wax included in the kit works best when heated to a lower temperature. It is generally a very sticky, stringy wax and if you don&#x27;t hold your skin tight and pull fast when removing the strips, it wont pull off clean, but might leave residue and won&#x27;t remove all the hair. Working in small areas works best. The wax tends to be more stringy when you try to get a large area at once. The kit does not come with body/skin wax remover which is really annoying, so make sure you order some in addition to the kit. Overall, the kit does what it is designed to do and is easy to use if you can deal with the mess. I would suggest an eppilator to those who are looking for a less messy method of hair removal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the wax that comes with the package but I tried twice to wax and it only made a huge sticky mess. It&#x27;s like the wax doesn&#x27;t stay hot enough even if I kept it covered.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed and am stuck with the product. I would say buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 5 uses, which I guess is still cheaper than going to the salon 5 times.  Will purchase a new unit, but not a Gigi.</li>
            <li> The product was just as described by seller and was received within the time stated. Thank You!</li>
            <li> I love it!! It&#x27;s so convenient &amp; easy to use. Plus, you have control of the shape of your brows!!</li>
            <li> This kit is exactly what i wanted, very simple and easy to use. The only suggestion is to buy wax off, it doesn&#x27;t come with it and its essential. You will have a sticky mess otherwise! I like the options of different sized applicators!</li>
            <li> works wonder heats up great</li>
            <li> Love love love my Gigi mini pro waxing kit!&lt;br /&gt;I set it on high for 25 minutes then down to low.&lt;br /&gt;The cream wax is hard to manipulate at first till you get the hang of it but I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It is very messy as everyone states but that&#x27;s when you&#x27;ve never worked with cream wax before. If it&#x27;s too hard for you just buy the hard wax!</li>
            <li> I had the same one at work, but this one never seems to melt correctly. The machine seems fine, but the wax it comes with never actually works. I am trained in waxing and no matter what i do, this wax will not pull off the hair.</li>
            <li> Every woman should have this.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter kit but I recommend buying more of the strips and applicators if you know you&#x27;re going to be doing a lot at first. Like others said it does not come with the powder or wax remover I bought both baby powder and baby oil and they work just fine.  I am not a huge fan of the cream wax that they sent, because it is very messy.... It works and does the job but i would like to get something less sticky and messy soon.</li>
            <li> The kit is awesome well worth the money! It came fast. Even my 16 year old knows how to  use it!</li>
            <li> The wife loved it works great came on time thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this kit primarily so that I could stop spending so much on professional Brazilian waxing.  The warmer works well, however it takes about 45 minutes to heat up the wax.  One thing that is nice about the warmer is that it has a control on it so that you can control the heat setting. It comes with applicator sticks, warmer collars and the cloth strips but not as many as the individual packets have. I would have rather bought the bulk packets so that I could have a supply.  The creme wax it comes with is horrible.  It sticks to your skin and is not effective at pulling all the hair off.  I had to do tiny little sections just to get a little hair off. If you are looking to do a bikini wax, this creme wax is definitely the wrong wax to use.  I spent an HOUR trying to do one and finally gave up.  I have never used something so messy and ineffective.  Also the kit comes with all these bottles of cremes and such that you don&#x27;t need and fails to give you the powder and wax remover that you do need.  If you are looking to purchase a kit, I would purchase everything separately.  Buy the warmer, the wax, the Pre-Hon lotion, the dusting powder, the wax remover, the strips, the collars, and the applicators separately.  Also this kit didn&#x27;t come with good instructions.  I had no idea how to use the applicator rest bars, and any idea what all the bottles of lotion and such were for and what order to apply them in.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit because I didn&#x27;t feel like paying $50 to my beautician every time I needed my legs waxed and I have to say it has already paid off (2mo. later). My legs are as smooth as always after a run to the spa. You do have to know what you&#x27;re doing tho; working the wax is not a science but it is a bit tricky at first. Once you get it tho, it&#x27;s real easy and results are excellent. So if you are not happy with the product I can assure you it&#x27;s not the product. You just need some more practice with it. I am curious to try other kinds of wax too.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife - at her request! Great gift, works well. She&#x27;s had no complaints so far. My only complaint is that for all the prep solutions and extras that come in the kit there&#x27;s no excess wax removal solution. GiGi sell a wax removal to get the excess off, but decided against putting it in this kit, puzzling. Still, a little Vaseline on a cotton bud will do the job.</li>
            <li> It was ok, messy, the waxing strips were bad cloth and flimsy. It was good in lots of ways but some ways not some much</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this kit.  I can wax myself and others whenever I want.  It&#x27;s so great that when I waxed my sister, she wanted one for herself, and now she has one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought this.  I was sick of paying $20 every two weeks to go to the salon.  Now I wax my eyebrows and upper lip at home and can do it as often as I want.  After reading the reviews of the creme wax that it comes with, I decided to buy the all purpose honee and used that instead.</li>
            <li> I really wanted beach ready legs this summer so I decided to give waxing a shot. After some on-line researching, I settled on this product (purchased locally at Sally&#x27;s) and a microwavable wax. I also experimented with the no strip wax. This is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The wax stays warm! No running back to the microwave to reheat it.&lt;br /&gt;The wax was easy to use, easy to rip off.&lt;br /&gt;You can use any type of oil to remove excess wax from skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If you get it on anything (carpet, bedding) expect it to be there awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already used one tin of the All-Purpose wax so I&#x27;ll be picking up some more soon. Some have mentioned what doesn&#x27;t come in the box. Well, they can&#x27;t put everything in it! I&#x27;d suggest, before a waxing session, make sure you have: Motrin (30 minutes before), Pre-Hon, Numbing Spray, Powder (cornstarch will work), lots of strips and spatulas, oil, cooling gel, mirror, towels, a good movie, and lots of patience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me about 2 hours to do a decent job on my legs. I&#x27;m hoping I can cut that down with more practice. Bottom line: my legs are smoother longer and the regrowth is thinner and finer. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Takes some practice but great for legs and underarms once you get he hang of it.  Still prefer to get it done preofessionally</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! I still have a ways to go before I am a full on pro at this. I mean I have areas with hair still on them but that is because I wasn&#x27;t all the uniform with my technique since this is my first time every using this, however, I will now be able to do this. It was awesome seeing the hair just come right off. I&#x27;ve tried kits in the past (microwavable ones) that just didn&#x27;t work and I always ended up taking huge bits of skin off or something but this doesn&#x27;t do that. It just removes the hair and that is that. I&#x27;m going to buy the 40 yard muslin roll and I think I will be all set. The only thing I can&#x27;t do is my own back but this product is great and it really works. I feel like I can do this now!!!! I would recommend having more muslin on hand because what comes in the kit isn&#x27;t enough if you are doing legs, arms, bikini etc... in one sitting. I would also recommend picking up some wax residue remover for the skin and pre clean to clean the skin off along with the oil that keeps the wax from sticking to the skin. I agree with others who said that stupid concealer is useless and that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Good luck!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed all the reviews on this kit complained about the wax. Well it is no wonder this wax doesn&#x27;t work with the muslin strips. For a cream wax you should use cloth strips not muslin. Muslin strips work best for honee waxes. This kit is expensive and doesn&#x27;t give you what you want. Get the warmer by itself. I went to a beauty supply store and I got the warmer, free honee wax, 100 free muslin strips, for 25 bucks. I got it at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store during their month of June sale. Don&#x27;t get the wax off btw it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as baby oil. Rubbing alcohol works for getting it off other surfaces. Make sure you get more collars!</li>
            <li> I am a beginner,just start to learn how to wax my eyebrow by myself. It&#x27;s easy for me to wax them. The lotion which come with are really nice.</li>
            <li> I seemed to be able to figure this out just fine - but problem with the pink &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; it never hardened! I left it on and heated up as isntructed, but when I went to use it it just remained sticky and never hardened. I will try to order the Honee wax and cross my fingers it works</li>
            <li> this product is just OK</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It does exactly as it claim to do. I love it, the hair comes off clean and smooth, just dont apply wax thickly. For a clean, smooth finish, apply a thin layer for waxing(the strip holds more firmly).</li>
            <li> I just used my Gigi Mini Pro on my upper lip today. It was life altering. When I think of the hundreds of dollars I&#x27;ve spent getting my upper lip waxed at a fancy salon all these years, it makes me sad that I haven&#x27;t found Gigi sooner. I was a bit apprehensive at first--I know how painful waxing the upper lip is, and I wasn&#x27;t looking forward to it, nor did I think I was \\&quot;professional\\&quot; enough to know how to wax, but I thought I would give it a go. I followed the simple heating instructions, used the prep lotion first, and applied the warm wax to one side of my lip. Pulled the strip taut, and yanked as fast as I possibly could. Voila! It was SO MUCH LESS painful than my salon waxes. I did both sides of my lip no prob, applied the soothing lotion on, and 20 minutes later it looks amazing. I don&#x27;t even have that cherry-red handle bar mustache I usually get at the salon after she&#x27;s finished with me. I will never go to a salon for upper lip waxing again!</li>
            <li> I love it, for the price of this you can wax your eyebrows 5 times and it pays for itself.</li>
            <li> I would like to provide feedback regarding the Gigi wax i used. it removed my hair for sure but i still have wax leftovers on my skin, i spent 4-5 hours removing the wax leftovers but i failed.. i spend the whole night awake.. I also got allergic and now i have red marks all over my body..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what kind of wax it was, i have always used wax my entire life, and i have never faced this kind of problem.</li>
            <li> Like others have mention, the wax is to thin and does not remove course hair properly. I still have to use tweezers. It&#x27;s works pretty good on fine facial hair. The muslin strips are not good quality either.  I will be trying another brand of wax before I decide on electrolysis. Laser was costly and the hair still grew back.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed that this kit didn&#x27;t include the pre epilation powder..however it has a lot of products for post epilation to condition the skin.I find that this wax isn&#x27;t as strong as the regular wax but that makes it great for sensitive areas like eyebrows and under arms..the warmer works well and everything included in the kit is good quality and the instruction manual is easy to follow. All in all its a great bundle for such a low price.</li>
            <li> was a gift for our granddaughter, not sure how she likes it</li>
            <li> Great deal for the cost. Works wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great kit, my only complaint would be that they should include wax remover.</li>
            <li> In general it is ok! It takes a long time to warm up. The wax is very sticky and it&#x27;s easy have a big mess</li>
            <li> Wow this was amazing will shop again thank you</li>
            <li> the lid was broken...totally in half&lt;br /&gt;Wish I would have opened it earlier them I could have sent it back</li>
            <li> The heater and the strips is excellent, the wax isn&#x27;t.  I got the one for sensitive skin. I had every intention to put this to use and get my money worth out of it.  However when I used it the wax was way too sticky and unmanageable.  I still have issues doing eyebrows with it.  I tried doing the bikini area once with it and I won&#x27;t try it again with this wax.  I did got to school for cosmetology so I do have a clue to what I am doing.</li>
            <li> THE GIGI MINI PRO PROFESSIONAL EPILATION KIT IS WONDERFUL.  THE WAX WARMER IS VERY COMPACT, SO IT DOESN&#x27;T TAKE UP MUCH SPACE AND IT IS ALWAYS AT A COMFORTABLE TEMPERATURE, IT DOES NOT GET TOO HOT. THE CREME WAX LEAVES YOUR SKIN FEELING GREAT, ALL OF THE LOTIONS AND ACCESSORIES MAKE THIS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT FOR BEGINNERS AND SEASONED PROFESSIONALS.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter kit - I appreciated the tips in previous reviews about needing  baby powder and wax off.  Needing wax off  is an understatement!  The wax is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life . . . to get it off me (everywhere else is another story) it took the wax off, and several rub downs with olive oil, and then a shower to be completely free of residue.  I really think that the particular wax that comes with this kit is particularly awful.  I threw it out and am looking forward to using the kit with a better wax.  I didn&#x27;t have much use for any of the other little bottles of stuff that came with the kit (except the sure clean, which I used most of in my first clean up!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if I had it to do again, I would just  buy the wax warmer,  a GOOD wax, &amp; the linen strips separately.  And use baby powder and safflower oil from the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck!  I love the waxing effects (softness, no stubble, no daily shaving . . . . but, it does hurt like ____!)</li>
            <li> Wax that came with kit was horrible. Left half the hair and was very harsh on the skin. Went and bought a different kind of wax, and is much better now.</li>
            <li> The warmer itself is great.  Does exactly what it says.  I like that you can adjust the temp.  I got the wax for sensitive skin, I should have gotten the regular.  This wax is very \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; unfortunately does not pull out the hair as effectively.  My purchase was delivered very quick.  I do love some of the creams that came with it, I would not have purchased them separately, but now I will buy a few of them.</li>
            <li> This is the best waxing product I have ever used. It is very economical and easy to use. I used to use wax I heated in the microwave and then they discontinued my favorite brand so I decided to try gigi and I am so happy I did. It sets up easily and the honee is fantastic. This is a great price too. It takes some experience to use though but if your already using warm wax its just as easy.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this for her birthday.  Although I have not seen it, she is very pleased and feels she has enough of the product to last a long time.</li>
            <li> WOW! That sums it up. I received my kit today and as most people do with new items, I opened it right away and prepared to use it. I prepped my area with baby oil, baby powder, scissors, paper towels and a mirror. My goal today was facial waxing. I ordered the Gigi Facial Honee along with this kit because of some of the other reviews concerning the creme wax. (On a side note, my cousin informed me this morning she LOVES the creme wax for her face). I stuck with the honee for today though. Everything was so easy to set up and use. The wax took about 20 minutes to heat (instructions say heat 15-25 minutes on high then drop to low.) I cleaned the area with the cleaner they provided (not gonna buy a refill but since it came with the kit I used it). After a few minutes of prepping myself mentally (these things always tend to have something go wrong) I began waxing on my upper lip. !!!!!!!!! It was the most painless waxing experience I have ever had!!!!!!! And it pulled every single hair out. I followed the instructions and applied immediate pressure. Then wiped off any residual wax with the baby oil and applied the post cooling gel (BTW - this is just aloe vera, save some money and buy a big bottle from Wal-Mart). There was a little stinging at first with the cooling gel but it went away quickly. I immediately thought since it was stinging it would get really red. No more than usual. (An hour later it was gone). So naturally I continued to wax everything else. It was painless and easy. The rest bars that come with the kit are a little difficult to work with. I noticed some reviews where people weren&#x27;t sure what they&#x27;re for. They&#x27;re to rest the applicator stick on when you&#x27;re not using it so you don&#x27;t get wax everywhere. They stand up easily but also fall down easily. I used to try the wax strips by sally Hansen or Nair and they always ripped my skin off. I don&#x27;t have time to go to a salon every 2-3 weeks to get my lip waxed. I will never do either of those things again.This is the most economical, painless, easy way there is.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I can not explain how much i love it. It heats up in just 15 minutes and does the job very well. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more and the price is right. Everything that is inside of the kit one can makes use of. There is a booklet (instructions manual) inside that guides you through first timers waxing. The product came with a 14 oz wax and it is made for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; but let me tell you it works so well and does the job. I am in love with my waxing kit :) I would def. suggest anyone to buy this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with the wax off product which is necessary to take off the wax that comes with the kit... Really sticky and it won&#x27;t come out of clothes so carefull</li>
            <li> Good and professional machine works as same as salon waxing. I enjoy using it and it is very easy and simple to use. The warmer is great.</li>
            <li> Mine came in good condition except the plastic lid was cracked because it was placed upside down in the box. The only thing I would say is that the wax is very runny ... unless you can learn to manipulate that well you should probably go for the hard wax this brand offers. I use it to wax my eyebrows, upper lip and under arms and it works awesome</li>
            <li> Very nice kit, but I won&#x27;t be using it again. My skin was very irritated and it ripped some skin off in a few areas. The wax is extremely sticky. You can barely get it off of your skin.</li>
            <li> Ok so Waxing can be messy, I get that, however this is THE worst! I have used wax kits before and didn&#x27;t have so much mess! Not to mention the strips that supplied are awful! I decided i wanted to return this item b/c it is so horrible, well guess what YOU CAN&#x27;T!! Way to go AMAZON!!! Thanks for that tip when i purchased it! My loyalty as a frequent Amazon customer just may come to end! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one!</li>
            <li> I must be doing something wrong with this aweful pink wax!  It doesn&#x27;t harden at all to stick hair to strip.  I pull the strip off and am left with a gunky mess on my face!  Please HELP!</li>
            <li> Works well with some areas of the body but I wish it worked a little better. Doesn&#x27;t feel good having to rewax the same spot to remove hair</li>
            <li> This product is good...but SO MESSY AND STICKY! Whenever I use it, it gets everywhere! Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m new at this, but I can&#x27;t seem to pull off all of the hair either. Maybe buying different papers would work instead of the ones provided? I kind of wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this... I&#x27;d rather pay the 30 bucks at the salon every time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried to wax myself before and I thought..well, let&#x27;s try with this waxing kit..seems nice!!.  I actually loved it.  The presentation is good and it really works...is not that painful. I just needed a couple of practices and that was it...I&#x27;m now an expert.</li>
            <li> what she wanted, sorry i am not a wordy person that goes on and on and on and on and on</li>
            <li> Warmer is fine, wax is terrible.  Buy the all purpose honee wax if you want optimal results.  Also kit doesn&#x27;t include two of the most important products - surface cleaner to remove wax from counter and wax removing solvent for skin</li>
            <li> The is good but not great, because you have to play with the temperature and you may get it wrong. It&#x27;s better to have a warmer with a single temperature setting. If you&#x27;re buying a wax kit you should choose a version with different strips and different wax. The wax here is like a cream, it gets really liquid and it&#x27;s difficult to apply. It may also be due to the warmer setting issue. The strips are cloth, and when the wax is liquid it gets through it. I should have chosen the version with honey or hard wax and paper strips. Now I know for next time.</li>
            <li> Not enough fabric comes with the kit, it ran out too soon, but the wax and product is amazing.  Love it, and will save a ton of money over the years by not paying others to do the waxing.</li>
            <li> Use this kit religiously. Good buy</li>
            <li> The kit itself is great and comes with almost everything you need. I think the only thing missing is wax remover. The directions are decent, but I still haven&#x27;t figured out what the little metal bar things are for. As far as actually waxing - it takes a lot of practice to get it right. Be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: I moved and placed the kit into its original box inside a larger box and put it in the uhaul. I made sure to put the lid on the container of wax on very tightly so nothing would spill. The inside of the truck got pretty warm during the move and the wax looks like it exploded from the heat. Everything is covered. I&#x27;m hoping baby oil can get it cleaned up. Probably best to keep this away from summertime heat.</li>
            <li> This has no stick. As soon as I peel it off, I notice it took absolutely no hairs off! It&#x27;s a mess but it&#x27;s expected, what wasn&#x27;t expected was the failure of this product. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a month ago and finally had the time to use it.  It was easy enough to use, and the results, where I put the wax, worked.  I&#x27;m not sure why so many people complain about removing the wax.  I used one of the creams that came with the kit (sorry, I forget which one I used, but it was what was recommended in the instruction manual), and the leftover wax came right off.  People say it&#x27;s messy.  I didn&#x27;t find it all that messy as long as you aren&#x27;t putting a big glob of wax on the stick and trying to put the wax somewhere difficult like the jawline.  Use a little wax at a time, and it works great.  For the amount that I used on my cheeks, I won&#x27;t need to buy any more wax for quite some time, and the pain was minimal.</li>
            <li> The wax that came with it is HORRIBLE.  So I just went out and got the honey kind.  Other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> Takes almost an hour to heat up.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. A great product and very inexpensive. It last forever and doesn&#x27;t leave much of a mess.</li>
            <li> Fabulous kit! Heats up the wax in like 20 mins for me, maybe even less. I love the creme wax that comes with this kit, and bought other types but didn&#x27;t like them as much. Perfect start up.</li>
            <li> Arrived on estimated arrival date.  Perfect condition and better than I anticipated.  I am very happy to have ordered through this company.  I use this Professional Kit at home, but remember I am a professional.  Great deal for the price.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> WOW! I read all the reviews and bought this product with not a little trepidation because even the most positive reviews stated that doing a bikini wax on yourself was challenging. I can say definitively that THIS system is the easiest AND most painless bikini wax I&#x27;ve EVER done on myself! First of all, I&#x27;ve been waxing myself with NADS and I thought that was the best it could get for a do-it -yourself home kit. WAS I EVER WRONG!!! My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy this kit YEARS ago instead of enduring the pain and poor results of using NADS or shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok - enough raving- here are the specifics of what I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The pre-wax oil completely protects the skin, helps reduce discomfort during waxing, and leaves the skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;2. The wax leaves hardly ANY stubble. And, let me add, this was my first bikini wax since well before I gave birth 6 weeks ago- I hadn&#x27;t been able to wax for at least 3 mos prior b/c I couldn&#x27;t see over my baby belly.&lt;br /&gt;3. The wax pulls off the skin EXACTLY as described in the tutorial DVD. Almost NO RESIDUE!&lt;br /&gt;4.To reiterate other reviews - YOU DON&#x27;T NEED STRIPS WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;5.The entire process is SO EASY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok - cons- honestly, I can&#x27;t think of any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this is a hard wax product and what little residue remains does not come off easily without using the GIGI oil remover. I mention this only because I don&#x27;t think that particular product comes as part of the kit. It must be purchased separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line-this is a WONDERFUL product! I can do my own bikini wax and save money and time!</li>
            <li> Everything seemed great but when I used it...not sure if it was the wax or the strips, but did not remove hair.  what a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Great product, great instruction, very professional for the home</li>
            <li> Horrible product. I revived it with the lid cracked. The wax is way to sticky and doesn&#x27;t come off all the way. Even with the creams and stuff that came with it. It says it works on sensitive skin and my skin completely broke out. Hives and bumps. This was not fun.</li>
            <li> The pink wax it comes with does not remove hair well at all and is really rough on the skin. I get waxed often and salons and ihaveno allergies nor do I have sensitive skin but it irritated my skin the wax would not fully come off or remove the hair and I&#x27;m sure my hair was long enough. Do notusethewax it comes with. Use clear honey colored wax preferably the brazillian one where you don&#x27;t need strips. It was a big painful mess</li>
            <li> We love this waxer! I&#x27;m purchasing our 2nd one today. We purchased our last one in 2010 and it has lasted until this year after being used several times a month by three women! It has paid for itself several times over in how much we have saved over the years. I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Loved it Just like the one at school</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this item.  The &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; is basically a pick stick tree sap.  It sticks to everything, gets everywhere and is impossible to remove.  When I used the wax, it pulled off layers of skin and left bloody sores on my skin.  Not advised for any use!</li>
            <li> When I opened the package the top of the machine was cracked in 3 different places.. I did get a full refund though and it does work good</li>
            <li> GiGi mini kit is great ,  professional, space saving wax warmer ,easy to use ,good size and has lotions and accessories included</li>
            <li> I have received this item, but unfortunately, it has been broken. I decided to exchange it, but the policy is to refund the money. In my opinion, it is good because it includes everything at one box. I will buy a new one soon.</li>
            <li> Great wax kit, Gigi is what we used in my salon. I would buy again. It would be nice if there were more strips.</li>
            <li> Not True. This product did not work at all.</li>
            <li> Love! Easy to use, comes with SO much stuff!</li>
            <li> I just hate this wax .... It smells so yuck and sticks to ur body even after two or three washes... my room becomes mess whenever i use it ..</li>
            <li> Wax had leaked when I got it. The entire package was a mess. Problem was I didn&#x27;t open it for 2 months after I purchased so i couldn&#x27;t return. I tried to notify seller to no avail. I would steer clear!</li>
            <li> warmer is good but wax cream is not good its like a chewgum its stick to skin nd i find  difficulty  to remove it  and other things wth ths useless</li>
            <li> More for salon use instead of personal use. Larger than it looks and definitely larger than I expected, up too much counter space. Not a fan of the cream wax but I guess if you are then this is for you.</li>
            <li> I love this kit! It&#x27;s very professional and works like a charm. Try not to spill any on the outter casing though, it&#x27;s a major pain to clean up. It doesn&#x27;t come with wax remover, I had to buy that at Salley&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This kit is great, since it come with everything you need to get started. The indicator light really helps to let you know when the wax is ready to be used. I would recommend buying extra muslin, since the kit only comes with a certain amount. I bought the large roll to do my legs, but there is enough in the kit to do your eyebrows a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must give you a warning. If you store the wax in the warmer make sure you keep it level! I have ruined two warmers during a move by leaving the wax in the warmer and then accidentally storing it in an unlevel area. The wax will run out and get everywhere! I didn&#x27;t want to turn it on to melt the wax, since I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would start a fire or short out.&lt;br /&gt;This was my fault, so it still gets 5 stars. I just wanted to warn you. :)</li>
            <li> I ripped an entire layer of skin off my cheek when first using this.  The wax included should only be used by someone who knows what they are doing.  I was used to using hard wax without strips.  There is definitely a learning curve to this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Wonderful price! :)</li>
            <li> The wax does not work well if it gets too hot and to liquid it doesn&#x27;t pull anything off when using the strips and the wax goes through the thin strips it comes with so it leaves my fingers all sticky. Maybe buying a different brand of wax would work and strips.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really rate the product as this was a gift.  However, I have not heard any complaints.</li>
            <li> Works great but amber dome came in pieces probably due to packaging.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in good time.  However, when it was opened on Christmas and used for the first time, the lid on the hot wax was very difficult to remove and my daughter ended up getting wax all over her hands which was very difficult to remove. We are guessing that the item was stored upside down in a hot truck for delivery and the wax melted and stuck firmly to the lid. The lid had to be discarded due to damage it received to remove it. Other than this problem, the product was in good working order.</li>
            <li> I am still getting used to the wax process. But, it is simple (my 9 year old helps me). Too exited, I am yet to read the book.  But it has more things that they use at beauty salon.  Before waxing, and after.  I feel like this is the best I could have done for myself in order to save money.</li>
            <li> This is just like the one my salon uses. It is so nice to be able to use this at home. Wish the kit came with a little wax off product.</li>
            <li> My first experience waving with Gigi, was interesting. I didn&#x27;t expect the product to be so messy and hard to remove I will continue to try to improve but I how this product gets easier to use over time</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this! This is the exact same kit my hairdresser has to do her waxes with. It has everything you need for before and after you wax.</li>
            <li> Its just what they said. I love this product, you have to know how use it, but Its not complicated, juts follow the instructions</li>
            <li> this product arrived on time, in great condition, and i used it as soon as i got it out of the box! everything was included. all the lotions, strips, sticks, and was. it even came with an instruction manual. very nice i was not disappointed. 5 stars! :)</li>
            <li> I like it but a little messy. Perfect for face but not bikini. Comes with creams also. Great product. Lana</li>
            <li> SO GREAT for hair removal! - I would recommend getting the almond wax removing oil though because the kit doesn&#x27;t come with anything like that and you want to be able to take it off if you make a mistake without ripping off your whole eyebrow. This works really well on my hair I use it on my legs, arms, and face mostly - I&#x27;m white I have fairly fine hair though so I don&#x27;t know how well it would work on a thicker haired lady or someone with different ethnicity. Don&#x27;t know how other women&#x27;s hair is.</li>
            <li> I love this kit! It comes with a lot of useful stuff but I&#x27;m not sure how to use half of them lol. The waxing strips are strong and don&#x27;t tear easily when you pull. The wax is really nice too it&#x27;s for sensitive skin which is great of you tend to swell a lot like I do. Over all it was a great purchase and I&#x27;d fortunately buy another one</li>
            <li> This product was so bad.  The wax was stuck to the lid.  It was very hard to remove.  Once applying the wax, and removing with the muslin sheets, muslin particles adhered to my face.  Cache would not accept my return and sent it back saying it needed an RMA #.  The supposedly sent an email on November 23, which I did not received.  Anyone dealing with Cache, please don&#x27;t.  If you are dissatisfied with the product, the only way to return it is unopened.  How do you know what the product is like if you do not open the box and try it.  I am having this investigated.  I am really disgusted with this company.  Do not purchase anything unless you intend to keep it.</li>
            <li> this is a great starter kit for a professional or home use, just be sure you know how to properly wax if you aren&#x27;t a professional you can really hurt yourself.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this.  I thought this was too good to be true, as the price under 40 bucks seemed unreal for what you get.  This same kit is sold from other retailers  for much much more.  GET THIS.  YOU WILL NEED more wax strips before you know it and you will need to buy wax remover also.</li>
            <li> it came with the plastic cap in two pieces...very poor equipment....dont like the wax that comes with it....dont like this product at all....i willl just put it in the garbage....</li>
            <li> Everything is good, but this wax in particular is way to sticky and seeps through the canvas strips so it gets all over your fingers in the process. However, it washed off pretty easily, so over all I give it 4 stars</li>
            <li> Nice personal unit; takes practice to do correctly</li>
            <li> I love this waxing kit! But when it was delivered to me the lid to the waxing pot was broken :(</li>
            <li> Thank you very much, it&#x27;s excellent</li>
            <li> The pot works great , the wax they give you with it&lt;br /&gt;sUCks</li>
            <li> Got for a gift and they love it</li>
            <li> Good one, I like it, I am using it since one year no issues yet, I can recommend it ...</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my best friend as a birthday gift since she was going to school for cosmetology.  She absolutely loves it!  She uses it all the time on clients and is always telling me how it was one of the best birthday gifts she&#x27;s received in a long time.</li>
            <li> Get product, just like the professionals. You will need to get other strips from like Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try out this warmer system.  I am very unhappy about my arms and bought this primarily to wax them in the privacy of my own home.  I am a girl and I have PCOS which cause me to have darker unwanted hair.  I works, I really like the results.  I can&#x27;t wait ti get other wax to fine tune the process.</li>
            <li> This waxing kit is great! I love the cream wax much better than the regular honey wax. My legs didn&#x27;t even get red after I waxed them! I would have liked it even more if a wax removal cream was included, (I had to use coconut oil to remove the excess wax instead) but otherwise I would definitely recommend this kit with the cream wax!</li>
            <li> Works great and was perfect for the home use. My hubby doesn&#x27;t like going in the mall in public to get done and his grow so much faster than mine that I would have to go with him to the nail shop more often so he could get them done in private room. This is much better!</li>
            <li> Pleased with my purchase. I would not have bought a few of the tiems like the collars, and the spatula rest if they had not come with the kit, but I really like them. The liquids don&#x27;t really seem necessary, but saved me trying whole bottles and then finding them not necessary. Muslin cloth? NEVER what a mess! Wax seeps right through. Buy the non woven strips. They go pretty far.</li>
            <li> I use the wax for my legs, under arms etc. and I love it! However the wax that it brings is not good. You should go to Sallys to purchase your own wax. I recommend a honey one. I bought the wax machine a few months ago, and still have a ton of waxing strips left :)</li>
            <li> Daughter uses this to no end. Wax is a bit messy, drips all over if not careful, but over all it is a good product, perfect for intended use</li>
            <li> I love the Gigi Waxing kit. The lotions that it comes I don&#x27;t really use, but the heating machine works well! I also like that the products are easily found on amazon.</li>
            <li> I like official WAX much better. This stuff was really runny and didn&#x27;t do as good a job as regular wax. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Sally Hanson wax worked much better for me. I have coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I love it... very professional and clean&lt;br /&gt;That is what i need... Now im ready for waxed :-) very good</li>
            <li> Thanks for this WONDERFUL product i use it all the time</li>
            <li> I love this product. YES, beware of the wax and try not to get it on anything around the area, such as sinks, floors. If you do get the wax on the area, &amp;#34;De-Solv-it&amp;#34; a contractors&#x27; solvent, works well to take off. Now, for the skin, and areas other than the waxing spot....not quite sure. Some say mineral oil. Not sure. I&#x27;m going to STOP waxing for now, until I find something that really works in taking the excess off of my skin. This will save me $$$$$ at the spa!!! However, I won&#x27;t be brave enough to try it on brows. I&#x27;ve done my face, bikini line (wear underwear to prevent getting it on hair you do not want to rip out), and my arms.</li>
            <li> received this item yestarday, the lid ( red colour) is broken. trying to figure out how to return this . such a big headache.</li>
            <li> I even can do it by myself, at least my legs, just buy extra fabric because seem like is too many but you will expend it all</li>
            <li> My parents bought the same kit as a Christmas gift and unfortunately was tipped on it&#x27;s side with wax in it. :/ I decided to just order another one, considering the price. My parents paid around a hundred bucks for it at the local Sally&#x27;s, and I got it for way less on Amazon. It&#x27;s worth $100 anyways, In my opinion. I wax my eye brows everyone 2-3 weeks and at $12 a pop at the local shop, it pays for it&#x27;s self in no time. Come to find out, after cleaning the old one, it works perfectly fine which I gifted to my younger sister, SCORE! NOTE: Use the Dark Honee for thicker hair like underarm, legs or bikini. Also buy the wax remover when ordering this product. If not, you&#x27;ll be sticky!</li>
            <li> I will save so much money with this. Although idk how to use it fully yet, just for the face aspect I really like it:)</li>
            <li> Only buy if you know what you&#x27;re doing. I ripped off a tad bit of skin because I&#x27;ve NEVER been to a professional waxer and had no idea what I was doing. It was nothing serious... buy at your own risk. I ended throwing the whole thing out and getting  professional laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> I love my waxing kit.  I&#x27;m new to waxing (doing it myself that is), but I couldn&#x27;t pass up the price on this kit.  It was about the same price as getting waxed at my salon (I only do face waxing - eyebrows/lip).  The instruction book was wonderful.  I haven&#x27;t used all the different bottles of pre/post-wax stuff, but I do love the cooling gel and the slow grow oil.</li>
            <li> I opened the box and wax was EVERYWHERE. Plus, it doesnt come with &amp;#34;wax off&amp;#34; so I had to scrub my hands and table for way too long! Ugh! So inconvenient!</li>
            <li> Love it ! Quick and easy to use</li>
            <li> I like the set the only thing is that the wax needs to be on for a long time for it to melt properly</li>
            <li> I bought the GiGi Mini Pro Waxing Kit as a starter for my at-home waxing alternative to paying the big bucks at the salon. The kit offered a lot of product at a good deal money-wise. I got all of the basic necessities: wax, wax warmer, spatulas, and then some. However, when I used the products as recommended, it only broke the hair off--leaving stubble. The kit comes with soft wax for sensitive skin, so maybe that wax wasn&#x27;t right for what I was doing. Overall, I was impressed by the deal but dissappointed by its use.</li>
            <li> i absolutely loved this wax set... i was a first time user... and i never waxed my own eyebrows cause i was too scared, but i had someone wax them for me... and i waxed all the other places.... i was so amazed at having my own wax kit and it had everything in it.... like a complete set...</li>
            <li> This kit comes with a lot but first timers shouldn&#x27;t buy it. The instruction book that it comes with is not entirely detailed. You have to have a little background knowledge before you can start waxing. Also, for those who don&#x27;t like using soft wax, don&#x27;t get this kit since it comes with it. I prefer hard wax over soft, but I just ended up buying a tub of hard wax before I checked out. Other than that, this kit is relatively easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my daughters, and they love it.&lt;br /&gt;Save money and time dong it themselves. Plus&lt;br /&gt;it works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using GiGi waxes for years, and the pink wax this comes with is the best for my sensitive skin. The only gripe I have is that the wax strips it comes with are terrible. The wax goes straight through them. Also, the post wax concealer is pretty useless. I don&#x27;t think it would ever match any human skin tone. But overall, it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> very bad it stuck to my daughter  skin and pilled the skin off. she have round marks on her hand.</li>
            <li> The price was Great and the product is amazing. Nothing makes a customer feel better than getting a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> love, love ,love this! it works great, and saves me a lot of money, I have 2 teenage girls and we all wax, so rather than go to the salon now we can do it at home any time we need to!</li>
            <li> The warming unit took some time to get to the correct temperature but otherwise it was fine.  Would have liked to have more sticks included.  A good product for touch ups.</li>
            <li> I love it - just need a little more practice. Recommended purchase</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my sister in law for Christmas . She told me it works great but she definitely needs more practice. At least her first attempt was on her arm and not one her eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li> The warmer and waxing supplies are great. A lot of the lotions included aren&#x27;t really necessary, I can do without the cleanse lotion &amp; concealer.  Wish they included baby oil (or something to remove wax) instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax that is included with the kit is best used on your legs or back. It&#x27;s very sticky and gets everywhere if you don&#x27;t peel correctly. If you&#x27;re waxing armpits I would highly recommend you buy GIGI Brazilian Hard Wax instead, it&#x27;s much easier to use.</li>
            <li> This wax pot is awesome. We are beginners and have had great success with it. Easy to use and actually painless. Would be nice to see this bundled with hard wax as well but the supplied soft wax is more than enough. My only concern is that my girlfriend might like it too much!</li>
            <li> The warmer is great and the accessories package is nice but the wax is horrible!  I used it once and threw it away and bought honey wax.</li>
            <li> After trying several drugstore types of waxing kits available and experiencing never-ending frustration we decided to give this a try. We have been able to wax any areas we so desire and it works! Definately worth it! So glad to finally get a great home product with professional results!&lt;br /&gt;As always, shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> Works good but wish it got hotter.  Only issue is that it take too long to heat up.  Other than that it&#x27;s a good buy.  Bought this as a gift and my friend says she still goes to the salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li> This set is awesome! I&#x27;ve been paying to have my face waxed almost monthly for 10 + yrs . This set came with enough supplies to last me for a very long time even if I waxed once a month. The price is an extra bonus and I am very happy I finally ordered it! I should add that I am a broke college student with four kids so before I buy anything extra I read a lot of reviews and really hope that when I make a purchase I won&#x27;t get ripped off with a cheap product, and I can honestly say that my highest expectations were made!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! So much came with it! This is all you need for an at-home wax.</li>
            <li> Great kit, works really well.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product for any waxer. I have never wax before and I felt it was easy to use and a great price!</li>
            <li> I always seem to need a quick waxing two hours before we go somewhere.  I have been a licensed climatologist for over 50+ years so I feel confident about doing this myself.  Love this product and have for years.</li>
            <li> just amazing! highly recommend and a great cheap buy! Has everything it shows and works very well. totally worth your money!!!!</li>
            <li> Beware of broken merchandise. I needed this warmer for practice while in esthetics school. When it arrived the lid was broken into pieces. Since I needed it ASAP I did not return the item. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had an hour of free time and decided to use this to wax pretty much my entire face- side burns, upper lip, eye brows. The wax is great. I do agree that half of the bottles are useless and that it should have come with powder, and wax-off, but other than that, pretty good deal. The first time I used this, it was a hot mess. I got wax everywhere, including the counter, my hands, everywhere! I learned that you need to take only a small tiny tiny amount of wax on your spatula and it becomes mess free. I also didn&#x27;t cut up the muslin strips, which is highly recommended so there isn&#x27;t a lot of waste. All in all, great product. Despite the fact that I still don&#x27;t get what those metal bars are for? I&#x27;d recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast looks nice 4stars cause the lid cover was broken when arrived. Other than that seems to be ok</li>
            <li> my daughter really likes this and it does a good job</li>
            <li> Very messy and not easy to use,</li>
            <li> Everything worked great.</li>
            <li> just wish the set came with honey wax instead of cream wax which is so runny and not good for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think people write negative reviews just for the sake of it. Giving a product less stars because you didn&#x27;t read the product description properly or don&#x27;t understand how to use it makes no sense. Especially not for a product like this. This warmer kit is actually a GREAT product at a great value. And despite being labelled as a &#x27;pro kit&#x27; it comes with written instructions (which I admit I didn&#x27;t really read) and an instructional (kinda) dvd. The warmer itself is very straight forward and easy to use. Kit comes with more or less all you need including a few collars. As for the question of how to use the &amp;#34;rest bars&amp;#34;, just drop them into your wax once it is melted (kit comes with 3 so you can probably just leave it there). I also bought a brazilian wax and an all-purpose honee, but I actually really like the creme wax that came with the kit, and it is really easy to work with (in my opinion). Personally my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy a double pot warmer. Right now in the process of deciding between getting an additional double or a second single. With three different types of wax, all of which I use at the same time (for different areas) it is a bit inconvenient to have to stop and wait for a second tin to melt. So if you know you also use more than one type you might want to take that into consideration. But if set on a single unit, this is a GREAT kit to invest in.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Has paid for itself in 2 uses.</li>
            <li> This is my first time waxing and buying my own products to wax. I used it on my face and I love it. It took about 30 minutes for the wax to melt but after that it was easy to apply and it wasn&#x27;t as painful as I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I used that didnt come with the kit were cotton balls, baby oil and powder. Baby oil and cotton balls to remove the wax off my face.&lt;br /&gt;The only way it would be messy is if you make it messy. I didnt put  any paper towels or hand towels down because I didnt plan to make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;I take that back.. I used a sheet of paper to put the used wax strips on for easier clean up but there was absolutely no mess.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone. I will no longer buy any shavers. Lol</li>
            <li> Great product at great price!</li>
            <li> WAX SUCKS DOESNT PULL OFF A HAIR, BEST BET IS TO GUY WAX FROM SALLYS BEAUTY SUPPLY</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Used for facial hair and eyebrows. It worked but it was very messy. Wax was so soft it dripped on the counter. Be sure to cover work area with a paper towel. Instructions included items not I. The kit (example: powder),</li>
            <li> but when I received this wax kit, I came to find the brown plastic lid which covers the wax container was broken. I will be exchanging it soon and will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on the other hand, the delivery on this item was very faster than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;the packaging seemed okay but I guess it couldn&#x27;t handle the scandal&lt;br /&gt;the items inside look of great quality, I really like that it holds a universal 14 oz wax container so I don&#x27;t have to buy a special kind of wax when I run out of gigis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everything that was shown in the picture is what I received&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;quite  honestly, the only disappointment I had was the broken lid, everything else was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try this product so I can leave a legit review</li>
            <li> Excellent set for waxing at home.  Cuts the cost of going to the salon. Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love the pro wax.  have course hairs and once done baby smooth :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for home use!</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to point out the lack of professionalism coming from Central Cosmetic and now, unfortunately from Amazon. It&#x27;s not possible from a serious company to take measures after almost two months. I paid for the product and I waited for almost two months to come...and it didn&#x27;t. They should have told me that they cannot respect their customers and I could have taken the product from another part and not waste two months from my time. I will try as much as possible for the future to avoid the services of Amazon and of course Central Cosmetics. I will instruct as much persons as I can to be very careful when buying from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second of all they said they will refund but they don&#x27;t refund all the sum paid....</li>
            <li> This is my third unit, the other two, people moved and spilled hot wax on the unit it self and made them a serious mess. Well I decided it was still easier on me and my skin to buy a new unit. The unit it self is still a good one, but this one has all kinds of creams and lotions for you skin, but that is not the best, cause I only use what doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, since I have sensitive skin. The new cream wax is FABULOUS. It was so easy to use and remove, so creamy, so nice, love it. I have never been good at this, so only did my mustache, maybe bikini line. With this I was able to do my whole face, love it, didn&#x27;t I already say that.</li>
            <li> The warmer itself works great, the wax however must go. I am used to using the Deplieve wax but wanted to give this a try after reading the reviews &amp; that it was for sensitive skin. My skin peeled for almost 2 weeks after the wax. The wax was quite thick and it was very hot so the temperature was not a factor in the thickness. I have yet to see if the deplieve wax fits in the Gigi but fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but didn&#x27;t like cream wax that came with would prefer honey wax and cloth in place of muslin. Can feel fax come through muslin often. And the he powder vs the other supplies such as after lotion I could do without!</li>
            <li> Product is great, however the lid was broken, I didn&#x27;t return it due to the lid, I just taped it together</li>
            <li> I was a little bit worried about the creme wax that came with the package, but I think it&#x27;s great! I did eyebrows, underarms and bikini. The cream worked great and was painless, even in the bikini area! I followed the heating instructions in the manual iand the wax was not too hot at all. I definitely recommend this! In one day this product has paid for itself!</li>
            <li> No more butt hair for me</li>
            <li> Good product loved it .</li>
            <li> I did not like the wax it came with</li>
            <li> Works grate (wife tells me )&lt;br /&gt;Does not have the wax remover! or the pre-powder!&lt;br /&gt;Directions tell you that you need it but this kid does not come with it</li>
            <li> This is really awesome and easy to use, especially for the price!  Two or three uses with this pays for itself!</li>
            <li> fantastic! works great and will save me money in the long run!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this wax pot for years and it still works great!! Came with all the supplies needed for at home waxing. Great price</li>
            <li> More items with it than expected!! Has everything! Excellent!</li>
            <li> The wax warmer works well. However I did not receive the PreHon lotion with my kit. Otherwise it was all it was advertised to be.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I purchased this item. I really don&#x27;t like shelling out $12 just to get my eyebrows waxed. So this little item comes in handy. I can do them when I want in the comfort of my own home. I really don&#x27;t like the smell of the cream wax, but it came with it so might as well use it. This little at home wax kit basically pays for it self.</li>
            <li> I tried to set up the warmer following the instructions that came with the product. I can&#x27;t even get the lid off the wax can. It is like glue. I got the wax on my fingers and immediately decided to return this product realizing this had been a big mistake. When I got on my orders page to return, I found out I cannot return the item as it is &amp;#34;hazardous materials.&amp;#34; Good to know since I was going to put this material on my face. A refund would be nice!</li>
            <li> This item was delivered with a broken lid and because it is a GiGi Mini Pro Waxing Kit that contains wax and lotions, I can&#x27;t return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazons policy is: \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was Sold by HASSLE-FREE through Amazon and I don&#x27;t even have an option on my orders page to contact them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I am stuck with a broken product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have a chance to actually use the product, I will come back and update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 8/15/2014 - The product itself works pretty good. My sister is a cosmetologist and she uses GIGI too. She recommended that this is the one to get for waxing. I contacted GIGI about where to purchase another lid and they sent me one for free. It took a few months to get it but I think their customer service rocks.</li>
            <li> Horrible reviews is simply because you do not know how to use the product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever use Gigi Creme Wax. Its seriously like glue--impossible to get off and makes a huge mess! Extremely unsatisfied!</li>
            <li> I have had this waxing kit for 10 years.  I am replacing it because my husband accidentally stored it on its side and the wax leaked all over the unit and cord.  I have saved a ton of money over the years waxing myself!  My last kit came with a how-to booklet full of waxing tips.  This kit pays for itself in one use, but definitely store it upright!</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  It comes with clear instructions, a good amount of product, and looks good.  It&#x27;s pretty good- plug it in/turn it on a little over an hour before you want to use it, and you have warm wax to get off your mustache or chin hairs quickly.  Definitely value for money, here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I only have one problem with the kit:  why the h*ll would the company include a wierd grayish-taupe concealer instead of baby powder?  You need the powder, and the concealer looks funky.  And smells like paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And GiGi forgot to include the oil to remove wax in places you&#x27;ve accidentally glopped it.  The one that&#x27;s included isn&#x27;t for your body, it&#x27;s for countertops and such.  GiGi makes one called \\&quot;Wax Off\\&quot; for the body, you can buy it here on Amazon.  It&#x27;s main ingredient is Mineral Oil, so if you have some at home you can skip the extra couple bucks. (BTW- you can use pretty much any oil- yes, even kitchen cooking oils- to remove the wax off your body. It might even be healthier, since mineral oil tends to clog the skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, In addition to the kit, you should have handy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Wax remover for the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Scissors to cut the muslin strips. (optional, but I found it useful)</li>
            <li> This home waxing kit gets the job done, and all in one package.  Lasts forever! My sister and I have shared the same one for 2 years and she recently moved away so I&#x27;ve had to buy my own.  It is by far the best home waxing kit that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I very much like the warmer, but the wax is just rotten. Plus it doesn&#x27;t come with the wax-off which is sorely needed with it!</li>
            <li> Just finished using GIGI cream wax. The warmer and the applicators are good. The wax is nothing but paint mixed with some glue. The wax is so bad and so sticky. Even after taking shower it doesn&#x27;t go off the skin. Didn&#x27;t use any of the other lotions that came with this. Probably they are another set of junk since we already have body lotions. I was about to put \\&quot;all purpose cleaner\\&quot; on my hands and read the instructions that it was only for Floor or Gigi warmer cleaning. The product would have worth with a better wax. And at the end, I noticed the wax container slightly got split at the bottom and leaked into the warmer - not a lot but a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get a good warmer anywhere then this product is not worth even to put 50 bucks.</li>
            <li> What a great product and a great deal!  I can now wax my chin and lip without paying someone every 5 weeks.  The product is very effective but sticky - you need to be careful not to get them on your fingers.  When I get brave enough I will wax my eyebrows....I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> great! just know what your doing! and must buy WAX OFF cuz it doesnt come with it!!!!</li>
            <li> The warmer is perfect! The wax not a favorite but ordered honey wax instead</li>
            <li> Works well. Product reviews were really helpful. The wax stayed kind of sticky when spreading in my opinion but did the job. This was after 2hrs of heating. Didn&#x27;t really get thin and clear as expected.</li>
            <li> I love it so nice everything. I needed it really didn&#x27;t hurt that much. It was like nice density as well.</li>
            <li> Great price! Easy to use, has everything you need to get started. All the products will last for quite sometime if you&#x27;re only using it for one person. Beats spending $10+ bucks at a salon.  It&#x27;s already paid for itself.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER pay $12 for an eyebrow wax again even if my life depended on it! I can&#x27;t believe this kit was what $40-$50 which is like at most 5 eyebrow waxes without a tip?! I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner! This is the EXACT same thing they have at the nail salons for eyebrow waxing, and they got it for $40?! I can&#x27;t believe that! Then they charge what $10 people a day $12?! I&#x27;m seriously in the wrong business lol. But if you are someone who goes to the salon every 2 weeks to get your brows waxed BUY THIS! After like 2 times doing my own brows I was a pro! I can&#x27;t speak to waxing the bikini line or sensitive areas since I just shave but the kit comes with directions on how to wax any and every body part imaginable. But like I said if you get your brows waxed/lip waxed/side burns waxed twice a month this thing pays for itself after like 2 months. Seriously! I fire this thing up every week when I see a few hairs growing in on my brows and wham bam in 3 minutes my brows is on FLEEK! I get so many compliments on my eyebrows it&#x27;s crazy. I keep mine on the sink 24/7 since it doesn&#x27;t make sense to put it away just to bring  it back out every week. Guests come to my house and ask about it and even inquire if I will do their brows, so this can also make money too! Lol the only thing I have to say is I chose sensitive wax I think which is pink-- I&#x27;ve never seen pink wax before but it works the same it just startled me at first. One other small thing is the kit comes with all of these booklets and lotions and sprays etc random stuff but DOESNT come with a wax removing oil... I have to buy that separately, no big deal just annoying. I now have a whole nail kit, and now a wax kit so I have saved at least $100 a month not going to salons. Oh btw, I used Nads back in the day for a long time the wax and the strips so I was somewhat used to waxing myself. If you&#x27;ve never done it maybe get a friend to help at first or ask them at the salon to show you how to wax and then just mimic that. It&#x27;s more painful too doing something yourself but you will get used to it in no time :)st mimic that. It&#x27;s more painful too doing something yourself but you will get used to it in no time :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. It saves me a lot of money. I appreciate the wax that was included (sensitive skin) but I wish it would&#x27;ve came with a &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; wax. :-)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve ordered this over a year and a half ago and i am so so happy i purchased this machine/kit. it&#x27;s the same one the salons use. i had been taking time out of my busy schedule to get my brows &amp; upper lip waxed at a salon every two weeks for YEARS!! not only am i saving time by not having to drive in rush hour traffic twice a month, i&#x27;m saving $40 bucks a month. this starter kit had everything i needed. when i ran out of the wooden sticks &amp; muslin strips i just went to Sally&#x27;s and bought more. recently i started buying popsicle sticks at the dollar store &amp; cutting my own cotton strips out of an old pillow case. saved even more money and the strips that i cut are way better than the store bought ones. this kit comes with thick paper &amp;#34;collars&amp;#34; that u put around the can of wax before u drop it in the machine. when i ran out of collars i just traced the old one on a thick piece of paper and cut my own. so there&#x27;s a few more tips for ya to save money :) instructions on how to shape brows are included. i also googled a bunch and printed some out to use as guidelines to get the look i wanted. of course there are a ton of vids out there. once u get comfortable with it it&#x27;s fantastic to just be able to quickly &amp; easily do ur own in the comfort of ur own home whenever u want. i even started doing them for my family and friends. i&#x27;m pretty good at it now. i usually turn the machine on to just over medium. i let it heat up for at least an hour or more. the longer the better. the machine is built to be on all day every day if u want it to. the creams they included are awesome! since i only use a very small dab i still have leftovers. i highly recommend this brand and product.</li>
            <li> Does not come with pre-epilation dusting powder or wax remover.  Can get by without the powder, but the remove is essential.  Do not attempt without this product on hand!  For a home kit, it works better than expected.  Will take some practice to perfect, but was impressed with the amount of hair removed.  The instruction manual is for commercial hair removal, leading me to believe this could be used in a professional salon.  Overall good product, but wish I had known to order the accessory items in advance.</li>
            <li> Heats well (about 30 min to temp). I would prefer less bottled product and more applicators in the set. I&#x27;m new to this type of wax so I&#x27;m still getting used to it but the machine it&#x27;s self has been exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have had this set for over a year. The warmer is a little sticky from the wax and it is difficult to clean. Other than that, this set is very worth it. I did not use all of the extra products but it has everything you can possibly need.</li>
            <li> Worth every Pennie. So much cheaper than going to a salon to get waxed.</li>
            <li> Great for small jobs! No time for salon wax, buy one. It last a long time. facial wax smells good.. no fumes.</li>
            <li> Wrote a review already concerning this kit&lt;br /&gt;Ended up with 2 because I could cancel the other on time.&lt;br /&gt;Had bad experience. Cheese cloth to thin&lt;br /&gt;Wax bleeds through big time&lt;br /&gt;Eyelids are so crusty even after 6 days&lt;br /&gt;Of Waxing. I have been waxing for years&lt;br /&gt;So I know and understand it...&lt;br /&gt;Only writing my personal opinion and experience with this kit and will not purchase GIGI anything like this again.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t give this other as the gift I was gonna give either.</li>
            <li> Great gift for beginners. Easy to use, however, following the instruction can be very complicate it.</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work,  it doesn&#x27;t remove hair at all.</li>
            <li> Works great and so much for the cost, saves me a whole lot of money to do myself and the products that come with are great! Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I would like to get my refund. I received my order today and the product isn&#x27;t in good condition. The wax container is opened and leaked. It was scattered all over inside the package and it is very sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this mini waxing kit..... I really recommend it..doesn&#x27;t hurts my skin..best one so far! Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I do not have to make appts anymore for waxwings. I can do it when I need to in my own home. This is professional grade stuff and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It came with everything that you would need for at home waxing. Also, I have very sensitive skin when it comes to waxing and the wax that came with the kit was just what I needed! Shipped very quickly, I highly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> Product as described saved me a bunch of money. good product. Will def buy from again. Same product at local beauty supply only half the price.</li>
            <li> just received my kit today. never waxed before, instructions were very clear. I luv it!!! as for there not being any baby powder or goo remover, everyone has powder of some type at home, be it baby or dusting(I used gold bond) for goo remover, you can&#x27;t beat Avon&#x27;s skin-so-soft(hey, it works on labels)a little on a cotton ball and every bit of wax comes right off, and it smells better than mineral oil!!</li>
            <li> Need to still buy wax off or use baby oil or massage oil to remove remaining wax. They should include in kit or remind it is needed for us rookies. Kit works great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. The system is so so but the wax that comes in it is 4 thumbs down. Cheap cheap wax that doesn&#x27;t harden enough to pull the hair out evenly and cleanly. It turned out to be a big gooey sticky mess! The wax does not remove easy from skin and basically has to wear itself off your skin due to the fact that its gooey and removes nothing. The warmer and everything else seems to work fine but you may want to purchase a better quality wax.</li>
            <li> The heater heats up nicely and the strips and applicators are great. The wax only does a &amp;#34;so, so&amp;#34; job as it is exceptionally sticky and not really hard enough to do the job well. Also, the trial bottles are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used honey wax many times and sadly failed to notice this was creme wax. This wax is not only a sticky mess that requires a special cleaner (had to use 420 cleaner and grundge off to clean up). The warmer takes a very long time to heat up the container and you need to stir it throughout the warming otherwise you will have molten wax around the edge with a majority of cold wax in the middle. After spending 3 hours to wax a few small areas and a addition hour in the shower to remove the stick i am repacking and returning. In no way can this be considered a \\&quot;pro\\&quot; waxing kit.</li>
            <li> After years of pulling off wax and getting skin burns, tweezing each and every hair on my chin and upper lip, painful and time consuming, I was looking at the expensive (read $299+) hair removal system.  I then saw Gini Pro Waxing Kit and decided to give this one more try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, this does exactly what it says it does...it removes hair.  You need to read the instruction manual and follow directions, and it will be a little messy the first time around, but it is worth it.  There is gel to use before using the wax, cooling gel afterwards and several other gels which are useful depending on whether you go with hard or soft wax.  I went soft wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side, which is a minor point, but one that I think is worth mentioning.  No where in the booklet does it give an approximate time for the heating of the wax.  It turned out to be 15 minutes before the wax was ready, and I think the manufacturer could give the consumer an approximate time...give or take a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spend several hundred dollars when this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Iove the waxing kit as a whole but the cream wax is not worth wasting your time with. Very stick &amp; stringy and not too effective. Buy the honey wax separate.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give my opinion about this waxing unit because it&#x27;s gotten some harsh reviews. First of all, WAX IS STICKY!&lt;br /&gt;I think anyone who has not waxed before, should try a professional first to get an idea of how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Melted wax is extremely sticky, which is why it takes your hair off&lt;br /&gt;MAKE SURE TO HAVE BABY OIL ON HAND FOR ANY WAX REMOVAL.&lt;br /&gt; Here are the steps I do to make it easy for me to wax:&lt;br /&gt;1: I pre-cut my muslin strips ahead of time and have them ready to use.&lt;br /&gt;2: I have baby powder out to apply on the area before I apply the wax.&lt;br /&gt;3: Before I even turn the unit on, I put a piece of paper under the heater that is large enough to cover any drips that may happen. I put the collar around the top of the wax can and then put it in the unit and heat it for about a half an hour before I use it. I also put another piece of paper between me and the unit to catch any drips so I don&#x27;t get any wax on my counter. I also put my used stick there after each use. It makes clean up SO easy- just throw away the paper and you&#x27;re all done.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT RE-DIP THE STICK AFTER EACH USE. This is for hygiene and keeps your wax clean.&lt;br /&gt;4: I make sure to use the pre-wax cleaner first, (so the skin is clean of any oils and bacteria) and then I use a small amount of baby powder over the area to be waxed.&lt;br /&gt;5: I put on gloves before I wax. It really makes a difference. I tried to do it without, and somehow always get some wax on me.&lt;br /&gt;I stir the wax, dip my stick in and use a small amount and wave it for just a second and apply the wax in the direction of hair growth. For my upper lip, I start in the middle of the lip and apply toward the edge of my lip. Apply the muslin strip and I let it stay there for almost 45 seconds. I have found if I try to remove my strip too soon, the wax doesn&#x27;t come off. Pull toward the middle of the lip (opposite direction of wax application) Make sure to pull quickly and you can hold the edge of your skin before you pull.&lt;br /&gt;Then I do the other side. I use baby oil to remove any left over wax and then put all my sticks, cotton pads, and gloves on the piece of paper and then throw away. VERY EASY&lt;br /&gt;I was told that cortisone cream may help after the first time of waxing as it can help reduce the redness.&lt;br /&gt;I also save the lid to my wax (put somewhere where nothing can touch it-it&#x27;s really sticky) so that if I want to change waxes I can.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps some of you who are new to waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to not spill the wax or you will have trouble cleaning it off of surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this kit, and it&#x27;s not fair to fault the wax, when it&#x27;s usually the user that is having problems. Just be prepared, and you&#x27;ll love this as much as I do.before you pull.&lt;br /&gt;Then I do the other side. I use baby oil to remove any left over wax and then put all my sticks, cotton pads, and gloves on the piece of paper and then throw away. VERY EASY&lt;br /&gt;I was told that cortisone cream may help after the first time of waxing as it can help reduce the redness.&lt;br /&gt;I also save the lid to my wax (put somewhere where nothing can touch it-it&#x27;s really sticky) so that if I want to change waxes I can.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps some of you who are new to waxing.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to not spill the wax or you will have trouble cleaning it off of surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this kit, and it&#x27;s not fair to fault the wax, when it&#x27;s usually the user that is having problems.

            <li> Love this product! Works great. Easy to set up and use. Used the day I received waxer couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. Easier/cheaper to wax at home with this then to go to salon</li>
            <li> There were metal bars in the container that had no instruction on how to use. The machine is tacky and is hallow and has no rigidness, you could warm up the honey with much more simpler methods.</li>
            <li> I used to go pretty regularly to get waxed.  Then a couple years ago, I put this on my wish list at amazon and my mom hooked me up.  I have been using this since then, and absolutely LOVE it!!!  It&#x27;s very easy to use.  I typically wax eyebrows/lip/chin.  Their sticks that they send are great - only problem was at the time I ran out (about a year after owning this), it was hard to find more of the exact brand.  Or maybe I didn&#x27;t look well enough.  I&#x27;m only about half way through the wax that came with it - so it lasts an incredible long time.  Heat up time is kind of long - but that&#x27;s to be expected I suppose.  It&#x27;s ready about 45-60 minutes after starting it up.  I&#x27;ve never really used much of the extra stuff that comes with - some are still untouched.  I wash my face first.  Next, I take rubbing alcohol and wipe over areas about to be waxed, then put a little bit of baby powder on.  Once I&#x27;m done waxing, I use either olive oil or coconut oil to remove any residual wax.  This may sound obvious, but make certain you store it upright without any tilt at all.  I store mine in a 3 drawer plastic sterlite type container, and once it was not quite level and some wax spilled out. Wow what a mess!!  (And STILL i have a lot of wax left).  Very very happy with this set!!</li>
            <li> Came quickly, easy to get started.  There is a learning curve, and if you are not careful it can be messy but it is not the Mini Pro fault. Has already paid at least 1/3 of itself.</li>
            <li> It comes with everything show, I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> Okay so...where do I begin. The item itself (the first time i ordered it) came in broken, they don&#x27;t do a great job of wrapping it to protect it from damage during shipping. However, because Amazon rocks- I was issued a refund. I decided to test my luck again- and I ordered it again. This time it did come in undamaged! yay! But if other people are saying it is messy, you need to believe it because I am saying it too! This comes with very poor directions, ensure you have something underneath it to catch all the gooey sticky dripping bc there is no bigger pain than removing wax off your fingers, surfaces etc... anyway long story short. It&#x27;s okay for beginners like myself. Don&#x27;t try to use this for anything but facial hair removal or very easy to pull hair...i.e. it isn&#x27;t going to work for a bikini wax....they sell a different wax for that. Good luck trying to open the wax in order to heat it up without making a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-messy&lt;br /&gt;-works&lt;br /&gt;-bad packaging&lt;br /&gt;-practice makes perfect?&lt;br /&gt;-try it for yourself&lt;br /&gt;-for the 8-15 dollars that people pay for waxing- this does the job- so yeah at the end of the day it is worth it.</li>
            <li> this was such a great deal and my daughter loved it. She even used it for a wedding party, on the bridesmaids! it is the same one in our local salon. Very high quality and great price!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am having trouble using this product.  I am not a professional so that might be the problem.  I thought I could save some money by getting my own waxing kit, but either the pros make it look so easy or this thing isn&#x27;t worth the buy.  The wax is extremely sticky and I can&#x27;t get it off my face or hands without really scrubbing and using some lotion.  Soap and water do not cut it.  Therefore, it is somewhat irritating to my skin.  Secondly, either I&#x27;m not doing it correctly (even after reading the directions) or the wax doesn&#x27;t even pull out the hairs!  If anything it makes them stiff and sticky so that I can then pluck them with tweezers.  I might just go back to plucking.  Pretty disappointed.  Unless some pros have advice and pointers, I&#x27;m bummed about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my gf so she wouldn&#x27;t have to spend so much money at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST OFF: We DIDN&#x27;T get everything that this kit is suppose to come with. The collars weren&#x27;t in the kit, neither were the smaller set of muslin strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND: The creme wax wasn&#x27;t great. It&#x27;s sticky, messy and \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; is not the greatest. However all skin types are different. It worked fine for her but on me was not at all pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than these two factors, this set would have been great! My gf loves everything else about it. She loves the warmer and says it&#x27;s a nice starter kit.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience doing my own at-home waxing. I am not a professional in any way. I used this kit to wax my eyebrows and upper lip. This kit is actually pretty great. It&#x27;s easy to use and effective. For as many awful reviews as the creme wax is getting, I was pleasantly surprised by it. It removed hair perfectly for me. My only complaint is the packaging: when my kit arrived, the lid was smashed into about a million pieces and some of the lotions were leaking. Other than the packaging, this is a great beginners&#x27; kit. I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it love it!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who waxes! I scoured the reviews before buying it and still decided to buy it with the bad reviews.... If you read the direction booklet it comes with though it&#x27;s SO easy and none of the bad reviews make any sense. Everything bad that anyone has to say is addressed in the booklet! I&#x27;ve already done $100 worth of waxing with this kit (eyebrows, lip, bikini, legs, armpits). SO worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Lid cracked, wax doesn&#x27;t melt fully, couldn&#x27;t return it. Threw it in the garbage. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The wax was very poor quality and made my skin irritated. 2 weeks after using it I still have patches of red flaky skin on my legs. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was so so happy and now she can do her own waxing. When she asked me the cost and I told her, she was amazed cause this kit is a steal of a deal. She was also happy that so many other things came with the kit in abundance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say many thanks, so many kisses she gave me cause this was just perfect for her. Simple, small and manageable to use. she prefer her own and I agree, for personal reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much Amazon.</li>
            <li> The lid for this product is kind of fragile, so be careful not to drop it.</li>
            <li> I really like this kit. Wasn&#x27;t sure what exactly came in the kit, because the description only lists: 1 Wax warmer, 10 petite applicators, 1 large accu-edge applicators, 10 small accu-edge applicators, but the kit DID arrive in the mail with everything that is pictured.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works just like the salon and with a little more practice it will be so much easier. This will save me tons of time and money, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit after going to the salon a few times for a Brazilian wax. The price for one wax at the salon is about the price of this kit. The kit comes with many things that you may or may not find useful, but are completely worth the price of this kit. I use the wax that the kit came with to do my legs, along with the strips of muslin. No matter what wax you use, the lotions and gels are useful, as well as the wooden sticks to spread the wax with.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this review 4 stars because I do not use the wax that the kit came with, and had to purchase two separate waxes (for legs and bikini area). All of the waxes can be messy, if you are inexperienced, but you can always use oil to remove the wax from unwanted areas. I use a mixture of olive oil and castor oil, mostly because it is what I use on my face and it&#x27;s right there in the bathroom :)&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning on doing sensitive areas, be sure to buy the hard Brazilian wax from GiGi.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m neutral with this review.  It&#x27;s probably a good product, but I&#x27;m still learning the fundamental of doing my own eyebrows.  I wanted to do my own eyebrows after paying folks $8 to do them at salons.  I wonder how this kit compares to a professional salon kit?  The glue was very sticky, but I&#x27;m not sure if it was getting hot enough.  I&#x27;m concern that I&#x27;l run out of cloths and sticks from just learning.  This process can create a real mess.  All solutions with the kit are real NICE!!  I&#x27;ll keep trying to use this kit, but have plenty of time work this...</li>
            <li> The wax while good, didn&#x27;t look to be the best of quality.... Have used honey wax which I felt was a better wax than this... But otherwise great product !!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was hard wax.. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The Pink Cr&amp;egrave;me Wax that it comes with can go from solid to messy real quick due to it&#x27;s sticky-ness. It is sure to pick up all of the hair if you&#x27;re using it for upper lip wax, legs, eyebrows (seek professional help in the beginning. Eyebrows are everything to me and hope it is to you as well. Make sure you won&#x27;t yank it all off) or like yours truly--bikini area. I do not recommend using this for armpit hair or other sensitive areas of the body. The sticky residue it leaves behind, it&#x27;s nothing a dash of baby oil can&#x27;t clean up. DO NOT wax for your face with this kind of wax, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the wax type or waxing your face in general--but it&#x27;s not a smart thing to do. The hairs on your face are there for a reason--search it, the hair follicles protects your pores from dirt &amp; excess oil. Any who, I&#x27;ve had bad results after waxing the face--red bumps and itchy. The worst feeling. Other than that.. this product does magic! The variety of edge applicators are so useful. Comes with directions on how to use and all.</li>
            <li> Salon perfect...we love it!!</li>
            <li> I will use the kit for my under arms not my legs or bikini area my skin did not come off but only because i had bleeding at the hair roots. The kit came with the pink cream wax. The cream wax did not grip a single hair my hair is very coarse from shaving ever since i was a teen. I had to go to sally&#x27;s beauty supply to purchase the GIGI Brazilian No Strips Needed Hard Wax. I still had too use the muslin strips with the hard wax. Instead of using the wooden applicator sticks I used a small plastic spatula from my old George Foreman grill. I would rather use plastic instead to save money and its very easy to clean using baby oil and bar soap. I used the cleanser that came with the kit, then applied the baby powder,applied the wax to my skin,applied the strip the  results were perfect but it wax painful as ish. I will use the kit for my under arms not my legs or bikini area my skin did not come off but only because i had bleeding at the hair roots. If you have thick hair get the hard wax instead otherwise the wax will from the kit be useless.Love the product line and kit.The wax warmer works great heats well stays warm or hot. Cost me 44 bucks with free 2 day shipping i used my new amazon prime student membership.The kit not come with a DVD. Go to the GIGI website under Waxing Videos and watch the DVD online its an old 1970&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s video but its still very informative. The kit is nice!</li>
            <li> I bought the new on for a Christmas present and it got here in a decent amount of Time. The bad part is even though it was &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;, the whole thing had been used and the lid cover was broke in half. Thankfully the returned it for the amount I paid , but I had to buy one in store for more because after that I didn&#x27;t have time to have it sent and get here before Christmas.</li>
            <li> Do I need practice or is this not a good kit for waxing other places than the face?  It does a terrific job on my face and I don&#x27;t have to throw my money away!</li>
            <li> This product sucks ! I thought I would give it a shot and try this out and review it but this product dried out my skin and pulled it, the wax wasnt even hot to start. I dont know if this item was defective but it sucks I would not recommend and it didnt even pull the hairs. I would rather use nairs microwavable wax tub</li>
            <li> Package arrived in correct size and in shorter time phrase than expected. Everything that I asked for. Perfect for what I needed.</li>
            <li> I was frustrated and thought it&#x27;s the worst at first because I had been using hard wax all times before. When I used this kit at first time, I guess I applied \\&quot;hard wax amount\\&quot; to skin, and of course nothing came off after I swiped with muslin cloth. It was a mess and the wax is so sticky. I even thought about retuning it right away. After I reviewed all youtube tutorials online, I started using less amount and thinner layer on skin, and swipe the cloth faster. After trying several times, I felt it&#x27;s easier than i thought and started like it!</li>
            <li> the best investment ever!</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this in Sallys beauty supply store and returned it since the price was about 50% cheaper here. The big things I noticed that were missing was there had been a dvd of info in the sally&#x27;s one that wasn&#x27;t in this box otherwise it seemed the same. The warmer is kind cheap looking and the strips it comes with are terrible. I bought some paper ones right away. Other then that It&#x27;s a great set.</li>
            <li> This is a great bundle for the price.  Love the instruction manual!  Even if you somewhat know what you&#x27;re doing ...It comes in handy!  Has step by step with picture illustraions.  All the extras are also a plus but honestly not really neccesary.&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser can be replaced with alchol and the post gel can be replaced with oil.(baby or any kitchen oil).  I recommend rubbing your hands down in oil or wearing gloves, the wax is pretty sticky.  I can&#x27;t stress enough when using the creme wax....the less on the stick the better! Avoid a mess!  This wax spreads pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the woven muslin strips don&#x27;t well with the creme wax.  If you&#x27;re considering buying this go to the store and buy non woven paper strips.(100 pcs for $4-5) or consider buying the Honee wax.  The woven muslin strips work well with the Honee wax(which is less sticky).</li>
            <li> I no longer have to wait for my hairdresser appointments to get my wax done!  Super easy to use with lots of accessories.  My only complaint was that the cover was cracked in half.  I wish I had a new one, but the item still works so I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product but the plastic lid came cracked!</li>
            <li> Warmer works well however the wax that&#x27;s included is almost useless. Tried using it for bikini and underarms and it doesn&#x27;t harden correctly, even after letting set for 5 min with very thin layer, and hardly pulls out any hairs. Tried multiple times and still couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I am anxious to try the hardening wax that doesn&#x27;t require strips....sounds like it might work better</li>
            <li> now my nuts are hair free!!!!</li>
            <li> my girlfriend says it works great.</li>
            <li> I love this kit it was for a nice price. However the sensitive skin wax that comes with it (pink) DOESNT WORK IT IS HORRIBLE buy a kit that comes with honey wax or hard wax etc</li>
            <li> I like this! The wax is a bit difficult to work with, but it works. Clorox wipes are great for cleanup!</li>
            <li> It might be I didn&#x27;t do the right thing for underarm hair removal. However, I have tried twice, and both failed. And it hurts!&lt;br /&gt;I do want to point out it works great for legs.</li>
            <li> Like most girls/women I&#x27;ve spent money lots of money on waxing, hair remover, eyebrow perfecting tools  and this has been my first try with waxing at home and it actually works really well it&#x27;s a good machine I am excited about it I&#x27;ve had it for over a month and I ordered the hard wax to see how it works since I&#x27;ve had that done before. Awesome at home machine.</li>
            <li> Every month I paid to have my eye brows waxed. I thought I&#x27;d try to save a little money and do my brows myself.  This kit was exactly what I needed. It does a great job waxing my eye brows.  I have attempted once to wax my legs.  Lets just say that was an epic fail.  I am not sure if the wax in this kit is the wrong kind or what I did wrong, but I had trouble removing any hair from my legs.  I am okay with not being able to wax my legs though since I really just wanted the kit for my eyebrows. I just thought I would give the leg waxing a try since I had the stuff to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this 4 or 5 months in a row now. It usually takes about 30 minutes for the wax to heat up. So I just turn it on and come back later.  The wax is a little messy, but not to bad.  Cleanup has always been fairly easy and quick.  Overall it does the job that I needed it to do and I am saving myself $15 every month now.</li>
            <li> This product is great, the shipping was pretty good too and it was professionally packaged as well. no complaints really, this is a great start up kit! definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Can be messy and hard to remove from wood tables (not a product complaint, user error).  Works well for my back, but works even better for my butt (any area with crevices and valleys)</li>
            <li> Best package yet. I do my waxing myself. The kit brings everything you need. Authentic. Everything worked great, I was very please with all the extra items in the box.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Easy to use and relatively little pain. I have never waxed at home before and I found this kit easy to use. I go to a salon for bikini waxing but after waxing my legs I am going to try my own bikini area next. When I waxed my first leg I left a few hairs but the second leg is beautiful! I&#x27;m sure the next time around will be great for both legs. I found that baby oil works well to remove the wax. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to wax themselves rather than spending 1/2 a fortune on a salon wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a awesome waxing kit, has everything you need to get started. Its also a great price and works great.</li>
            <li> I love my new Gigi Mini Professional waxing kit!  My step daughter tells me it is better then the one she had at her salon.  The directions are a bit confusing and the directions for the wax are on the bottom of the can so read before you heat it up.  I think it worked great.</li>
            <li> The kit is ok - the wax that comes with it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It comes in handy when necessary although it&#x27;s not very user friendly. Can be quite messy and you&#x27;ll still need to use your tweezer afterwards. The wax is also hard to clean off your skin. Baby oil works best when removing the wax residue from your skin.</li>
            <li> When u wax with the sinsative wax theres left over wax that is extremely hard to get off. It dose not pick up all the hairs, I still had to shave some spots over.</li>
            <li> Nice set for great price. I have not used it yet, but I am sure it will be nice &amp; it came with everything needed.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Thank u very much!</li>
            <li> I found the wax very difficult to work with and it just left a large painful mess.  The kit also doesn&#x27;t come with a dusting powder that the instructions say you need to use.</li>
            <li> THE PRICE WAS DEFINITELY GREAT FOR A SUPER PRO EYEBROW WAX! NEVER HAVE TO PAY A PROFESSIONAL FOR WAXING AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I use this product on Myself and my 2 girls. We were going to the salon and paying at least $40.00 every 3 weeks. I got on YouTube and watched a few videos on &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; and I do a great job each time. It&#x27;s easy, simple, and cost efficient. I love this product! The kit has everything you need. I&#x27;ll never go back to a salon again.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as the place I was getting waxing done no longer does it.  This kit works great.  I use it mostly for my eyebrows and upper lip.  Super easy to use and really takes care of the hairs.  There are a couple of products the instructions say to use that do not come with it, but I used it any way without them and had no problems.  This will definitely save me money in the long run.  I usually spent $16 every time I went for waxing so after the third use this has paid for itself.</li>
            <li> Good unit but we apparently wanted &amp;#34;Hard Wax&amp;#34;  So we still use this warmer just with a different wax.</li>
            <li> This is way more convenient then having to go out and get my eyebrows done.  I love my waxing kit!</li>
            <li> Worst waxing kit I have ever used. Doesn&#x27;t work on coarse hair. I tried it several times.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and the price was great!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;s live without this set - the wax is better than what I had been using (the honey one) so glad I got this set.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of time!! In my case it didn&#x27;t work too good! To get rid of my facial hair with Gigi took me days! 👎</li>
            <li> The waxer works fine, but the wax that came with it is a nightmare. The microwavable wax is easier to use than the pink wax. I will consider buying one of the hard waxes to see if that works better for me.</li>
            <li> useless, the wax is very soft and does not pull out hair very well, that is the reason to buy the product, I suppose I can buy another type of wax and pray it works with the machine.</li>
            <li> Great starter kit with everything needed.</li>
            <li> The dom cover was cracked upon arrival. Otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> A lot of you are disappointed with the wax, trust me I understand. The creme wax isn&#x27;t nearly as good as the Dark Honee for coarse hair wax.  The Dark Honee can be used all over and it gets all the hair in one pull! THE BEST!</li>
            <li> It is a great kit! I love it! Has everything you need to start waxing. The kit is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very useful and easy to use. Always handy, just plug it, wait for a few minutes and use. I recommend it to all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a beginner with this but my wife insists I get this for her.  She loves it and the amount of wax that comes with it will last forever as long as you keep your treatments to every couple weeks.  Be sure to follow the usage instructions or you&#x27;ll both end up a sticky ball.</li>
            <li> Love my GiGi Mini Pro Waxing Kit!</li>
            <li> It works pretty decent. I wish I would have just got the regular wax, this one doesn&#x27;t quite get the job done. Everything else works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got everything a person needs to get started waxing.</li>
            <li> I received the Kit with Cream Wax. It&#x27;s just a waste of money to buy this kit. The wax didn&#x27;t come off, so I had to literally scratch it from my skin. I get other small lotions in the kit, but I really don&#x27;t need them. Why should I use really dark foundation lotion for a white skin, after I wax???</li>
            <li> I had a terrible experience at a salon and decided to try at home waxing. This kit made it very easy. Everything (Wax, sticks, cloth, warmer, instructions, extra bottles of stuff you dont really need..) are all included and it still costs less than one salon session. Definitley worth trying.</li>
            <li> The machine does what you expect it to do, it heats up the wax. I like that it came with many strips and wooden spatula things of many sizes. The wax worked for me the first time but didn&#x27;t work well after that. It&#x27;s very hard to get off your skin (use baby oil for this!) and forget about your clothes. I ruined a shirt by wearing it when I was waxing my upper lip. Will never make that mistake again. Searching for better wax.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and it will save me alot of money. Its a great product.will def be shopping at your site.</li>
            <li> The waxing strips are a big NO! The wax goes through it and just leaves your hand sticky. The wax isn&#x27;t that great either. The products it came with are useless (to me). The only good things about this is the heater and the sticks used to place the wax.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you are familiar with waxing.  It is small and very easy to use.  I don&#x27;t have to go out to have my eyebrows waxed.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what prompted me to not to buy this product forever ago. After years of paying to have my eyebrows waxed, I now can get the exact same results at home. Without having to worry about someone taking all of my eyebrows off. Easy setup. Shipped with everything you need. I won&#x27;t need to order anymore strips for months to come and I can&#x27;t imagine using all of the wax in less than a year. Very good investment. I am not sure I will use all of the little bottles of product, bu the pre cleaner and post cooling gel are nice. I can see how this product could be intimidating if you are new to the waxing world. If that&#x27;s the case, go have a professional do it and make sure you are up it.</li>
            <li> A Christmas gift requested by my daughter.  Arrived on time.  Price was good.</li>
            <li> The wax cream is awful and messy.I would not recommend this to anyone. It takes a  long time to heat up as well. Alot of work for just trying to wax your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this because I don&#x27;t get to the salon&lt;br /&gt;often enough to have consistently groomed brows.  This needs&lt;br /&gt;to be done every week or two and I only get my hair cut&lt;br /&gt;every 5 weeks.  Plus by the time I bought this set after only&lt;br /&gt;a few uses it will pay for itself.  And all my daughters can&lt;br /&gt;use it too!  It is awesome!  You do need to let it heat up&lt;br /&gt;for a long time, I wish it was truly a MINI pot like&lt;br /&gt;the description says but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s a regular size wax pot&lt;br /&gt;so it takes a long time to get the wax hot.  However, it works&lt;br /&gt;like a charm and I was really nervous to try this for the first&lt;br /&gt;time ever.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked&lt;br /&gt;and how actually EASY it was to wax my own brows.  It does NOT&lt;br /&gt;work for my upper lip though, I think the hair is a different&lt;br /&gt;texture because after 3 tries I have given up the idea of using&lt;br /&gt;it on my lip.  It just does not get the hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself,  it&#x27;s great plus saves me money from going to get my brows done at a salon</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I am sending this back, did not do a good job on my eyebrows.  Very sticky, did not come off face easy.  Did not like the overall product.</li>
            <li> Came with the pink gooey soft wax. HATE it..Had to purchase the hard wax and love that one. Do it right, no pain...the pink stuff sucks!</li>
            <li> Great kit! I never pay for waxes now that I have this. Very easy to do at home once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Works great! Recommend not using the creme wax provided. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the honee wax. Other than that the warmer works perfect. Half the price tha. What I would have paid at a beauty store! Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Excellent wax kit for the starters. I have sensitive skin and was not sure if this wax would be suitable for my skin type. I had bitter experiences at the parlour that after waxing I would have bruises all over my skin and they just said that it was &#x27;normal&#x27;. But I had no such problems with this product and would recommend it for people with sensitive skin to give this a try and see if you like it.</li>
            <li> Loved the very thorough guide that came with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;Number of splints/cloths seemed fair. Seemed to be fine cloths to use with the cream wax.&lt;br /&gt;The cream wax itself leaves a lot to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;Warmer works, would just suggest getting a kit with any wax that isn&#x27;t cream wax.&lt;br /&gt;I found the cream wax to be very messy and not all that effective.&lt;br /&gt;Had a lot of broken hairs on my legs, and didn&#x27;t find it removed much at all in my armpits. Just hurt a lot.&lt;br /&gt;GiGi wax kits are great, the cream wax is not.</li>
            <li> Just love this. I save about 20 dollars a month. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Perfect kit for getting started . . . love GiGi products.</li>
            <li> The sticky wax is not for beginners so Im going to get the hard wax, everything else on it is worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever tried to use.  Gum would work better. This will not come off your skin, and does not remove any hair at all.  Trying to return it now.</li>
            <li> This wax kit arrived only 3 days after I ordered it. It&#x27;s helpful to look up &amp;#34;facial waxing&amp;#34; on youtube. Watch a couple of the demos and you&#x27;ll be ready. The first time I used it everything came out perfect. It is not painful. Also, if you don&#x27;t heat the wax up to the hottest temp, you don&#x27;t have all the mess of wax dripping everywhere. I reuse the wooden waxing sticks and haven&#x27;t thrown any away yet. Just scrape the wax off when they&#x27;re real hot. I use the wax kit for my face and my arms. Although my hair is blonde, I just have too much fuzz and waxing it off is WONDERFUL. Never had it done professionally, but I feel like a pro it went so well. Comes with a fine oil (thin) to put on before waxing. You can just use baby oil, but it&#x27;s thicker so use sparingly and blot with tissue before waxing. The problem I had was breaking out in horrible red bumps. Researched it online and it said when you pull the hair out it opens the follicle up briefly and it can get infected. After waxing, I applied antibiotic ointment (thinly) over my arms and face and magically - no break out at all. Skin remained perfectly smooth. Remember to apply wax in the direction that the hair grows and pull it off in the opposite direction that the hair grows. There seems to be some confusion in the feedback, and some are saying it incorrectly.</li>
            <li> The wax is a straight-up mess. I am very dissappointed with this purchase. Unfortunately this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am happy with it! Works well</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! This has all you need to wax! Very happy!</li>
            <li> This product was returned by the buyer because it did not get hot enough for the wax that it came with!</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this one as a gift.  I bought one for myself about a year ago and use it all the time.  My daughter comes over to use it too so I ordered one for her.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. I didn&#x27;t care for the cream wax or the muslin strips, I like honey wax and non woven strips, but the kit itself works great.</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands of dollars going to salons for eyebrow, bikini and leg waxing.  I purchased this item with the goal of reducing my expense.  Great choice!  instructions were simple and great.  Product overall is easy to use and will save you plenty of salon visits, saving you money,</li>
            <li> Thw price was right but I don&#x27;t really care for the creme wax. The woven strips are horrible as the wax seeped through and got my hands all sticky. Had to purchase some unwoven strips that are due to arrive today.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great starter kit has everything good price. Love the lavender cream wax instead of the sticky Gigi honee it&#x27;s more gental on the skin less bumps and breakouts</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I love the product!  Works perfectly.  Only suggestion is to buy the pre wax powder, it&#x27;s not included.</li>
            <li> Maybe its the way i wax but i have not falled  loved with this product ... bought this wax set after seeing it tried out by  youtube blogger not impressed ... residue sucks and left my skin with a terrible rash for a week straight&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend to a friend !</li>
            <li> Wax doesn&#x27;t get as hot and thin as it should which makes it harder to use</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for her birthday.  It was perfect, everything came with this unit shown in the picture, she loves it and has had no issues with it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> i have coarse hair and the wax that comes with it doesnt do well with that. the wax paper is thin and you can feel the wax seeping through. it heats up pretty quickly though. and it has a lot of stuff for before and after waxing.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money. After years I still have most of the wax left</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for home use. The pot is super cute and I loved the products except creme wax. I did purchase the honey wax separate and I am glad I did. The kit comes complete with everything except wax remover but I used baby oil and it works great. I gave it 4 stars because of the creme.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great product</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. I have no idea why I bought it. It&#x27;s just a sticky substance that gets everywhere and doesn&#x27;t even have the waxing effect of being strong enough to even pull peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> if you dont know how to use it, or you have small siblings that can ruin it then, don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> great, works well, good buy</li>
            <li> Great kit. However it doesn&#x27;t come with the powder it keeps mentioning to use. Also, make sure you let the wax get very hot before your apply it to your skin, unless you want to scrub it off.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I love the footprint of the appliance, the temperature control and the directions. It came with everything I needed to use it. It works. I have tried over the counter waxes that I heated in the microwave and the warm the strip in you hands stuff for  a while. I did not want to add another ongoing expenditure to my budget for something I believed I could for myself. Now, I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> I had never used a home waxing kit and this product was perfect. It comes with all the lotions, wax, strips, sticks, and the warmer. Everything was very clear on how to use it too. The only thing you might want to buy is a pair of throw-away latex gloves for when you&#x27;re using the kit. Otherwise, it was great! Shipped earlier than expected :)</li>
            <li> I really like this kit but I did not like the wax that it came with, once it melts its very watery and its pink. I would have preferred a regular wax.&lt;br /&gt;The wax warmer is great and it does warm up the wax fairly quickly. I have not used any of the creams though.</li>
            <li> The  machine  is really  nice.  I  haven&#x27;t  tried  it  yet.</li>
            <li> Like others, I figured why spend money at the salon when I could buy the same thing and do it at home for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial waxing is not difficult.  You just have to be patient, get the wax to the right temperature, a thin layer, let it set for a moment, place the muslin over the wax and take a deep breath when you pull.  Do remember that the wax will not get every hair and you will need to invest in a magnifying mirror and a good pair of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit takes about 30 minutes to warm up the wax.  On the lowest setting, you will still have a clump of unheated wax in the middle but that is no problem.  Just stir and use the outer most liquid. At this temperature, you will not have to blow on the stick to cool it before placing it on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use all the prep lotions that were included since my salon did not and I was comfortable with that.  Simple baby oil and a quick washing with your regular mild facial cleanser will take care of any residue that you were not able to blot off with the muslin strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the wax included is for sensitive skin, I experience itching and a slight discomfort around my eyebrows– but that goes away within a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though not stated on the box or the description, there are a couple of the collars included so before you add them to your cart, wait until you receive your box and check its contents.  I had ordered them not knowing and would have much preferred to order extra muslin or sticks for the same money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had the problem that others have had with the included strips leaving fuzz (not sure if they meant fuzz from the muslin or fuzz as in fine baby hairs) and found them to be very useful with just the right amount of grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great investment and had paid for itself in just two usages.</li>
            <li> The warmer stopped working after one use. It was too late for me to return it.</li>
            <li> Came in authentic packaging! Super happy.</li>
            <li> First off the Post Wax purple concealer had exploded in the box when I opened it so all of the bottles were covered with purple concealer. Second, another bottle didn&#x27;t even have the cap screwed on and third, thank you for not including anything to get the stuff wax off.  I will not purchase anything from here again, nor will I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good buy! Professional results</li>
            <li> I have read almost all of these reviews and have yet to find anyone responding as to how these resting bars are used??? Can someone out there who has figured it out, give me a clue. I also find it ridiculous that it claims to be a (KIT) and yet in order to use it you have to go out and purchase the powder and oil in order to even start.</li>
            <li> I had another wax kit with the hard wax and loved it.  Thought I would try the soft wax and didn&#x27;t like it as much.  However, this kit is great!  Comes with everything you need to get started.  Something that came with this kit that didn&#x27;t come with the last one were rings to put around the rim of the warmer to keep wax from dripping all over it and into the well.  Those are a must!  Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this set up. Everything in the picture was sent to me and it works great.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly. With everything that is show on the picture. The wax warmer it only takes between 15 to 20 minutes to melt the wax. I found it safe to use because it doesn&#x27;t burn at all.  I was disappointed because the wax that came is a pink one that say that is for sensitive skin but is the opposite. It is very messy, very sticky and hard to take off even with oil. I follow all the instructions and prepared my skin with powder, (by the way it don&#x27;t come in the kit). I did everything as suppose but when I start to removing the wax with the strips the wax was staying on my skin and most off the hair also. It said that is safe to use it on the face but it is not. it let the hair on my eyebrows and harm my skin. I also use it under my arms and it did the same thing. It took 5 days for my skin get to almost normal. The little bottles are unnecessary because non of them help to make it better. My advise if you are going to by it make sure that the wax is the GIGI honee. It is better than the pink one.</li>
            <li> thank you i got my product</li>
            <li> I love my kit. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this item and I love it for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all that I have to say about that.  *wink*</li>
            <li> Messy, just go to the Salon and have a professional do it.</li>
            <li> Returned this kit the day after it arrived. The cream wax was awful leaving me a sticky mess and didn&#x27;t remove the hair. Repurchased the Gigi warmer and wooden spatulas  and then bought Cirepil blue wax and haven&#x27;t been sorry once. Rated 2 stars because the warmer and spatulas  worked like a charm but all the other items were crap.</li>
            <li> This kit is amazing. For anyone buying this kit I would recommend that u get some baby oil to use as wax remover. Takes a while to heat up. Overall it&#x27;s a great kit and it arrived on time. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using the cream wax on ur underarm I would suggest that u buy the GiGi hard wax for that.</li>
            <li> Love the melting pot but the wax is TERRIBLE! very sticky!!! could not take off : (&lt;br /&gt;So I just purchased a hard melting wax, now I am very happy : )</li>
            <li> I used this once and it was great. The wax didn&#x27;t burn my face and it really does work for more than six weeks. I can happily reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for personal in home use and will last a super long time! Great deal for my money!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the GiGi Mini Pro Waxing Kit. I followed the product instructions, and I also listened to some of the advice I read in other product reviews. (Thanks a million to the reviewer who said I could use regular cooking oil to remove wax).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why I strongly dislike this product:&lt;br /&gt;*Messy - I was very careful. I had several towels ready for clean up. Once the wax heats up to a certain point, it becomes harder to avoid drips. The cloth strips did not remove all of the wax from my skin. I had to scrub my legs with cooking oil to try to remove the wax. I&#x27;m still sticky in some places. After I finished, I have a large collection of cloth strips with wax on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Alternatives - There are better alternatives for me. I strongly prefer my Braun epilator to at-home waxing. Waxing is less &amp;#34;painful,&amp;#34; but waxing was messy, more time consuming (start to finish with clean up), less effective (I have patches of hair), and takes up less space. The wax warmer is larger than I anticipated. I tried Nads when I was a teenager, and that was much easier and cleaner to use than this waxing kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Solo use - I do not think this is a good hair removal method to use on yourself. It&#x27;s kinda like yoga if you&#x27;re using this as your sole hair removal method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried this product, because I was curious to see if it would work for me. Unfortunately, I really hate it.</li>
            <li> If you are planning to buy and use this product, make sure to buy the hard wax on the side... The wax that it comes with does not really wax too well</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use it because the lid was broken at arrival so I just gift it before trying to use it</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> The wax warmer itself is excellent, the creme wax is nice but kind of messy to use but maybe once I get the hang of using creme wax I&#x27;ll be a little more satisfied and it came with a bunch of useless creams gels and so on.  I didn&#x27;t have too much trouble with the strips it came with and any problems I did have with the strips was probably my fault cause it was hard for me to use the wax I might have piled the wax on too thick. I&#x27;m not in love with the product but I don&#x27;t regret buying it at all.  All in all I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> did not come with a remover. waste of money</li>
            <li> melts the wax quickly.  love all the products that came with it</li>
            <li> IF YOUR PLANNING TO BUY THIS BUY POWDER AND OIL BEFORE HAND&lt;br /&gt;i agree with the other reviewers there are 2 things messing which are powder and oil, i bought baby powder and baby oil but u can olive oil too.(powder u put on before waxing it helps the wax not to stick on your skin and ease the pain, also oil which help removes the wax after u pull it off)&lt;br /&gt;i feel most of the bottles they gave were pretty much useless because i only use the pre-wax cleanser which is some anti bacterial stuff u put on before waxing (just in case u pull a hair too hard and it bleed and prevent from getting infected). i wanted to use the slow grower but decided not to, only because my hair hasn&#x27;t grown yet when i waxed it. I don&#x27;t feel the need to try it since my hair hasn&#x27;t grown yet.</li>
            <li> Saves money. I use it every two week for my lips and it lasts forever. Easy to take care of and cheaper than going to the salon. Who knows how sanitary it is there!</li>
            <li> This product was horrible. I followed step by step.. Better off using ductape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I use different wax.. Everything else works okay, the wax doesn&#x27;t work on tough hair..</li>
            <li> not its fault but very messy (as noted)...  will see if my stylist would like to purchase from me or sell it at a yard sale... I am to picky for this kind of mess.  :-) once again , my fault for thinking I could do this at home.</li>
            <li> Amazing kit. Easy to use and even my very first eyebrow waxing was a succes.&lt;br /&gt;This product will save you hundreds over time by doing quality waxing at home vs paying overpriced salons to wax you.&lt;br /&gt;This kit will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Loved it works amazing im saving so much money doing my own browwaxing</li>
            <li> Just as described and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> Messy to work with and did not remove hair completely.  Heading back to salon in future</li>
            <li> Comes with most every thing that you need and did not catch on fire. So I would say it does an  excellent job at warming up wax.</li>
            <li> This has been wonderful for all my waxing needs!</li>
            <li> I love my little GiGi pot! Does what I paid it to do.  Running my own business it;s inexpensive and just great!</li>
            <li> Does not work. was does not harden and if you use the strips the was still sticks to your face.</li>
            <li> I really love my waxer. The only bad thing is that the lid was cracked on delivery. Amazon reimbursed me for that. Other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give a better review is for the fact that my lid to go over the wax was broken completely when it arrived. My girlfriend was very disappointed to see this as was I.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t start to say the num of times I have wished I never bought this disastrous kit!&lt;br /&gt;So where do we start -&lt;br /&gt;It looks good - all cute and decent.&lt;br /&gt;The moment you get it heated up and wait for the wax to melt , the pain starts!&lt;br /&gt;I am not even sure if it&#x27;s just me who has this terrible time trying to apply the wax and remove it. I did everything as per the instructions (which is a lot of steps) and then apply the wax and it sticks all over and comes off in patches!! Yikes. And it is not because I don&#x27;t heat the wax enough. I always do. I don&#x27;t have a sensitivity to temperatures and my skin doesn&#x27;t scream if it&#x27;s a tad too hot so I try to keep the heat of the wax as high as I can handle.&lt;br /&gt;It would be wrong to write the whole kit out - the wax warmer is good. The wax, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the kit is a little too much. I basically ended up with a bunch of bottles that I didn&#x27;t need and I wouldn&#x27;t have ever purchased separately.&lt;br /&gt;They could have given tons of cloth strips instead. The one provided, even the big ones, are not sufficient for the legs. I used all of it up in 2 tries.&lt;br /&gt;As for all the wax i had on me at the end of the ordeal, olive oil did the trick. I applied a good bit of olive oil and patiently rubbed it in to get the wax off.&lt;br /&gt;And as for all the hair still looking up at me from my legs, well, I went back to veet for now.</li>
            <li> The lid to the warmer came broken in half. Also, the wax had adhered to the lid of the container making it very difficult to open. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! It comes with everything you need. Also, is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use. Package didn&#x27;t come with wax removal lotion of any kind. It was horrible trying to get it off of my skin.</li>
            <li> The top to my gigi mini pro was cracked when it was received. Not very happy with that! I might have to return it</li>
            <li> I received the product in very good conditions and very fast. However, the wax that came with it HORRIBLE! It never ever dries! After 20 minutes and with no possitive results I tried to remove it with the &amp;#34;after wax remover&amp;#34; and it did not work at all. I had to shower and I still have wax today.&lt;br /&gt;The heater was good but the wax is horrible, it was the pink one that says creme wax. My advice is not to buy that one, I will try changing the wax.</li>
            <li> I use this every two weeks for my face. It is amazing! I have very sensitive skin and I have not gotten a rash or anything in the almost year I have had this. The temperature control is great! I adore it.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my wax machine. I looked on other sites and this was the best. I was happy to see that they did give sample bottles of the other waxing products. It is a great starter kit!</li>
            <li> I just got my waxing kit today. The lid for my wax warmer is broken. Everything else seems alright, but the warmer lid isn&#x27;t useable.</li>
            <li> I have used this system quite a few times and love it.  I am not an expert, but am learning a few tricks as I go.  It has saved me a ton of money and works great.</li>
            <li> I really enoy My GiGi Mini Pro Waxing Kit.</li>
            <li> I like being able to wax at home.  It takes some getting used to . . .  doing it to myself. The wax is nice and warm, not too hot. It came with a nice booklet on the &amp;#34;how to&amp;#34; wax the areas of the body but not much instructions on the warmer itself.  It came with wire racks to rest the wood sticks on, bit not diagrams to show how they stay on.  I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay on.  Good machine for home use!</li>
            <li> The lid was cracked at arrival</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times now, and love it more and more each time I use it! The kit is complete with enough supplies for a few waxes. I purchased this kit for facial waxing, including eyebrows, to save time and money. The kit is easy to use, and the wax works well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great way to save money on your monthly waxes, this is definitely the route to go--just watch a few YouTube videos before removing the hair :)</li>
            <li> The wax warmer heats up fast and the kit comes with everything needed. I would just recommend buying a different wax if you have more sensitive skin and also making sure you have oil to apply on the skin right after it&#x27;s been waxed to prevent little red bumps or ingrown hairs from occurring. The strips are nice because they can easily be ripped to different sizes. If you&#x27;re new to using wax, i would suggest covering any surfaces the warmer lays on with something because it can get messy. Having my own warmer has saved me money and time. Overall it&#x27;s a good product and good deal if you get the kit, especially if you&#x27;re doing simple waxing (like for eyebrows and upper lip)or if you are just beginning.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was tried of spending money on getting my eyebrows and legs waxed. But I didn&#x27;t like the creme that come with the kit, the wax didn&#x27;t remove none of the hair of my legs at all, and the wax was very messy. If you decide to purchase this kit, just make sure that you purchase the Honey hard wax.</li>
            <li> Nice looking, well built but it is so messy and we could not get it to remove hair no matter much we tried.  Oh well, back to tweezers and professional waxing.</li>
