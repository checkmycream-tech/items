    <ol>
            <li>This toothpaste is awesome!  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste is the best tasting of all toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Best.</li>
            <li>,  this is the best toothpaste for me !!!</li>
            <li>Awesome toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and it is incredible.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of cleaning our mouth without worrying about flouride.</li>
            <li>I decided to tried the ginger stuff, and it does work great but doesn&#x27;t taste all that good.</li>
            <li>This just doesn&#x27;t taste good at all.</li>
            <li>Good brand and wholesome...</li>
            <li>This stuff is really good.  </li>
            <li>I have tried wintergreen, but found it caused mouth dryness, so I switched to this and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>It seems like a very healthy way to achieve oral cleanliness and I like that.  </li>
            <li>If you are adventurous give it a shot!      </li>
            <li>I should also mention 2 more good things about this toothpaste: 1.</li>
            <li>Leaves me with nice breath.</li>
            <li>This particular flavor is delicious.</li>
            <li>Superb in all respects and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly for me, and my mouth feels fresh and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>It is the best toothpaste I have bought so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flavor is an excellent balance of several flavors and the product&#x27;s consistency is near perfect.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love the taste.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible tasting like some toothpastes</li>
            <li>I love ginger -</li>
            <li>favorite toothpaste\\&quot; - but until then I will be reaching for Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpaste.    </li>
            <li>This is still better than Nature&#x27;s Gate and TOM toothpaste</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m used to the taste, I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I have recommended it to many others.  </li>
            <li>Love the ginger flavor.  </li>
            <li>I have used Desert Essence Toothpaste for years and was glad to see they had a ginger alternative.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S MY FAVORITE FLAVOR OF THE DESERT ESSENCE TOOTHPASTES!!!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am going back to the mint flavor which has some good teeth whitening benefits and tastes pleasant.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil is an important adjunct in view of my gum problems, so I would gladly give it six stars if I were able.</li>
            <li>Great flavor and very natural taste and feeling.</li>
            <li>This paste is very gentle and effective but the taste (albeit nice) is a tad too sweet.</li>
            <li>Great ginger taste for the 5 year old</li>
            <li>Being A-Z-N :) I love ginger, but this stuff was kind of too much and leaves a bit of an aftertaste.</li>
            <li>It actually tastes good!</li>
            <li>Nice mild taste and my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula, but I noticed that the tea tree oil isn&#x27;t as strong, which I now don&#x27;t mind since I am used to the flavor.</li>
            <li>If you like a very mild toothpaste perhaps you will enjoy this.</li>
            <li>I really love the desert essence mint toothpaste, and I also love ginger, so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to order three boxes of this stuff without trying it first.</li>
            <li>Love the ginger and fresh taste.</li>
            <li>I find myself brushing more often to keep my mouth feeling fresh with this lackluster toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but now I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy brushing with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with truly natural ingredients, works well, whitens teeth, taste good.  </li>
            <li>the tea tree oil hours after I&#x27;ve brushed and that&#x27;s very nice.  </li>
            <li>The taste is unique and might take some time to adjust to it.</li>
            <li>At first I found the tea tree oil to be a bit overwhelming, but have become used to it.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through all three tubes of this stuff without issue, but it&#x27;s far from spectacular.</li>
            <li>the taste of this toothpaste is unusual but gratifying; in addition the tea tree oil imparts a strong, clean aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong and easy on the teeth if you happen to be sensitive.</li>
            <li>Bottom Line: If you are going to dole out $5-$6 for a non-flouride toothpaste, make sure it doesn&#x27;t have Sulfates, and is packaged in the new white-blue boxes and not the beige-green box (tamper-proof seal).</li>
            <li>I love the ginger flavor, ginger is also a natural antiseptic, and it doesn&#x27;t ruin your tastebuds when you&#x27;re done brushing your teeth!  </li>
            <li>but I think worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is unique because you can really taste the tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>Better on my teeth than sensodyne; in fact I am on a short trip and forgot my Ginger Toothpaste</li>
            <li>It is pretty pricey for a toothpaste</li>
            <li>I recently was in NY and tried the mint all natural desert essences toothpaste, and really like how clean my teeth felt and that there was no awful after taste.</li>
            <li>Ginger is my favorite flavor of toothpaste, but this toothpaste is not particularly gingery.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste works fine and is what was described, but it tastes like chewing on ginger root, and I wake up in the middle of the night with that flavor in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Was really feeling this toothpaste</li>
            <li>Desert Essence&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil with Ginger toothpaste is very tasty.</li>
            <li>Much prefer the mint variety that I bought in a Whole Foods store.</li>
            <li>just really cannot stand the ginger.</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>The foaming action is just right, helping to keep what&#x27;s in your mouth, in your mouth.</li>
            <li>In terms of cleaning, I&#x27;d rate this toothpaste just average, but it tastes and feels so good, I&#x27;m likely to brush a bit longer.</li>
            <li>I particularly appreciate the way this toothpaste behaves in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel very, very clean after brushing and I can sometimes get a slight taste of</li>
            <li>I really do like the brand and the fact that this is all natural (my reason for two stars), but the taste of this flavor is just unbearable.</li>
            <li>With some tweaking I can see this being my \\&quot;new</li>
            <li>It does however, have an ingredient called \\&quot;Sodium Coco-Sulfate\\&quot; which some people say is a problem, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any problems to me, and I have very sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I see there are wildly varying comments on Amazon about it, but few thoughtful evaluations.</li>
            <li>So far, it has worked.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, Desert Essence&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil with Ginger toothpaste beats a dozen natural toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
            <li>Taste must be a personal thing, and I really dislike this.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try an affordable, natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>All natural products, bleeding problem with my gums have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>So sorry I bought 3 and will be giving it away to Good Will.</li>
            <li>Exactly the product I ordered and expected!!</li>
            <li>Odd at first,</li>
            <li>I tried this because I got tired of the mint flavors, but let me say, I love ginger, but this was definitely not for me.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about the ginger flavoring, but after the first initial \\&quot;shock\\&quot; we actually like it.</li>
            <li>This was on the shelves at Whole Foods before they recently took it down.</li>
            <li>Even better: no chance of fluorosis (the weird super-white spots that can appear on your teeth from too much fluoride -- in the water, in black tea, in soda pop, and again in your toothpaste).</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly tea tree flavored, either.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you find &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34; toothpaste to taste strange, synthetic and just odd.</li>
            <li> Pop loves it even though he&#x27;d always used harsh commercial fluoride toothpaste previously</li>
            <li> Other benefits are, it doesn&#x27;t have Fluoride or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.</li>
            <li> I recommend this over the other flavors.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Having tried several other natural and ginger flavored toothpastes, I would say that this ranks as solidly mediocre.</li>
            <li> To be fair the worst taste is at the beginning</li>
            <li> What it boils down to is 1.If you like ginger, which I do, you&#x27;ll like this toothpaste, and 2.</li>
            <li> Have you ever gone out drinking all night, puked up lots of beer, and then brushed your teeth only to still have the weird puke/mint aftertaste?</li>
            <li> The results are like pouring acid on the teeth&#x27; s nerves that are exposed due to excessive teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to become accustom to the taste of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> If you wish to avoid harsh chemicalized ingredients and fluoride, you&#x27;ll appreciate this product.</li>
            <li> Was grateful to find a toothpaste that sounded natural and was without any artificial sweetener.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste the past 6 months</li>
            <li> it was hard to find tooth paste that didn&#x27;t contain some type of mint or wasn&#x27;t a children&#x27;s toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Disappointing flavor and performance</li>
            <li> It tastes worst than chewing on a ginger root.</li>
            <li> Mint and alike seems so boring after this one.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Been using this for months. Love the ginger and fresh taste. Cost much less than at our local health food store</li>
            <li> Great ginger taste for the 5 year old</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is awesome!  I love the ginger flavor, ginger is also a natural antiseptic, and it doesn&#x27;t ruin your tastebuds when you&#x27;re done brushing your teeth!  Even better: no chance of fluorosis (the weird super-white spots that can appear on your teeth from too much fluoride -- in the water, in black tea, in soda pop, and again in your toothpaste). Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients. The taste is unique and might take some time to adjust to it.</li>
            <li> I love the taste.  Not too strong and easy on the teeth if you happen to be sensitive.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the best tasting of all toothpastes. It actually tastes good! Other benefits are, it doesn&#x27;t have Fluoride or Sodium Lauryl Sulfate. Both of these ingredients can cause cancer and canker sores. It does however, have an ingredient called \\&quot;Sodium Coco-Sulfate\\&quot; which some people say is a problem, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any problems to me, and I have very sensitive gums. I should also mention 2 more good things about this toothpaste: 1. Tee Tree Oil and 2. Ginger (both fight canker sores). So if you get a lot of mouth blisters, I would recommend Desert Essence. It&#x27;s a step above almost ALL toothpastes.</li>
            <li> After developing an allergy to mint it was hard to find tooth paste that didn&#x27;t contain some type of mint or wasn&#x27;t a children&#x27;s toothpaste.  After searching I found the Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil and Ginger toothpaste at a local grocery store that carries organic/natural items.  At first I found the tea tree oil to be a bit overwhelming, but have become used to it.  The grocery store stopped carrying this toothpaste, so I searched Amazon and found it.  It is cheaper to get the the larger tubes (the grocery store only sold the 3.5 oz tubes) and the 3-pack saves on shipping and lasts for a while since I am the only one who uses it. I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula, but I noticed that the tea tree oil isn&#x27;t as strong, which I now don&#x27;t mind since I am used to the flavor.</li>
            <li> Was really feeling this toothpaste</li>
            <li> Best. Toothpaste. Ever. Nice mild taste and my teeth feel really clean. Leaves me with nice breath. I recommend this over the other flavors.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to the other reviewers. This just doesn&#x27;t taste good at all. I dread having to use up 3 tubes of this toothpaste. It tastes worst than chewing on a ginger root. To be fair the worst taste is at the beginning and it subsides some as you start to brush, but there is an after taste that stays longer than you want  it to.</li>
            <li> Ginger is my favorite flavor of toothpaste, but this toothpaste is not particularly gingery. It&#x27;s not particularly tea tree flavored, either. I&#x27;ve gone through all three tubes of this stuff without issue, but it&#x27;s far from spectacular. I find myself brushing more often to keep my mouth feeling fresh with this lackluster toothpaste. If you like a very mild toothpaste perhaps you will enjoy this. It&#x27;s not terrible tasting like some toothpastes so I&#x27;ll give it that. Having tried several other natural and ginger flavored toothpastes, I would say that this ranks as solidly mediocre.</li>
            <li> It is the best toothpaste I have bought so far. Mot keeps your teeth white as well.</li>
            <li> I love ginger - the taste of this toothpaste is unusual but gratifying; in addition the tea tree oil imparts a strong, clean aftertaste.  If you are adventurous give it a shot!      The Desert Essence Ginger does not have flouride, but the tubes I bought do have SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate).  Reports of SLS causing canker make this a big drawback.  Desert Essence is in the process of repackaging this product, and I assume they&#x27;ve redesigned the future ingredients to exclude SLS.      Also, there was no tamper-proof seal on the toothpaste tube I bought.  I bought a \\&quot;white\\&quot; packaged Desert Essence Mint toothpaste and it did have a foil seal.      With some tweaking I can see this being my \\&quot;new favorite toothpaste\\&quot; - but until then I will be reaching for Nature&#x27;s Gate toothpaste.    Bottom Line: If you are going to dole out $5-$6 for a non-flouride toothpaste, make sure it doesn&#x27;t have Sulfates, and is packaged in the new white-blue boxes and not the beige-green box (tamper-proof seal).</li>
            <li> This paste is very gentle and effective but the taste (albeit nice) is a tad too sweet. This is still better than Nature&#x27;s Gate and TOM toothpaste and I&#x27;ll continue using it. Pop loves it even though he&#x27;d always used harsh commercial fluoride toothpaste previously</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil toothpaste was recommended to us a decade ago to prevent and cure gum disease. So far, it has worked. This particular flavor is delicious. I have tried wintergreen, but found it caused mouth dryness, so I switched to this and have been very pleased. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Disappointing flavor and performance</li>
            <li> The price was the same as found at my local Vitamin Shoppe. Better on my teeth than sensodyne; in fact I am on a short trip and forgot my Ginger Toothpaste so I purchased a tube of the very same Sensodyne I&#x27;ve used before. The results are like pouring acid on the teeth&#x27; s nerves that are exposed due to excessive teeth grinding. I am running back to the Ginger Toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Cleans well, and the taste is definitely an acquired one.  Odd at first, but now I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Desert Essence&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil with Ginger toothpaste is very tasty. It&#x27;s flavor is an excellent balance of several flavors and the product&#x27;s consistency is near perfect. I particularly appreciate the way this toothpaste behaves in your mouth. The foaming action is just right, helping to keep what&#x27;s in your mouth, in your mouth. In terms of cleaning, I&#x27;d rate this toothpaste just average, but it tastes and feels so good, I&#x27;m likely to brush a bit longer. Bottom line, Desert Essence&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil with Ginger toothpaste beats a dozen natural toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
            <li> I really love the desert essence mint toothpaste, and I also love ginger, so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to order three boxes of this stuff without trying it first. Wrong. Have you ever gone out drinking all night, puked up lots of beer, and then brushed your teeth only to still have the weird puke/mint aftertaste? That is what this toothpaste tastes like, I sh*t you not. I tried it once and then gave it to my husband who couldn&#x27;t stand it either. I ended up throwing all three tubes out because I can&#x27;t imagine anyone would want this. I am going back to the mint flavor which has some good teeth whitening benefits and tastes pleasant. I really do like the brand and the fact that this is all natural (my reason for two stars), but the taste of this flavor is just unbearable.</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to become accustom to the taste of this toothpaste.  It is unique because you can really taste the tea tree oil.  Now that I&#x27;m used to the taste, I love it.  My teeth feel very, very clean after brushing and I can sometimes get a slight taste of the tea tree oil hours after I&#x27;ve brushed and that&#x27;s very nice.  It seems like a very healthy way to achieve oral cleanliness and I like that.  So far, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Was grateful to find a toothpaste that sounded natural and was without any artificial sweetener. Taste must be a personal thing, and I really dislike this. The toothpaste works fine and is what was described, but it tastes like chewing on ginger root, and I wake up in the middle of the night with that flavor in my mouth. So sorry I bought 3 and will be giving it away to Good Will. Much prefer the mint variety that I bought in a Whole Foods store. Good brand and wholesome...just really cannot stand the ginger.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t want Flouride in my body and I cannot have any mint in my mouth (husband is allergic to mint !),  this is the best toothpaste for me !!!</li>
            <li> I adore this product. Beats the socks off all others I&#x27;ve tried over the years, and I haven&#x27;t used commercial varieties like Crest for decades. I see there are wildly varying comments on Amazon about it, but few thoughtful evaluations. What it boils down to is 1.If you like ginger, which I do, you&#x27;ll like this toothpaste, and 2. If you wish to avoid harsh chemicalized ingredients and fluoride, you&#x27;ll appreciate this product. It works perfectly for me, and my mouth feels fresh and clean after using it. The tea tree oil is an important adjunct in view of my gum problems, so I would gladly give it six stars if I were able. Superb in all respects and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recently was in NY and tried the mint all natural desert essences toothpaste, and really like how clean my teeth felt and that there was no awful after taste. I decided to tried the ginger stuff, and it does work great but doesn&#x27;t taste all that good. Being A-Z-N :) I love ginger, but this stuff was kind of too much and leaves a bit of an aftertaste. I would recommend the mint.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product and I have recommended it to many others.  If your teeth or gums hurt, you should use this product until you can see your dentist.  It really helps.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try an affordable, natural toothpaste. I was a little worried about the ginger flavoring, but after the first initial \\&quot;shock\\&quot; we actually like it. Does a great job of cleaning our mouth without worrying about flouride.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good.  It&#x27;s made with truly natural ingredients, works well, whitens teeth, taste good.  Love the ginger flavor.  It is pretty pricey for a toothpaste but I think worth the money.</li>
            <li> Exactly the product I ordered and expected!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome toothpaste. The taste takes some getting used to but eventually you don&#x27;t realize the bitterness. Helps stop my tooth pain and helps scrub any plaque buildup off my teeth</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste the past 6 months and it is incredible. All natural products, bleeding problem with my gums have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I got tired of the mint flavors, but let me say, I love ginger, but this was definitely not for me. Floride-free toothpaste already has a hardtime giving you that &amp;#34;fresh breath&amp;#34; feeling. This will definitely leave you hanging.</li>
            <li> I have used Desert Essence Toothpaste for years and was glad to see they had a ginger alternative. Enough said.</li>
            <li> This was on the shelves at Whole Foods before they recently took it down. I was thinking, &amp;#34;WHAT?! IT&#x27;S MY FAVORITE FLAVOR OF THE DESERT ESSENCE TOOTHPASTES!!!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I think search Amazon and found it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unique flavor through and through. Earthy aroma with the tea tree. Mint and alike seems so boring after this one.</li>
            <li> Great flavor and very natural taste and feeling. If you are like me, you find &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34; toothpaste to taste strange, synthetic and just odd. I really enjoy brushing with this toothpaste.</li>
