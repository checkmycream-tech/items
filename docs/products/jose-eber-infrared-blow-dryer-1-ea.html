            <li>Does a wonderful job with my hair.  </li>
            <li>Best blow dryer ever!  </li>
            <li>Amika is an excellent product used it for a year</li>
            <li>but this JOSE EBER IS THE BEST!</li>
            <li>Best blowdryer I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Jose Eber&#x27;s Infrared Blow Dryer is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>It also has taken away my fly away hair.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>My kids thought it was very cool to watch, but mom wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend said \\&quot;your hair looks good, you can tell a difference.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I initially loved this dryer.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I found the Blow Dryer is good for my hair.</li>
            <li>My wife love it, it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>I put it in the mail today, but was impressed with the quick good response from the seller I would buy from them again for sure.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>My clients and I love it!</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li>this dryer, leaves my hair smooth and looking really great for just blowdrying.</li>
            <li>She borrowed this to use on her hair and said she liked it as well</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>THIS BLOWDRYER IS THE BEST ONE I VE TRIED THUS FAR</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I was able to get such a great price through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer is fantastic!</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer is my latest obsession.</li>
            <li>Anyone with scalp issues will love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I have already recommended Jose Eber Infrared Blow Dryer to many of my friends.  </li>
            <li>Love the life-time warranty</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cooler to use and does a much better job of drying my hair</li>
            <li>For the price, I was expecting more of a miracle.  </li>
            <li>The infrared light is nice because you can also see where the heat is being directed on the hair when using it, that is not the purpose of the light (it is the heat source) but it is again an added bonus.</li>
            <li>, let me just say I was hooked after the very first use and continue to love it.  </li>
            <li>AND it is so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and allows me to keep the perfect blown out look for a few days until my hair gets greasy</li>
            <li>Perhaps a more realistic review would be appropriate in some years ahead to establish what its longevity may be.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it burns my scalp and shoulders.</li>
            <li>All in all, this hair dryer is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>But my hair is more smooth and straight after using this thing.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it to smooth my bangs and the angled pieces around my face and maybe run over the top layer of hair quickly if I have any flyaways on a rainy day.</li>
            <li>This was a gift to someone who has chronic parasites that love moisture, so the fast drying is helpful.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t find that to be true at all.  </li>
            <li>The air coming out of the drier does not feel that hot, as with a traditional dryer, I&#x27;d say its more warm even on the hottest setting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of heavy but does a nice job.</li>
            <li>I think that if you have fine, straight hair, that claim might ring true.</li>
            <li>so that I am writing my first review EVER!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and thought that this would be healthier for my hair if it really worked (ie- didn&#x27;t cause heat damage as specified in the products description).  </li>
            <li>this is an awesome dryer, I have color treated hair, very thick and wavy.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The blog was just a girl saying that this blow dryer was part of her daily routine and that she really liked it.  </li>
            <li>which will be nice especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>The time it cut out made it well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I wondered if it was worth it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the $.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you are blow drying hair out with a round brush, it might make a difference, but if you are drying naturally curly hair, you won&#x27;t be impressed!</li>
            <li>the control buttons are on the handle, which is right where your fingers go</li>
            <li>It intrigued me, mainly because of the infrared light.  </li>
            <li>This dryer really dries quickly w/o damaging my hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I bought a second one for home!</li>
            <li>I read reviews before purchasing and they all seemed pretty positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>A bonus is you aren&#x27;t so hot and sweaty</li>
            <li>There is a lifetime guarantee on the dryer, but only if you purchase it from authorized resellers, so make sure to check Jose Eber&#x27;s website for a list of stores.</li>
            <li>When I got it home and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>(I am also a user of the LED light systems for your skin) but it isn&#x27;t something that you really notice a difference it, especially if you are blow drying clean hair in the first place.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice looking hair dryer, but unfortunately for me, looks don&#x27;t make my hair smooth!!  </li>
            <li>THe blue light is interesting, it is supposed to kill bacteria and clean the hair as you dry.</li>
            <li>and I noticed that my hair dried much faster and styled more easily than when I used the one I have at home.</li>
            <li>We looked forward to using this dryer to smooth our hair, reduce frizz, and dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Most blow dryers turn my hair to frizz and dry it out.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone who wants a really nice blow dryer that will save them time and money on other products!</li>
            <li>I also believe if this dryer really did what it claims they wouldn&#x27;t keep lowering the price.  </li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON FOR HAVING THIS DRYER</li>
            <li>I go through dryers fast because I use them on every client.</li>
            <li>The blower was delivered in a timely manner and seems to work very well indeed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The description makes you believe this is better than other dryers</li>
            <li>When I used the high speed to try and expedite the drying process it left huge tangled knots in my hair that had to be cut out.  </li>
            <li>It does cut down how much time I need to use my flat iron, so it is good in that regard.</li>
            <li>top down in a convertible on the highway.  </li>
            <li>This dryer gives more body to my hair and drys my hair in half the time.  </li>
            <li>This dryer was supposed to dry my hair faster and leave me with silky smooth hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use not hot on hair</li>
            <li>This blow dryer really does cut down on drying time and lessens the friz with my fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out the hair and is very fast drying</li>
            <li>Whether I was at top heat and speed or not, my hair didn&#x27;t dry any quicker than my regular hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>This dryer does dry hair so quickly and without harming the hair.</li>
            <li>I read somewhere that it will make your hair feel smooth enough so that you don&#x27;t need to flat iron, but I&#x27;d have to disagree with that.</li>
            <li>Love my dryer; it&#x27;s a little heavier &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry my hair that much faster</li>
            <li>I ordered this blow dryer after reading about it on a blog I frequent.  </li>
            <li>It was soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I paid much more than it is currently being sold for and feel I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li>I like the low heat and even the cool air dry</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>This happened every time I used the high setting and sometimes even on the low setting.  </li>
            <li>I have really super thick hair and this dryer really does the trick.</li>
            <li>Although the air was not intensely hot, I had to turn down the air flow so because the top spot blew my hair all over the place.  </li>
            <li>It does dry fast</li>
            <li>and if I bend over and blow dry all my hair while pulling hands through it, it makes my hair stick straight without even using a brush.  </li>
            <li>I would expect things to work well on delivery; I pay a higher than average price for goods in the expectation they will be very durable and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap Conair dryer that normally would take at least 45 minutes to get my hair completely dry.</li>
            <li>In fact, there is no doubt that it does not dry faster.  </li>
            <li>It would normally take 20 minutes to dry with a regular Conair dryer.</li>
            <li>It dried my thick curly hair fast, and smooth.</li>
            <li>The infrared feature dries without the high levels of heat used by conventional hair dryers.</li>

            <li> The infrared feature dries without the high levels of heat used by conventional hair dryers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy, but worth the extra weight and when it takes less time, the extra weight doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> I usually flat iron after I blow dry to tame some frizz (I have naturally curly hair that I always wear straight because I don&#x27;t like it curly when its long which it is).</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the short life span of this dryer because I really loved it while it worked.</li>
            <li> It took equally as long as my regular hair dryer to dry my hair and it was equally frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I was really nervous about splurging on this hair dryer, since reviews on it are hard to come by.</li>
            <li> but you aren&#x27;t holding it that long.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> pretty heavy! But my hair is more smooth and straight after using this thing.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is efficient without frying your hair. It locks in the moisture. I could never go back to another blow dryer after using this one. The blow dryer itself is a bit on the heavy side, but that, to me, is probably the only con. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is fantastic! My daughter has very, very, very thick hair; instead of taking 45 mins to dry her hair with a standard blow dryer...with the Jose Eber it only takes 6 mins to dry!!!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is amazing.  It does dry fast and if I bend over and blow dry all my hair while pulling hands through it, it makes my hair stick straight without even using a brush.  It also has taken away my fly away hair.  I am so happy that I was able to get such a great price through Amazon.  I am a happy camper!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of heavy but does a nice job.</li>
            <li> My wife love it, it was a great purchase. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with this blow dryer...cut the time it takes in half.</li>
            <li> I ordered this blow dryer after reading about it on a blog I frequent.  The blog was just a girl saying that this blow dryer was part of her daily routine and that she really liked it.  But it was not a paid endorsement.  It intrigued me, mainly because of the infrared light.  I have fine hair and thought that this would be healthier for my hair if it really worked (ie- didn&#x27;t cause heat damage as specified in the products description).  I read reviews before purchasing and they all seemed pretty positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me just say I was hooked after the very first use and continue to love it.  Enough so that I am writing my first review EVER! My hair dried faster.  It was soooo soft. AND it is so smooth.  I usually flat iron after I blow dry to tame some frizz (I have naturally curly hair that I always wear straight because I don&#x27;t like it curly when its long which it is). I find that I hardly have to touch my hair with the straightening iron after blow drying.  I mainly use it to smooth my bangs and the angled pieces around my face and maybe run over the top layer of hair quickly if I have any flyaways on a rainy day. My hair looks and feels better.  Even my boyfriend said \\&quot;your hair looks good, you can tell a difference.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom has VERY thick hair.  She borrowed this to use on her hair and said she liked it as well and she felt that it dried her hair faster, too.  She had only used it once since, but is considering getting one for herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes: The air coming out of the drier does not feel that hot, as with a traditional dryer, I&#x27;d say its more warm even on the hottest setting.  But it is supposed to be that way as to dry the hair from the inside out.  A bonus is you aren&#x27;t so hot and sweaty which will be nice especially in the summer. There are 3 each of heat and speed settings which is nice, plus a cold shot button.  THe blue light is interesting, it is supposed to kill bacteria and clean the hair as you dry. I do believe this (I am also a user of the LED light systems for your skin) but it isn&#x27;t something that you really notice a difference it, especially if you are blow drying clean hair in the first place.  But it couldn&#x27;t hurt. The infrared light is nice because you can also see where the heat is being directed on the hair when using it, that is not the purpose of the light (it is the heat source) but it is again an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I have really super thick hair and this dryer really does the trick. It gets my hair from wet to dry in just a few minutes. It would normally take 20 minutes to dry with a regular Conair dryer. Its a quality product and comes with a lifetime warranty. Don&#x27;t feel bad about the cost because you will be glad you bought it.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is my latest obsession. Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and allows me to keep the perfect blown out look for a few days until my hair gets greasy and I have to wash it. Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> I initially loved this dryer. I have very long THICK wavy hair &amp; a lot of it. I previously only uses the babyliss dryers (Pro TT ect.). In comparison - this dryer did the job quicker - same silky results (so no difference there). The time it cut out made it well worth the price. So in that regard I would highly recommend this to anyone especially with very thick hair.... I purchased this dryer last July (2014) over the past month the dryer has been producing a burnt hair smell and smoke comes out of the backend when I turn it off. The smell is really awful &amp; it appears that they dryer is already starting to die (I clean the filter after each use so it&#x27;s not from that). I only use it 2 MAYBE 3 times a week (30/45 min each time). I am disappointed in the short life span of this dryer because I really loved it while it worked.</li>
            <li> Anyone with scalp issues will love this dryer. Does not dry out the hair and is very fast drying This was a gift to someone who has chronic parasites that love moisture, so the fast drying is helpful.</li>
            <li> This dryer really dries quickly w/o damaging my hair.  I usually let my hair air dry but it takes about 3 hrs. But this dryer dries my hair in 10 minutes and my hair feels/looks great !</li>
            <li> I returned this dryer because it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This dryer does dry hair so quickly and without harming the hair. Some think it is too heavy, but you hold it for a much shorter time.</li>
            <li> My color treated hair loves this blow dryer.  This dryer gives more body to my hair and drys my hair in half the time.  I have already recommended Jose Eber Infrared Blow Dryer to many of my friends.  Love the life-time warranty</li>
            <li> I actually never used this after I read the instructions and they warned of high heat and being careful not to burn yourself and don&#x27;t lay it on a hard surface, etc. etc. I wondered if it was worth it so I contacted the seller and asked to send it back and got an immediate email with a label to print out to send it back. No questions asked, not even if I&#x27;d used it, which I hadn&#x27;t. I put it in the mail today, but was impressed with the quick good response from the seller I would buy from them again for sure.</li>
            <li> It is too heavy, whatever product I use for setting my hair like gel my hair gets lymp so I have to use hair spray to give it  volume. Otherwise I found the Blow Dryer is good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was really nervous about splurging on this hair dryer, since reviews on it are hard to come by. I am so glad I did! I have insanely thick hair that reaches the middle of my back. I had a cheap Conair dryer that normally would take at least 45 minutes to get my hair completely dry. This infrared blow dryer dries my hair in 10 minutes! I love that it doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it burns my scalp and shoulders. I read somewhere that it will make your hair feel smooth enough so that you don&#x27;t need to flat iron, but I&#x27;d have to disagree with that. My hair is a weird wavy texture, so it could just be me. It does cut down how much time I need to use my flat iron, so it is good in that regard. I think that if you have fine, straight hair, that claim might ring true. There is a lifetime guarantee on the dryer, but only if you purchase it from authorized resellers, so make sure to check Jose Eber&#x27;s website for a list of stores. Unfortunately, Amazon isn&#x27;t one of them, so keep that in mind! All in all, this hair dryer is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My wife was going through a blow dryer every couple of months.  This one is expensive but it&#x27;s built to last and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  Does a wonderful job with my hair.  I would recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> Over rated and under delivered.  Too expensive for how it performs.  I cannot tell any difference in the drying time as compared to a regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this dryer.  The description makes you believe this is better than other dryers but I think it&#x27;s worse.  After using it for several months I&#x27;ve gone back to my regular dryer.  They claim it&#x27;s supposed to dry your hair faster, I didn&#x27;t find that to be true at all.  In fact, there is no doubt that it does not dry faster.  When I used the high speed to try and expedite the drying process it left huge tangled knots in my hair that had to be cut out.  This happened every time I used the high setting and sometimes even on the low setting.  You should haven&#x27;t to cut tangles out of your hair just by blowing it dry.  It also says it &amp;#34;Blow Dryer helps to cleanse the hair as it dries, removing any bacteria or buildup leading to greater shine, smoother hair, and easier styling.&amp;#34;  I was always skeptical about how a blow dryer could &amp;#34;cleanse the hair as it dries&amp;#34;.. But I saw no increase in shine, smoother hair or easier styling.  I paid much more than it is currently being sold for and feel I wasted my money.  I also believe if this dryer really did what it claims they wouldn&#x27;t keep lowering the price.  Buyer beware</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer ever!  Gave my AMIKA to my daughter.  Amika is an excellent product used it for a year but this JOSE EBER IS THE BEST! HAIR LOOKS SHINIER!  Easy to use not hot on hair</li>
            <li> My daughter has had one of these dryers for several years. It used it every time I visited her and I noticed that my hair dried much faster and styled more easily than when I used the one I have at home. I finally decided to buy one and I am thrilled with it. The infrared feature dries without the high levels of heat used by conventional hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Amazing! This blow dryer really does cut down on drying time and lessens the friz with my fine wavy hair. It&#x27;s a little heavy, but worth the extra weight and when it takes less time, the extra weight doesn&#x27;t really matter. I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone who wants a really nice blow dryer that will save them time and money on other products!</li>
            <li> Best blowdryer I have ever had.  If you have long thick hair it&#x27;s worth the $.</li>
            <li> THIS BLOWDRYER IS THE BEST ONE I VE TRIED THUS FAR I DRIED MY HAIR IN 5 MIN WHAT BEFORE IT TOOK FOREVER THANKS AMAZON FOR HAVING THIS DRYER</li>
            <li> We looked forward to using this dryer to smooth our hair, reduce frizz, and dry quickly. It not only did none of those things, but it wouldn&#x27;t style -- despite constant coercing with a round brush, my hair ended up looking windblown. We returned it.</li>
            <li> Jose Eber&#x27;s Infrared Blow Dryer is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever used!! Would recommend it to anyone! It is a little pricey but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist. I Have been doing hair for 20 years! I go through dryers fast because I use them on every client. My T3 recently kicked the bucket so I was in search for another dryer. I bought one for work. When I got it home and used it for the first time. It dried my thick curly hair fast, and smooth. When I used it I had less frizz! I liked it so much, I bought a second one for home! My clients and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love my dryer; it&#x27;s a little heavier &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry my hair that much faster but it&#x27;s cooler to use and does a much better job of drying my hair</li>
            <li> The blower was delivered in a timely manner and seems to work very well indeed.  Perhaps a more realistic review would be appropriate in some years ahead to establish what its longevity may be.  I would expect things to work well on delivery; I pay a higher than average price for goods in the expectation they will be very durable and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I wanted. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a nice looking hair dryer, but unfortunately for me, looks don&#x27;t make my hair smooth!!  My kids thought it was very cool to watch, but mom wasn&#x27;t impressed.  I have naturally curly hair and usually let it air dry, but sometimes I need to dry it.  Most blow dryers turn my hair to frizz and dry it out.  This dryer was supposed to dry my hair faster and leave me with silky smooth hair.  I didn&#x27;t get either of those.  It took equally as long as my regular hair dryer to dry my hair and it was equally frizzy.  The dryer blows seriously strong-think top down in a convertible on the highway.  Although the air was not intensely hot, I had to turn down the air flow so because the top spot blew my hair all over the place.  Whether I was at top heat and speed or not, my hair didn&#x27;t dry any quicker than my regular hair dryer.  For the price, I was expecting more of a miracle.  Perhaps if you are blow drying hair out with a round brush, it might make a difference, but if you are drying naturally curly hair, you won&#x27;t be impressed!</li>
            <li> this is an awesome dryer, I have color treated hair, very thick and wavy. I have problems with breakage and frizzies. this dryer, leaves my hair smooth and looking really great for just blowdrying. I like the low heat and even the cool air dry it gives me. I would not say it dries my hair any faster, but truly does do it healthier. the dryer is a little heavy but you aren&#x27;t holding it that long. the control buttons are on the handle, which is right where your fingers go and I have switched drying levels not meaning to, but I am just careful where my fingers rest. I would recommend this dryer to anyone who has thick color treated hair.</li>
