            <li>I solved both problems with this great mirror.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>product was great, although getting it to me in a timely fashion wasn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>Mirror looks good and works good.</li>
            <li>Good for eyebrow tweezing</li>
            <li>Good description, provided all hardware to install.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is an exceptional aid for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>Nice finish, looks good and woeks good.  </li>
            <li>The finish and functionality is of top quality and looks great.  </li>
            <li>They love it!</li>
            <li>We are satisfied customers!</li>
            <li>this is a very nice additon to the master bath , the light, the size.</li>
            <li>perfect size, swings easily and lights up just-right (not too bright, not too dim).</li>
            <li>good, but could use a stronger light</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, the 5X magnification of my face scared me, but it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Finish is nice and magnification not too strong.</li>
            <li>Before I drill a hole in my wall I want to make sure I won&#x27;t need to change the bulbs or batteries all the time.</li>
            <li>We were able to install better ones we found and they are staying in wall.</li>
            <li>BUT, the lighting and magnification are just OK.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The 5X magnification is more than sufficient for my intended use.  </li>
            <li>The light is just bright enough for those up-close eyebrow-plucking jobs we all enjoy so much (lol) or anything else.  </li>
            <li>so am I. Great selection on Amazon and was able to find the brushed nickel finish which practically no one carries</li>
            <li>install was easy - use the cord for now, will hard-wire it when I have some time.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;electrician installed and said installation was easy</li>
            <li>It was easy to hang.  </li>
            <li>I will turn it again and it will turn on/off just fine.  </li>
            <li>The arm moves smoothly and holds the mirror well at any angle.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something with a brighter light.  </li>
            <li>Light should be flourescent or nothing at all.</li>
            <li>Just right for us !</li>
            <li>This is the perfect makeup mirror , the only problem I had was the switch was striped only after the first use, but was an easy fix with super glue</li>
            <li>I had another one before, and the light was much brighter.  </li>
            <li>If I had it to do over again, I would buy a larger mirror with more magnification and brighter light.</li>
            <li>The halo light is adequate as long as there is another light on in the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light is very dim.</li>
            <li>Price point very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The light is too dim.</li>
            <li>Should have ordered slightly higher magnifier</li>
            <li>This light is only 25 watts, yuk!  </li>
            <li>My wife wanted a mirror and this is what she chose.shipped fast and was just what she wanted</li>
            <li>I really like this item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was very well packaged when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>The only minus thing is the light really is not that bright.  </li>
            <li>As we grow older</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am particular when it comes to quality &amp; service.  </li>
            <li>Purchase this magnifying mirror for our young adult daughters bathroom.</li>
            <li>This one barely makes a difference between on and off.</li>
            <li>I am a 45 year old male that keeps unwanted hairs trimmed or plucked.  </li>
            <li>The light is not very bright, and the left side is in shadow from the overhead lights.  </li>

            <li> I thought this was a different brand than the other mirrors I reviewed, but I have the same complaint. The light is too dim. Before I drill a hole in my wall I want to make sure I won&#x27;t need to change the bulbs or batteries all the time. I sent this product back.</li>

            <li> This mirror exceeds my dear wife&#x27;s expectations so she is happy. And it follows of course so am I. Great selection on Amazon and was able to find the brushed nickel finish which practically no one carries</li>
            <li> Purchase this magnifying mirror for our young adult daughters bathroom. They love it! We had our contractor remove a medicine chest, fill in the wall,etc then he hard wired it and mounted it. Finish is nice and magnification not too strong. Price point very reasonable. We are satisfied customers!</li>
            <li> Light is very dim. I had another one before, and the light was much brighter.  This one barely makes a difference between on and off.</li>
            <li> The light is not very bright, and the left side is in shadow from the overhead lights.  If I had it to do over again, I would buy a larger mirror with more magnification and brighter light.</li>
            <li> Mirror looks good and works good. My issue is that the bolts wouldn&#x27;t hold it in drywall. We were able to install better ones we found and they are staying in wall.</li>
            <li> install was easy - use the cord for now, will hard-wire it when I have some time. perfect size, swings easily and lights up just-right (not too bright, not too dim). the on/off switch cover came off on shipping, but I&#x27;ll just glue it back on instead of returning for a replacement. I had asked for one at Christmas - got two units (Santa heard me) and this one is the one we kept.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect makeup mirror , the only problem I had was the switch was striped only after the first use, but was an easy fix with super glue</li>
            <li> BUT, the lighting and magnification are just OK. I was hoping this would replace a mirror on my dresser with this wall mount in the BR. Good for eyebrow tweezing</li>
            <li> This mirror is used daily and I love it.  As we grow older the eyes get dimmer.  This mirror is an exceptional aid for applying makeup.  I would be lost without it and I miss it when I travel. The only minus thing is the light really is not that bright.  I never turn mine on because it does not enhance the mirror.</li>
            <li> missing extra as advertized in your ad  on amizon  i i i i i i i i i i  i</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on this mirror, I felt it would fulfill my needs of extra lighting and magnification without having to hold a mirror.  I value space and neatness as well and it fits these specifications wonderfully. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> At 76 the vision is not so great. Trying to shave was a problem and the light was bad. I solved both problems with this great mirror. The first time I used it, the 5X magnification of my face scared me, but it&#x27;s great. Susan loves it for her make-up applications.</li>
            <li> I wanted something with a brighter light.  This light is only 25 watts, yuk!  Light should be flourescent or nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Good description, provided all hardware to install.  Works great.  Nice finish, looks good and woeks good.  Easy to install.  Recommend it.</li>
            <li> Should have ordered slightly higher magnifier</li>
            <li> product was great, although getting it to me in a timely fashion wasn&#x27;t so great. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I mounted this on the wall with out a problem.  The two things I would mention, a tad small and a tad dim but the quality makes up for these.</li>
            <li> Just what it said it was. My wife wanted a mirror and this is what she chose.shipped fast and was just what she wanted</li>
            <li> this is a very nice additon to the master bath , the light, the size. Just right for us !</li>
            <li> I looked a while to find the perfect wall mounted vanity mirror for myself.  I really like this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;beautiful nickel design&lt;br /&gt;works great&lt;br /&gt;electrician installed and said installation was easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch sometimes doesn&#x27;t work.  I am not sure if this is because I turn it in a weird way and maybe it doesn&#x27;t turn all the way or what the issue is.  Basically when I turn the knob sometimes it will not turn on/off.  I will turn it again and it will turn on/off just fine.  This doesn&#x27;t happen often though.</li>
            <li> Works. good, but could use a stronger light</li>
            <li> I debated between purchasing a 5X and 10X magnification mirror.  To keep the cost down; I opted for this 5X magnification mirror.  I did not regret my decision.  The 5X magnification is more than sufficient for my intended use.  I am a 45 year old male that keeps unwanted hairs trimmed or plucked.  The halo light is adequate as long as there is another light on in the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am particular when it comes to quality &amp; service.  This mirror exceeded all my expectations.  It was very well packaged when it arrived.  It was easy to hang.  The finish and functionality is of top quality and looks great.  This mirror is a GREAT value!!  I am going to purchase an additional one as a gift for a friend.</li>
