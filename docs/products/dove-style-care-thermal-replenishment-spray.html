            <li>Ultra light weight and smells amazing &amp;#60;33</li>
            <li>I love this thermal spray.</li>

            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, this is my second purchase, dove has excellent products</li>
            <li>It was very lightweight but very effective.</li>
            <li>It sprays in a fine mist just like water would spray out.</li>
            <li>From the very first use I was in love.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I like how light it is and that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel over processed after heat styling.</li>
            <li>Add on top of that my scalp condition causes my hair to be very greasy around the top</li>
            <li>If needed, I spray a bit more later in the day to remove more frizz and supply more curl.  </li>
            <li>Amazing products nmakes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>so as you can imagine, my hair is full of damage and not looking its best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great spray, I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other.</li>
            <li>you have no scalp problems and are not prone to oily hair you may be able to use more than I do and seal out the humidity a little better.</li>
            <li>My hair has not felt this good in a long time.</li>
            <li>its cheap, smells good, its a little sitcky, buy i cant live without it</li>
            <li>have very long, very think hair that I love to straighten.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use much at all on the lower sections</li>
            <li>The smell stays in my hair all day and my hair looks so much better after using this compared to other products I have tried using recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product !</li>
            <li>Last time I saw my stylist, she commented on my hair being very soft and full.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>First off, I love that this product can be used on wet OR dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very soft, silky and manageable after using.</li>
            <li>I like this stuff so far!</li>
            <li>but I was surprised that it is none of those!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m black, white, creek &amp; Cherokee Indian so this spray is a life saver. :)</li>
            <li>Hair was soft and my hair didn&#x27;t smell like it was burning when I used heat.</li>
            <li>I have medium length, thin to medium thickness hair with an obnoxious wave that is just curly enough to cause knotting, but not enough to look cute, so I have to hot iron and/or</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far though.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t attract gunk during the day and stayed soft and frizz-free, even though I live in a wet climate.</li>
            <li>and it does not dry the hair out..</li>
            <li>Mine will start to get a little wavy if it is humid, but keep in mind that I am not using much at all, maybe just6-7 sprays for ALL of my hair from shower to finished hair.</li>

            <li> I have used this product for straightening my hair for a long time, but now I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried about buying a product that isn&#x27;t specifically suited for African American hair</li>
            <li> My hair had gotten so dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> She has medium weight, wavy hair that tends to get dry.</li>
            <li> You and use this on hair that is going to be ironed or just blow dry</li>
            <li> I sometimes just use this after shampooing and let it hair dry ..</li>
            <li> every couple days or so--I need all the natural oils I can get and to keep my expensive color lasting.</li>
            <li> It is all the way down my back and naturally curly, which means difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> Hate that this is no longer available in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> so I find it hard to use ANY products in my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of very expensive products and this beats them all..</li>

            <li> It could be better. but is ok. I like it.</li>
            <li> Great spray, I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other. Ultra light weight and smells amazing &amp;#60;33</li>
            <li> I like this stuff so far! Last time I saw my stylist, she commented on my hair being very soft and full. I told her I was using this (*gasp*, a non-salon product), she laughed and told me not to tell her this stuff. Anyway, I like how light it is and that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel over processed after heat styling. I have medium length, thin to medium thickness hair with an obnoxious wave that is just curly enough to cause knotting, but not enough to look cute, so I have to hot iron and/or blow-dry straighten my hair every time I wash it (which is only once every couple days or so--I need all the natural oils I can get and to keep my expensive color lasting. In a nutshell, I like it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this thermal spray. It&#x27;s lightweight, smells amazing, and does the job. I use it before blowdrying and before curling or straightening my hair. I spray it in layers then brush it out to make sure it&#x27;s evenly distributed throughout my hair. It&#x27;s one of the better products I&#x27;ve used for heat protectant, and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for straightening my hair for a long time, but now I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores.  Lightweight but still works well and scent isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it every time I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for years. Get it</li>
            <li> I have permed hair and swim almost daily at the YMCA. My hair had gotten so dry and frizzy.  I was looking for a lower cost option to improve the condition of my hair.  Now I rinse out the chlorine, add conditioner in the shower, and then once out I spray in the Dove as I push my hair back into shape.  If needed, I spray a bit more later in the day to remove more frizz and supply more curl.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> First off, I love that this product can be used on wet OR dry hair. Before I used this product I had worries about how it would feel in my hair (greasy, sticky, etc.) but I was surprised that it is none of those! My hair feels very soft, silky and manageable after using. It is easier to brush through and run my fingers through now without looking frizzy and tangled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, very think hair that I love to straighten. It is all the way down my back and naturally curly, which means difficult to manage. Add on top of that my scalp condition causes my hair to be very greasy around the top so I find it hard to use ANY products in my hair anymore. I am using Dawn dish detergent in every shower to keep the greasy feeling away and I can no longer use regular shampoos. It is either a medicated or dandruff shampoo coupled with Dawn. This has been going on about a year now so as you can imagine, my hair is full of damage and not looking its best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started using this product not even a week ago. From the very first use I was in love. My hair has not felt this good in a long time. Of course I am still careful to not spray near my scalp and I don&#x27;t use much at all on the lower sections so I do not comb/brush it back into the scalp area. I am still getting the results though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very good and the liquid is not heavy at all. It sprays in a fine mist just like water would spray out. I like to spray a little on the ends of my hair right after my shower and then dry my hair and spray a little on each section as I straighten it. The smell stays in my hair all day and my hair looks so much better after using this compared to other products I have tried using recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have no scalp problems and are not prone to oily hair you may be able to use more than I do and seal out the humidity a little better. Mine will start to get a little wavy if it is humid, but keep in mind that I am not using much at all, maybe just6-7 sprays for ALL of my hair from shower to finished hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing products nmakes my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Hate that this is no longer available in retail stores.  Very happy with quality.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about buying a product that isn&#x27;t specifically suited for African American hair but I was impressed with the results. It holds curls even in summer weather and when I woke up the next day it still held its curl. Hair was soft and my hair didn&#x27;t smell like it was burning when I used heat. No gross residue and lightweight (like it says). I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spray for a month and i love it. I went through hell trying to find it in stores in my area. So my next step was coming online. I have to have this spray. I love it. It works really good on my hair. i&#x27;m black, white, creek &amp; Cherokee Indian so this spray is a life saver. :)</li>
            <li> its cheap, smells good, its a little sitcky, buy i cant live without it, this is my second purchase, dove has excellent products</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my daughter since she loved it, but could no longer find it on the shelves. She has medium weight, wavy hair that tends to get dry. It made her very happy!</li>
            <li> I love this is is the best i have ever used..All good things in it and it does not dry the hair out..I have used lots of very expensive products and this beats them all..You and use this on hair that is going to be ironed or just blow dry..I sometimes just use this after shampooing and let it hair dry ..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product ! Perfect to help run a comb through after washing. Highly recommend. Go for it.</li>
            <li> This spray does not hydrate the hair at all. It feels like a perfumed water that I am applying on my hair. Does nothing for frizz.</li>
            <li> Left hair greasy looking</li>
            <li> I bought this in the store because it was the only product I saw that claimed to use heat styling to improve your hair, and I need it.It actually did feel healthier after I used it with a straightening iron, and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how it does with curls. It was very lightweight but very effective. It didn&#x27;t attract gunk during the day and stayed soft and frizz-free, even though I live in a wet climate. Love it!</li>
