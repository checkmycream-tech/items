            <li>It turned out perfect.</li>
            <li>I try my best to do my research before I try a product</li>
            <li>I must admit that the purple is brilliant and I&#x27;m getting tons of compliments</li>

            <li>This hair color is great and it lasts foreverrrrrr.</li>

            <li>Great dye.</li>
            <li>This dye is really good.</li>
            <li>Special Effects semi permanent hairdyes are the darkest and best on the market.  </li>
            <li>Special effects is the best colour</li>
            <li>I had my hairdresser (who is very skilled) apply this dye to my hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE this dye!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasted for about 3 weeks or so, pretty impressed that it even showed up on my hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told I LOVE YOUR PURPLE HAIR!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this color!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nonetheless, this is a great brand, has a high reputation as one of the most successful for unnatural colors, and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>The color is amazing.</li>
            <li>The results were spectacular.</li>
            <li>This was washing my hair once a day in luke warm water.</li>
            <li>Fading nicely into a purpley-gray.</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this color, I just wish it didn&#x27;t stain everything it touches.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dye.</li>
            <li>BE SURE</li>
            <li>I love the color this product creates</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even leave a toxic smell in your hair like most dye do.</li>
            <li>Love this brand</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t have any steel sinks) and we were both delighted as my gray hairs turned the brilliant indigo shown in the color icon.</li>
            <li>I still have to use copious amounts of conditioner, though, more than I&#x27;ve ever had to before.</li>
            <li>Great Price, Fast Delivery!!&lt;br /&gt;All kinds of fun stuff in this store!!</li>
            <li>This was pretty good.</li>
            <li>I love special effects!</li>
            <li>It lasts 3 to 6 weeks while still being bright, and makes my hair all nice and soft even though it&#x27;s been bleached to the point of straw.</li>
            <li>Still looks very cool</li>
            <li>Special Effects hair dye never disappoints!</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this brand and look forward to trying some of the other colors.</li>
            <li>To many folks this will appear purple - no bad thing.  </li>
            <li>Special Effects is by far the best vibrant color demi permanent dye I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This color stick to hair amazingly well, and you can&#x27;t beat how well the color pops - by far my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>So if your looking at doing just to top parts of your hair (nothing that rubs on skin) its worth it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, Had many colors available.</li>
            <li>Special Effects is my new favorite :-)</li>
            <li>This indigo is great because it fades to purple, unlike most blues which tend to fade to green.</li>
            <li>, I moved to the Special Effects.</li>
            <li>The blue is dark yet bright and when it fades it still looks good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a shocking blue, it&#x27;s nice and calm and rich..</li>
            <li>I love that about this color in particular!   </li>
            <li>The result was a really beautiful dark Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did my full head.</li>
            <li>It faded true and held well.</li>
            <li>The color my hair came out when i decided to use this product was really cool.</li>
            <li>I put the dye on and kept it in much longer than the recommended 15-30 minutes, as per advice I found on the web, more like 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a really great product, and I would recommend to anyone looking for this shade.</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t wash out as quickly.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest that if you don&#x27;t want to lose the color as quickly as I did, avoid pools.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed like everything was great, but then I noticed that even after it had been dry for hours after the wash, it still stained the frames of my glasses.</li>
            <li>Very pretty all the way through.</li>
            <li>I have tryed many types of dye and special effects lasts by far the longest with the brightest color</li>
            <li>There was a good deal of bleeding the first few times, but my hands stopped getting stained and the color has persisted despite how many times I&#x27;ve washed it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t super enthusiastic about this hair color before I purchased it, as I wanted a different color that was out of stock.</li>
            <li>It was very dark and had a strong purple hue to it; with each shampoo, it turned more and more purple.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, so I&#x27;m usually very sparing with conditioner, but if I don&#x27;t condition the dyed parts</li>
            <li>So if you want an amazing purple, get the Blue Velvet.</li>
            <li>and I expected really good results</li>
            <li>I have noticed that towards my roots the color does not hold as well revealing bleached white hair, but that may be my own fault.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, Special Effects is by far the longest lasting semi-permanent hair color</li>
            <li>Awesome choice if youre looking for a dark blue color.</li>
            <li>If you have dark hair, be sure to read up on safe ways to bleach your hair.</li>
            <li>While Special Effects is the BEST semi-permanent hair color out there, Blue Velvet falls very short where the actual color is concerned.</li>
            <li>Vibrant, rich color and non-drying formula.</li>
            <li>When I got it out of the bottle this particular color (Blue Velvet) had an inky, coppery shine to it and was much more &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; than the smooth texture of the manic panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews stating it was more of a purple than blue but decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li>The first time I put my blend of the two dyes into my hair together, [which was bleached to platinum before dying, mind you]</li>
            <li>&#x27;Bed Head: Control Freak,&#x27; to be exact] as an experiment</li>
            <li>This was the exact color I was looking for.</li>
            <li>But thats ok because the dye is such a pretty color</li>
            <li>I did go into a pool yesterday and now my hair is a really pretty purple.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well</li>
            <li>This color has more of a purple to it at first but then goes to a deppp blue that is just gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Fades into a pretty shade of purple after a while and then almost a pinkish.</li>
            <li>actually a really nice blue color that KIND OF looks like electric purple, but is DEFINITELY electric blue.</li>
            <li>This was my first time dying my hair something so colorful, and it worked better than expected.</li>
            <li>As the dye fades it loses most of the blue and turns to purple, which still looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li>:) As for how long it stayed in the hair.</li>
            <li>I heard Pravana is also a good brand, but it&#x27;s generally not as easy to find as  Special Effects because it&#x27;s only marketed to salon professionals.  </li>
            <li>to just see how fast it would fade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not noticed that one fades much faster than another</li>
            <li>A shame, I really used to swear by it.</li>
            <li>But not too much, or else your hand will stain every time you use it.</li>
            <li>This color really fits the description.</li>
            <li>Making any kind of hair dye last takes a lot of hard-work, research and effort, especially for unnatural colors, and because of it&#x27;s extremely-unnatural chemical formula</li>
            <li>I have super dark hair and have to bleach a bit to get this to show, but so worth it!  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, so my scalp gets oily super fast and not cleaning my hair daily isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li>I used to use only Special Effects for my hair dyeing.</li>
            <li>After bleaching my hair, I used Blue Velvet and Fishbowl Special Effects hair colors.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this specific color again, but I would use the Special Effects dye.</li>
            <li>Over the past couple of years, I&#x27;ve had the stuff not fade true and wash out very quickly both on myself and others.</li>
            <li>This has happened with Blue Velvet twice on 2 different people, as well as Atomic Red and one of the bright greens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up straight up shampooing and conditioning it afterward about 4-6 times before my hair started to feel normal again.</li>
            <li>After trying a couple of other blue dyes that were gone after a couple of washes, I&#x27;m happy to say that after seven weeks, the Special Effects Blue Velvet is still going strong with very little fading.  </li>
            <li>The color was pretty vibrant on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>So if you are going for a more true blue go with Blue Mayhem, as I&#x27;d definitely call this a blue/purple.  </li>
            <li>This is a great item for blondes, however, my hair is black &amp; I was just trying to give it that blue highlight, well like every other colored hair dye I tried (Manic Panic, Splat), it did a much better job of dying my scalp than my actual hair.  </li>
            <li>is that their Blue Velvet does fade quite quickly into purple/violet/lilac when not maintained well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My hair is still soft and I don&#x27;t notice a difference between the bleach parts and the non-bleached parts other than the bleached parts being more prone to tangling.</li>
            <li>Its a very dark blue/purple that would become visible when the light hits the highlights right or when youre right up next to someone, with the way I have it highlighted.</li>
            <li>This was clean, dry hair without conditioner in it, per the instructions.</li>
            <li>This blue fades to purple, and even with a fresh dye job</li>
            <li>This blue can sometimes seem purple even when freshly dyed depending on your hair and the tone after you bleached.</li>
            <li>Use wisely, and I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I ordered Blue Velvet and it went right to purple.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted a deep royal blue but Special Effects doesn&#x27;t seem to have one yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say my hair had about 40-50% of MP&#x27;s pigment in it by the time I went do to the new color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used three colors (vintage rose, pimpin purple, blue velvet) and they hardly fade and fade very evenly.</li>
            <li>This is the dye u want if u are looking for a rich, deep blue.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of dark purple tint to it depending on the light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2 months ago I bleached my hair (dark brown) to a light gold.</li>
            <li>Almost a month and a half using sulfate free cleansing conditioner and shampoo with sulfate.</li>
            <li>Be careful though, this hair dye will dye your skin quickly if it touches it.</li>
            <li>It lasted several weeks, with some care, and I got loads of positive comments about it.</li>
            <li>It went from a dark blue and faded to a deep purple which still looked nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s opaque and vivid, lasts quite long compared to other brands, and all while blending &#x27;Blue Velvet&#x27; along with Special Effects&#x27; &#x27;Electric Blue,&#x27; I can successfully maintain a strongly vivid Royal Blue that lasts endlessly.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle difference between my dark hair and the blue, people only notice when the light is right which is just what I want.    </li>
            <li>, Blue is most definitely one of the most difficult to upkeep.</li>
            <li>I had a professional apply it</li>
            <li>I think it really does look the way blue velvet would.</li>
            <li>have jet black hair and use special effects over bleached hair.</li>
            <li>If you want a true blue, well, I&#x27;m going to try the Electric Blue next and see how that comes out.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, my dark brown hair turned a solid and gorgeous black that just highlighted all that vivid blue.</li>
            <li>This blue is really vibrant.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, they will reconfigure the Blue Velvet formula or come up with something new soon.</li>
            <li>Pretty, long lasting colour.</li>
            <li>Their Electric Blue fades purple as well, but lasts much longer than their Blue Velvet.</li>
            <li>The color comes out vibrant and stays a long time.</li>
            <li>Its been about a week since I had the blue put in and it hasnt faded yet (so about 6 washes so far).</li>
            <li>For the first two weeks after using it, use dark towels and pillow cases.</li>
            <li>To keep my Royal Blue strong, I put this formula of the two blue dyes in with my regularly-used Sulfate-Free Conditioner, only ever use Sulfate-Free conditioner and shampoo, only ever wash under cold water and apply Apple Cider Vinegar regularly; leading to extremely healthy hair and an almost-never-fading outcome.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find anything negative about using Special Effects on hair that currently had dye in it.</li>
            <li>As for mess, I took my bottle into the salon and had it done there, but I imagine if you did it at home you&#x27;d have to only use your dark towels and be careful not to get it on anything else because I&#x27;m sure it would stain.    </li>
            <li>My only suggestion to keep the color as long as possible is to use an all natural cleansing conditioner (wen $30</li>
            <li>However, with washing it every third day, using cold water, it stayed nice for 2 months, fading a little bit to a pretty dark/medium purple.  </li>

            <li> If you have dark hair, be sure to read up on safe ways to bleach your hair.</li>
            <li> While Special Effects is the BEST semi-permanent hair color out there, Blue Velvet falls very short where the actual color is concerned.</li>
            <li> Vibrant, rich color and non-drying formula.</li>
            <li> When I got it out of the bottle this particular color (Blue Velvet) had an inky, coppery shine to it and was much more &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; than the smooth texture of the manic panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews stating it was more of a purple than blue but decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li> The first time I put my blend of the two dyes into my hair together, [which was bleached to platinum before dying, mind you]</li>
            <li> &#x27;Bed Head: Control Freak,&#x27; to be exact] as an experiment</li>
            <li> This was the exact color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> But thats ok because the dye is such a pretty color</li>
            <li> I did go into a pool yesterday and now my hair is a really pretty purple.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well</li>
            <li> This color has more of a purple to it at first but then goes to a deppp blue that is just gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Fades into a pretty shade of purple after a while and then almost a pinkish.</li>
            <li> actually a really nice blue color that KIND OF looks like electric purple, but is DEFINITELY electric blue.</li>
            <li> This was my first time dying my hair something so colorful, and it worked better than expected.</li>
            <li> As the dye fades it loses most of the blue and turns to purple, which still looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li> :) As for how long it stayed in the hair.</li>
            <li> I heard Pravana is also a good brand, but it&#x27;s generally not as easy to find as  Special Effects because it&#x27;s only marketed to salon professionals.  </li>
            <li> to just see how fast it would fade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed that one fades much faster than another</li>
            <li> A shame, I really used to swear by it.</li>
            <li> But not too much, or else your hand will stain every time you use it.</li>
            <li> This color really fits the description.</li>
            <li> Making any kind of hair dye last takes a lot of hard-work, research and effort, especially for unnatural colors, and because of it&#x27;s extremely-unnatural chemical formula</li>
            <li> I have super dark hair and have to bleach a bit to get this to show, but so worth it!  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, so my scalp gets oily super fast and not cleaning my hair daily isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> I used to use only Special Effects for my hair dyeing.</li>
            <li> After bleaching my hair, I used Blue Velvet and Fishbowl Special Effects hair colors.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this specific color again, but I would use the Special Effects dye.</li>
            <li> Over the past couple of years, I&#x27;ve had the stuff not fade true and wash out very quickly both on myself and others.</li>
            <li> This has happened with Blue Velvet twice on 2 different people, as well as Atomic Red and one of the bright greens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up straight up shampooing and conditioning it afterward about 4-6 times before my hair started to feel normal again.</li>
            <li> After trying a couple of other blue dyes that were gone after a couple of washes, I&#x27;m happy to say that after seven weeks, the Special Effects Blue Velvet is still going strong with very little fading.  </li>
            <li> The color was pretty vibrant on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> So if you are going for a more true blue go with Blue Mayhem, as I&#x27;d definitely call this a blue/purple.  </li>
            <li> This is a great item for blondes, however, my hair is black &amp; I was just trying to give it that blue highlight, well like every other colored hair dye I tried (Manic Panic, Splat), it did a much better job of dying my scalp than my actual hair.  </li>
            <li> is that their Blue Velvet does fade quite quickly into purple/violet/lilac when not maintained well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My hair is still soft and I don&#x27;t notice a difference between the bleach parts and the non-bleached parts other than the bleached parts being more prone to tangling.</li>
            <li> Its a very dark blue/purple that would become visible when the light hits the highlights right or when youre right up next to someone, with the way I have it highlighted.</li>
            <li> This was clean, dry hair without conditioner in it, per the instructions.</li>
            <li> This blue fades to purple, and even with a fresh dye job</li>
            <li> This blue can sometimes seem purple even when freshly dyed depending on your hair and the tone after you bleached.</li>
            <li> Use wisely, and I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered Blue Velvet and it went right to purple.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted a deep royal blue but Special Effects doesn&#x27;t seem to have one yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say my hair had about 40-50% of MP&#x27;s pigment in it by the time I went do to the new color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used three colors (vintage rose, pimpin purple, blue velvet) and they hardly fade and fade very evenly.</li>
            <li> This is the dye u want if u are looking for a rich, deep blue.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of dark purple tint to it depending on the light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 months ago I bleached my hair (dark brown) to a light gold.</li>
            <li> Almost a month and a half using sulfate free cleansing conditioner and shampoo with sulfate.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, this hair dye will dye your skin quickly if it touches it.</li>
            <li> It lasted several weeks, with some care, and I got loads of positive comments about it.</li>
            <li> It went from a dark blue and faded to a deep purple which still looked nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s opaque and vivid, lasts quite long compared to other brands, and all while blending &#x27;Blue Velvet&#x27; along with Special Effects&#x27; &#x27;Electric Blue,&#x27; I can successfully maintain a strongly vivid Royal Blue that lasts endlessly.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle difference between my dark hair and the blue, people only notice when the light is right which is just what I want.    </li>
            <li> , Blue is most definitely one of the most difficult to upkeep.</li>
            <li> I had a professional apply it</li>
            <li> I think it really does look the way blue velvet would.</li>
            <li> have jet black hair and use special effects over bleached hair.</li>
            <li> If you want a true blue, well, I&#x27;m going to try the Electric Blue next and see how that comes out.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, my dark brown hair turned a solid and gorgeous black that just highlighted all that vivid blue.</li>
            <li> This blue is really vibrant.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, they will reconfigure the Blue Velvet formula or come up with something new soon.</li>
            <li> Pretty, long lasting colour.</li>
            <li> Their Electric Blue fades purple as well, but lasts much longer than their Blue Velvet.</li>
            <li> The color comes out vibrant and stays a long time.</li>
            <li> Its been about a week since I had the blue put in and it hasnt faded yet (so about 6 washes so far).</li>
            <li> For the first two weeks after using it, use dark towels and pillow cases.</li>
            <li> To keep my Royal Blue strong, I put this formula of the two blue dyes in with my regularly-used Sulfate-Free Conditioner, only ever use Sulfate-Free conditioner and shampoo, only ever wash under cold water and apply Apple Cider Vinegar regularly; leading to extremely healthy hair and an almost-never-fading outcome.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find anything negative about using Special Effects on hair that currently had dye in it.</li>
            <li> As for mess, I took my bottle into the salon and had it done there, but I imagine if you did it at home you&#x27;d have to only use your dark towels and be careful not to get it on anything else because I&#x27;m sure it would stain.    </li>
            <li> My only suggestion to keep the color as long as possible is to use an all natural cleansing conditioner (wen $30</li>
            <li> However, with washing it every third day, using cold water, it stayed nice for 2 months, fading a little bit to a pretty dark/medium purple.  </li>
            <li> Using shampoos and conditioners for color-treated hair and skipping days in between will keep your color in as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> so the dark blue against it is subtle enough for work, but still really fun.  </li>
            <li> The Blue Velvet turned out very dark, and definitely purple, not blue.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> The color lasked really long.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get it for long.</li>
            <li> The color lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> , you then get a week of purple hair, then like kelly osbourn grey.</li>
            <li> but overall I got everything I expected!</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair every other day as to preserve the color.</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic color, that as it fades, fades purple, as opposed to the Deep Purple color that Ive used for over 2 years that tends to fade to a pink-y that I&#x27;m not so crazy about.</li>
            <li> The blue velvet fades to purple and then a sort of lavender and the pink one just becomes lighter pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these colors in for three weeks so far with very little fading</li>
            <li> I treated it poorly with hot water and sulfate hair products [</li>
            <li> Or as long as your careful when using/rinsing it out (stains).</li>
            <li> When used alone, &#x27;Blue Velvet&#x27; has a heavy dark-purple undertone while &#x27;Electric Blue&#x27; looks a little too unnatural for my personal tastes.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed &amp; was looking forward to that nice blue highlight in the black hair</li>
            <li> Although this dye stains everything it touches, and does so throughout its livelihood, the dye lasts a long time and only fades a little bit.</li>
            <li> I wanted to dye my hair black with blue highlights for Halloween.</li>
            <li> It is gentle- doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and and really lasts (almost two weeks for me)</li>
            <li> With this said, BE CAREFUL HOW YOU USE IT.</li>
            <li> I use this for low-lites in combination with pastel cupcake pink hilights.</li>
            <li> I only used less than half the tube.</li>
            <li> But I used this over my poor teal, not blue hair and was instantly bummed that I wasted my money on pravana chromasilk blue.</li>
            <li> This is a very dark blue with, as other readers have noted, a slightly purple tint.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the glow in the dark pink one).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this problem with the other dye.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair, and I dyed a streak of it, hoping for a tint.</li>
            <li> Not to worry, usually it gets out with bleach or alcohol, but I have had a few stains that simply will not come out of the surface they touched for years.</li>
            <li> Every time I wash my hair, I notice that the rinse water is slightly tinted purple.</li>
            <li> my hair becomes a tangled mess and feels fried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use a little dishsoap on the corner of a washcloth to get it off your ears and neck.</li>
            <li> It stayed in for about 2 weeks, some parts a little longer.</li>
            <li> This will help if you bleach your hair heavily before coloring also.</li>
            <li> I guess the product&#x27;s gone down hill in the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, upon receipt of the color, it didn&#x27;t even LOOK blue in the bottle, let alone on my hair (which is bleached up to almost platinum).</li>
            <li> I ended up actually showering and shampooing it, because it was so bad.</li>
            <li> but it is thin.</li>
            <li> So it was frustrating experience going on and also when rinsing out.</li>
            <li> My hair bleaches very badly, so I have waited decades until I had enough gray to show a color, and I went with this one.</li>
            <li> Had lame experience with pravana.</li>
            <li> The horrible texture softened a bit, but it was still very unnerving for me - my hair wasn&#x27;t this bad after I bleached it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bleeds horribly everytime it gets wet or</li>
            <li> I rinsed in cold water about 3 times, trying to get the grimy texture out of my hair.</li>
            <li> This brand BLEEDS LIKE CRAZY.</li>
            <li> When I read to be prepared for bleeding nothing could have prepared me for how bad it was.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or</li>
            <li> what. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to see what it would have done to walls/floor!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I did my research on this product and I expected really good results and that&#x27;s exactly what I got. The color was pretty vibrant on my natural hair. I have long hair but it is thin. I only used less than half the tube. So if I wanted I could do my entire head twice with just one bottle. The color lasked really long. Almost a month and a half using sulfate free cleansing conditioner and shampoo with sulfate. I did wash my hair every day at the month mark. It went from a dark blue and faded to a deep purple which still looked nice. Only con is that it gets everywhere. Everything white turns blue (example: hands, phone, earphones, sink, bathroom) but overall I got everything I expected! C:</li>
            <li> Special Effects semi permanent hairdyes are the darkest and best on the market.  I have super dark hair and have to bleach a bit to get this to show, but so worth it!  People are forever complimenting my color and yes, it is quite blue violet.  To many folks this will appear purple - no bad thing.  A luscious color that shines well and helps hair looks not fried ( a concern with bleaching).  Bea carefrul when using this - it will stain a sink for life and any runoff you get on your ears/forehead will be there for a day.</li>
            <li> While Special Effects is the BEST semi-permanent hair color out there, Blue Velvet falls very short where the actual color is concerned. I read all the reviews stating it was more of a purple than blue but decided to try it anyway. Needless to say, upon receipt of the color, it didn&#x27;t even LOOK blue in the bottle, let alone on my hair (which is bleached up to almost platinum). It was very dark and had a strong purple hue to it; with each shampoo, it turned more and more purple. NOT BLUE. I must admit that the purple is brilliant and I&#x27;m getting tons of compliments but I wanted blue. So if you want an amazing purple, get the Blue Velvet. If you want a true blue, well, I&#x27;m going to try the Electric Blue next and see how that comes out. I really, really wanted a deep royal blue but Special Effects doesn&#x27;t seem to have one yet. Hopefully, they will reconfigure the Blue Velvet formula or come up with something new soon.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this color, I just wish it didn&#x27;t stain everything it touches.</li>
            <li> I have been putting blue streaks in my hair for years now.  This color shows up great after I bleach the strands and it looks like Superman hair.  I love the subtle difference between my dark hair and the blue, people only notice when the light is right which is just what I want.    Lasts longer if you use a shampoo for blonde/silver hair which is blue in color so it won&#x27;t wash out as quickly.  Otherwise lasts for about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have tryed many types of dye and special effects lasts by far the longest with the brightest color</li>
            <li> This is a great item for blondes, however, my hair is black &amp; I was just trying to give it that blue highlight, well like every other colored hair dye I tried (Manic Panic, Splat), it did a much better job of dying my scalp than my actual hair.  It washed out within a week.  I was disappointed &amp; was looking forward to that nice blue highlight in the black hair but I didn&#x27;t get it for long.</li>
            <li> This hair color is great and it lasts foreverrrrrr. I tried to dye over it and it just wouldn&#x27;t budge. Pretty, long lasting colour.</li>
            <li> LOVE this dye! Had lame experience with pravana. But I used this over my poor teal, not blue hair and was instantly bummed that I wasted my money on pravana chromasilk blue. This is the dye u want if u are looking for a rich, deep blue. It&#x27;s absolutely magnificent! Bleeds horribly everytime it gets wet or u wash so be prepared. Definitely my go to hair coli for blue!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye. It&#x27;s opaque and vivid, lasts quite long compared to other brands, and all while blending &#x27;Blue Velvet&#x27; along with Special Effects&#x27; &#x27;Electric Blue,&#x27; I can successfully maintain a strongly vivid Royal Blue that lasts endlessly. When used alone, &#x27;Blue Velvet&#x27; has a heavy dark-purple undertone while &#x27;Electric Blue&#x27; looks a little too unnatural for my personal tastes. They&#x27;re both still great colors, though. To keep my Royal Blue strong, I put this formula of the two blue dyes in with my regularly-used Sulfate-Free Conditioner, only ever use Sulfate-Free conditioner and shampoo, only ever wash under cold water and apply Apple Cider Vinegar regularly; leading to extremely healthy hair and an almost-never-fading outcome. BE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO TREAT YOUR HAIR BEFORE DYING IT, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something I can warn you about is that their Blue Velvet does fade quite quickly into purple/violet/lilac when not maintained well. Their Electric Blue fades purple as well, but lasts much longer than their Blue Velvet. The first time I put my blend of the two dyes into my hair together, [which was bleached to platinum before dying, mind you] I treated it poorly with hot water and sulfate hair products [&#x27;Bed Head: Control Freak,&#x27; to be exact] as an experiment to just see how fast it would fade. After one wash, it was Easter Purple. With this said, BE CAREFUL HOW YOU USE IT. Do not judge this dye poorly simply because you do not know how to maintain the color. Making any kind of hair dye last takes a lot of hard-work, research and effort, especially for unnatural colors, and because of it&#x27;s extremely-unnatural chemical formula, Blue is most definitely one of the most difficult to upkeep. Know what you&#x27;re getting into before dying it, or pastel colors will prevail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, this is a great brand, has a high reputation as one of the most successful for unnatural colors, and I&#x27;m happy with it. Give it a go. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I wanted to dye my hair black with blue highlights for Halloween. This was the exact color I was looking for. It turned out perfect. Its a very dark blue/purple that would become visible when the light hits the highlights right or when youre right up next to someone, with the way I have it highlighted. Its been about a week since I had the blue put in and it hasnt faded yet (so about 6 washes so far). Awesome choice if youre looking for a dark blue color.</li>
            <li> actually a really nice blue color that KIND OF looks like electric purple, but is DEFINITELY electric blue.</li>
            <li> After trying a couple of other blue dyes that were gone after a couple of washes, I&#x27;m happy to say that after seven weeks, the Special Effects Blue Velvet is still going strong with very little fading.  This is a very dark blue with, as other readers have noted, a slightly purple tint.  As the dye fades it loses most of the blue and turns to purple, which still looks pretty good.  I have dark brown hair so the dark blue against it is subtle enough for work, but still really fun.  To get the correct color you MUST, MUST, MUST bleach your hair to practically white before you apply the dye.  Using shampoos and conditioners for color-treated hair and skipping days in between will keep your color in as long as possible.  As for mess, I took my bottle into the salon and had it done there, but I imagine if you did it at home you&#x27;d have to only use your dark towels and be careful not to get it on anything else because I&#x27;m sure it would stain.    I heard Pravana is also a good brand, but it&#x27;s generally not as easy to find as  Special Effects because it&#x27;s only marketed to salon professionals.  I was very happy with this brand and look forward to trying some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> This hair dye doesnt look blue. But it is the coolest shade of purple. Everyone loves my hair. The color lasts for a long time. It lasts about a month for me and i wash my hair often. Be careful though, this hair dye will dye your skin quickly if it touches it. But thats ok because the dye is such a pretty color and it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> I love the color this product creates however it only lasts about a week, you then get a week of purple hair, then like kelly osbourn grey.</li>
            <li> It will stain, just like all the hair dye products. Use a little dishsoap on the corner of a washcloth to get it off your ears and neck. It is a fantastic color, that as it fades, fades purple, as opposed to the Deep Purple color that Ive used for over 2 years that tends to fade to a pink-y that I&#x27;m not so crazy about. It&#x27;s not a shocking blue, it&#x27;s nice and calm and rich.. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I got this hair dye a while back but didn&#x27;t use it till yesterday. I absolutely love it! This blue is really vibrant.  It doesn&#x27;t even leave a toxic smell in your hair like most dye do. Love this brand</li>
            <li> I love special effects! I like to dye my hair with mostly blue velvet and then do maybe a tiny section with atomic cupcake (I think that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called...it&#x27;s the glow in the dark pink one). The blue velvet fades to purple and then a sort of lavender and the pink one just becomes lighter pink so I like the gradient that the two make.&lt;br /&gt;I have jet black hair and use special effects over bleached hair. If you have dark hair, be sure to read up on safe ways to bleach your hair. It is possible to do it without damaging your hair, you just have to be patient and prepared to dedicate a few days to the whole process. My hair is still soft and I don&#x27;t notice a difference between the bleach parts and the non-bleached parts other than the bleached parts being more prone to tangling.</li>
            <li> starts falling out after a week and turns purple , in no way is a semi permanent dye supposed to fall out in a week when you follow the directions to the tee.</li>
            <li> Special Effects is by far the best vibrant color demi permanent dye I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used three colors (vintage rose, pimpin purple, blue velvet) and they hardly fade and fade very evenly. I&#x27;ve not noticed that one fades much faster than another and I use all three colors together. My only suggestion to keep the color as long as possible is to use an all natural cleansing conditioner (wen $30+, RenPure$8) instead of shampoo. This will help if you bleach your hair heavily before coloring also. I have very oily skin, so my scalp gets oily super fast and not cleaning my hair daily isn&#x27;t an option. I&#x27;ve had these colors in for three weeks so far with very little fading and I wash my hair with cleansing conditioner daily.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super enthusiastic about this hair color before I purchased it, as I wanted a different color that was out of stock. I ordered the Blue Velvet anyways and took it to my stylist. She applied it with no problems, leaving the color on for about 30 minutes. She also lightened my brown hair to blond before she applied the Blue Velvet. The result was a really beautiful dark Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the color in now for about 2 weeks. Every time I wash my hair, I notice that the rinse water is slightly tinted purple. I only wash my hair every other day as to preserve the color. I did go into a pool yesterday and now my hair is a really pretty purple. I would suggest that if you don&#x27;t want to lose the color as quickly as I did, avoid pools. Other than that, it is a really great product, and I would recommend to anyone looking for this shade.</li>
            <li> My hair bleaches very badly, so I have waited decades until I had enough gray to show a color, and I went with this one. The results were spectacular. I had a professional apply it (I don&#x27;t have any steel sinks) and we were both delighted as my gray hairs turned the brilliant indigo shown in the color icon. As a bonus, my dark brown hair turned a solid and gorgeous black that just highlighted all that vivid blue. It lasted several weeks, with some care, and I got loads of positive comments about it. Will definitely be using it again.</li>
            <li> When I read to be prepared for bleeding nothing could have prepared me for how bad it was. I did my full head. To start off it stained almost everything it touched from skin, my shower, my sink. I&#x27;d hate to see what it would have done to walls/floor! Then it would bleed and dye my forehead and neck purple (it was blue dye) so I was constantly rubbing my forehead and neck to keep it off. I ordered Blue Velvet and it went right to purple. Yes, I followed the directions. :) As for how long it stayed in the hair. This was pretty good. It stayed in for about 2 weeks, some parts a little longer. This was washing my hair once a day in luke warm water. So if your looking at doing just to top parts of your hair (nothing that rubs on skin) its worth it. Or as long as your careful when using/rinsing it out (stains).</li>
            <li> Although this dye stains everything it touches, and does so throughout its livelihood, the dye lasts a long time and only fades a little bit. I have noticed that towards my roots the color does not hold as well revealing bleached white hair, but that may be my own fault.</li>
            <li> This dye is really good. It lasts 3 to 6 weeks while still being bright, and makes my hair all nice and soft even though it&#x27;s been bleached to the point of straw. A++ has engendered my loyalty to the brand.</li>
            <li> I used to use only Special Effects for my hair dyeing. It faded true and held well. Over the past couple of years, I&#x27;ve had the stuff not fade true and wash out very quickly both on myself and others. I guess the product&#x27;s gone down hill in the past 20 years. A shame, I really used to swear by it. This has happened with Blue Velvet twice on 2 different people, as well as Atomic Red and one of the bright greens.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair, and I dyed a streak of it, hoping for a tint. It worked pretty well, you couldn&#x27;t see it unless you were standing in the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;It lasted for about 3 weeks or so, pretty impressed that it even showed up on my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if you put a plastic cap on while waiting for the haircolour to take it&#x27;s easier to wash out, and it lasts longer.  This blue fades to purple, and even with a fresh dye job I&#x27;ve been told I LOVE YOUR PURPLE HAIR!  So if you are going for a more true blue go with Blue Mayhem, as I&#x27;d definitely call this a blue/purple.  Still looks very cool, I&#x27;m a brunette and have bleached highlights that I put it on.  Special effects is the best colour and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> This blue can sometimes seem purple even when freshly dyed depending on your hair and the tone after you bleached. I LOVE this color! This indigo is great because it fades to purple, unlike most blues which tend to fade to green. I love that about this color in particular!   Be warned that this dye stains EVERYTHING, even your hands and skin, and especially tiles and bathtubs. Not to worry, usually it gets out with bleach or alcohol, but I have had a few stains that simply will not come out of the surface they touched for years. On the bright side, Special Effects is by far the longest lasting semi-permanent hair color I&#x27;ve ever had the pleasure to use!   Use wisely, and I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This color has more of a purple to it at first but then goes to a deppp blue that is just gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;Love their products &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The color is amazing. Fades into a pretty shade of purple after a while and then almost a pinkish. Very pretty all the way through.</li>
            <li> Recommend putting some leftover dye in your conditioner. But not too much, or else your hand will stain every time you use it.</li>
            <li> This color really fits the description. I think it really does look the way blue velvet would. It has a bit of dark purple tint to it depending on the light. The color comes out vibrant and stays a long time. Special Effects hair dye never disappoints!</li>
            <li> I try my best to do my research before I try a product and I couldn&#x27;t find anything negative about using Special Effects on hair that currently had dye in it. I&#x27;ll go over my hair journey in hopes of someone out there having had a similar experience and knowing what may have gone awry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 months ago I bleached my hair (dark brown) to a light gold. I did this in two stages on two different days with time in between with lots of coconut oil being used. After I let my hair rest being blonde I then dyed it with Manic Panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it began to fade and I had run out of dye for touch ups, I moved to the Special Effects. I&#x27;d say my hair had about 40-50% of MP&#x27;s pigment in it by the time I went do to the new color. I read the instructions, looked up online for tips, etc, before actually applying it to my hair. When I got it out of the bottle this particular color (Blue Velvet) had an inky, coppery shine to it and was much more &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; than the smooth texture of the manic panic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried combing my hair with the dye it tangled fiercely. This was clean, dry hair without conditioner in it, per the instructions. I didn&#x27;t have this problem with the other dye. So it was frustrating experience going on and also when rinsing out. I rinsed in cold water about 3 times, trying to get the grimy texture out of my hair. I ended up actually showering and shampooing it, because it was so bad. The horrible texture softened a bit, but it was still very unnerving for me - my hair wasn&#x27;t this bad after I bleached it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up straight up shampooing and conditioning it afterward about 4-6 times before my hair started to feel normal again. There was a good deal of bleeding the first few times, but my hands stopped getting stained and the color has persisted despite how many times I&#x27;ve washed it. I still have to use copious amounts of conditioner, though, more than I&#x27;ve ever had to before. My hair is fine, so I&#x27;m usually very sparing with conditioner, but if I don&#x27;t condition the dyed parts my hair becomes a tangled mess and feels fried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone else experience this? I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what. :( I have yet to find someone else online with a similar experience.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I got this dye because IT IS PURPLE. I have almost white bleached hair and diluted this with conditioner to make a pastel. It is an awesome, bright purple. I use this for low-lites in combination with pastel cupcake pink hilights. LOVE IT! This dye has staying power, even diluted. It is gentle- doesn&#x27;t smell bad, and and really lasts (almost two weeks for me) Special Effects is my new favorite :-)</li>
            <li> The color my hair came out when i decided to use this product was really cool. The blue is dark yet bright and when it fades it still looks good!</li>
            <li> This color stick to hair amazingly well, and you can&#x27;t beat how well the color pops - by far my favorite brand.</li>
            <li> This brand BLEEDS LIKE CRAZY. I had my hairdresser (who is very skilled) apply this dye to my hair. At first it seemed like everything was great, but then I noticed that even after it had been dry for hours after the wash, it still stained the frames of my glasses. I will never use this brand again.</li>
            <li> Great dye. Vibrant, rich color and non-drying formula. Word of warning though: stains textiles. For the first two weeks after using it, use dark towels and pillow cases. Fading nicely into a purpley-gray.</li>
            <li> This was my first time dying my hair something so colorful, and it worked better than expected. After bleaching my hair, I used Blue Velvet and Fishbowl Special Effects hair colors. I put the dye on and kept it in much longer than the recommended 15-30 minutes, as per advice I found on the web, more like 2-3 hours. The Blue Velvet turned out very dark, and definitely purple, not blue. However, with washing it every third day, using cold water, it stayed nice for 2 months, fading a little bit to a pretty dark/medium purple.  It might have even gone longer, but I&#x27;m trying to wash it out now. I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this specific color again, but I would use the Special Effects dye.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, Had many colors available. Great Price, Fast Delivery!!&lt;br /&gt;All kinds of fun stuff in this store!!</li>
