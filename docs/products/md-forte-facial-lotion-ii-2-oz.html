            <li>Very pleased with product and service.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wear sunscreen over it if you plan to be in the sun all day since it doesn&#x27;t have any SPF!</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin so soft,exfoliated and minimizes my pores and very fine lines.</li>
            <li>Maybe more time is needed.</li>
            <li>Now I use it once a week and love it.</li>
            <li>Love it, hope they keeop making it.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using all the MD Forte products.</li>
            <li>Anyone know where to get it at a normal price or a good substitute?</li>
            <li>I think the solution is fine</li>
            <li>The reason I bought this product was because I had read that glycolic acid was an important ingredient in minimizing the look of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Loved their facial cream, but they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve been using this product for over ten years and like the lotion and the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It is quite strong for my 43 year old acne scarred skin.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this product is very light weight</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear, from breakouts, help with fine lines,</li>
            <li>I have been using it for more than 10 years and get complimented on my skin on the regular!</li>

            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t expect time to be reversed</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>They seem to manage my acne very well, and even out the tone of my skin.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this particular product again.</li>
            <li>but if you put it on the night before over budding acne, it stops the pimples before they grow :) I would recommend it for anyone with acne and extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of the product for nearly 10 years!</li>
            <li>It made me red at first.  </li>
            <li>, I become sensitive.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed this being any better than other products used in past.</li>

            <li> My skin would not be the perfection that it is without MD Forte. I have been using it for more than 10 years and get complimented on my skin on the regular! Whenever I test another product out (just to see)... I always wind up going back to MD Forte because it&#x27;s perfection compared to all other products out there!</li>
            <li> Excellent service, product was as described, and packaging was all as described.  Very pleased with product and service.</li>
            <li> Gread  have used this product for years and really love it,please keep selling it,this is the only place I can find it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I&#x27;ve used it for 10+ years.  Unfortunately, it is no longer being manufactured...what a shame.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel wonderful!!! I have been a fan of the product for nearly 10 years! Nothing beats it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve been using this product for over ten years and like the lotion and the cleanser.  I&#x27;d recommend this for people needing products with glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> Best Glycolic acid on the market!! Keeps my skin so soft,exfoliated and minimizes my pores and very fine lines. I notice a big difference if I stop using this. I have been using this since I was 25 and I am now 45 and I get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
            <li> Too bad this product is discontinued.  Works great on problem skin.</li>
            <li> MD Forte products are the best. Loved their facial cream, but they don&#x27;t make it anymore. Anyone know where to get it at a normal price or a good substitute?</li>
            <li> I think the solution is fine but I bought it by mistake thinking it was their cleanser.  I can&#x27;t find the cleanser anywhere, and I miss it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used MD Forte in the past and I know that this is NOT MD Forte. This lotion has the consistency of water and doesn&#x27;t moisturize anything.  I will not purchase this from here ever again.</li>
            <li> have used this for years.  Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this product was because I had read that glycolic acid was an important ingredient in minimizing the look of wrinkles.  Perhaps I have not used it correctly (I generally apply at least once a day, sometimes twice &amp; I&#x27;ve used it for a little over two weeks) but I see not an iota of difference.  Maybe more time is needed. I certainly don&#x27;t expect time to be reversed and I didn&#x27;t have big expectations but I see no changes to report....nothing negative, nothing positive.  I&#x27;m still using it and will until it is gone but I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this particular product again.</li>
            <li> It is quite strong for my 43 year old acne scarred skin.  It made me red at first.  Now I use it once a week and love it.</li>
            <li> Reordered this product.  Great price and quality</li>
            <li> I fight the the little bumps under the skin. Breakouts. Uneaven skin tone. You name it!!! I used this product YESTERDAY and see the results already!!! Little bumps are GONE!!! Pimples are dried up... Love it!!!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed this being any better than other products used in past. But will still give it a chance for now.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fair price. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love it, hope they keeop making it.  Dont like to go higher than 2, I become sensitive. Keeps my skin clear, from breakouts, help with fine lines, The best beauty product I use, and I&#x27;m 60, get compliments on my skin all the time.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using all the MD Forte products. They seem to manage my acne very well, and even out the tone of my skin. I am looking forward to working my way into the MD Forte lll.</li>
            <li> Works good. The MD Forte III is best but not making it anymore</li>
            <li> This product is soooo awesome. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist because I&#x27;ve struggled with extremely oily skin since FOREVER and I didn&#x27;t have a good face lotion. Whenever I put lotion on my face, I would get oilier and my face would get so heavy way before lunchtime. Not only is this product is very light weight but if you put it on the night before over budding acne, it stops the pimples before they grow :) I would recommend it for anyone with acne and extremely oily skin.
