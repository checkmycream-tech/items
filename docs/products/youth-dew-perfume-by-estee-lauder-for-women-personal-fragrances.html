            <li>Works fairly well,</li>
            <li>good product, looks good, and the price is the lowest I can find for this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Whatever that gorgeous smell was, it is lost.</li>
            <li>Smells so good ,was in the supermarket smell the lady with it on</li>
            <li>I have loved it ever since.  </li>
            <li>but when I hug folks, I want them to enjoy the wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>HAVE LOVED THIS FRAGRANCE FOR YEARS.WILL ORDER</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve worn this years ago and really loved it...</li>
            <li>It smells beautiful at any age, and the unique bottle looks great on your dresser.  </li>
            <li>Many years ago, this beautiful scent came into being.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product and service.</li>
            <li>I more often wear something lighter, like [[ASIN:B00ALJWYZY JOY by Jean Patou]] or [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this perfume!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will need to order another one for her birthday this year!</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments on its fragrance !  </li>
            <li>, I LOVE this scent!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Youth Dew has always been my favorite!</li>
            <li>Smells great but may be a bit to strong.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to order and arrived in the original box in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Whatever they are, they smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Good cosy more than macys</li>
            <li>When I saw that Amazon carried it, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>and I grew up loving but not wearing Youth Dew.</li>
            <li>Still, I cannot wear this scent in warm weather.</li>
            <li>have read that a lot of people think the formula has changed since my mother&#x27;s time, but honestly I can&#x27;t smell a difference.</li>
            <li>used this fragance for and it;s still as nice as it always was.</li>
            <li>Pleasing, Warm and sensuous.</li>
            <li>So Thanks for helping me fashion a wonderful moment in their lives one more time.</li>
            <li>Love it and have had many compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li>I purchased a bottle (it is still really cheap) and gave it two good sprays on my arm before bed.</li>
            <li>I would probably classify it as a spicy floral with rose and jasmine as top notes.  </li>
            <li>But, beware, If it does not work on you, you will smell like a \\&quot;dog poo masterpiece!\\&quot; LOL ;)</li>
            <li>Since she passed away many years ago, I decided to buy a bottle, just so I could indulge in the scent to remind me of her.</li>
            <li>Mom&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>I got it for my mother who loves the staying power of youth dew, it is her favorite.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>My mother&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>The aroma is not over bearing and gets many compliants.</li>
            <li>Stop raping my nose, youth dew!&amp;#34; He jokingly whispered to me as we scurried away from the youth dew fallout zone (which was most of the grocery store).</li>
            <li>but Amazon&#x27;s price was better, so I thought I&#x27;d try them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS COLOGNE..</li>
            <li>.. GET MANY COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WEAR YOUTH DEW..</li>
            <li>But when you spend $34 on a bottle of your favorite perfume, you want it to be your favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I have used Estee Lauder Youth dew for more than 30 yrs.</li>
            <li>I love that about this product.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne</li>
            <li>There are much better prices elsewhere.</li>
            <li>But it is still way better than anything on the market today, scents that smell like candy and fruits.  </li>
            <li>She is pleased.</li>
            <li>Its her bday she will love it, always has for 28 yrs,</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT, and hope to get some eventually.</li>
            <li>Love the Youth Dew fragrance.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews I could find, most of which were against the smell of the Youth Dew.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it though, as I can truly say that I tried it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sexy sort of dignity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wife enjoyed receiving</li>
            <li>Always buy perfume from a reputable place or department store.</li>
            <li>I used to love wearing this in my 20&#x27;s , I thought what the heck.</li>
            <li>Smells like coca cola for sure.</li>
            <li>Totally safe buy though.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>My wife is very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s her favorite perfume - also takes her back to &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; days.&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li>outstanding product.</li>
            <li>My grandmother has used this for more than 20 years now.  </li>
            <li>but I know many who compliment her on it.</li>
            <li>I love Estee Lauder products.  </li>
            <li>This Youth Dew has such a timeless, wonderful, scent.</li>
            <li>Youth Dew still works it&#x27;s magic for them even though their in their 80&#x27;s.....</li>
            <li>Sure would have put me in a sweeter mood.</li>
            <li>Sure would have put me in a sweeter mood.</li>
            <li>However, Amazon requires more words.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance--</li>
            <li>This is a favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn Estee Lauder Youth Dew since the 1970s, when it was a favorite with my mother.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to try the powder, too.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This fragrance did not even resemble the fragrance that I so love.  </li>
            <li>Given to a friend for Christmas  her favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love Estee Lauder&#x27;s &amp;#34;Youth Dew&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>But good Lord it&#x27;s a beauty, and just right for me.</li>
            <li>good and last the whole day!!!!!!</li>
            <li>giving five stars because of the beautiful fragrance...a classy classic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always worry that perfume online may be old, but this smells fresh and wonderful.</li>
            <li>Yes, I realize there are more important problems in the world.</li>
            <li>Go to Este Lauder on line, pay a couple more bucks, and receive free shipping and returns through them.</li>
            <li>It was a good deal with fast shipping</li>
            <li>Every Person says how good it smells and wants to know where I get the product</li>
            <li>I know for sure, because I still have an original bottle I&#x27;ve saved from years ago.  </li>
            <li>My latest purchase was the same great quality as always.</li>
            <li>Strong and spicy.  </li>
            <li>As the fragrance wears, the spices deepen and I think, become more pronounced until you end up with primarily sweet and spicy bottom</li>
            <li>, it was such a joy to watch her enjoy my fragrance.....</li>
            <li>This was a gift and the person was over whelm that this product was still available.  </li>
            <li>and it brought back great memories for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Old lady scent and not in a good way</li>
            <li>Anyways, I would recommend Youth Dew for anyone who wants a perfume that smells good and actually lasts at the same time. :D</li>
            <li>She was so excited to get it at a reduced price.</li>
            <li>Arrived in record time in its original unopened packaging.</li>
            <li>I first used &amp;#34;Youth Dew&amp;#34; many years ago.  </li>
            <li>lovely &amp; smells exactly as we remembert</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance and pretty bottle.</li>
            <li>I actually find this better than Amazing Grace by Philosophy.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Rich, clean, sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to see in on Amazon for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>any rate, although I love Amazon and spend way to much time and $$ on here buyer beware.</li>
            <li>,so Dad ask me to see if I could find it one more time for Mom for Christmas and Thanks to you  </li>
            <li>Buying online is much easier that going to the mall and was at a much better price.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a powerful perfume, this stuff is very POWERFUL.  </li>
            <li>All the ladies at work would comment that I &amp;#34;smelled fresh and clean,</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon for the great service,  I received it 3 days after it was ordered, and that was with standard shipping!</li>
            <li>: he was just talking about today&#x27;s Youth Dew by Estee Lauder, not that original glorious musk right out of a novel about old-time shieks with harems.</li>
            <li>It was drop dead, beautifully done perfume.  </li>
            <li>This is an old favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think Youth Dew is a nice scent, but that may only be me.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes, it becomes a nice soft smell that makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>Thereafter, for many years, the scent was gone, as far as I could detect.</li>
            <li>Love the soft scent of a Youth Dew.</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite and</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is a very good smelling and long lasting cologne.  </li>
            <li>Now I know my son was right</li>
            <li>I must say this is a sweet oriental spicey smell much like a chai latte.  </li>
            <li>I am a naturally \\&quot;warm\\&quot; person, I sweat easily, and the scent is overpowering to me in the heat.</li>
            <li>The shining was very fast</li>
            <li>My first encounter with this scent was on an airplane.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was many years, and after Mom&#x27;s death in 1994, that I finally bought some - to celebrate being a mom myself.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the first thing I look at.</li>
            <li>After ten miutes, it was interesting.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my cousin just got married and Youth Dew is all she wears.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted - saved me a trip to the Mall</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>What is this scent exactly?..</li>
            <li>Maybe it just sits in stock for whoever hasn&#x27;t yet learned better to buy it only once.</li>
            <li>oever hasn&#x27;t yet learned better to buy it only once.</li>
            <li>and it was the real stuff!</li>
            <li>same as it was years ago, love it..........</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Youth Dew ever since 1967 when I bought my first bottle for college.  </li>
            <li>the first whiff of Youth Dew on your skin might shock you a bit.</li>
            <li>( but I hope it will have the same effect on my husband:)</li>
            <li>&quot; Gee, tons of people are naming their babies with \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; names...just because something is originally from one time period</li>
            <li>People will often ask me what I am wearing, because it is a smell that lasts a long time and is memorable.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a favorite for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have always liked Youth-Dew, particularly the addictive cola-like top notes and the powdery rose dry down, but somehow I could never actually wear it on my skin without the skanky animalic notes coming to the fore and ruining everything (it is these notes that cause many to shriek, \\&quot;Old lady!!\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>It comes in a simple styled bottle with easy access.</li>
            <li>The change can&#x27;t be too large though, or I know I&#x27;d notice</li>
            <li>It certainly clears up your sinuses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sexy, complex, and sometimes overly strong scent.</li>
            <li>The thing to remember about this perfume is there really is no \\&quot;high, top notes.\\</li>
            <li>She never indulged much on herself, but this was her one vice.</li>
            <li>was very disapointed with this.</li>
            <li>It smells really good.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>You have to really pump it to get any spray.  </li>
            <li>My mom asked for this for her birthday; and she absolutely loves the scent.  </li>
            <li>This was a great buy, and I am highly addicted to this scent now.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s warm and cozy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Again</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I know for me, it&#x27;s getting harder for me to be able to afford it...</li>
            <li>at least my niece tells me that I &#x27;smell good.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Over the next decade, this luscious smell grew so popular that it could only drop out of fashion, because literally everybody was wearing it.</li>
            <li>Both my orders of this scent arrived quickly, new, unopened, packaged as pretty as can be.</li>
            <li>IT MAD A WONDERFUL GIFT</li>
            <li>Subtle, and just a gorgeous scent.</li>
            <li>My Dad&#x27;s bought this for Mom for years,a kinda special gift that&#x27;s shown up for different occasions over the years...</li>
            <li>She loved it of course and buying through Amazon is less money than buying locally.</li>
            <li>Youth Dew is an older scent, and thus often put down by fans of trendier and more modern perfumes.</li>
            <li>Funny how people will disparagingly label something as \\&quot;old lady.\\</li>
            <li>Decided to try again because I had liked it so well in the past.</li>
            <li>This is another one of those perfumes, like Joy, that I find to be not only not a nice smell, but horrid.</li>
            <li>But for an older, dignified, know who she is *woman</li>
            <li>I also have an older bottle of the EDP.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to women, and order it again for myself.</li>
            <li>I hope they just leave it alone now -- or else revive the old formula!!  </li>
            <li>I will probably keep dabbing it on after bathing, hoping my nose will change its mind, that so many fine reviews could not possibly be mistaken or exaggerating or loyal to an eerie fault....</li>
            <li>I will probably keep dabbing it on after bathing, hoping my nose will change its mind, that so many fine reviews could not possibly be mistaken or exaggerating or loyal to an eerie fault....</li>
            <li>Most Estee Lauder products contain oil and that makes them last so much longer than other perfumes I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>My friend was estatic when she opened this present and started wearing it right away.  </li>
            <li>I wish all these other reviews had been accurate.</li>
            <li>I wish all these other reviews had been accurate.</li>
            <li>No 5 Women, 3.4oz / 100ml EDP, SPRAY, NEW &amp; SEALED]].</li>
            <li>It came brand new and in a sealed box.</li>
            <li>It was new, unused.</li>
            <li>It IS a very, VERY strong scent, and not a nice one, either.  </li>
            <li>In trying to save a couple bucks, by ordering through Amazon, I&#x27;m wondering if I received a very old expired bottle.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was not full like the one we bought in the store, and the fragrance was not as strong as the store bought.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>And she is 30 years old, not 95!  </li>
            <li>I love the way you can spray it on but the smell is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>My solution has been to use the oil first and follow it with the body cream, and then a brief spray over all of it.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I first smelled it emanating from a glamorous cousin (she was a medical resident), it filled the whole 2-story house when she walked in and pulled the towel off her hair and ran upstairs to visit my mother as per usual.</li>
            <li>what a shame some companies try to push off their old products in place of new.</li>
            <li>Old, as in first produced as a scent in the beginning of the 20th century.</li>
            <li>She was so surprised that I remembered it and said it still smelled the same as when she first wore it.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m past 60 now, widowed, and don&#x27;t care how my perfume affects the nostrils around me, only whether it pleases my own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to do without some things I might actually have enjoyed to feel less crummy about it.</li>
            <li>I am 35 years old and this is far from being old lady like.  </li>
            <li>This scent is not floral or &amp;#34;heavenly&amp;#34; as some of us describe the old perfume.  </li>
            <li>This is masculine with spices and a salty odor.  </li>
            <li>The absolute only time I ever asked anyone what they were wearing</li>
            <li>But five minutes later, it became very powdery.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as it was recommended as an old perfume, which always intrigue me.</li>
            <li>Then something completely unexpected happened</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mature in the way that Chanel is.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, they fought over who got it, and my mother, old brute that she is, won..</li>
            <li>The price is quite reasonable for a high-quality designer scent such as this.</li>
            <li>I am fourteen years old (as I have already</li>
            <li>brought as gift for 85 year old mother at her request.</li>
            <li>She wore this when I was a young boy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an intoxicating, boozy, cognac-smooth love potion of spices and blooming flowers and earthy patchouli and hippie head-shop resins and delicate powdery woods.</li>
            <li>Its pretty old school and is getting more difficult to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>I received this as a Christmas present this past year and it was the most horrendous thing I have ever smelt.  </li>
            <li>I am told YD has a high concentration of essential oils</li>
            <li>Needless to say I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas, for the last 27 years, so</li>
            <li>I said that it said, \\&quot;Mom\\&quot; to me and that I wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;old (mature) enough to wear it.\\&quot; I gave Mom the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it actually smelled like it was old, very strong and unappealing.</li>
            <li>One of my major pet peeves is when sellers try to jack up the price of their item by adding to the shipping.</li>
            <li>People obviously KNOW what it smells like now, yet keep buying it, paying nearly twice what a nice-size squirter of spicy Calvin Klein Obsession would cost.</li>
            <li>It not only arrived early but met my time need as well.</li>
            <li>It is such a classy fragrance.</li>
            <li>Right away, my mother was wearing the scent, and I got a whisper of a dab for the few dances and dates I was allowed to go on at 15.</li>
            <li>All the other Youth Dew I have had has had a much stronger scent.  </li>
            <li>The packaging and the bottle were exactly the same as in the past but the smell was completely off.  </li>
            <li>Additionally...this perfume bottle is in no way heavy or bulky, thus, I don&#x27;t believe for a hot minute that it would cost $10.99 to ship.</li>
            <li>Youth Dew was my first perfume, a gift from my Mother, at age 18 (and that was a &#x27;few&#x27; years ago)....</li>
            <li>you like sweet, complex scents, this one could be for you.  </li>
            <li>I am still using it just have too spray on a little more than usual.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon, for making my life a little easier.</li>
            <li>The scent clung to my skin and clothes and stunk up the whole room after one little spray.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was very happy to find it on Amazon at a good price and with free prime shipping.</li>

            <li> good product, looks good, and the price is the lowest I can find for this fragrance.</li>

            <li> I have loved it ever since.  </li>
            <li> but when I hug folks, I want them to enjoy the wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li> HAVE LOVED THIS FRAGRANCE FOR YEARS.WILL ORDER</li>

            <li> It smells beautiful at any age, and the unique bottle looks great on your dresser.  </li>
            <li> Many years ago, this beautiful scent came into being.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and service.</li>
            <li> I more often wear something lighter, like [[ASIN:B00ALJWYZY JOY by Jean Patou]] or [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will need to order another one for her birthday this year!</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments on its fragrance !  </li>
            <li> , I LOVE this scent!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Youth Dew has always been my favorite!</li>
            <li> Smells great but may be a bit to strong.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to order and arrived in the original box in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> Whatever they are, they smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Good cosy more than macys</li>
            <li> When I saw that Amazon carried it, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> and I grew up loving but not wearing Youth Dew.</li>
            <li> Still, I cannot wear this scent in warm weather.</li>
            <li> have read that a lot of people think the formula has changed since my mother&#x27;s time, but honestly I can&#x27;t smell a difference.</li>
            <li> used this fragance for and it;s still as nice as it always was.</li>
            <li> Pleasing, Warm and sensuous.</li>
            <li> So Thanks for helping me fashion a wonderful moment in their lives one more time.</li>
            <li> Love it and have had many compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle (it is still really cheap) and gave it two good sprays on my arm before bed.</li>
            <li> I would probably classify it as a spicy floral with rose and jasmine as top notes.  </li>
            <li> But, beware, If it does not work on you, you will smell like a \\&quot;dog poo masterpiece!\\&quot; LOL ;)</li>
            <li> Since she passed away many years ago, I decided to buy a bottle, just so I could indulge in the scent to remind me of her.</li>
            <li> Mom&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> I got it for my mother who loves the staying power of youth dew, it is her favorite.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> The aroma is not over bearing and gets many compliants.</li>
            <li> Stop raping my nose, youth dew!&amp;#34; He jokingly whispered to me as we scurried away from the youth dew fallout zone (which was most of the grocery store).</li>
            <li> but Amazon&#x27;s price was better, so I thought I&#x27;d try them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS COLOGNE..</li>
            <li> .. GET MANY COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WEAR YOUTH DEW..</li>
            <li> But when you spend $34 on a bottle of your favorite perfume, you want it to be your favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I have used Estee Lauder Youth dew for more than 30 yrs.</li>
            <li> I love that about this product.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne</li>
            <li> There are much better prices elsewhere.</li>
            <li> But it is still way better than anything on the market today, scents that smell like candy and fruits.  </li>
            <li> She is pleased.</li>
            <li> Its her bday she will love it, always has for 28 yrs,</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, and hope to get some eventually.</li>
            <li> Love the Youth Dew fragrance.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews I could find, most of which were against the smell of the Youth Dew.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it though, as I can truly say that I tried it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sexy sort of dignity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wife enjoyed receiving</li>
            <li> Always buy perfume from a reputable place or department store.</li>
            <li> I used to love wearing this in my 20&#x27;s , I thought what the heck.</li>
            <li> Smells like coca cola for sure.</li>
            <li> Totally safe buy though.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s her favorite perfume - also takes her back to &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; days.&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li> outstanding product.</li>
            <li> My grandmother has used this for more than 20 years now.  </li>
            <li> but I know many who compliment her on it.</li>
            <li> I love Estee Lauder products.  </li>
            <li> This Youth Dew has such a timeless, wonderful, scent.</li>
            <li> Youth Dew still works it&#x27;s magic for them even though their in their 80&#x27;s.....</li>
            <li> Sure would have put me in a sweeter mood.</li>
            <li> Sure would have put me in a sweeter mood.</li>
            <li> However, Amazon requires more words.  </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance--</li>
            <li> This is a favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Estee Lauder Youth Dew since the 1970s, when it was a favorite with my mother.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to try the powder, too.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> This fragrance did not even resemble the fragrance that I so love.  </li>
            <li> Given to a friend for Christmas  her favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> I love Estee Lauder&#x27;s &amp;#34;Youth Dew&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> But good Lord it&#x27;s a beauty, and just right for me.</li>
            <li> good and last the whole day!!!!!!</li>
            <li> giving five stars because of the beautiful fragrance...a classy classic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always worry that perfume online may be old, but this smells fresh and wonderful.</li>
            <li> Yes, I realize there are more important problems in the world.</li>
            <li> Go to Este Lauder on line, pay a couple more bucks, and receive free shipping and returns through them.</li>
            <li> It was a good deal with fast shipping</li>
            <li> Every Person says how good it smells and wants to know where I get the product</li>
            <li> I know for sure, because I still have an original bottle I&#x27;ve saved from years ago.  </li>
            <li> My latest purchase was the same great quality as always.</li>
            <li> Strong and spicy.  </li>
            <li> As the fragrance wears, the spices deepen and I think, become more pronounced until you end up with primarily sweet and spicy bottom</li>
            <li> , it was such a joy to watch her enjoy my fragrance.....</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person was over whelm that this product was still available.  </li>
            <li> and it brought back great memories for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Old lady scent and not in a good way</li>
            <li> Anyways, I would recommend Youth Dew for anyone who wants a perfume that smells good and actually lasts at the same time. :D</li>
            <li> She was so excited to get it at a reduced price.</li>
            <li> Arrived in record time in its original unopened packaging.</li>
            <li> I first used &amp;#34;Youth Dew&amp;#34; many years ago.  </li>
            <li> lovely &amp; smells exactly as we remembert</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> I actually find this better than Amazing Grace by Philosophy.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Rich, clean, sweet scent.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to see in on Amazon for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> any rate, although I love Amazon and spend way to much time and $$ on here buyer beware.</li>
            <li> ,so Dad ask me to see if I could find it one more time for Mom for Christmas and Thanks to you  </li>
            <li> Buying online is much easier that going to the mall and was at a much better price.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a powerful perfume, this stuff is very POWERFUL.  </li>
            <li> All the ladies at work would comment that I &amp;#34;smelled fresh and clean,</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon for the great service,  I received it 3 days after it was ordered, and that was with standard shipping!</li>
            <li> : he was just talking about today&#x27;s Youth Dew by Estee Lauder, not that original glorious musk right out of a novel about old-time shieks with harems.</li>
            <li> It was drop dead, beautifully done perfume.  </li>
            <li> This is an old favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think Youth Dew is a nice scent, but that may only be me.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, it becomes a nice soft smell that makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> Thereafter, for many years, the scent was gone, as far as I could detect.</li>
            <li> Love the soft scent of a Youth Dew.</li>
            <li> It is by far my favorite and</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is a very good smelling and long lasting cologne.  </li>
            <li> Now I know my son was right</li>
            <li> I must say this is a sweet oriental spicey smell much like a chai latte.  </li>
            <li> I am a naturally \\&quot;warm\\&quot; person, I sweat easily, and the scent is overpowering to me in the heat.</li>
            <li> The shining was very fast</li>
            <li> My first encounter with this scent was on an airplane.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was many years, and after Mom&#x27;s death in 1994, that I finally bought some - to celebrate being a mom myself.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the first thing I look at.</li>
            <li> After ten miutes, it was interesting.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my cousin just got married and Youth Dew is all she wears.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted - saved me a trip to the Mall</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> What is this scent exactly?..</li>
            <li> Maybe it just sits in stock for whoever hasn&#x27;t yet learned better to buy it only once.</li>
            <li> oever hasn&#x27;t yet learned better to buy it only once.</li>
            <li> and it was the real stuff!</li>
            <li> same as it was years ago, love it..........</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Youth Dew ever since 1967 when I bought my first bottle for college.  </li>
            <li> the first whiff of Youth Dew on your skin might shock you a bit.</li>
            <li> ( but I hope it will have the same effect on my husband:)</li>
            <li> &quot; Gee, tons of people are naming their babies with \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; names...just because something is originally from one time period</li>
            <li> People will often ask me what I am wearing, because it is a smell that lasts a long time and is memorable.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a favorite for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Youth-Dew, particularly the addictive cola-like top notes and the powdery rose dry down, but somehow I could never actually wear it on my skin without the skanky animalic notes coming to the fore and ruining everything (it is these notes that cause many to shriek, \\&quot;Old lady!!\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> It comes in a simple styled bottle with easy access.</li>
            <li> The change can&#x27;t be too large though, or I know I&#x27;d notice</li>
            <li> It certainly clears up your sinuses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sexy, complex, and sometimes overly strong scent.</li>
            <li> The thing to remember about this perfume is there really is no \\&quot;high, top notes.\\</li>
            <li> She never indulged much on herself, but this was her one vice.</li>
            <li> was very disapointed with this.</li>
            <li> It smells really good.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> You have to really pump it to get any spray.  </li>
            <li> My mom asked for this for her birthday; and she absolutely loves the scent.  </li>
            <li> This was a great buy, and I am highly addicted to this scent now.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s warm and cozy.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Again</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I know for me, it&#x27;s getting harder for me to be able to afford it...</li>
            <li> at least my niece tells me that I &#x27;smell good.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Over the next decade, this luscious smell grew so popular that it could only drop out of fashion, because literally everybody was wearing it.</li>
            <li> Both my orders of this scent arrived quickly, new, unopened, packaged as pretty as can be.</li>
            <li> IT MAD A WONDERFUL GIFT</li>
            <li> Subtle, and just a gorgeous scent.</li>
            <li> My Dad&#x27;s bought this for Mom for years,a kinda special gift that&#x27;s shown up for different occasions over the years...</li>
            <li> She loved it of course and buying through Amazon is less money than buying locally.</li>
            <li> Youth Dew is an older scent, and thus often put down by fans of trendier and more modern perfumes.</li>
            <li> Funny how people will disparagingly label something as \\&quot;old lady.\\</li>
            <li> Decided to try again because I had liked it so well in the past.</li>
            <li> This is another one of those perfumes, like Joy, that I find to be not only not a nice smell, but horrid.</li>
            <li> But for an older, dignified, know who she is *woman</li>
            <li> I also have an older bottle of the EDP.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to women, and order it again for myself.</li>
            <li> I hope they just leave it alone now -- or else revive the old formula!!  </li>
            <li> I will probably keep dabbing it on after bathing, hoping my nose will change its mind, that so many fine reviews could not possibly be mistaken or exaggerating or loyal to an eerie fault....</li>
            <li> I will probably keep dabbing it on after bathing, hoping my nose will change its mind, that so many fine reviews could not possibly be mistaken or exaggerating or loyal to an eerie fault....</li>
            <li> Most Estee Lauder products contain oil and that makes them last so much longer than other perfumes I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> My friend was estatic when she opened this present and started wearing it right away.  </li>
            <li> I wish all these other reviews had been accurate.</li>
            <li> I wish all these other reviews had been accurate.</li>
            <li> No 5 Women, 3.4oz / 100ml EDP, SPRAY, NEW &amp; SEALED]].</li>
            <li> It came brand new and in a sealed box.</li>
            <li> It was new, unused.</li>
            <li> It IS a very, VERY strong scent, and not a nice one, either.  </li>
            <li> In trying to save a couple bucks, by ordering through Amazon, I&#x27;m wondering if I received a very old expired bottle.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was not full like the one we bought in the store, and the fragrance was not as strong as the store bought.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> And she is 30 years old, not 95!  </li>
            <li> I love the way you can spray it on but the smell is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> My solution has been to use the oil first and follow it with the body cream, and then a brief spray over all of it.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I first smelled it emanating from a glamorous cousin (she was a medical resident), it filled the whole 2-story house when she walked in and pulled the towel off her hair and ran upstairs to visit my mother as per usual.</li>
            <li> what a shame some companies try to push off their old products in place of new.</li>
            <li> Old, as in first produced as a scent in the beginning of the 20th century.</li>
            <li> She was so surprised that I remembered it and said it still smelled the same as when she first wore it.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m past 60 now, widowed, and don&#x27;t care how my perfume affects the nostrils around me, only whether it pleases my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to do without some things I might actually have enjoyed to feel less crummy about it.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old and this is far from being old lady like.  </li>
            <li> This scent is not floral or &amp;#34;heavenly&amp;#34; as some of us describe the old perfume.  </li>
            <li> This is masculine with spices and a salty odor.  </li>
            <li> The absolute only time I ever asked anyone what they were wearing</li>
            <li> But five minutes later, it became very powdery.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as it was recommended as an old perfume, which always intrigue me.</li>
            <li> Then something completely unexpected happened</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mature in the way that Chanel is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, they fought over who got it, and my mother, old brute that she is, won..</li>
            <li> The price is quite reasonable for a high-quality designer scent such as this.</li>
            <li> I am fourteen years old (as I have already</li>
            <li> brought as gift for 85 year old mother at her request.</li>
            <li> She wore this when I was a young boy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an intoxicating, boozy, cognac-smooth love potion of spices and blooming flowers and earthy patchouli and hippie head-shop resins and delicate powdery woods.</li>
            <li> Its pretty old school and is getting more difficult to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas present this past year and it was the most horrendous thing I have ever smelt.  </li>
            <li> I am told YD has a high concentration of essential oils</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas, for the last 27 years, so</li>
            <li> I said that it said, \\&quot;Mom\\&quot; to me and that I wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;old (mature) enough to wear it.\\&quot; I gave Mom the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it actually smelled like it was old, very strong and unappealing.</li>
            <li> One of my major pet peeves is when sellers try to jack up the price of their item by adding to the shipping.</li>
            <li> People obviously KNOW what it smells like now, yet keep buying it, paying nearly twice what a nice-size squirter of spicy Calvin Klein Obsession would cost.</li>
            <li> It not only arrived early but met my time need as well.</li>
            <li> It is such a classy fragrance.</li>
            <li> Right away, my mother was wearing the scent, and I got a whisper of a dab for the few dances and dates I was allowed to go on at 15.</li>
            <li> All the other Youth Dew I have had has had a much stronger scent.  </li>
            <li> The packaging and the bottle were exactly the same as in the past but the smell was completely off.  </li>
            <li> Additionally...this perfume bottle is in no way heavy or bulky, thus, I don&#x27;t believe for a hot minute that it would cost $10.99 to ship.</li>
            <li> Youth Dew was my first perfume, a gift from my Mother, at age 18 (and that was a &#x27;few&#x27; years ago)....</li>
            <li> you like sweet, complex scents, this one could be for you.  </li>
            <li> I am still using it just have too spray on a little more than usual.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon, for making my life a little easier.</li>
            <li> The scent clung to my skin and clothes and stunk up the whole room after one little spray.  </li>
            <li> but other scents come and go and this one never smells old fashioned</li>
            <li> That way, you could bathe in a bit more later for a touch up, and by your own logic, that awful foot odor from your rancid sneakers in the back seat might abate just a little bit too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today, I told her, hey... why don&#x27;t you keep that stuff out in yer car, so when you slather up with it in the morning, you don&#x27;t stench up the whole abode, like you usually do?  </li>
            <li> It lingers a long time, especially on clothes you&#x27;ve worn, like a winter coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I mean, half a spray on the nape of my neck to start, and maybe half a spray in the cleavage if I want a more full-on dose.</li>
            <li> After getting to our seats, I asked my fiancé a little too loudly , &amp;#34;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Please understand that one of the primary components of this is oakmoss, which a few years back was regulated by the industry due to allergies and a lot of scents were forced to reformulate or stop being made.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts a long time, and blends with your skin.  </li>
            <li> Never had that problem before, in over 40 years which is how long I have used Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> it has to stick around as long as I do.</li>
            <li> and that is what makes it so long</li>
            <li> Larger bottle than I expected.  </li>
            <li> But, be careful, the scent is strong,and it lasts VERY LONG, so you only have to use between one or two sprays if you prefer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Youth Dew today is a &#x27;spray-on&#x27; cologne, and is far too much.  </li>
            <li> , I know how Youth Dew&#x27;s supposed to smell; nor does it last even half as long as the perfume I&#x27;ve been buying from Macy&#x27;s for years.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is old or</li>
            <li> I was selecting a cheese when a &#x27;snobby&#x27; looking blue haired diva strutted down the aisle in her diamonds and drapers outfit, reeking of &#x27;the dew.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Live with it for at least 4 hours before you decide to buy.</li>
            <li> Clove, rose, ylang-ylang, cinnamon, cassie, jasmine, orchid; Base notes:</li>
            <li> -a little goes a long way, use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I think two things have happened: (1) Lauder has reformulated the EDP so that it is lighter and brighter, less cloying and funky, but still very much itself--  a glorious, femme-fatale classic.</li>
            <li> every year this is one gift she requires from me, all the other gifts are my choosing.</li>
            <li> The stores here in to Central Valley have it but the neighborhoods around the mall are not safe, so we don&#x27;t go to the Mall anymore.</li>
            <li> it smell like toilet bowl cleaner on this plane?&amp;#34; That&#x27;s when I noticed the little old lady behind us with her torn open duty free bag on her lap, violently spritizing youth dew all over her neck as if it was truly the water from the fountain of youth.</li>
            <li> I shipped it in a small flat rate box for $5 and change.</li>
            <li> It is so obvious that over a period of years, the corporate goons at Lauder, in an effort to keep costs down and to comply with the new and dreadful IFRA regulations, have made the once glorious and deep oriental wonder that WAS Youth Dew into a ghost of its former self.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little dirty, and it&#x27;s not the least bit innocent.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t care for it, but she&#x27;s been using it for at least 30-40 years.</li>
            <li> I use just a slight spray on my lower neck and half spray on one wrist, rubbing on the other.  </li>
            <li> I can understand the complaints from folks who say it is changed, even watered down.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this bottle is not very strong.  </li>
            <li> The YOUTH DEW by ESTEE LAUDER for women perfume I purchased as a gift mid 2014 turned out to be FAKE when I gave it 1/2 a year later.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m 20 years old, so maybe that&#x27;s why I hate it so much.  </li>
            <li> When I was a little girl this bottle was always on my Moms dresser.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few fragrances that lasts and lasts on me.  </li>
            <li> Almost killed another employee when I went to work with this on.  </li>
            <li> The pump is not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I bought the perfume spray, couldn&#x27;t believe how bad it smelled, realized I would have to buy EXACTLY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Youth Dew for decades ... usually buy it from [...]...</li>
            <li> When I was a HS senior, my boyfriend, not knowing it was my mom&#x27;s scent, gave me a small bottle.</li>
            <li> He has past away now though</li>
            <li> Thank heavens I have a small bottle of the bath oil which I have been hoarding for years.  </li>
            <li> when I reach home it drove my dog wild, she would jump all over me and sniff me like crazy</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this soon, my dog has past:</li>
            <li> and I was shocked at how high the prices are.</li>
            <li> That weird brown liquid in the bottle was alarming.  </li>
            <li> Not nice at all.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t re-become \\&quot;modern\\&quot; in another!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, what are the undertones used in this perfume?</li>
            <li> I was reminded of this intrusive, unpleasant perfume this afternoon, at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li> but this was not good for me, even though it is an Oriental perfume as well.</li>
            <li> the metal cap on the bottle is bent making it difficult to remove without pulling quite hard.</li>
            <li> It strangely DOES have some sort of cola syrup smell, followed by a powdery amber cinnamon base.  </li>
            <li> I smelled so bad, I could have killed myself.  </li>
            <li> Costly selfish purchases on my part.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, they are pricing theirselves out of the market place...</li>
            <li> For years, I looked at this stuff and was even afraid to spray it.  </li>
            <li> so I KNOW how bad this perfume can me.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> (I hate shopping.)</li>
            <li> Showered TWICE and still couldn&#x27;t get rid of the awful smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into fruity and floral scents and this perfume is just toxic and disgusting.  </li>
            <li> But about 5 years ago, my teenaged (youngest) son mentioned that the worst smelling \\&quot;girl&#x27;s perfume\\&quot; he&#x27;d ever smelled was Youth Dew by Estee Lauder.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good cosy more than macys</li>
            <li> giving five stars because of the beautiful fragrance...a classy classic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The packaging was intact, sealed with cellophane and in mint condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However,,,and this is puzzling...the metal cap on the bottle is bent making it difficult to remove without pulling quite hard. Thought this was strange!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise... I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> When I was a little girl this bottle was always on my Moms dresser. She never indulged much on herself, but this was her one vice. Since she passed away many years ago, I decided to buy a bottle, just so I could indulge in the scent to remind me of her. The best scent they make in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Mom&#x27;s favorite. Great price</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, and smells great!</li>
            <li> This is a very good smelling and long lasting cologne.  I got it for my mother who loves the staying power of youth dew, it is her favorite.</li>
            <li> For my Mom!  She was so excited to get it at a reduced price.</li>
            <li> This was a surprise gift for my sisters.  So happy they still make it.</li>
            <li> WARNING: It looks the same - same bottle, same box.  Different perfume.  I know for sure, because I still have an original bottle I&#x27;ve saved from years ago.  This scent is not floral or &amp;#34;heavenly&amp;#34; as some of us describe the old perfume.  This is masculine with spices and a salty odor.  THIS CANNOT BE RETURNED -- so DON&#x27;T BUY IT ONLINE!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  The fragrance lasts a long time, and blends with your skin.  People will often ask me what I am wearing, because it is a smell that lasts a long time and is memorable.      It arrived shortly after it was ordered, without any hassles.  I would highly recommend it to women, and order it again for myself.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Been using it for years. Barb D.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li> It was a good deal with fast shipping</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for about 30 years, and always got lots of compliments on it.  My latest purchase was the same great quality as always. Thanks, Amazon for the great service,  I received it 3 days after it was ordered, and that was with standard shipping!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person was over whelm that this product was still available.  The aroma is not over bearing and gets many compliants.</li>
            <li> was very disapointed with this. it didnt smell as i remebered it actually smelled like it was old, very strong and unappealing. i used to wear this scent and if it had smelled like this i wouldnt have. what a shame some companies try to push off their old products in place of new.</li>
            <li> My first encounter with this scent was on an airplane. After getting to our seats, I asked my fiancé a little too loudly , &amp;#34;Doesn&#x27;t it smell like toilet bowl cleaner on this plane?&amp;#34; That&#x27;s when I noticed the little old lady behind us with her torn open duty free bag on her lap, violently spritizing youth dew all over her neck as if it was truly the water from the fountain of youth. Let me tell you, this is NOT the fountain of youth. In fact, if I had to liken the scent to anything else my nose has regretfully encountered, I&#x27;d say it has notes of my grandmothers underwear drawer/athletes foot powder. I was reminded of this intrusive, unpleasant perfume this afternoon, at my local grocery store. I was selecting a cheese when a &#x27;snobby&#x27; looking blue haired diva strutted down the aisle in her diamonds and drapers outfit, reeking of &#x27;the dew.&#x27; I looked at my fiancé, and his eyes widened with disbelief. &amp;#34;My nose! Stop raping my nose, youth dew!&amp;#34; He jokingly whispered to me as we scurried away from the youth dew fallout zone (which was most of the grocery store). Please, unless you want to smell like the inside of a centenarians coffin, do not buy this youth dew, or as I like to call it, &amp;#34;death nectar.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Arrived in record time in its original unopened packaging. Very pleased with the product and service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Youth Dew for decades ... usually buy it from [...]... but Amazon&#x27;s price was better, so I thought I&#x27;d try them.  Advertised at a great price because it was being sold NOT IN THE BOX.  But when the order arrived, voila ... IN THE BOX!  Such a deal!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Youth Dew for years.  It&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS COLOGNE.. ONLY COLOGNE THAT LAST ON ME.. GET MANY COMPLIMENTS WHEN I WEAR YOUTH DEW..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Youth Dew for years and have always bought it through Macy&#x27;s. When I saw that Amazon carried it, I was thrilled. Same price, but no-cost shipping on Prime, and I didn&#x27;t have to go shopping. (I hate shopping.) So I bought it and got it a couple days later, and it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same as Youth Dew -- believe me, I know how Youth Dew&#x27;s supposed to smell; nor does it last even half as long as the perfume I&#x27;ve been buying from Macy&#x27;s for years. So I guess it&#x27;s back to get-in-the-car-drive-to-Macy&#x27;s-and-buy. Yes, I realize there are more important problems in the world. But when you spend $34 on a bottle of your favorite perfume, you want it to be your favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I have used Estee Lauder Youth dew for more than 30 yrs. I have always loved it. I was very happy to find it on Amazon at a good price and with free prime shipping.</li>
            <li> Most Estee Lauder products contain oil and that makes them last so much longer than other perfumes I&#x27;ve purchased.  I can put this on in the morning and still smell it in the afternoon.  I love that about this product.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne so gave these two as Christmas gifts and the women were very happy with them</li>
            <li> This is an old favorite of mine.  I was glad to see in on Amazon for a reasonable price.  Nice scent.</li>
            <li> Youth Dew is an older scent, and thus often put down by fans of trendier and more modern perfumes. I have to wonder if it&#x27;s a knee jerk reaction to the age of the formula. It&#x27;s a sexy, complex, and sometimes overly strong scent. Funny how people will disparagingly label something as \\&quot;old lady.\\&quot; Gee, tons of people are naming their babies with \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; names...just because something is originally from one time period doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t re-become \\&quot;modern\\&quot; in another!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 46, and I grew up loving but not wearing Youth Dew. It was my mother&#x27;s signature scent. When I was a HS senior, my boyfriend, not knowing it was my mom&#x27;s scent, gave me a small bottle. He was so offended when I told him I wouldn&#x27;t wear it! I said that it said, \\&quot;Mom\\&quot; to me and that I wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;old (mature) enough to wear it.\\&quot; I gave Mom the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was many years, and after Mom&#x27;s death in 1994, that I finally bought some - to celebrate being a mom myself. And I still do think it&#x27;s a \\&quot;mature\\&quot; scent. It lingers a long time, especially on clothes you&#x27;ve worn, like a winter coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves Youth Dew! Still, I cannot wear this scent in warm weather. I am a naturally \\&quot;warm\\&quot; person, I sweat easily, and the scent is overpowering to me in the heat. Even in the winter I wear it sparingly. I feel the same way about [[ASIN:B00BOJFWWC Chanel No 5 Women, 3.4oz / 100ml EDP, SPRAY, NEW &amp; SEALED]]. I more often wear something lighter, like [[ASIN:B00ALJWYZY JOY by Jean Patou]] or [[ASIN:B0092ODTXU WHITE LINEN by Estee Lauder EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY 2 OZ for WOMEN]].&lt;br /&gt;I have read that a lot of people think the formula has changed since my mother&#x27;s time, but honestly I can&#x27;t smell a difference. From what I am reading, they are correct and my sniffer is off! The change can&#x27;t be too large though, or I know I&#x27;d notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top notes: Orange, spice note, bergamot, peach, aldehydes;  Heart notes: Clove, rose, ylang-ylang, cinnamon, cassie, jasmine, orchid; Base notes: amber, tolu, patchouli, olibanum, oakmoss, peru balsam, benzoin, vanillaber, tolu, patchouli, olibanum, oakmoss, peru balsam, benzoin, vanilla</li>
            <li> My mother has used this fragrance since 1960&#x27;s. It is wonderful. I hope you never stop making the fragrance. It is still the best of all.</li>
            <li> My Ma had worn this since she was 16 and she&#x27;s 65 now. I gag at the smell in the store but on her it smells SO good! Part of it may be that it&#x27;s just the way my Mama smells but her body chemistry must just work well with it. So I came on here looking for it to have sent to her for Grandparents Day and I was shocked at how high the prices are. I paid like $27 for it at Nordstrom. Additionally...this perfume bottle is in no way heavy or bulky, thus, I don&#x27;t believe for a hot minute that it would cost $10.99 to ship. I shipped it in a small flat rate box for $5 and change. One of my major pet peeves is when sellers try to jack up the price of their item by adding to the shipping. That&#x27;s the first thing I look at. As a seller myself I ship 90% of what I sell for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, although I love Amazon and spend way to much time and $$ on here buyer beware. There are much better prices elsewhere.</li>
            <li> WOW!  For years, I looked at this stuff and was even afraid to spray it.  That weird brown liquid in the bottle was alarming.  And to sniff it from the bottle was ....WHEW!  Imagine my surprise when a woman I know gave me a hug and she smelled heavenly.  The absolute only time I ever asked anyone what they were wearing and she replied, \\&quot;Youth Dew.\\&quot;  I finally decided to give it a try.  I purchased a bottle (it is still really cheap) and gave it two good sprays on my arm before bed. My initial reaction was, \\&quot;Oh no, this is just wrong.\\&quot;  But five minutes later, it became very powdery.  After ten miutes, it was interesting.  By fifteen minutes later, I was in bed, inhaling my pajama sleeve.  When I woke up this morning, my husband said, \\&quot;I smell Bottlecaps.\\&quot;  I said, \\&quot;What?\\&quot;  He said, \\&quot;Bottlecaps.  The candy.  You know, the cola ones.  It smells really good.\\&quot;  YES!  It strangely DOES have some sort of cola syrup smell, followed by a powdery amber cinnamon base.  It is delicious!  I am 35 years old and this is far from being old lady like.  I can understand the complaints from folks who say it is changed, even watered down.  Please understand that one of the primary components of this is oakmoss, which a few years back was regulated by the industry due to allergies and a lot of scents were forced to reformulate or stop being made.  So yes, it is somewhat different. But it is still way better than anything on the market today, scents that smell like candy and fruits.  There is a reason it has been around for 60 years.  In fact, my cousin just got married and Youth Dew is all she wears.  And she is 30 years old, not 95!  Please stop judging this scent by it&#x27;s initial blast.  Give it a chance to blend with your body chemistry.  And only one or two sprays!</li>
            <li> My mom loves youth dew. When she&#x27;s happy, am very happy and it&#x27;s a good day!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! It came brand new and in a sealed box. It smells just like I remember. It was delivered on time. The amount was correct. I bought one for my mom and one for myself. I would definitely recommend !</li>
            <li> My wife asked for it and was overjoyed when she received it. Hint -a little goes a long way, use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> The pump is not easy to use.  You have to really pump it to get any spray.  Never had that problem before, in over 40 years which is how long I have used Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> used this fragance for and it;s still as nice as it always was. this is a good product&lt;br /&gt; i will order it again when it;s needed</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted - saved me a trip to the Mall so I didn&#x27;t have to mingle with the crowds.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a birthday present for a dear friend.  She is pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used Youth Dew ever since I was a teenager and still use it. It is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> This was a great price for this cologne. . Its pretty old school and is getting more difficult to find in the stores. Thanks Amazon, for making my life a little easier.</li>
            <li> Old lady scent and not in a good way</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a present for a friend because she loves Youth Dew.  It was easy to order and arrived in the original box in perfect condition.  My friend was estatic when she opened this present and started wearing it right away.  I&#x27;m sure I will need to order another one for her birthday this year!</li>
            <li> Its her bday she will love it, always has for 28 yrs, every year this is one gift she requires from me, all the other gifts are my choosing.</li>
            <li> The bottle was not full like the one we bought in the store, and the fragrance was not as strong as the store bought.</li>
            <li> I have an elderly woman friend, and this is her signature fragrance; every time I hug her I can smell the fragrance. I often mention it to her, but since she wears it all the time; the fragrance is on everything she wears. I LOVE IT, and hope to get some eventually.</li>
            <li> used it for 50 years.....&lt;br /&gt;smells good and last the whole day!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the Youth Dew fragrance. It&#x27;s been a favorite for a long time. So convenient to purchase it here!!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> MY FRIEND ASKED ME FOR THIS YOUTH DEW SPRAY.  IT MAD A WONDERFUL GIFT AND MY FRIEND IS DELIGHTED. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my mother. She loved it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as it was recommended as an old perfume, which always intrigue me. Old, as in first produced as a scent in the beginning of the 20th century. I read all the reviews I could find, most of which were against the smell of the Youth Dew. It IS a very, VERY strong scent, and not a nice one, either.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it though, as I can truly say that I tried it. This is another one of those perfumes, like Joy, that I find to be not only not a nice smell, but horrid.I don&#x27;t think Youth Dew is a nice scent, but that may only be me. I prefer Oriental perfumes. such as Shalimar, but this was not good for me, even though it is an Oriental perfume as well. Not nice at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear this perfume at all - ever, never, ever ever.  It smells like dog poo on me - literally.  I know this because I actually bought a bottle from the Estee Lauder website last year so I KNOW how bad this perfume can me.  I smelled so bad, I could have killed myself.  Showered TWICE and still couldn&#x27;t get rid of the awful smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 24 hours (LOL!!) it finally went away.  Icky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, before I threw the bottle away, I tried to see if any family or friends might want it.  My mother and sister-in-law came by for coffee and I was telling them about my \\&quot;harrowing Youth Dew ordeal\\&quot; :) and they asked to smell it.  Then something completely unexpected happened and it was this, it smelled absolutely GORGEOUS on both of them!!  All woods and incense, but gorgeously done.  The thing to remember about this perfume is there really is no \\&quot;high, top notes.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s all woods and spice. But, anyway, none of us could stop smelling their wrists. It was drop dead, beautifully done perfume.  Not for kids.  It&#x27;s mature in the way that Chanel is.  But for an older, dignified, know who she is *woman*, this perfume is just beautiful in it&#x27;s sexy sort of dignity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, they fought over who got it, and my mother, old brute that she is, won..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave a five rating because if it works on you, it lives up to it&#x27;s name of being a \\&quot;perfume masterpiece.\\&quot;  But, beware, If it does not work on you, you will smell like a \\&quot;dog poo masterpiece!\\&quot; LOL ;)</li>
            <li> A woman I worked with introduced me to this perfume and I have used it ever since. I love the way you can spray it on but the smell is not overwhelming. After a few minutes, it becomes a nice soft smell that makes me feel good. Try it, you will like it.</li>
            <li> This smells so yummy!  I&#x27;m not an expert in describing a smell. I just know what I like. I continuously smell my wrist all day since it lasts forever.  I know this has been around since The 60&#x27;s....but other scents come and go and this one never smells old fashioned</li>
            <li> I was happy to be able to purchase Estee Lauders &amp;#34;Youth Dew&amp;#34; online at a very good price. I have been wearing this perfume for years and I get so many compliments on its fragrance !  Thank you !</li>
            <li> My mom asked for this for her birthday; and she absolutely loves the scent.  Subtle, and just a gorgeous scent.</li>
            <li> Youth Dew was my first perfume, a gift from my Mother, at age 18 (and that was a &#x27;few&#x27; years ago)....Am constantly told, &amp;#34;You smell SO good&amp;#34;....it has to stick around as long as I do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Estee Lauder, what else do you expect? They make the Best.It last for 24 hours +. Has been around for years and I see why it&#x27;s still around.</li>
            <li> It was ordered for my wife for Valentines day, she is happy. The stores here in to Central Valley have it but the neighborhoods around the mall are not safe, so we don&#x27;t go to the Mall anymore.</li>
            <li> Wife enjoyed receiving</li>
            <li> The YOUTH DEW by ESTEE LAUDER for women perfume I purchased as a gift mid 2014 turned out to be FAKE when I gave it 1/2 a year later. So disappointed. Always buy perfume from a reputable place or department store. Try to keep product and all receipts, just in case, for returning.</li>
            <li> Item As Described works great...!</li>
            <li> Great transaction! Made my wife happy!</li>
            <li> I used to love wearing this in my 20&#x27;s , I thought what the heck. Didn&#x27;t work out with my chemistry now. lol. It was new, unused. Smells like coca cola for sure. Just too powdery on my body at my age. Totally safe buy though.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing YD since 1998 and I adore it. It is one of the few fragrances that lasts and lasts on me.  After I use it, I can still smell it on my clothes for days.  I am told YD has a high concentration of essential oils and that is what makes it so long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like sweet, complex scents, this one could be for you.  I would probably classify it as a spicy floral with rose and jasmine as top notes.  As the fragrance wears, the spices deepen and I think, become more pronounced until you end up with primarily sweet and spicy bottom notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy a bottle, go to someplace like Sephora or Ulta and try it on. Live with it for at least 4 hours before you decide to buy. The price is quite reasonable for a high-quality designer scent such as this.</li>
            <li> I first used &amp;#34;Youth Dew&amp;#34; many years ago.  At that time, Youth Dew was an OIL.  However, as a MALE, I did not want to smell &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34;  so I would rub ONE DROP under each arm-pit after my shower, before going to work.  All the ladies at work would comment that I &amp;#34;smelled fresh and clean, like I had  &#x27;Just stopped out of the shower.&#x27;  That is all I wanted to smell like.  Unfortunately, the Youth Dew today is a &#x27;spray-on&#x27; cologne, and is far too much.  I now try just to &#x27;spray it into the air and walk through it.&#x27;  Works fairly well, at least my niece tells me that I &#x27;smell good.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Very good I used it for 40 years. Every Person says how good it smells and wants to know where I get the product</li>
            <li> I buy this every year for my mom.  Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I am fourteen years old (as I have already stated)And, I LOVE this scent! What is this scent exactly?..I mean, what are the undertones used in this perfume? Whatever they are, they smell amazing. I actually find this better than Amazing Grace by Philosophy. This was a great buy, and I am highly addicted to this scent now. But, be careful, the scent is strong,and it lasts VERY LONG, so you only have to use between one or two sprays if you prefer. Anyways, I would recommend Youth Dew for anyone who wants a perfume that smells good and actually lasts at the same time. :D</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s her favorite perfume - also takes her back to &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; days.&lt;br /&gt;An outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my grandmother.  My papa used to buy this for her thru out their marriage.  He has past away now though and it had been a while since she wore this.  I had memory&#x27;s of this smell and recalled the bottle design.  My grandmother has used this for more than 20 years now.  She was so surprised that I remembered it and said it still smelled the same as when she first wore it.  It reminded her of her youth.  I must say this is a sweet oriental spicey smell much like a chai latte.  It is very warm and great for winter.  It is not my personal taste but I know many who compliment her on it.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas present this past year and it was the most horrendous thing I have ever smelt.  If I were to describe it, I would say that it&#x27;s a weapon of mass destruction.  The scent clung to my skin and clothes and stunk up the whole room after one little spray.  Now, I&#x27;m 20 years old, so maybe that&#x27;s why I hate it so much.  I&#x27;m into fruity and floral scents and this perfume is just toxic and disgusting.  But if you&#x27;re looking for a powerful perfume, this stuff is very POWERFUL.  It certainly clears up your sinuses.</li>
            <li> Strong and spicy.  Almost killed another employee when I went to work with this on.  Smells great but may be a bit to strong.  Will buy again.  Don&#x27;t wear if you&#x27;re going some place that&#x27;s warm and cozy.  Others will be overwhelmed.</li>
            <li> Am using this sent since age 22.  Love it! I live in Texas, for the last 27 years, so it became my winter scent.</li>
            <li> good product, looks good, and the price is the lowest I can find for this fragrance. This is a great gift.</li>
            <li> I love Estee Lauder products.  This Youth Dew has such a timeless, wonderful, scent.</li>
            <li> This is a product that&#x27;s been in my family for decades.My Dad&#x27;s bought this for Mom for years,a kinda special gift that&#x27;s shown up for different occasions over the years...Christmas,Valentines Day,Birthday....This year my Dad&#x27;s now in a nursing home and Mom is at home,so Dad ask me to see if I could find it one more time for Mom for Christmas and Thanks to you  guys I did.He was so proud to give it to her and see acted like a teenager when she received it...So Thanks for helping me fashion a wonderful moment in their lives one more time.Youth Dew still works it&#x27;s magic for them even though their in their 80&#x27;s.....Thanks Again</li>
            <li> this product i had purchased as a gift for my mother in law. it smells great on her.. it was delivered in a timely manner and was very happy with it.. this is the second time purchasing this product and will continue to do so..</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as described. Thank you.</li>
            <li> lovely &amp; smells exactly as we remembert</li>
            <li> I cannot understand it. I bought the perfume spray, couldn&#x27;t believe how bad it smelled, realized I would have to buy EXACTLY what I remember having smelled so heavenly when I was 15, the BATH OIL, bought it, and it smells the same. Whatever that gorgeous smell was, it is lost. Forever, I guess. And no returns allowed on liquids. Costly selfish purchases on my part. I&#x27;ll have to do without some things I might actually have enjoyed to feel less crummy about it. This is NOT the fault of the sellers. Both my orders of this scent arrived quickly, new, unopened, packaged as pretty as can be. But about 5 years ago, my teenaged (youngest) son mentioned that the worst smelling \\&quot;girl&#x27;s perfume\\&quot; he&#x27;d ever smelled was Youth Dew by Estee Lauder. He called it \\&quot;unbearable.\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t believe him. Then I thought it must depend on the nose of the smeller. Or maybe the gender? But I&#x27;m past 60 now, widowed, and don&#x27;t care how my perfume affects the nostrils around me, only whether it pleases my own. Many years ago, this beautiful scent came into being. I first smelled it emanating from a glamorous cousin (she was a medical resident), it filled the whole 2-story house when she walked in and pulled the towel off her hair and ran upstairs to visit my mother as per usual. Right away, my mother was wearing the scent, and I got a whisper of a dab for the few dances and dates I was allowed to go on at 15. Over the next decade, this luscious smell grew so popular that it could only drop out of fashion, because literally everybody was wearing it. Thereafter, for many years, the scent was gone, as far as I could detect. Now I know my son was right: he was just talking about today&#x27;s Youth Dew by Estee Lauder, not that original glorious musk right out of a novel about old-time shieks with harems. People obviously KNOW what it smells like now, yet keep buying it, paying nearly twice what a nice-size squirter of spicy Calvin Klein Obsession would cost. Or DO they? Maybe it just sits in stock for whoever hasn&#x27;t yet learned better to buy it only once. I wish all these other reviews had been accurate. Sure would have put me in a sweeter mood. I will probably keep dabbing it on after bathing, hoping my nose will change its mind, that so many fine reviews could not possibly be mistaken or exaggerating or loyal to an eerie fault....oever hasn&#x27;t yet learned better to buy it only once. I wish all these other reviews had been accurate. Sure would have put me in a sweeter mood. I will probably keep dabbing it on after bathing, hoping my nose will change its mind, that so many fine reviews could not possibly be mistaken or exaggerating or loyal to an eerie fault....</li>
            <li> A+++  been using it 40 years, if everyone would stop complimenting I can move on... But no way</li>
            <li> I have not purchased Youth Dew by Estee Lauder for years. Decided to try again because I had liked it so well in the past. Needless to say I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Had not seen this in stores for ages, and used to use it all the time.  Love it and have had many compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li> Thank heavens I have a small bottle of the bath oil which I have been hoarding for years.  I also have an older bottle of the EDP.  It is so obvious that over a period of years, the corporate goons at Lauder, in an effort to keep costs down and to comply with the new and dreadful IFRA regulations, have made the once glorious and deep oriental wonder that WAS Youth Dew into a ghost of its former self.  My solution has been to use the oil first and follow it with the body cream, and then a brief spray over all of it.  I can get close to the way it used to smell.  I hope they just leave it alone now -- or else revive the old formula!!  I know I am not alone in this opinion.  We are legion.</li>
            <li> The only perfume I have used for almost 50 years!</li>
            <li> My review of Estee Lauder Youth Dew would be a simple, one word review:  PERFECTION.  However, Amazon requires more words.  I love this fragrance--thank goodness EL has not changed the formula.  It is timeless and even soothing.  I NEVER run out of Youth Dew.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Arrived quickly and smells fantastic. I always worry that perfume online may be old, but this smells fresh and wonderful. Will buy perfume here again.</li>
            <li> It is among my favorites.  Mixes well with my body chemistry.  Get lots and lots of compliments when I wear it!!!</li>
            <li> I have worn this for over 40 years and will till the day I die.  I feel naked without it.</li>
            <li> smells like purity class</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m givin&#x27; this stink water a five-o-la because my girlfriend loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I cannot stant the stench of this stuff.  Makes me gag, and gives me a headach that no amount of Bourbon whiskey will cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves it though, and she must be obeyed, if you guys know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I told her, hey... why don&#x27;t you keep that stuff out in yer car, so when you slather up with it in the morning, you don&#x27;t stench up the whole abode, like you usually do?  That way, you could bathe in a bit more later for a touch up, and by your own logic, that awful foot odor from your rancid sneakers in the back seat might abate just a little bit too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;ll have none of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Times like these, I resort to using Gunk Engine Brite, Hoppe&#x27;s #9 or P.B. Blaster as face splashin&#x27; stuff, just to get even.</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent. Pleasing, Warm and sensuous.</li>
            <li> Timeless fragrace of all time.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite cologne.  It comes in a simple styled bottle with easy access. It not only arrived early but met my time need as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Estee Lauder Youth Dew since the 1970s, when it was a favorite with my mother.  It smells beautiful at any age, and the unique bottle looks great on your dresser.  Rich, clean, sweet scent.  Be sure to try the powder, too.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped and delivered as promised.I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> friend of mine was wearing this cologne I asked what fragrance was it and immediately I checked Amazon for it and I ordered for my wife she enjoys it.</li>
            <li> Love this. Have worn this scent for years and always get compliments from both sexes. Not over powering at all.</li>
            <li> Gift for my mother she loves it.</li>
            <li> brought as gift for 85 year old mother at her request.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume my mom wears.  I personally don&#x27;t care for it, but she&#x27;s been using it for at least 30-40 years.</li>
            <li> I just received my order of Este Lauder Youth Dew perfume. I have worn this for probably 35 years.  This fragrance did not even resemble the fragrance that I so love.  In trying to save a couple bucks, by ordering through Amazon, I&#x27;m wondering if I received a very old expired bottle.  The packaging and the bottle were exactly the same as in the past but the smell was completely off.  Go to Este Lauder on line, pay a couple more bucks, and receive free shipping and returns through them. This will be returned!!!</li>
            <li> I have been smelling this scent for night on 37 years. Various girlfriends, a wife, my sisters and my mother. It is such a classy fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells so good ,was in the supermarket smell the lady with it on and she told me the name &amp;#34; youth dew &amp;#34;oldie but goodie</li>
            <li> Wow!  Larger bottle than I expected.  Love the soft scent of a Youth Dew.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who is celebrating her 88 birthday in a couple of weeks. She wore this when I was a young boy and it brought back great memories for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great service from this seller.</li>
            <li> Given to a friend for Christmas  her favorite fragrance.  She loved it of course and buying through Amazon is less money than buying locally.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  Buying online is much easier that going to the mall and was at a much better price.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and pretty bottle. The shining was very fast and I opened it as soon as I left my mailbox.</li>
            <li> my wife likes it &amp; that&#x27;s all that counts.  thank you</li>
            <li> Youth Dew has always been my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfum for probably close to 30 years. It is by far my favorite and I had been out for probably 6 months so when the package arrive 7days earlier than the website said it would, it was like Christmas day for me! Everything was great and I would/will definately order from this merchant again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and it was the real stuff!</li>
            <li> I love Estee Lauder&#x27;s &amp;#34;Youth Dew&amp;#34;...unfortunately, they are pricing theirselves out of the market place...as I understand it, they will be increasing their prices every 6-months...per one of their spokespersons.  I know for me, it&#x27;s getting harder for me to be able to afford it...</li>
            <li> same as it was years ago, love it..........</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Youth Dew ever since 1967 when I bought my first bottle for college.  I have loved it ever since.  It is the one fragrance that does not get \\&quot;odd\\&quot; on my body.  I use just a slight spray on my lower neck and half spray on one wrist, rubbing on the other.  I don&#x27;t want to smell up a room, but when I hug folks, I want them to enjoy the wonderful fragrance.  I have been complemented on Youth Dew for over 45 years now!</li>
            <li> HAVE LOVED THIS FRAGRANCE FOR YEARS.WILL ORDER THIS ONE AGAIN WHEN I RUN OUT.  THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Youth-Dew, particularly the addictive cola-like top notes and the powdery rose dry down, but somehow I could never actually wear it on my skin without the skanky animalic notes coming to the fore and ruining everything (it is these notes that cause many to shriek, \\&quot;Old lady!!\\&quot;). For years I could only use the perfumed-soap version. Even the bath oil, which is subtler and closer to the skin, gave me a roaring migraine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have now been converted to the realm of Youth-Dew lovers! I think two things have happened: (1) Lauder has reformulated the EDP so that it is lighter and brighter, less cloying and funky, but still very much itself--  a glorious, femme-fatale classic. (2) I have learned how to apply with restraint. I mean, half a spray on the nape of my neck to start, and maybe half a spray in the cleavage if I want a more full-on dose. Applied correctly Youth-Dew is anything BUT old-lady! It&#x27;s an intoxicating, boozy, cognac-smooth love potion of spices and blooming flowers and earthy patchouli and hippie head-shop resins and delicate powdery woods. My signature! And, I&#x27;m convinced, the inspiration for great Oriental scents of newer vintage, from Angel to Opium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like fruity body sprays and sticky gourmands and hyper-clean soapy florals-- and believe me, I like all of the above-- the first whiff of Youth Dew on your skin might shock you a bit. It&#x27;s heady, it&#x27;s a little dirty, and it&#x27;s not the least bit innocent. But good Lord it&#x27;s a beauty, and just right for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t made my purchase as yet but I&#x27;ve worn this years ago and really loved it...I would wear it after I shower from a work-out and when I reach home it drove my dog wild, she would jump all over me and sniff me like crazy, it was such a joy to watch her enjoy my fragrance.....I will be purchasing this soon, my dog has past:( but I hope it will have the same effect on my husband:)</li>
            <li> The scent of this bottle is not very strong.  Not sure if it is old or just the batch it came from.  All the other Youth Dew I have had has had a much stronger scent.  I am still using it just have too spray on a little more than usual.</li>
