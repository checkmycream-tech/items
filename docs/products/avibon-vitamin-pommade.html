    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the perfect emollient for people with that type of skin.</li>
            <li>Seems like a great product though!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great</li>
            <li>It smells great though.</li>
            <li>and I have to say Avibon works a million times better!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!!</li>
            <li>It looks even and very healthy.</li>
            <li>Super hydrating, smells great, tastes great (you can use on your lips).</li>
            <li>I use a pea sized amount, warm it in my palm</li>
            <li>I put just a pea sized drop on my fingers and rub to warm and soften before applying to my face.</li>
            <li>Great service - shipment arrived right on time without any issues.</li>
            <li>(my husband hates the smell, but I love it) and is very easy to blend over the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great substitute for Retin-A as it does not cause peeling and irritation - it leaves skin super smooth and glowy.</li>
            <li>Go to Paris and buy it way cheaper like dirt cheap!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing instead of drying like most retinal products.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I sure hope is true!</li>
            <li>I love Avibon for fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>so it melts into more of an oil, and then smooth it all over my face.</li>
            <li>Avibon is vitamin A, which is a retinoid, but it is not as strong as tretinoin.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to own up to the fact that I bought the hype.  </li>
            <li>but they ran out of an important ingredient</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning with smooth skin and a matte t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a cheap pharmacy item in France.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I came across this product after doing extensive research on skincare.</li>
            <li>If they weren&#x27;t selling it at the hype price, I would be more willing to promote it.</li>
            <li>This is a great cream for nighttime use in the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li>Now in my early 30s, my skin&#x27;s oil production level is more under control, so I now need more moisture but also combats aging while fighting blemishes.</li>
            <li>I love that it made my lips and face feel more plump and so soft.  </li>
            <li>I did not observe any change in my fine lines and hyperpigmentation, but I didn&#x27;t have much to begin with.  </li>
            <li>I stocked up in France but $27 is still worth it if you can&#x27;t get there.</li>
            <li>I like the&lt;br /&gt;product, but don&#x27;t know that it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Who in their right mind would spend $179 on this.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin smooth and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a less chemical-packed way to get retinol as an anti-aging treatment, and I found this to be a good pick.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell about fine lines and evenness</li>
            <li>I did not see any results and the smell is only okay.</li>
            <li>This is my first day using it</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Favorite French Pharmacy Items\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but I will definitely make sure I always have a tube on hand.</li>
            <li>It will not drive the results as Retin-A does, however I do believe this product diminishes lines and clears up blemishes (I can attest, as I have been using this ointment for a few months and my skin looks gorgeous).</li>
            <li>So many better products on the market if you are serious about aging skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very heavy ointment &amp; a bit &amp;#34;difficult&amp;#34; to use; however it looks good under make-up.  </li>
            <li>Is a little heavy for summer, but perfect for winter time.</li>
            <li>and I notice my makeup goes on smoother, and stays on much longer .</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Great for wrinkles ,</li>
            <li>Really????</li>
            <li>(so I used it sparingly) and a heavy rose smell (</li>
            <li>Does anyone know where the full list of ingredients is (not in French)?</li>
            <li>Make sure to use sunscreen on a daily basis, especially when using Avibon - vitamin A increases sun sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it really makes an actual difference with over-all skin &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; such as fine lines, pores, etc.</li>
            <li>Its normally around $25</li>
            <li>It is extremely moisturizing and I wake up with plumped up and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Even the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I have mature, sensitive and acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still young so as far as wrinkles go</li>
            <li>Avibon is a very rich, Vaseline-like ointment that is very thick and very emollient.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I would use this every day, but it is a good moisturizer  for rough dry skin.</li>
            <li>but if you have a major event to go to, start using this every night after cleaning for about a week to two weeks (based on your skin&#x27;s needs)</li>
            <li>I barely started using this product and it works wonders</li>
            <li>In the morning, my skin is not oily just hydrated, my pores are less noticeable, and it seems to be helping a couple of (new) acne marks to heal faster - they aren&#x27;t scars so I will update this if it does indeed help with some of the older marks with time.</li>
            <li>a little strong but not unpleasant, and it&#x27;s a little sticky/tacky feeling until it sinks in which I&#x27;m not entirely sure how long that takes since I put it on right</li>
            <li>my experience is equally good and far less expensive.  </li>
            <li>Trust me this is not worth that much $$$.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other lines such as La Mer,</li>
            <li> dry skin, chapped lips.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so a tube should last you a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I use African Black soap which can be drying</li>
            <li> I will update this on further use, but I will say that I have used this for the past 2 nights and there is actually a visible difference in my skin in the morning!</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!I only gave it 1 star because I could not write a reveiw with out rating it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other full-blast versions do, and I did notice a difference in my skin after some prolonged use.</li>
            <li> This product does not cause excessive dry/scaly skin like the regular Retin-A cream does.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> When you use it at night, it feels so heavy.</li>
            <li> any cream/ oil/ moisturizer that feels heavy and clogging my skin.</li>
            <li> While this does feel heavy, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is clogging my skin.</li>
            <li> it would have been to heavy and greasy for what my skin needed then.</li>
            <li> It smells like roses and green tea to me...</li>
            <li> It is too heavy for daytime.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also expensive and difficult to get, so in the end, I ended up just not bothering after I used up the first tube.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell if it prevents.</li>
            <li> I put a pea size on at night all over my face/neck and in the morning my skin feels like butter (my skin definitely sucks every ounce of it up by morning)</li>
            <li> By my late 20s, my skin got its act together.</li>
            <li> However, the times I have used it, I didn&#x27;t see a negative reaction, my skin glows, and marks already begin to fade after one use.</li>
            <li> and I used a very small amount</li>
            <li> I brought this like 6 months ago and after using it for a month and no good results</li>
            <li> This is a must - it is hard to find in the United States and so take advantage when you can!</li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> This is a very thick cream - almost like an ointment.</li>
            <li> which I didn&#x27;t mind but other reviewers seemed to hate).</li>
            <li> I have tried a multitude of  expensive creams and have not achieved results like I have with Avibon.  </li>
            <li> Please what the heck is wrong with this seller!</li>
            <li> For me, I hate</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking for a less chemical-packed way to get retinol as an anti-aging treatment, and I found this to be a good pick. it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other full-blast versions do, and I did notice a difference in my skin after some prolonged use. That said, the drawbacks are that it does have the consistency of petroleum jelly (so I used it sparingly) and a heavy rose smell (which I didn&#x27;t mind but other reviewers seemed to hate). It&#x27;s also expensive and difficult to get, so in the end, I ended up just not bothering after I used up the first tube. C&#x27;est la vie.</li>
            <li> Who in their right mind would spend $179 on this. Trust me this is not worth that much $$$. Go to Paris and buy it way cheaper like dirt cheap! Its like 8 US dollars! Please what the heck is wrong with this seller!</li>
            <li> I use this product every day, once a day and it keeps my skin smooth and vibrant.  It is very thick so I use only a drop.However the instructions are in french and I don&#x27;t understand french!</li>
            <li> I barely started using this product and it works wonders it heals my acne scars and stretch marks this is a fanatastic product I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> After reading Gwyneth Paltrow&#x27;s raving review of this product on GOOP I decided to try this for myself. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other lines such as La Mer, SK-11 etc and I have to say Avibon works a million times better!! Thank you GOOP! I put a pea size on at night all over my face/neck and in the morning my skin feels like butter (my skin definitely sucks every ounce of it up by morning) and I notice my makeup goes on smoother, and stays on much longer . After using it for just a few months I noticed my crows feet and scars from my old blemishes fade away!!! I&#x27;m in love!!</li>
            <li> Everyone keeps freaking out about the price. Its normally around $25 but they ran out of an important ingredient so they ceased production earlier this year &amp; are hoping to continue production in 2014. The cost is raised because you cannot find it on the shelf or online anywhere, so for people who have been using this religiously they will pay the price until it starts being sold again!</li>
            <li> I have been using a variety of products and see that the price has gone up dramatically. I did not see any results and the smell is only okay. So many better products on the market if you are serious about aging skin.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money. I brought this like 6 months ago and after using it for a month and no good results WHAT SO EVER!!!! I have a tube of this in my cabinent collecting dust. Take my advise and PLEASE dont wast your money on this.And to raise this from $40 dollars which was to much for a waste of a product. Now its $200.00. Please it should be against the law to do this to buyers. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!I only gave it 1 star because I could not write a reveiw with out rating it.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for nighttime use in the dry winter months.  I did not observe any change in my fine lines and hyperpigmentation, but I didn&#x27;t have much to begin with.  It should also be noted I only paid ~$25 for this...not over a $100!  If you are looking for a Vitamin A analogue cream, ask your doctor for an Rx of Retin-A, etc instead!</li>
            <li> This is a very thick cream - almost like an ointment. When you use it at night, it feels so heavy. But when you wake up, you can see that all that greasy heaviness is penetrated into skin.</li>
            <li> ****This product contains vitamin A and Lanolin!******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this as a night cream - it smells of roses!! It is an emollient so that means it is heavier and thicker than regular night creams. A little goes a long way so a tube should last you a couple of months. I use a pea sized amount, warm it in my palm so it melts into more of an oil, and then smooth it all over my face. For me, I hate any cream/ oil/ moisturizer that feels heavy and clogging my skin. While this does feel heavy, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is clogging my skin. I can deal with this. I wake up in the morning with smooth skin and a matte t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout my 20s, I had combination/ oily t-zone skin. I would get cystic acne occasionally that would take forever to heal! By my late 20s, my skin got its act together. Before I turned 30, this emollient would not have helped my skin. it would have been to heavy and greasy for what my skin needed then. Now in my early 30s, my skin&#x27;s oil production level is more under control, so I now need more moisture but also combats aging while fighting blemishes. This is the perfect emollient for people with that type of skin. I have only used it for a week (I know - writing a review already?!) but if you have a major event to go to, start using this every night after cleaning for about a week to two weeks (based on your skin&#x27;s needs) so your skin is glowing on the big day!&lt;br /&gt; ****This product contains vitamin A and Lanolin!******</li>
            <li> I use African Black soap which can be drying so I had no issue with Avibon being ointment like.  This is my first day using it and I used a very small amount and it did not make my face feel greasy, it made my face feel dewy.  I love that it made my lips and face feel more plump and so soft.  Too early to tell about fine lines and evenness but I will definitely do an update after using it for a bit.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Great for wrinkles , dry skin, chapped lips. Multipurpose salve&lt;br /&gt;Prefer of homeoplasmine or pawpaw ointment&lt;br /&gt;Works great</li>
            <li> I will update this on further use, but I will say that I have used this for the past 2 nights and there is actually a visible difference in my skin in the morning! It&#x27;s kind of crazy. It smells like roses and green tea to me...a little strong but not unpleasant, and it&#x27;s a little sticky/tacky feeling until it sinks in which I&#x27;m not entirely sure how long that takes since I put it on right before I go to sleep. I put just a pea sized drop on my fingers and rub to warm and soften before applying to my face. In the morning, my skin is not oily just hydrated, my pores are less noticeable, and it seems to be helping a couple of (new) acne marks to heal faster - they aren&#x27;t scars so I will update this if it does indeed help with some of the older marks with time. Seems like a great product though!</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon at the start of the year. I have been using nightly. It is too heavy for daytime. My skin texture has changed. It looks even and very healthy. I am 53 and African American so I do not have wrinkles. The problem now is that I paid $34 for this  at start of year, as I watched the price increase I bought another a couple of months ago for around $70, now it&#x27;s $179! Really???? Shame on this seller!!!!</li>
            <li> After using Avibon nightly for 1 month, I have already seen results in my skin texture and clarity.  Even the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable.  I have mature, sensitive and acne-prone skin.  This product does not cause excessive dry/scaly skin like the regular Retin-A cream does.  I have tried a multitude of  expensive creams and have not achieved results like I have with Avibon.  This product has exceeded all my expectations.  I will never be without it!!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would use this every day, but it is a good moisturizer  for rough dry skin. It smells great though. I think my skin is just too oily for it.</li>
            <li> I love Avibon for fine lines around my eyes and mouth. It&#x27;s moisturizing instead of drying like most retinal products. I also us it on my face on days when Renova is too drying. I learned about this product on Goop.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It is a cheap pharmacy item in France. Gwyneth Paltrow wrote about Avibon on her website under \\&quot;Favorite French Pharmacy Items\\&quot;. It is a miracle cream. Heals everything! Super hydrating, smells great, tastes great (you can use on your lips). Is a little heavy for summer, but perfect for winter time. I stocked up in France but $27 is still worth it if you can&#x27;t get there.</li>
            <li> Great service - shipment arrived right on time without any issues. Product was as stated in ad. I like the&lt;br /&gt;product, but don&#x27;t know that it is worth the price.  Aquaphor healing ointment has the same consistency and as far&lt;br /&gt;as my experience is equally good and far less expensive.  It doesn&#x27;t have vitamin E, but I could add that myself to any product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to own up to the fact that I bought the hype.  If they weren&#x27;t selling it at the hype price, I would be more willing to promote it. For the record, the reason I know that the Aquaphor is comparative is because I bought it for a burn on my arm and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> After switching over to \\&quot;clean\\&quot; products, I was hesitant to continue use of my Avibon. However, the times I have used it, I didn&#x27;t see a negative reaction, my skin glows, and marks already begin to fade after one use. It&#x27;s not my staple but I will definitely make sure I always have a tube on hand. I&#x27;m still young so as far as wrinkles go it&#x27;s hard to tell if it prevents. Someone here also said it doesn&#x27;t have parabens which I sure hope is true! Does anyone know where the full list of ingredients is (not in French)?</li>
            <li> I am so happy I came across this product after doing extensive research on skincare. Avibon is a very rich, Vaseline-like ointment that is very thick and very emollient. It smells of roses (my husband hates the smell, but I love it) and is very easy to blend over the skin. It is extremely moisturizing and I wake up with plumped up and smooth skin. I alternate this product with Retin-A and Refissa (both tretinoins). Avibon is vitamin A, which is a retinoid, but it is not as strong as tretinoin. This is a great substitute for Retin-A as it does not cause peeling and irritation - it leaves skin super smooth and glowy. It will not drive the results as Retin-A does, however I do believe this product diminishes lines and clears up blemishes (I can attest, as I have been using this ointment for a few months and my skin looks gorgeous). Make sure to use sunscreen on a daily basis, especially when using Avibon - vitamin A increases sun sensitivity. This is a must - it is hard to find in the United States and so take advantage when you can!</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy ointment &amp; a bit &amp;#34;difficult&amp;#34; to use; however it looks good under make-up.  Don&#x27;t know if it really makes an actual difference with over-all skin &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; such as fine lines, pores, etc.</li>
