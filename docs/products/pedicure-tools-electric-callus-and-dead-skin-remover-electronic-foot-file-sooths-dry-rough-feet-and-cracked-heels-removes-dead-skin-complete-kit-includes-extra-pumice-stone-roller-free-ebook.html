            <li>What a nice surprise to find a cute device like this that works.  </li>
            <li>Very thoughtful that that&#x27;s in there already.  </li>
            <li>You have to glide it very lightly, which takes forever.</li>
            <li>I love how it glides and removes my calluses without any pain or discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Better than the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34</li>
            <li>; removers you spend much more money on.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve bought more products than I can count to work on my wife&#x27;s alligator-skin feet.</li>
            <li>This one works better than any of them</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cute</li>
            <li>But the device itself is very useful!</li>
            <li>so it stays nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>This product removes all rough skin and makes your feet feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>My feet are all smooth again, socks and panty hose to snag any more on my heals.  </li>
            <li>Easy storage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great way to save money and still get the same results.</li>
            <li>Its ok but the instructions say that it&#x27;s extremely powerful</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use and super fast!</li>
            <li>This tool works great on dry feet.</li>
            <li>I will make sure I ALWAYS have a Pedi-Smooth ready to go.  </li>
            <li>For now I&#x27;m enjoying the benefits of much smoother feet.</li>
            <li>this is not bad.</li>
            <li>And it says not to leave it against your skin for more than 3 seconds or it will break the skin, lol, I could leave it there for 30 seconds and it hardly does anything.</li>
            <li>so I really appreciate a good product and this one definitely works well for me.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this, I thought it would be worth a try.  </li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s so easy to use, my 6 year old likes to pamper my feet with it!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Priced right.</li>
            <li>It arrived right on time</li>
            <li>it really does I can see my foot skin color for the first time in years!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different things and none of them had worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I stopped and took a shower to see if soaking my feet first would help.</li>
            <li>works very well on my calluses!</li>
            <li>This little tool is definitely the best way to go to smooth out my rough heels.  </li>
            <li>So it really works.  </li>
            <li>I was quite surprised how fast it worked!</li>
            <li>Speed is fast with new Alkaline batteries, but it is not powered with a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li>Definitely buy a different one:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones and spent time (I don&#x27;t have) and money (I shouldn&#x27;t have) at salons getting treatments for smooth heels.</li>
            <li>It is actually smoothing out my feet for the first time in 20 years.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an extra roller in the box for when you feet wear out the first roller.  </li>
            <li>and they never make my feet as soft as I like.</li>
            <li>They feel so soft now.  </li>
            <li>but when you barely press on your skin, it stops.</li>

            <li> Speed is fast with new Alkaline batteries, but it is not powered with a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, does absolutely nothing for your feet.</li>
            <li> This is perfect! Works well and does a great job!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Its very easy to use and super fast! I was quite surprised how fast it worked! I used to spend a lot of time with the pedegg and this does about the same result but faster</li>
            <li> Love this product! I get a pedicure every two weeks and they never make my feet as soft as I like. This product removes all rough skin and makes your feet feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! my pedicure tool.  I love how it glides and removes my calluses without any pain or discomfort.  I&#x27;ve tried pumice stones and spent time (I don&#x27;t have) and money (I shouldn&#x27;t have) at salons getting treatments for smooth heels. This little tool is definitely the best way to go to smooth out my rough heels.  As a business owner, I have little time so I really appreciate a good product and this one definitely works well for me. I have already started recommending it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Works good.&lt;br /&gt;Priced right.</li>
            <li> This has to be one the best electronic callus removers on the market it does the job it really does I can see my foot skin color for the first time in years!</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this callus remover!  It is simple to use, inexpensive and it works!  Definitely worth the buy.  Better than the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; removers you spend much more money on.  Easy storage.  It is actually smoothing out my feet for the first time in 20 years.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> For years now, I have been using a very small floor sander that I got from Home Depot to use on my feet to make them soft.  It worked but it was a little harsh, heavy and I had to be careful.  When I saw this, I thought it would be worth a try.  What a nice surprise to find a cute device like this that works.  I used it all over my foot, not just the rough hard spots like the heel but everywhere.  The bad dry stuff was flying off my feet!  Yet my movements were gentle and slow just like the directions say.  Thank goodness it&#x27;s lightweight.  I really liked that.  My feet loved it.  They feel so soft now.  So it really works.  I also particularly like the little brush that comes with it.  It gets the bad dry stuff that was falling away off the Pedi-Smooth so it stays nice and clean.  There&#x27;s an extra roller in the box for when you feet wear out the first roller.  Very thoughtful that that&#x27;s in there already.  I don&#x27;t have to go looking around for another one any time soon.  I will make sure I ALWAYS have a Pedi-Smooth ready to go.  I can finally get rid of the small sander (yes, sander) I&#x27;ve been using for a few years.  There no reason I can&#x27;t have nice feet all the time.  I could get used to that.  Five stars.</li>
            <li> Unit has no power. You have to glide it very lightly, which takes forever. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Best product ever! I&#x27;ve tried so many different things and none of them had worked. I finally found a solution for my dried heels. I just love it!</li>
            <li> USED EACH ROLLER ONCE THAN IT WAS NO GOOD</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought more products than I can count to work on my wife&#x27;s alligator-skin feet. She never liked any of them bc they took too much work, hurt, were messy, etc. This one works better than any of them and she uses it regularly now.</li>
            <li> this is not bad. though will not take the place of a razor</li>
            <li> This gadget is PERFECT!!  It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.  I have rough feet, and this will save me from going to a salon constantly for help with my horrible feet!!!  It arrived right on time, it&#x27;s cute and I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> Awesom product.  My feet are all smooth again, socks and panty hose to snag any more on my heals.  I love it!!! It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> So awesome!  My skin is much smoother and my feet feel great!  Who needs to spend $30 at the nail salon anymore.  This product paid for itself after 2 uses!!  Great way to save money and still get the same results.</li>
            <li> Its ok but the instructions say that it&#x27;s extremely powerful but when you barely press on your skin, it stops. And it says not to leave it against your skin for more than 3 seconds or it will break the skin, lol, I could leave it there for 30 seconds and it hardly does anything. Definitely buy a different one:)</li>
            <li> Love it best ever for your feet &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> does a nice job without a lot hassel</li>
            <li> This tool works great on dry feet. Damp feet however, not so well. Also I could not use my rechargeable batteries with it so I ended up buying regular alkaline batteries. Only a slight inconvenience. But the device itself is very useful! It had been a while since I had pampered my feet so it took some time to get the desired result. I stopped and took a shower to see if soaking my feet first would help. It helped only to soften up the dead skin. But like I said prior, it does not work well on softened skin. I will continue to use it regularly and give an objective review based on continued use. For now I&#x27;m enjoying the benefits of much smoother feet. Bonus: It&#x27;s so easy to use, my 6 year old likes to pamper my feet with it!!</li>
            <li> works very well on my calluses!</li>
            <li> Weak.  Doest work well.... Going in trash</li>
            <li> This product never worked out of the box. There is a no refund or exchange policy.  Hopefully this review will help someone from getting a useless product.</li>
