    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is an excellent razor.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it is probably the lowest price corded shaver, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about a battery needing a charge when I have to shave.  </li>
            <li>and it is great to have it around now that I&#x27;ve come to terms with it!</li>
            <li>Very good price, works great!  </li>
            <li>All in all, I was very happy that we were able to find this product.</li>
            <li>Works great, I love it</li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for about seven weeks and am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>He also liked how it felt and how the shave was.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, he was very happy when he saw that all he had to do was plug it in, and the on/off switch is large and very easy to operate.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s dry-only - would be nice to be able to wash it...</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, so</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with its performance.  </li>
            <li>I should have paid better attention when reading the description.</li>
            <li>This is definitely better.</li>
            <li>All in all am satisfied with how it shaved my legs, and again, it was a close shave which was what I like for touchups with convenience.</li>
            <li>I think I will become used to it and be glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I like the flexible head making it easy for me to shave him.</li>
            <li>but  otherwise works fine.</li>
            <li>Razor works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now buying shavers from another manufacturer online, not the ones that are available in stores.</li>
            <li>The older razor body was much more substantial, and I purchased this one for a backup to my blade razor primarily.</li>
            <li>It is not a heavy duty but makes a nice backup.</li>
            <li>They really have changed things in this Disposable Item Age, that&#x27;s however a given!!</li>
            <li>Works as expected, much better as any battery-powered unit, as it has more power from AC.</li>
            <li>Glad I hadn&#x27;t tossed the old norelco.  </li>
            <li>think it works better than his old rechargeableC</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it would do with a man&#x27;s heavier beard, but it&#x27;s worth a try with their return guarantee.</li>
            <li>you have a heavy beard or need a pop-up trimmer, this is not the shaver for you, spend more, get more.</li>
            <li>First Norelco I&#x27;ve had without one.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li>It shaved very close - once I got over the difference in speed, and yes, the cord is pretty short, but I can&#x27;t stand the charging razors, so it was the better alternative there.</li>
            <li>WE HAVE USED NORELCO RAZORS OVER THE YEARS AND FIND THEM TO BE A VERY DEPENDABLE RAZOR THAT GIVES MANY YEARS OF TROUBLE FREE SERTVICE.</li>
            <li>It does not do the job and pulls hair right from the very beginning while brand new.</li>
            <li>Real value for the money.  </li>
            <li>then you have to throw the whole thing away).  </li>
            <li>I use to buy Remington shavers only after experiencing the cheaply made shaving head of a Norelco 10 years ago, but this Norelco has a well made shaving head design.</li>
            <li>The other plus is that corded razors have more shaving power than rechargeables.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s anything like the older one my husband owned that I shaved my legs with -</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is definetely not up to the \\&quot;old Norelco\\&quot; standard of the original shavers made in Holland.</li>
            <li>I had been buying replacement heads for old razors that cost as much as the new razor.  </li>
            <li>but it cuts my admittedly light beard with no trouble and if I loose it or it breaks</li>
            <li>(If some of you there have older parents you may completely understand what I am saying).</li>
            <li>However be aware that it does have a short, coiled cord that sometimes comes out while shaving.  </li>
            <li>The head sits a bit loosely on the body but the blades are sharp and the motor is quieter than the older ones, and gives the impression it is underpowered (loud must be better)</li>
            <li>the speed was much faster in yesteryear tho&#x27; not the same model, granted.  </li>
            <li>So far it does the job, does what an electric razor is supposed to do</li>
            <li>I read other reviews and knew it had no pop-up trimmer and a short cord, but for hotel use I felt it would be fine, and it is.  </li>
            <li>I only used the new head on my old norelco.  </li>
            <li>Will have to do something different in the near future.</li>

            <li> Works as expected, much better as any battery-powered unit, as it has more power from AC. Too sad it&#x27;s dry-only - would be nice to be able to wash it...</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend.</li>
            <li> Works great, I love it</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor. Closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years. However be aware that it does have a short, coiled cord that sometimes comes out while shaving.  You must stay close to electrical outlet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for about seven weeks and am thrilled with it.  This Norelco gives me a close shave, without any pulling or discomfort.  The best part is that it is probably the lowest price corded shaver, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about a battery needing a charge when I have to shave.  The other plus is that corded razors have more shaving power than rechargeables.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this razor to anybody.its giving me bumps</li>
            <li> great,comfortable shave!</li>

            <li> Very good price, works great!  Hard to find a cord only shaver:  I don&#x27;t like rechargeables (batteries degrade then you have to throw the whole thing away).  I use to buy Remington shavers only after experiencing the cheaply made shaving head of a Norelco 10 years ago, but this Norelco has a well made shaving head design.</li>
            <li> Razor works fine. I was disappointed it doesn&#x27;t have a pop up trimmer. First Norelco I&#x27;ve had without one. I should have paid better attention when reading the description.</li>
            <li> Try to find a &amp;#34;corded&amp;#34; razor in your local stores. Almost impossible. I purchased this for my father who simply wanted a razor with a cord. He&#x27;s older, and the charging system confused him; some of the elderly cannot understand &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; products. (If some of you there have older parents you may completely understand what I am saying). Nonetheless, he was very happy when he saw that all he had to do was plug it in, and the on/off switch is large and very easy to operate. He also liked how it felt and how the shave was. All in all, I was very happy that we were able to find this product. NOT EASY TO FIND A CORDED RAZOR anymore, and I stress that point.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; is a joke. The motor is intentionally made slower than the other shavers. It does not do the job and pulls hair right from the very beginning while brand new. Also NORELCO now pulls a scam where they never indicate on any of their shavers whether they got a beard trimmed in the back of the shaver. There is no way to look that feature up until you purchase the shaver. I bought this one expecting it to have a beard trimmer on the back, but it does not! Beware. I do not see a reason why make a shaver motor slower than other shavers. I used the head on my faster shaver and threw this one away. Avoid. I&#x27;m now buying shavers from another manufacturer online, not the ones that are available in stores. The ones who gave it 5 stars must be Norelco employees.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to shave my elderly father.I like the flexible head making it easy for me to shave him. I&lt;br /&gt;like that it;s a plug in .I think it works better than his old rechargeableC</li>
            <li> Exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li> Bought this low price shaver as a travel item.  I read other reviews and knew it had no pop-up trimmer and a short cord, but for hotel use I felt it would be fine, and it is.  And it uses the same replacement blades as my house shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definetely not up to the \\&quot;old Norelco\\&quot; standard of the original shavers made in Holland. The cord is short, like 18 inches so be close to a plug.  The head sits a bit loosely on the body but the blades are sharp and the motor is quieter than the older ones, and gives the impression it is underpowered (loud must be better) but it cuts my admittedly light beard with no trouble and if I loose it or it breaks I am not out $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a heavy beard or need a pop-up trimmer, this is not the shaver for you, spend more, get more.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s anything like the older one my husband owned that I shaved my legs with - the speed was much faster in yesteryear tho&#x27; not the same model, granted.  The older razor body was much more substantial, and I purchased this one for a backup to my blade razor primarily. It shaved very close - once I got over the difference in speed, and yes, the cord is pretty short, but I can&#x27;t stand the charging razors, so it was the better alternative there. Already returned a Lady Remington last week and a Remington trimming electric as well - they were totally useless! This is definitely better. My hair is very fine, so I don&#x27;t know what it would do with a man&#x27;s heavier beard, but it&#x27;s worth a try with their return guarantee. All in all am satisfied with how it shaved my legs, and again, it was a close shave which was what I like for touchups with convenience. Inexpensive too - and it is great to have it around now that I&#x27;ve come to terms with it! Less abrasive than the older one too - again, model differences?  I think I will become used to it and be glad I bought it. They really have changed things in this Disposable Item Age, that&#x27;s however a given!!</li>
            <li> So far it does the job, does what an electric razor is supposed to do</li>
