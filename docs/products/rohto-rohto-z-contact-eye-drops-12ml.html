            <li>I love the cooling sensation.</li>
            <li>These are the best, cool feeling , clear eyes immediately</li>
            <li>the most I ever paid for eye drops, but I think it is so worth the feeling and not to mention the super trendy bottle it comes it.</li>
            <li>Love these, great for dry eye.</li>
            <li>I work 12hr shifts at night starring at a computer monitor, I was even thinking about getting special glasses for work but found this</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of zing, and formulated for contacts leaves me guilt-free!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used and loved regular rohto drops for when I&#x27;m simply wearing my glasses, by somehow these ones feel SO much better and provide so much for relief.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hard to resist towards the evening hours because I know how great my eyes would feel after I use them.</li>
            <li>The product itself is stellar.</li>
            <li>Your eyes will definitely feel more awake, look whiter and more open after using them.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Rhoto!</li>
            <li>When I first used these eye drops</li>
            <li>Initially they do burn but it&#x27;s refreshing, though it does fade over time</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I read a lot of positive reviews about it and needed something for my eyes.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I am going to have to reorder soon as everyone wants to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works really well, makes my eyes feel like ice cubes</li>
            <li>I really ask for contact one because I used circles lens..</li>
            <li>I seldom wrote a review, bu I really love the icy feeling after applying this eye drop.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try other contact friendly rohto drops!</li>
            <li>I use these before dinner parties to get my eyes super white.</li>
            <li>Your eyes will no be able to open at first due to the cooling effect of a menthol like substance.</li>
            <li>It starts off feeling a little bit overwhelming</li>
            <li>These are definitely the REAL DEAL when it comes to eye drops.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a burst of refreshment unlike no other drops I have tried, and if you haven&#x27;t worked your way through the several intensities that the regular US version of ROHTO drops have, I suggest you prepare for a cold refreshing blast that relaxes tired eyes, and works great when you&#x27;ve been staring at computer screens all day.</li>
            <li>it does relieves the dryness and uncomfortable resulting from contact lenses and its very cool for the first 3 sec</li>
            <li>wear contacts almost daily and generally from wake to slumber (14+ hours per day).</li>
            <li>After the first few drops your eyes get used to the feeling though.</li>
            <li>The first few times I tried these they definitely stung like people said they would.</li>

            <li> , I wish it lasted all day but usually lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> you for the small gift, a paper crane.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the ROHTO brand of eye drops, there&#x27;s not much more that can be said about these drops, except for the fact they&#x27;re made for contact</li>
            <li> I use the drops at least once a day when I&#x27;m not looking at the computer monitor.</li>
            <li> Cooling effect wakes up tired eyes</li>
            <li> I am not happy</li>
            <li> It is very expensive...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> As a contact lens wearer with perpetually dry or irritated eyes, this was a godsend. By far the best eye drops I&#x27;ve ever used for contacts. I&#x27;ve always used and loved regular rohto drops for when I&#x27;m simply wearing my glasses, by somehow these ones feel SO much better and provide so much for relief. Can&#x27;t wait to try other contact friendly rohto drops!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read a lot of positive reviews about it and needed something for my eyes. I work 12hr shifts at night starring at a computer monitor, I was even thinking about getting special glasses for work but found this and it works. I don&#x27;t have experience with the US version of this product but I absolutely recommend this one. I would describe it as them doing for your eyes what mints do to your mouth, they just feel refreshed and awake.</li>
            <li> The container is awesome. I get inquiries every time I pull it out. The product itself is stellar. It does sting a bit for people not used to it but I honestly love it now. It&#x27;s like my eyes know that following this brief, minty sensation on my eyeballs will be followed by instant freshness. The price was the only thing keeping me from trying it sooner but after trying 3 or 4 other brands (specific to contacts) I decided to give them a shot. I am going to have to reorder soon as everyone wants to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear contacts almost daily and generally from wake to slumber (14+ hours per day). I try not to use these daily but it&#x27;s hard to resist towards the evening hours because I know how great my eyes would feel after I use them.</li>
            <li> Works really well, makes my eyes feel like ice cubes</li>
            <li> These are wonderful drops when wearing my contact lenses!</li>
            <li> These are the best, cool feeling , clear eyes immediately</li>
            <li> Better than any eye drops we have in the states for contacts. Wakes me up and gets me going in the afternoon. I use these before dinner parties to get my eyes super white. Makes you look really healthy and confident.</li>
            <li> This is great for contact and non-contact wearers. The first few times you use it, wowza! Your eyes will no be able to open at first due to the cooling effect of a menthol like substance. Your eyes will definitely feel more awake, look whiter and more open after using them. It&#x27;s an eye wake up call:)</li>
            <li> Love these drops.  Just the right amount of zing, and formulated for contacts leaves me guilt-free!  Thanks, Rhoto!</li>
            <li> Love it .. Cooling effect wakes up tired eyes might order again</li>
            <li> I really ask for contact one because I used circles lens.. and I got refresh your eyes when ....price to different pay extra $$$$5.99 I am not happy I hope they get back too me</li>
            <li> I love the cooling sensation. It makes my eyes white, I wish it lasted all day but usually lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> I seldom wrote a review, bu I really love the icy feeling after applying this eye drop.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the small gift, a paper crane.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a contact lens-friendly eye drops and this is a godsend!  The tingling feel lasts for a few seconds but the moisturizing effect lasts for a couple hours. I use the drops at least once a day when I&#x27;m not looking at the computer monitor. I do have to use the drops every 3 hours or so for when I have to work an 8-hour shift staring at a computer monitor. These drops also helps with eye fatigue and makes my eye white whiter. Since I have Dry Eye Syndrome, these drops help alleviate the discomfort. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I always have fatigued eyes from work and staring at my computer for 8 hours with my contacts on. When I first used these eye drops It felt like I dropped ice cubes in my eyeballs. It starts off feeling a little bit overwhelming and then it immediately wakens me up and widen my eyes. I LOVE the feeling!!!! The icy feeling last about only a few minutes, but it keeps my eyes still feeling awake for longer time. It is very expensive...the most I ever paid for eye drops, but I think it is so worth the feeling and not to mention the super trendy bottle it comes it. Try it out!</li>
            <li> it does relieves the dryness and uncomfortable resulting from contact lenses and its very cool for the first 3 sec then it would go away. its just the moist doesnt stay for very long. maybe it was the problem of my contact lenses</li>
            <li> These are definitely the REAL DEAL when it comes to eye drops. Absolutely THE BEST....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the ROHTO brand of eye drops, there&#x27;s not much more that can be said about these drops, except for the fact they&#x27;re made for contact wearers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a burst of refreshment unlike no other drops I have tried, and if you haven&#x27;t worked your way through the several intensities that the regular US version of ROHTO drops have, I suggest you prepare for a cold refreshing blast that relaxes tired eyes, and works great when you&#x27;ve been staring at computer screens all day.</li>
            <li> The first few times I tried these they definitely stung like people said they would. After the first few drops your eyes get used to the feeling though. I&#x27;ve been using them for months now and they feel amazing</li>
            <li> I honestly prefer the stinging eye drops. Initially they do burn but it&#x27;s refreshing, though it does fade over time and my eye gets used to it, to the point where I cant feel them unless I dont wear contacts. So I might go a few weeks or a month without using them.  And sometimes I&#x27;ll use the rhoto lycee eye drops. I wish they weren&#x27;t so pricey but I cant find them in my hometown markets.</li>
            <li> Love these, great for dry eye. Wont use any other eye drops EVER</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Excellent product if you like the cooling sensation! Best contact lens eye drop out of all rohto products.</li>
