            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but makes the shaving experience very nice.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather quit as good as truett hill, but is still a great cream for shaving.</li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t my favorite fragrance, it&#x27;s still awesome stuff!</li>
            <li>, this product does not have a pleasant lemon-lime scent, it smells like lemon detergent.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a good citrus shaving cream tgis is the one to get</li>
            <li>I did not immediately loved.</li>
            <li>and I love &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; it to shave my legs!</li>
            <li>I build lather on the face and find it feels amazing going on and building up.  </li>
            <li>Try the lavender scent, it&#x27;s simply amazing.</li>
            <li>My Face\\&quot; amazingly the cheapest.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s in is nice as well.  </li>
            <li>the rose</li>
            <li>Smells nice, protects the skin well</li>
            <li>It is however NICE.</li>
            <li>The shave itself is very smooth, even better with a good pre-shave like the edwin Jagger pre-shave lotion, or TOBS preshave gel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Taylor of Old Bond Street for about 3 years now, this stuff is perfect and the lemon and lime has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years, and have always liked it.  </li>
            <li>however this scent is not my favorite I like The Sandlewood and Rose much better</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t give this any more than one star based on the shape the product came in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite (DR Harris Arlington), but $ for $</li>
            <li>Started using a double sided safety razor - and this cream is the best.</li>
            <li>Plus I love the smell.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it is a handsome plastic container, maybe I can use it for something.</li>
            <li>It just detracted so much from what is otherwise a great product.  </li>
            <li>I love Taylor of bond St</li>
            <li>I would have no problem using it if I couldn&#x27;t get to one of the top</li>
            <li>Sure beats the stuff out of the can.</li>
            <li>Its a nice light citrus soap smell.</li>
            <li>Its pretty good but just seems to lack the \\&quot;glide\\&quot; and closeness of the others.</li>
            <li>Lemon Lime smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is very mild so if you are looking for a stronger citrus scent I would make sure you either get one of the lime pre/post shave lotions oils or a citrus scented aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and really feels good on the face.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the smooth shave it gives.  </li>
            <li>it is a good value and does a much better than average job of lathering and making for a smooth, pleasant shave.</li>
            <li>Its easy to make the foam</li>
            <li>be it straight blade or a DE safety razor whose looking for an exceptional shave</li>
            <li>The lime scent is refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is VERY mild</li>
            <li>Not at all too strong.  </li>
            <li>but this smells just fine to me.  </li>
            <li>The shaving protection is adequate but Proraso seems to protect better.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take very much to make a really nice brush full of lather.</li>
            <li>great soap, lathers and smells terrific</li>
            <li>Mr Taylor&#x27;s, both of which left me wanting.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemon and Lime is a delightful scent, to be sure, and of the four Taylor scents I&#x27;ve tried is my second favorite.</li>
            <li>is all you need on tip of brush to a great later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to give it one star because it&#x27;s probably a great product for some people, but this just simply did not work for me.    </li>
            <li>/&gt; returned and that I could dispose of it as I saw fit.</li>
            <li>Taylor&#x27;s Cream is great, Five stars all the way, the only shaving cream that I will use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 62 and have use several Taylor product and the lemon lime is the one I like the best, and by the way I use a 1958 Gillette  fatboy double edge with feather blade(the best blade out there) and enjoy the taylor better than any of the other fragrances,and I will keep buying it!</li>
            <li>Excellent as usual great price as that 5.3 ounce jar lasts as long as 4 cans of shaving cream as a dime</li>
            <li>Like every other ToOBS cream I&#x27;ve used it is a great easy lather.  </li>
            <li>I am delighted with the items and the wooden bowl for the soap puck.</li>
            <li>I really like this,subtle but refreshing.</li>
            <li>and if there&#x27;s anything to this aroma therapy business - it&#x27;s abundantly clear in how relaxing the rose scent is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that I may be mildly allergic to one of the ingredients, because it made my face mildly itchy in a way that I haven&#x27;t experienced with other creams and soaps.    </li>
            <li>Not much is necessary, just a plastic seal around the bowl, or a better seal on top of the cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It lingers for a while but fades quickly</li>
            <li>Personally I prefer the Rose, Lavander and Sandlewood - but do enjoy the lime on occassion.</li>
            <li>We love Taylor of Old Bond!!</li>
            <li>Lathers up great and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much.</li>
            <li>Love it as all of the Taylor of Old Bond</li>
            <li>My favorite scent so far.</li>
            <li>and yes, its worth a try if your on the fence.</li>
            <li>I love Old Bond shaving creams.  </li>
            <li>I love the taylor of old bond shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Taylors , to me, is waiting  right outside the top ring.</li>
            <li>If you are in a hot area it may be melted but should cool and thicken back up just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great cream, I will definitely be buying more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>but it is always my first choice in the morning.  </li>
            <li>first chose, with some trepidation</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d try a different fragrance because I wanted something with a bit more body.</li>
            <li>Really smells like lemon and lime!</li>
            <li>The first giveaway that these were fakes was the label on the lid.</li>
            <li>The Art of Shaving and my personal favorite, \\&quot;Kiss</li>
            <li>I shave about 1-2 times a week and each jar lasts me about 6 months, but I am pretty liberal with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice lemon-lime with no chemical smell as with some other shaving creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Classy, rich, just an absolute beaute of a scent.</li>
            <li>I use a shaving brush to work up a lather and find just using this tiny bit is more than enough for two full latherings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product is great, but the way it arrives from Amazon is so jarring, that you have to think very hard about whether or not to use it.  </li>
            <li>Love TOBS, but the container was about one-third empty</li>
            <li>Let me say there is a much noticed difference.  </li>
            <li>was much, much</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a real shame.</li>
            <li>thought I might end up smelling like someone&#x27;s great granny - or worse, a funeral parlor all day</li>
            <li>My absolute favourite is Mr. Taylor&#x27;s Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li>Use a brush to apply, shave, then enjoy the smell like you just left the barber shop!</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>really dont want to say the seller or somebody within the seller&#x27;s company is tampering with these creams</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few others, but the lather from this cream is really nice.</li>
            <li>A little strong at first but not overpowering or cloying - fresh and</li>
            <li>(it looked like someone took an ice cream scoop to the tub), and the cream appeared to have a much more viscous consistency than I&#x27;m used to from other Taylor creams.</li>
            <li>I really do love the shave I get from this cream and will be buying it again, probably trying other scents as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It costs a little more than others</li>
            <li>This lemon-lime cream itself is the same good quality as the others; it&#x27;s rich and thick and just a dab on the end of a wet brush is enough for two applications for a smooth and close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cream provides a drag and nick free shave.</li>
            <li>It softens the whiskers so much that the blade has no trouble making mincemeat out of them.</li>
            <li>I bought Old Bond from reviews and its reputation and I was not dissapointed, makes a very craemy lather with my tweeserman brush, I bought the Lemon/lime and the Coconut Creams and THREW the cans of shaving cream away.</li>
            <li>you only need a tiny bit (the size of a small almond) to produce a great volume of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Drives the ladies wild!</li>
            <li>creams\\&quot; being in constant movement in a hot truck while the \\&quot;USPS creams\\&quot; stop so often at a warehouse or whatever</li>
            <li>- I use about a fingertip full of cream and using a fully wet badger brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street is one of those little luxuries I think anyone would enjoy.</li>
            <li>However, the cream had clearly melted and slopped partly out of it&#x27;s plastic bowl.</li>
            <li>, Others have complained about the fragrance, the fragrance is for you to enjoy,then you put on your favorite after shave or cologne,to finish off you routine.</li>
            <li>Instead of being printed directly on the plastic, they were&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is another winner from Taylor of Old Bond Street.  </li>
            <li>a soft cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a soft citric scent,&lt;br /&gt;which</li>
            <li>In that time I have only tried a few scents and am hooked on the sandalwood scent the most.</li>
            <li>It had whipped up a little on one side, I tapped it down on the counter and it evened out nicely.  </li>
            <li>For any product to last that long I surmised it just had to be worth a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this companies entire product line.  </li>
            <li>Quickly creates a good base for shaving.  </li>
            <li>NONE of the TOBS creams have a heavy, sweet or cloying fragrance - they fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know someone that thinks it is a great scent, he&#x27;s wrong on other things also.</li>
            <li>I generally mix it in a coffee mug with a dab of water.  </li>
            <li>It must have been last August when I tried a sample of Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving</li>
            <li>I have an old container that I bought with the same shaving cream</li>
            <li>There is no way that such a prestigious company as Taylor of Old Bond Street would put out such</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick with my soaps, because those give me more bang for the buck and last far longer than this expensive container of cream.</li>
            <li>This product is less expensive and is just as good.  </li>
            <li>they are fast to lather with little water.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My favorite scent so far.</li>
            <li> and yes, its worth a try if your on the fence.</li>
            <li> I love Old Bond shaving creams.  </li>
            <li> I love the taylor of old bond shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Taylors , to me, is waiting  right outside the top ring.</li>
            <li> If you are in a hot area it may be melted but should cool and thicken back up just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great cream, I will definitely be buying more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> but it is always my first choice in the morning.  </li>
            <li> first chose, with some trepidation</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d try a different fragrance because I wanted something with a bit more body.</li>
            <li> Really smells like lemon and lime!</li>
            <li> The first giveaway that these were fakes was the label on the lid.</li>
            <li> The Art of Shaving and my personal favorite, \\&quot;Kiss</li>
            <li> I shave about 1-2 times a week and each jar lasts me about 6 months, but I am pretty liberal with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lemon-lime with no chemical smell as with some other shaving creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Classy, rich, just an absolute beaute of a scent.</li>
            <li> I use a shaving brush to work up a lather and find just using this tiny bit is more than enough for two full latherings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is great, but the way it arrives from Amazon is so jarring, that you have to think very hard about whether or not to use it.  </li>
            <li> Love TOBS, but the container was about one-third empty</li>
            <li> Let me say there is a much noticed difference.  </li>
            <li> was much, much</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a real shame.</li>
            <li> thought I might end up smelling like someone&#x27;s great granny - or worse, a funeral parlor all day</li>
            <li> My absolute favourite is Mr. Taylor&#x27;s Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li> Use a brush to apply, shave, then enjoy the smell like you just left the barber shop!</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> really dont want to say the seller or somebody within the seller&#x27;s company is tampering with these creams</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others, but the lather from this cream is really nice.</li>
            <li> A little strong at first but not overpowering or cloying - fresh and</li>
            <li> (it looked like someone took an ice cream scoop to the tub), and the cream appeared to have a much more viscous consistency than I&#x27;m used to from other Taylor creams.</li>
            <li> I really do love the shave I get from this cream and will be buying it again, probably trying other scents as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It costs a little more than others</li>
            <li> This lemon-lime cream itself is the same good quality as the others; it&#x27;s rich and thick and just a dab on the end of a wet brush is enough for two applications for a smooth and close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cream provides a drag and nick free shave.</li>
            <li> It softens the whiskers so much that the blade has no trouble making mincemeat out of them.</li>
            <li> I bought Old Bond from reviews and its reputation and I was not dissapointed, makes a very craemy lather with my tweeserman brush, I bought the Lemon/lime and the Coconut Creams and THREW the cans of shaving cream away.</li>
            <li> you only need a tiny bit (the size of a small almond) to produce a great volume of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Drives the ladies wild!</li>
            <li> creams\\&quot; being in constant movement in a hot truck while the \\&quot;USPS creams\\&quot; stop so often at a warehouse or whatever</li>
            <li> - I use about a fingertip full of cream and using a fully wet badger brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street is one of those little luxuries I think anyone would enjoy.</li>
            <li> However, the cream had clearly melted and slopped partly out of it&#x27;s plastic bowl.</li>
            <li> , Others have complained about the fragrance, the fragrance is for you to enjoy,then you put on your favorite after shave or cologne,to finish off you routine.</li>
            <li> Instead of being printed directly on the plastic, they were&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is another winner from Taylor of Old Bond Street.  </li>
            <li> a soft cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a soft citric scent,&lt;br /&gt;which</li>
            <li> In that time I have only tried a few scents and am hooked on the sandalwood scent the most.</li>
            <li> It had whipped up a little on one side, I tapped it down on the counter and it evened out nicely.  </li>
            <li> For any product to last that long I surmised it just had to be worth a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this companies entire product line.  </li>
            <li> Quickly creates a good base for shaving.  </li>
            <li> NONE of the TOBS creams have a heavy, sweet or cloying fragrance - they fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know someone that thinks it is a great scent, he&#x27;s wrong on other things also.</li>
            <li> I generally mix it in a coffee mug with a dab of water.  </li>
            <li> It must have been last August when I tried a sample of Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving</li>
            <li> I have an old container that I bought with the same shaving cream</li>
            <li> There is no way that such a prestigious company as Taylor of Old Bond Street would put out such</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick with my soaps, because those give me more bang for the buck and last far longer than this expensive container of cream.</li>
            <li> This product is less expensive and is just as good.  </li>
            <li> they are fast to lather with little water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mistake, You really do not need a lot to get a really rich, thick lather.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews have said the smell was very unappealing, but I liked it.</li>
            <li> Good consistency when it arrived, it is cold out here so less heat to deal with during shipping.  </li>
            <li> The cream had been sloshed around the container, so that it looked like a 7 year old had filled it haphazardly.  </li>
            <li> There was far less of the product in my jar than there should have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little concerned when the item first arrived because it was a lot creamier less solid than what I was used to with other TOBS creams, thinking I was going to be going through this in no time.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was how heavy this little tub of shave cream was</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my order it&#x27;s been one of my personal favorites, and I would say a must have for any wet shaver</li>
            <li> For a long time I used either Crabtree &amp; Evelyn or Art of Shaving shaving cream in a tub.</li>
            <li> I got the same quality product with the Lemon and Lime as the other TOBS creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Like the other TOBS shaving creams, the scent is there during the shave but disappears after the final rinse.</li>
            <li> was half empty and either melted and stuck around the edges with a big hole in the middle.</li>
            <li> The smell is very subdued its not bright and citrusy...</li>
            <li> I know this because my previous (and only) TOBS cream had melted on the way to my house through UPS.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if longevity of this product is a concern, I would say that you are definitely getting plenty of bang for your buck, and a little really does lather very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> I really feel bad about making these allegations but It&#x27;s just too much of a coincidence.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so incredibly lush and thick</li>
            <li> little- benefit of the doubt, my other TOBS cream is avocado and it has a different consistency (fluffier or yogurty like) than this lemon-lime cream (harder, kinda like cream cheese)</li>
            <li> I have read some other unflattering reviews on that side, with some calling it to artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what was going on with the item, but after reading other reviews that also appeared to show possible tampering, I placed this one in the trash.</li>
            <li> but I manually settled the cream and compared it to my other TOBS cream and this one</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews, this seems typical.  </li>
            <li> Black specks seem out of place in this product and I haven&#x27;t ever noticed it before in any I recieved from other suppliers.</li>
            <li> had about a quarter less cream than my other TOBS cream...</li>
            <li> I initially thought this will be a hard soap,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried stirring it up and letting it sit for a few days, but it never regained the consistency of other TOBS products purchased from other retailers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve narrowed it down to Truefitt&amp;Hill,</li>
            <li> that would also mean it&#x27;s less likely to melt as easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I seriously considered sending it back because I didn&#x27;t know if it had been tampered with.  </li>
            <li> It just needs to put minds at ease about whether or not this product has been used previously, tampered with, or otherwise corrupted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had intended on saving $6 over my typical supplier</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s less cream, however,</li>
            <li> I had a very difficult time working this into a lather that wasn&#x27;t too dry, and this really irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is going on with this product but like other buyers it looked like my container</li>
            <li> just a little soap on a brush makes a lot of lather.  </li>
            <li> You figure with the $8 price that all this is a little</li>
            <li> was not familiar with using creams,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> but instead I just wasted $8, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the almond or St. James TOBS shaving creams</li>
            <li> Now, if your looking for &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34;, vibrant lemon lime you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My last shipment came in all dried up and hard :(</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product....</li>
            <li> It still has the toughest competition ahead facing off, so to speak, against the royalty(most expensive) Art of Shaving, and the people&#x27;s favorite(least expensive) Kiss My Face.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it still has a faint scent of the lemon-lime, this after 18 years!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Like every other ToOBS cream I&#x27;ve used it is a great easy lather.  The shave is great.  I just do not care for the scent.  I know someone that thinks it is a great scent, he&#x27;s wrong on other things also.</li>
            <li> Love TOBS, but the container was about one-third empty (it looked like someone took an ice cream scoop to the tub), and the cream appeared to have a much more viscous consistency than I&#x27;m used to from other Taylor creams. Can&#x27;t give this any more than one star based on the shape the product came in.</li>
            <li> Love it as all of the Taylor of Old Bond</li>
            <li> I tried this cream after using Omega shaving cream for a bit.  Let me say there is a much noticed difference.  I really do love the shave I get from this cream and will be buying it again, probably trying other scents as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned when the item first arrived because it was a lot creamier less solid than what I was used to with other TOBS creams, thinking I was going to be going through this in no time.  My mistake, You really do not need a lot to get a really rich, thick lather.  I build lather on the face and find it feels amazing going on and building up.  The shave itself is very smooth, even better with a good pre-shave like the edwin Jagger pre-shave lotion, or TOBS preshave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very mild so if you are looking for a stronger citrus scent I would make sure you either get one of the lime pre/post shave lotions oils or a citrus scented aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great cream, I will definitely be buying more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have been using this for about two weeks now and am just now using up the residue that was on the lid, I haven&#x27;t even touched the cream that was in the jar.  So if longevity of this product is a concern, I would say that you are definitely getting plenty of bang for your buck, and a little really does lather very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Taylor, both the cream and the soap. I am delighted with the items and the wooden bowl for the soap puck. However, the cream had clearly melted and slopped partly out of it&#x27;s plastic bowl. There was an indentation in the cream as if it had been  touched.</li>
            <li> I got the same quality product with the Lemon and Lime as the other TOBS creams I have tried.  I don&#x27;t have any scent skills but this smells just fine to me.  I have read some other unflattering reviews on that side, with some calling it to artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issues with spillage on mine.  The inner plastic cover was intact, not a seal mind you, but a plastic cap inside the lid.  It had whipped up a little on one side, I tapped it down on the counter and it evened out nicely.  Good consistency when it arrived, it is cold out here so less heat to deal with during shipping.  If you are in a hot area it may be melted but should cool and thicken back up just fine.</li>
            <li> great soap, lathers and smells terrific</li>
            <li> I really like this,subtle but refreshing.</li>
            <li> I like this shave cream a lot.  It&#x27;s not my favorite (DR Harris Arlington), but $ for $ it is a good value and does a much better than average job of lathering and making for a smooth, pleasant shave.</li>
            <li> Started using a double sided safety razor - and this cream is the best. Its easy to make the foam - I use about a fingertip full of cream and using a fully wet badger brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others, but the lather from this cream is really nice. Plus I love the smell. No complaints.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather quit as good as truett hill, but is still a great cream for shaving. I would definitely recommend it to someone else.</li>
            <li> I have been hooked on Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams since I started wet shaving over a decade ago. In that time I have only tried a few scents and am hooked on the sandalwood scent the most. (I&#x27;ve also tried the Eton College one and Mr Taylor&#x27;s, both of which left me wanting.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lemon and Lime is a delightful scent, to be sure, and of the four Taylor scents I&#x27;ve tried is my second favorite.I now keep a jar of this and the sandalwood both in my medicine cabinet so I can alternate between the two.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent so far. If your looking for a good citrus shaving cream tgis is the one to get</li>
            <li> Excellent as usual great price as that 5.3 ounce jar lasts as long as 4 cans of shaving cream as a dime is all you need on tip of brush to a great later. Great smell also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to give it one star because it&#x27;s probably a great product for some people, but this just simply did not work for me.    I had a very difficult time working this into a lather that wasn&#x27;t too dry, and this really irritated my skin. I think that I may be mildly allergic to one of the ingredients, because it made my face mildly itchy in a way that I haven&#x27;t experienced with other creams and soaps.    I&#x27;m going to stick with my soaps, because those give me more bang for the buck and last far longer than this expensive container of cream. On the plus side, it is a handsome plastic container, maybe I can use it for something.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years, and have always liked it.  The shaving cream itself is great, and the plastic tub that it&#x27;s in is nice as well.  However, I have bought this product in person, and it&#x27;s presentation was much, much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this arrived, it was unsealed.  The cream had been sloshed around the container, so that it looked like a 7 year old had filled it haphazardly.  Reading other reviews, this seems typical.  I seriously considered sending it back because I didn&#x27;t know if it had been tampered with.  It just detracted so much from what is otherwise a great product.  Not much is necessary, just a plastic seal around the bowl, or a better seal on top of the cream.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be air-tight, even.  It just needs to put minds at ease about whether or not this product has been used previously, tampered with, or otherwise corrupted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is great, but the way it arrives from Amazon is so jarring, that you have to think very hard about whether or not to use it.  That&#x27;s a real shame.</li>
            <li> I have been using Taylor for several years.  I love the scent and the smooth shave it gives.  It costs a little more than others but it is always my first choice in the morning.  I would also recommend the sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Very nice citrus and lime scent.  Not at all too strong.  Makes for a very nice wake up at the morning shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using Taylor of Old Bond Street for about 3 years now, this stuff is perfect and the lemon and lime has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> I love Taylor of bond St however this scent is not my favorite I like The Sandlewood and Rose much better</li>
            <li> It must have been last August when I tried a sample of Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my order it&#x27;s been one of my personal favorites, and I would say a must have for any wet shaver be it straight blade or a DE safety razor whose looking for an exceptional shave experiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first chose, with some trepidation the rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I might end up smelling like someone&#x27;s great granny - or worse, a funeral parlor all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in reading about the product itself as well as the scent both date back to 1850&#x27;s. For any product to last that long I surmised it just had to be worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the scent is delicious. A little strong at first but not overpowering or cloying - fresh and fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lingers for a while but fades quickly and if there&#x27;s anything to this aroma therapy business - it&#x27;s abundantly clear in how relaxing the rose scent is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was how heavy this little tub of shave cream was, it&#x27;s the densest shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s so incredibly lush and thick you only need a tiny bit (the size of a small almond) to produce a great volume of lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing &#x27;soapy\\&quot; about the cream and it glides over your face with ease - I use a shaving brush to work up a lather and find just using this tiny bit is more than enough for two full latherings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream provides a drag and nick free shave. It softens the whiskers so much that the blade has no trouble making mincemeat out of them. Afterwards your skin feels refreshed and supple without any dryness whatsoever. The lime scent is refreshing and clean. Personally I prefer the Rose, Lavander and Sandlewood - but do enjoy the lime on occassion. NONE of the TOBS creams have a heavy, sweet or cloying fragrance - they fade quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor of Old Bond Street is one of those little luxuries I think anyone would enjoy.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is going on with this product but like other buyers it looked like my container was half empty and either melted and stuck around the edges with a big hole in the middle. The fragrance is VERY mild almost not there. The shaving protection is adequate but Proraso seems to protect better. I wouldn&#x27;t order from these folks again and I&#x27;d try a different fragrance because I wanted something with a bit more body.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Smells nice, protects the skin well and it doesn&#x27;t take very much to make a really nice brush full of lather.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, something is afoot. My product was also &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; separated into parts and leaked. I tried stirring it up and letting it sit for a few days, but it never regained the consistency of other TOBS products purchased from other retailers. There was far less of the product in my jar than there should have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product does not have a pleasant lemon-lime scent, it smells like lemon detergent.</li>
            <li> ......great shaving soap........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.....great lather......... easly to use...great scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.......definitely a great shaving soap for the money.... you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product....</li>
            <li> I bought Old Bond from reviews and its reputation and I was not dissapointed, makes a very craemy lather with my tweeserman brush, I bought the Lemon/lime and the Coconut Creams and THREW the cans of shaving cream away. Would recommend/ GREAT SHAVE, Others have complained about the fragrance, the fragrance is for you to enjoy,then you put on your favorite after shave or cologne,to finish off you routine. I&#x27;m 62 and have use several Taylor product and the lemon lime is the one I like the best, and by the way I use a 1958 Gillette  fatboy double edge with feather blade(the best blade out there) and enjoy the taylor better than any of the other fragrances,and I will keep buying it! Sometimes you just can&#x27;t PLEASE people. Just my opinion!</li>
            <li> Writing this review only because I&#x27;ve used this before. My last shipment came in all dried up and hard :( Anyway, it is a great scent. Really smells like lemon and lime! Now, if your looking for &amp;#34;sparkly&amp;#34;, vibrant lemon lime you will be disappointed. The smell is very subdued its not bright and citrusy... It is however NICE. I like it and yes, its worth a try if your on the fence. My absolute favourite is Mr. Taylor&#x27;s Shaving Cream. The smell of that cream is orgasmic. Yes, its orgasmic. Classy, rich, just an absolute beaute of a scent. If your in the market and you are on the fence about which one...and you only intend on buying one tub, buy Mr. Taylor&#x27;s Shaving Cream. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The first giveaway that these were fakes was the label on the lid. Instead of being printed directly on the plastic, they were&lt;br /&gt; decals. The decals had air bubbles in them. A shabby job. The cream itself also didn&#x27;t have the same scent as the ones&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;d used before. There is no way that such a prestigious company as Taylor of Old Bond Street would put out such a shoddy&lt;br /&gt;product. I asked and got, through Amazon, a refund. They told me that because of the law a personal product cannot be&lt;br /&gt; returned and that I could dispose of it as I saw fit. I decided to throw them out. I washed out the containers and noticed also&lt;br /&gt;that there is no remnant of the scent in the containers.  I have an old container that I bought with the same shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;(Lemon-Lime shave cream) and it still has a faint scent of the lemon-lime, this after 18 years!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and provides a perfect lather.  Would highly recommend this companies entire product line.  Try the lavender scent, it&#x27;s simply amazing.</li>
            <li> As I have said elsewhere I have tried several brands. This was \\&quot;Okay\\&quot; but in terms of razor glide and smoothness I&#x27;ve narrowed it down to Truefitt&amp;Hill, The Art of Shaving and my personal favorite, \\&quot;Kiss My Face\\&quot; amazingly the cheapest. Taylors , to me, is waiting  right outside the top ring. Its pretty good but just seems to lack the \\&quot;glide\\&quot; and closeness of the others. I would have no problem using it if I couldn&#x27;t get to one of the top 3,&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;An appeal was filed and a head to head, so to speak, duel was established with T&amp;H over a 4 day period. The results were indisputable. Taylor actually came back to edge out T&amp;H for glide, closeness of shave and skin condition afterwards. Taylor, from this point hence, will be known as the \\&quot;come back kid\\&quot; of shaving cream. It still has the toughest competition ahead facing off, so to speak, against the royalty(most expensive) Art of Shaving, and the people&#x27;s favorite(least expensive) Kiss My Face. Stay tuned...</li>
            <li> Taylor&#x27;s Cream is great, Five stars all the way, the only shaving cream that I will use. I still use some shaving soaps from time to time but Taylor&#x27;s has been the best cream for myself. The star rating on this review isn&#x27;t against the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I recieved was, in my opinion, a used product, there was debris inside the lid, that did not appear to possibly have come from the ingredients of the product. Black specks seem out of place in this product and I haven&#x27;t ever noticed it before in any I recieved from other suppliers. Not sure what was going on with the item, but after reading other reviews that also appeared to show possible tampering, I placed this one in the trash. I had intended on saving $6 over my typical supplier but instead I just wasted $8, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I love Old Bond shaving creams.  What can I say, I wanted to try them all.  I shave about 1-2 times a week and each jar lasts me about 6 months, but I am pretty liberal with it.  I generally mix it in a coffee mug with a dab of water.  Use a brush to apply, shave, then enjoy the smell like you just left the barber shop!</li>
            <li> I love the taylor of old bond shaving cream. I am not a big fan of the Lime scent - I would rather have the lavender. Great product</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff.  Quickly creates a good base for shaving.  Lemon Lime smells pretty good.  Sure beats the stuff out of the can.</li>
            <li> Perfect scent. Drives the ladies wild!</li>
            <li> I have always preferred shaving creams in tubs to aerosol or gels. For a long time I used either Crabtree &amp; Evelyn or Art of Shaving shaving cream in a tub. This product is less expensive and is just as good.  I have ordered the Lemon/Lime, Almond, and Sandalwood. All are very good and just a little soap on a brush makes a lot of lather.  This is my product of choice for the future.</li>
            <li> This is another winner from Taylor of Old Bond Street.  I usually buy the almond or St. James TOBS shaving creams but I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. This lemon-lime cream itself is the same good quality as the others; it&#x27;s rich and thick and just a dab on the end of a wet brush is enough for two applications for a smooth and close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference here is in the scent. It&#x27;s a nice lemon-lime with no chemical smell as with some other shaving creams I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s refreshing and really feels good on the face. Like the other TOBS shaving creams, the scent is there during the shave but disappears after the final rinse. I&#x27;ll be using this regularly.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have said the smell was very unappealing, but I liked it. Its a nice light citrus soap smell. Lathers up great and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much.</li>
            <li> This is delightful to use. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but makes the shaving experience very nice. Comes in several different \\&quot;flavors.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought \\&quot;that won&#x27;t happen to me.\\&quot; Well, it did, when my cream arrived it was slopped to a side in a way that seemed unnatural, as if someone had scooped up a big chunk, I know because Ive received creams through UPS that had melted and they didn&#x27;t look like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, every time I receive a cream through USPS, it&#x27;s NEVER melted. I don&#x27;t know if it has to do with the \\&quot;UPS creams\\&quot; being in constant movement in a hot truck while the \\&quot;USPS creams\\&quot; stop so often at a warehouse or whatever but I have noticed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW this cream didnt have the consistency of having melted on the way. I know this because my previous (and only) TOBS cream had melted on the way to my house through UPS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really dont want to say the seller or somebody within the seller&#x27;s company is tampering with these creams but I manually settled the cream and compared it to my other TOBS cream and this one had about a quarter less cream than my other TOBS cream... That I have used several times!!! You figure with the $8 price that all this is a little suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give the seller the -a little- benefit of the doubt, my other TOBS cream is avocado and it has a different consistency (fluffier or yogurty like) than this lemon-lime cream (harder, kinda like cream cheese) does and maybe that&#x27;s the reason there&#x27;s less cream, however, that would also mean it&#x27;s less likely to melt as easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just threw it away and purchased one from another seller. I really feel bad about making these allegations but It&#x27;s just too much of a coincidence.</li>
            <li> We love Taylor of Old Bond!! While this isn&#x27;t my favorite fragrance, it&#x27;s still awesome stuff! My husband LOVES how great a shave he gets and I love &amp;#34;borrowing&amp;#34; it to shave my legs!</li>
            <li> I initially thought this will be a hard soap,&lt;br /&gt;it turned out to be a soft cream.&lt;br /&gt;I was not familiar with using creams,&lt;br /&gt;but they are fast to lather with little water.&lt;br /&gt;So no complains. It has a soft citric scent,&lt;br /&gt;which doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying this again, and again!&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet tried a taylor of bond street&lt;br /&gt;that I did not immediately loved.</li>
