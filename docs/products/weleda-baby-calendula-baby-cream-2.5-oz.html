            <li>has pleasant smell and will be rebuying this one to keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>I told my wife and she said that she knew the cream was good</li>
            <li>Their products is fairly good.</li>
            <li>it is good to put on sunburns or for softening your foot calluses.  </li>
            <li>I have heard nothing but good things about Calendula cream, and the Weleda brand was recommended.  </li>
            <li>Good for Eczema baby who has an oat allergy...</li>
            <li>Smells great, works great, didn&#x27;t irritate my sons eczema like many others did and feels better than aquaphor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best applied right after a bath.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>then try the Weleda baby care products and see how nice your skin looks.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it great on eczema, but it&#x27;s really awesome on cradle cap, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus I use it as a primer for when I put on my own make up.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as California Baby calendula.  </li>
            <li>It smells so nice too.</li>
            <li>Very nice texture and light smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job, has a nice light pleasant citrusy smell, and feels as though it is quality.</li>
            <li>I wanted something without any kind of scent (I do not buy scented products for her - soup, wipes, diapers) but again the scent is very mild</li>
            <li>and you want to use more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beautiful, safe ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is probably better for hands, feet, elbows, and knees.</li>
            <li>We received this as a gift, a lovely cream</li>
            <li>More like a diaper cream than a lotion.</li>
            <li>Just feel ok</li>
            <li>I love this baby cream -</li>
            <li>I wish I would have shopped around better</li>
            <li>Look for the most bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>love this product/</li>
            <li>my son has eczema and this works wonders for him, i no longer have to use hydrocortisone which dries out his skin even more.</li>
            <li>Love this brand and it helped with my son&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>A natural, easily absorbed, pleasantly scented cream that does a great job soothing and healing my eczema patches and eruptions.</li>
            <li>I have used many products for my beautiful baby and so far this product is working fine.</li>
            <li>It is working great for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It is more oily, but not as moisturizing and rich as Skin Food.</li>
            <li>It does have a fairly strong smell as well.</li>
            <li>I was happy that the initial spot-test on my baby&#x27;s eczema showed improvement.  </li>
            <li>Seemed to work okay, but the scent was too strong and the product is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>The perk, it works great on my dry hands (from washing all the time).  </li>
            <li>It smells good, is all natural, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>I love the light scent which is different than most mass-marketed baby smells</li>
            <li>so i cant give it full credit</li>
            <li>so we were surprised by how effective this was on our baby&#x27;s bum.</li>
            <li>, I believe the main ingredient is very important for healing and calming the skin, this ingredient is the Calendula which has calming and healing property to it,  </li>
            <li>cream has the thickest texture of the Weleda creams - the face cream is lighter - the baby balm is super for hiking ...</li>
            <li>She also mentioned that she used it on her belly when pregnant to avoid stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>We received the Weleda Baby Cream as a gift when our baby was born last year, and we are so glad we did!  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and light.  </li>
            <li>This is the only cream that I liked to use for my baby girl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural really is better.</li>
            <li>I had followed doctor recommendations without success.</li>
            <li>but its about 90% clear better than any lotion.</li>
            <li>I know this is a product for baby skin, but I use it myself and feel very safe using it on dry baby skin.</li>
            <li>My friend bought me a tube of this when I was pregnant with my first child.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is pretty mild.</li>
            <li>It softened the skin right up, allowing me to rub it away and also prevented the cradle cap from recurring in those areas.</li>
            <li>Our pediatrician recommended this cream and we&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s great for clearing up and preventing excessive dryness.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good thing that baby loves this on his bum and calms down immediately once applied.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it, and that it is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>However, for as soft and smooth as it makes skin, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Sure, it made her hair look super greasy, but that&#x27;s no worse than how gross cradle cap can get.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have written a review.</li>
            <li>After the first application of this calendula cream on our baby, which was in the evening, upon waking the next morning the roughness had improved a lot and the redness was gone from a lot of areas, except the most stubborn</li>
            <li>After applying the cream on our baby at night, her skin felt and looked so much better the next morning.  </li>
            <li>but she hadn&#x27;t realized it worked that fast!</li>
            <li>First one is shampoo.</li>
            <li>Kind of like a heat creams for adults like Icy Hot.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and we noticed excemza starting flare up more</li>
            <li>The weather in Singapore is really hot and humid</li>
            <li>THAT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>(imagine how much goes into a 2.5 oz baby bottle), but most importantly, while it worked as well as any other moisturizer, my baby is still scratching until he bleeds every chance</li>
            <li>Also good for small cuts and as a lotion.</li>
            <li>Calendula is a very effective and potent plant to heal any rashes and this cream is specifically designed for babies, to ease skin pain which results too often in scratching, making the rash only worse.</li>
            <li>this was my favorite in terms really making skin moist and lasted long on the skin.  </li>
            <li>the humidity level is very high over there.</li>
            <li>I would very highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>first tried it on my belly, which got huge, due to a very large baby.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Light scent, very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve covered the whole kid just once you have practically emptied the bottle.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li>/&gt;We really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the cream.  </li>
            <li>Its pricey, but it worked for the rash and a light sunburn my baby had later gotten.</li>
            <li>It is VERY creamy and does take some rubbing to apply</li>
            <li>but we put it on and night and find that it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>so I assume they don&#x27;t add that much</li>
            <li>It has a gentle smell as well.</li>
            <li>but it works - really well.</li>
            <li>This really worked well on our newborn baby.</li>
            <li>Thick, creamy, nourishing and works great on my toddlers sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised to see comments that others found the scent strong as it barely seems to have a scent at all.  </li>
            <li>So the next time the baby had the rash I was sure to tell her to notice if the rash was gone the following morning</li>
            <li>It was amazing how fast it worked, almost like a neosporin for babies, at least that&#x27;s how we used</li>
            <li>Nothing, and I mean nothing, works as fast and effectively as this does.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend Weleda Calendula Baby Cream.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It has really helped clear my acne.</li>
            <li>I wish I had thought to use it on the scalp sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this is one baby product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of our must haves, and we recommended it to all of our friends who have new babies.</li>
            <li>I started using this cream as an alternative to petroleum based creams for our new born.</li>
            <li>It does not spread easily so you must use a handful to cover ever half of a baby.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to all parents for babies sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used this when my baby was a newborn and had very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>We use it on our baby&#x27;s butt at first signs of a rash together with our regular baby rash cream.  </li>
            <li>A must have for all parents of young toddlers!</li>
            <li>This stuff is gentle enough that it&#x27;s the only thing I use on my daugther&#x27;s face right out of the bath.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve struggled to find a cream moisturizing enough for our baby who easily gets chapped skin and has very dry arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>This baby cream works fine after applying for a few days to my son&#x27;s chin.  </li>
            <li>So my son is 1yr now and eczema has been issue whole time and we tried every lotion out there with little success.  </li>
            <li>to the next miracle product promising to cure his eczema...</li>
            <li>This might be a pro for babies and diaper rush, but if you are considering this cream for an adult, I would stick with skin food.</li>
            <li>Our baby had a stubborn rash that kept appearing near her mouth.  </li>
            <li>Said it was all 100% natural .</li>
            <li>I like that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Makes skin soft.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s still silky soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>I like that this product has gentle ingredients and works well at the same time.</li>
            <li>but it went away and her skin is soft again.  </li>
            <li>and it is natural oils anyway</li>
            <li>Was delightfully surprised.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and does have a strong smell at first</li>
            <li>This cream is pretty much gone from your skin in a  few minute</li>
            <li>Got a sample of this when I was pregnant in my little gift bag from babiesrus.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for the rash but for dry skin it works wonders.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is so thick, which is great for dry skin, however, since it is so thick, you really have to rub it in well</li>
            <li>my daughter was born, I used it on her mild baby eczema, and within a few days, it was gone.</li>
            <li>If only the bottle were a little bigger, but it really is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>We got this cream as a gift from our three-month old&#x27;s aunt because we mentioned the baby had patches that were very red and dry/rough.  </li>
            <li>This baby cream has worked wonders on my daughter&#x27;s extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This cream works very well and delicately, with a slightly botanical pleasant scent (not overwhelming).</li>
            <li>I rubbed it on my newborn&#x27;s flaky skin and had to rub it in so much that it ended up rubbing a lot of her flakes off, but it seemed to have made a lot of other flakes appear, almost like it would with an exfoliant.</li>
            <li>cream is less of a good deal as the other items in the same line as you&#x27;ll see that 2.5oz is very little</li>
            <li>use it sparingly, and we just dab a little on each time, so a year and a half later, we still have most of the tube left.  </li>
            <li>those tiny red bumps were smoothing out and now her skins are almost normal just like any other 2 year old girl.</li>
            <li>Now when I see a slight redness or irritation at its beginning stages, I immediately apply the cream and get very satisfactory results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my one month old&#x27;s diaper rash and her dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is a little bit shiny, but I put on powder make-up, so you can&#x27;t tell much.</li>

            <li> I know this is a product for baby skin, but I use it myself and feel very safe using it on dry baby skin.</li>
            <li> My friend bought me a tube of this when I was pregnant with my first child.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is pretty mild.</li>
            <li> It softened the skin right up, allowing me to rub it away and also prevented the cradle cap from recurring in those areas.</li>
            <li> Our pediatrician recommended this cream and we&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s great for clearing up and preventing excessive dryness.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a good thing that baby loves this on his bum and calms down immediately once applied.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it, and that it is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> However, for as soft and smooth as it makes skin, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Sure, it made her hair look super greasy, but that&#x27;s no worse than how gross cradle cap can get.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have written a review.</li>
            <li> After the first application of this calendula cream on our baby, which was in the evening, upon waking the next morning the roughness had improved a lot and the redness was gone from a lot of areas, except the most stubborn</li>
            <li> After applying the cream on our baby at night, her skin felt and looked so much better the next morning.  </li>
            <li> but she hadn&#x27;t realized it worked that fast!</li>
            <li> First one is shampoo.</li>
            <li> Kind of like a heat creams for adults like Icy Hot.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and we noticed excemza starting flare up more</li>
            <li> The weather in Singapore is really hot and humid</li>
            <li> THAT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> (imagine how much goes into a 2.5 oz baby bottle), but most importantly, while it worked as well as any other moisturizer, my baby is still scratching until he bleeds every chance</li>
            <li> Also good for small cuts and as a lotion.</li>
            <li> Calendula is a very effective and potent plant to heal any rashes and this cream is specifically designed for babies, to ease skin pain which results too often in scratching, making the rash only worse.</li>
            <li> this was my favorite in terms really making skin moist and lasted long on the skin.  </li>
            <li> the humidity level is very high over there.</li>
            <li> I would very highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> first tried it on my belly, which got huge, due to a very large baby.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Light scent, very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve covered the whole kid just once you have practically emptied the bottle.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> /&gt;We really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the cream.  </li>
            <li> Its pricey, but it worked for the rash and a light sunburn my baby had later gotten.</li>
            <li> It is VERY creamy and does take some rubbing to apply</li>
            <li> but we put it on and night and find that it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> so I assume they don&#x27;t add that much</li>
            <li> It has a gentle smell as well.</li>
            <li> but it works - really well.</li>
            <li> This really worked well on our newborn baby.</li>
            <li> Thick, creamy, nourishing and works great on my toddlers sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see comments that others found the scent strong as it barely seems to have a scent at all.  </li>
            <li> So the next time the baby had the rash I was sure to tell her to notice if the rash was gone the following morning</li>
            <li> It was amazing how fast it worked, almost like a neosporin for babies, at least that&#x27;s how we used</li>
            <li> Nothing, and I mean nothing, works as fast and effectively as this does.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend Weleda Calendula Baby Cream.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It has really helped clear my acne.</li>
            <li> I wish I had thought to use it on the scalp sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this is one baby product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of our must haves, and we recommended it to all of our friends who have new babies.</li>
            <li> I started using this cream as an alternative to petroleum based creams for our new born.</li>
            <li> It does not spread easily so you must use a handful to cover ever half of a baby.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to all parents for babies sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used this when my baby was a newborn and had very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> We use it on our baby&#x27;s butt at first signs of a rash together with our regular baby rash cream.  </li>
            <li> A must have for all parents of young toddlers!</li>
            <li> This stuff is gentle enough that it&#x27;s the only thing I use on my daugther&#x27;s face right out of the bath.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve struggled to find a cream moisturizing enough for our baby who easily gets chapped skin and has very dry arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> This baby cream works fine after applying for a few days to my son&#x27;s chin.  </li>
            <li> So my son is 1yr now and eczema has been issue whole time and we tried every lotion out there with little success.  </li>
            <li> to the next miracle product promising to cure his eczema...</li>
            <li> This might be a pro for babies and diaper rush, but if you are considering this cream for an adult, I would stick with skin food.</li>
            <li> Our baby had a stubborn rash that kept appearing near her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Said it was all 100% natural .</li>
            <li> I like that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Makes skin soft.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s still silky soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I like that this product has gentle ingredients and works well at the same time.</li>
            <li> but it went away and her skin is soft again.  </li>
            <li> and it is natural oils anyway</li>
            <li> Was delightfully surprised.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and does have a strong smell at first</li>
            <li> This cream is pretty much gone from your skin in a  few minute</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this when I was pregnant in my little gift bag from babiesrus.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for the rash but for dry skin it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is so thick, which is great for dry skin, however, since it is so thick, you really have to rub it in well</li>
            <li> my daughter was born, I used it on her mild baby eczema, and within a few days, it was gone.</li>
            <li> If only the bottle were a little bigger, but it really is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> We got this cream as a gift from our three-month old&#x27;s aunt because we mentioned the baby had patches that were very red and dry/rough.  </li>
            <li> This baby cream has worked wonders on my daughter&#x27;s extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This cream works very well and delicately, with a slightly botanical pleasant scent (not overwhelming).</li>
            <li> I rubbed it on my newborn&#x27;s flaky skin and had to rub it in so much that it ended up rubbing a lot of her flakes off, but it seemed to have made a lot of other flakes appear, almost like it would with an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> cream is less of a good deal as the other items in the same line as you&#x27;ll see that 2.5oz is very little</li>
            <li> use it sparingly, and we just dab a little on each time, so a year and a half later, we still have most of the tube left.  </li>
            <li> those tiny red bumps were smoothing out and now her skins are almost normal just like any other 2 year old girl.</li>
            <li> Now when I see a slight redness or irritation at its beginning stages, I immediately apply the cream and get very satisfactory results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my one month old&#x27;s diaper rash and her dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit shiny, but I put on powder make-up, so you can&#x27;t tell much.</li>
            <li> I developed it in the USA at 30 years old (not sure why).</li>
            <li> It took a little over a week, but the cradle cap completely disappeared!</li>
            <li> For maintenance, I applied a tiny amount daily for a few months afterward (not enough for the greasy hair look), and it never came back.</li>
            <li> 2.5 oz lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Anyway, you may want to try this cream and a humidifier, also keep her in long pants and long sleeve shirts (100% cotton) to avoid scratching (it also protects skin moister from wind).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a strange rash from pregnancy around my nostrils and chin.</li>
            <li> I knew about the Calendula, long time ago.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I applied the cream to an irritated area on his neck, he broke out in a full rash on his neck, back of his head, and forehead.  </li>
            <li> used it on rashes and on small cuts and scrapes, and it does wonders in helping them heal faster when other products didn&#x27;t help as much.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of their other products like the diaper rash cream, the calendula oil, the body wash and the face cream.</li>
            <li> The other only thing I did was to buy a humidifier which I guess is not recommended for people with psoriasis</li>
            <li> This cream prevents the dry scaly skin they had been experiencing.</li>
            <li> I even use it for diaper redness and soothing the hairline and inside the ears if they are dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We also use the cream when there are rough patches in her skin, and it moisturizes the skin and the rough patches seem to go away by the next</li>
            <li> It might just be luck or genetics, but I did not get a single stretch mark.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> We have tried every possible cream or lotion with no success: Aveeno, Aquafor, Eucerin, Cetaphil, Curel...etc.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hands or anywhere the skin is very dry and irritated, or bumpy.  </li>
            <li> But this body cream comes in a very small bottle and does not go very far when you put it on.</li>
            <li> Use this cream or the diaper one everyday on the folds of my baby&#x27;s skin especially the chins to prevent rashes.</li>
            <li> It takes about 3 days before I notice any change but all bumps and rough skin is gone by the 5th day.</li>
            <li> My toddler had a pretty bad psoriasis rash that I could not get rid with creams, lotions, natural oils (organic coconut and almond)...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> and I had tried other moisturizers (aveeno eczema, J&amp;J, aquaphor etc) with no visible improvement.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have mentioned, our baby has eczema as well.</li>
            <li> In 21 years, through 6 kids, I&#x27;ve never used any other diaper cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a magical cream, so don&#x27;t expect the rash will go away in the next day after once usage.</li>
            <li> My other favorites are penaten and bag balm.</li>
            <li> Have given it as a gift to other mothers-to-be!</li>
            <li> My toddler children have dry skin due to hard city water.</li>
            <li> She swore that was a cure-all for typical skin irritations that affect babies.</li>
            <li> He is 3 and a half now....</li>
            <li> my youngest daughter has slight atopy irritation on her body.</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad case of dry hands with some rush.</li>
            <li> I use this creme since my little boy was born.</li>
            <li> The textur is a little sticky, but it works well.</li>
            <li> and I found that though expensive, a single tube lasted me for almost 3 months, with two of those being with almost daily use.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is very thick, so it takes a bit extra to get it spread evenly (</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not too harsh and it does the work.</li>
            <li> The tube is heavy duty quality, made out of aluminum?</li>
            <li> I tried everything and this cleared it up completely in a few days.</li>
            <li> we gave it a try of course and after few weeks, we saw the difference.</li>
            <li> Desperate for an eczema cure for my frantically scratching baby, I ordered the Calendula cream with high hopes.  </li>
            <li> The part I was not happy about was how fast it goes and how expensive it was.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also extremely thick and a little greasy.</li>
            <li> In the past I used Burt&#x27;s Bees but now they do not hold up to my standards.</li>
            <li> However one small disadvantage that it has no smell.</li>
            <li> My children were unfortunate enough to inherit my eczema.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was coincidence</li>
            <li> Looked it up for the bad stuff it had a high rating.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> still has a little behind knees</li>
            <li> This has worked well on delicate skin</li>
            <li> but you should know that it is thick and does not absorb well.</li>
            <li> I am 100% serious when I say that just one application stopped the redness and dryness.  </li>
            <li> I used this to soften the hard scales that accumulated on eyebrows and behind my baby&#x27;s ears when she had cradle cap.</li>
            <li> Sorry didn&#x27;t care for this one .</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong item but using it for body lotion.</li>
            <li> but I was desperate.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s usually the worst spot for it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a bit of a mediciney smell when you apply it, but it isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> son was sick and had to go on antiobiotics</li>
            <li> I needed the diaper cream. :(</li>
            <li> We use this for baby diaper cream, eczema cream, and as an all day mosquito repellant (it contains marigolds which mosquitos hate).  </li>
            <li> She had her worst case of psoriasis before we went to Cartagena for Christmas (and I should say that our humidifier broke by then) and I noticed that as soon as I got there</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A natural, easily absorbed, pleasantly scented cream that does a great job soothing and healing my eczema patches and eruptions.</li>
            <li> Desperate for an eczema cure for my frantically scratching baby, I ordered the Calendula cream with high hopes.  We already have the bath/shower wash and diaper cream which we like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is less of a good deal as the other items in the same line as you&#x27;ll see that 2.5oz is very little (imagine how much goes into a 2.5 oz baby bottle), but most importantly, while it worked as well as any other moisturizer, my baby is still scratching until he bleeds every chance he gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the next miracle product promising to cure his eczema...</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have written a review. My toddler children have dry skin due to hard city water. This cream prevents the dry scaly skin they had been experiencing. This has worked well on delicate skin and I highly recommend Weleda Calendula Baby Cream.</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad case of dry hands with some rush. I&#x27;ve been using Weleda Skin food, but decided to try this baby cream. It is more oily, but not as moisturizing and rich as Skin Food. This cream is pretty much gone from your skin in a  few minute and you want to use more. This might be a pro for babies and diaper rush, but if you are considering this cream for an adult, I would stick with skin food.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my face for over a decade and people say I look 10 years younger than I am, all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, safe ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light scent, very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has the thickest texture of the Weleda creams - the face cream is lighter - the baby balm is super for hiking ... I have not had any problems breaking out &amp; I use it 2ce daily.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so thick, which is great for dry skin, however, since it is so thick, you really have to rub it in well or else it leaves a white film.  I rubbed it on my newborn&#x27;s flaky skin and had to rub it in so much that it ended up rubbing a lot of her flakes off, but it seemed to have made a lot of other flakes appear, almost like it would with an exfoliant. this is probably better for hands, feet, elbows, and knees.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that I liked to use for my baby girl.&lt;br /&gt;It is not too harsh and it does the work. Very nice texture and light smell.</li>
            <li> We got this cream as a gift from our three-month old&#x27;s aunt because we mentioned the baby had patches that were very red and dry/rough.  She seemed to have them in creases or spots where heat/sweat accumulated and I had tried other moisturizers (aveeno eczema, J&amp;J, aquaphor etc) with no visible improvement.  After the first application of this calendula cream on our baby, which was in the evening, upon waking the next morning the roughness had improved a lot and the redness was gone from a lot of areas, except the most stubborn (under the neck never seems to get enough)!  I even use it for diaper redness and soothing the hairline and inside the ears if they are dry. Now when I see a slight redness or irritation at its beginning stages, I immediately apply the cream and get very satisfactory results.  This cream works very well and delicately, with a slightly botanical pleasant scent (not overwhelming). Have given it as a gift to other mothers-to-be!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of their other products like the diaper rash cream, the calendula oil, the body wash and the face cream. But this body cream comes in a very small bottle and does not go very far when you put it on. It does not spread easily so you must use a handful to cover ever half of a baby. Once you&#x27;ve covered the whole kid just once you have practically emptied the bottle.</li>
            <li> We received this as a gift, a lovely cream but you should know that it is thick and does not absorb well. More like a diaper cream than a lotion. It does have a fairly strong smell as well.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it, and that it is nice and thick. It is working great for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great baby cream. In the past I used Burt&#x27;s Bees but now they do not hold up to my standards. So I tried this. It works really well. It does dissolve into the skin it does not produce a protective barrier.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cream! Like other reviewers have mentioned, our baby has eczema as well. In doing my research, I read that creams and ointments work best, not lotions. After applying the cream on our baby at night, her skin felt and looked so much better the next morning.  I purchased this at a health food store, but will definitely order on amazon. If only the bottle were a little bigger, but it really is a fantastic product. Natural really is better.</li>
            <li> My friend bought me a tube of this when I was pregnant with my first child. She swore that was a cure-all for typical skin irritations that affect babies. She also mentioned that she used it on her belly when pregnant to avoid stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I first tried it on my belly, which got huge, due to a very large baby. It might just be luck or genetics, but I did not get a single stretch mark.&lt;br /&gt;Once my daughter was born, I used it on her mild baby eczema, and within a few days, it was gone. The best though, was when I started rubbing it into her scalp daily when she had a terrible case of cradle cap. Sure, it made her hair look super greasy, but that&#x27;s no worse than how gross cradle cap can get. It took a little over a week, but the cradle cap completely disappeared! For maintenance, I applied a tiny amount daily for a few months afterward (not enough for the greasy hair look), and it never came back. I wish I had thought to use it on the scalp sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this is one baby product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I call this the miracle cream! We use it on our baby&#x27;s butt at first signs of a rash together with our regular baby rash cream.  I call it the miracle cream because I noticed that whenever we use it at night the next morning the rash would disappear. I told my wife and she said that she knew the cream was good but she hadn&#x27;t realized it worked that fast! So the next time the baby had the rash I was sure to tell her to notice if the rash was gone the following morning and it was! It works every time!</li>
            <li> This is the second Wedler production I bought. First one is shampoo. Their products is fairly good. I do not have a lot of experience with it. Just feel ok</li>
            <li> We received the Weleda Baby Cream as a gift when our baby was born last year, and we are so glad we did!  It&#x27;s not something we would have bought on our own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve used it on rashes and on small cuts and scrapes, and it does wonders in helping them heal faster when other products didn&#x27;t help as much.  It was amazing how fast it worked, almost like a neosporin for babies, at least that&#x27;s how we used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use it sparingly, and we just dab a little on each time, so a year and a half later, we still have most of the tube left.  Our baby had a stubborn rash that kept appearing near her mouth.  The Weleda cream helped to keep it under control and eventually got it to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a bit of a mediciney smell when you apply it, but it isn&#x27;t bad.  Kind of like a heat creams for adults like Icy Hot.  It clears the nose a bit when you smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also use the cream when there are rough patches in her skin, and it moisturizes the skin and the rough patches seem to go away by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really couldn&#x27;t be happier with the cream.  It&#x27;s one of our must haves, and we recommended it to all of our friends who have new babies.</li>
            <li> If you like Suki or Arbonne products but can&#x27;t afford them (that&#x27;s me!) then try the Weleda baby care products and see how nice your skin looks.  I love this baby cream - it is good to put on sunburns or for softening your foot calluses.  It smells good, is all natural, and the price is right.  What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li> Sorry didn&#x27;t care for this one . Said it was all 100% natural . Looked it up for the bad stuff it had a high rating.&lt;br /&gt;This has a return item.</li>
            <li> I use this for my face twice a day (morning &amp; night). It has really helped clear my acne. It is a little bit shiny, but I put on powder make-up, so you can&#x27;t tell much. After my powder, my face just looks dewy. I believe it reduces redness as well. 2.5 oz lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I used this to soften the hard scales that accumulated on eyebrows and behind my baby&#x27;s ears when she had cradle cap. It softened the skin right up, allowing me to rub it away and also prevented the cradle cap from recurring in those areas.</li>
            <li> This stuff is gentle enough that it&#x27;s the only thing I use on my daugther&#x27;s face right out of the bath.  I love the light scent which is different than most mass-marketed baby smells and I found that though expensive, a single tube lasted me for almost 3 months, with two of those being with almost daily use.  A little goes a long way and I feel like it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for a rash my baby had. It helped immediately. I was extremely happy. The part I was not happy about was how fast it goes and how expensive it was. I wish I would have shopped around better but I was desperate. The lotion is very thick, so it takes a bit extra to get it spread evenly (or so it seems to me). The tube is heavy duty quality, made out of aluminum? Overall, it did it&#x27;s job, has a nice light pleasant citrusy smell, and feels as though it is quality. Its pricey, but it worked for the rash and a light sunburn my baby had later gotten. I would definetly recommend, but would advise comparison shopping and getting a larger size if possible. Look for the most bang for your buck. Otherwise- excellent quality product!</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great, didn&#x27;t irritate my sons eczema like many others did and feels better than aquaphor</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve struggled to find a cream moisturizing enough for our baby who easily gets chapped skin and has very dry arms and legs.  Our pediatrician recommended this cream and we&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s great for clearing up and preventing excessive dryness.  I&#x27;m surprised to see comments that others found the scent strong as it barely seems to have a scent at all.  It is VERY creamy and does take some rubbing to apply but we put it on and night and find that it absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> I like that it has all natural ingredients. Makes skin soft. However one small disadvantage that it has no smell.</li>
            <li> My children were unfortunate enough to inherit my eczema. We have tried every possible cream or lotion with no success: Aveeno, Aquafor, Eucerin, Cetaphil, Curel...etc. Nothing, and I mean nothing, works as fast and effectively as this does. I am 100% serious when I say that just one application stopped the redness and dryness.  I put it on my baby at night and he&#x27;s still silky soft in the morning. Not only is it great on eczema, but it&#x27;s really awesome on cradle cap, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a fragrance but there is definitely a smell...hard to describe. However, for as soft and smooth as it makes skin, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; Smells wonderful too</li>
            <li> In 21 years, through 6 kids, I&#x27;ve never used any other diaper cream. This stuff is the best ever.</li>
            <li> This baby cream works fine after applying for a few days to my son&#x27;s chin.  It&#x27;s not a magical cream, so don&#x27;t expect the rash will go away in the next day after once usage.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 2 years for myself and now my baby.  I used this from the day she was born.  It is great for the skin and for rashes.</li>
            <li> Use this cream or the diaper one everyday on the folds of my baby&#x27;s skin especially the chins to prevent rashes. Works great in summer. Also good for small cuts and as a lotion.</li>
            <li> Thick, creamy, nourishing and works great on my toddlers sensitive skin.  Love it!  The perk, it works great on my dry hands (from washing all the time).  My skin immediately feels nourished.</li>
            <li> I like that this product has gentle ingredients and works well at the same time. It does help us with the diaper rash and even seems to help with eczema on baby&#x27;s arms and legs.</li>
            <li> love this product/ I think it is one of the best to use. I use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;worth every dollar</li>
            <li> Smells great and kept baby&#x27;s eczema moisturized but did not improve it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work on my baby&#x27;s eczema, and Ped suggested don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> My toddler had a pretty bad psoriasis rash that I could not get rid with creams, lotions, natural oils (organic coconut and almond)... nothing. I had followed doctor recommendations without success. I decided to try this and in 2 days it was gone. I am not sure if it was coincidence but it went away and her skin is soft again.  The other only thing I did was to buy a humidifier which I guess is not recommended for people with psoriasis but I am from Cartagena-Colombia and the humidity level is very high over there. She had her worst case of psoriasis before we went to Cartagena for Christmas (and I should say that our humidifier broke by then) and I noticed that as soon as I got there her skin was like baby skin... as perfect as it has never been. We were there for 1 month and neither her or I got any problems. I did not know what was psoriasis while living in Colombia. I developed it in the USA at 30 years old (not sure why). Anyway, you may want to try this cream and a humidifier, also keep her in long pants and long sleeve shirts (100% cotton) to avoid scratching (it also protects skin moister from wind).&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pretty mild. I wanted something without any kind of scent (I do not buy scented products for her - soup, wipes, diapers) but again the scent is very mild so I assume they don&#x27;t add that much and it is natural oils anyway which is great.</li>
            <li> Calendula is a very effective and potent plant to heal any rashes and this cream is specifically designed for babies, to ease skin pain which results too often in scratching, making the rash only worse. A must have for all parents of young toddlers! and it smells great! ;)</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this when I was pregnant in my little gift bag from babiesrus. Finally thought to try it. Was delightfully surprised. My other favorites are penaten and bag balm. I like to switch things up every now and then, so I keep a variety... but like I said.. this is my new favorite. ;c)</li>
            <li> bought it to help with baby eczema.  while it wasn&#x27;t only lotion i used so i cant give it full credit this was my favorite in terms really making skin moist and lasted long on the skin.  has pleasant smell and will be rebuying this one to keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  So my son is 1yr now and eczema has been issue whole time and we tried every lotion out there with little success.  BUT we just found the solution.  Probiotics!  son was sick and had to go on antiobiotics so i went to purchase some probiotics to help with stomach and while researching i saw reviews people claiming help with eczema it wasn&#x27;t why i was looking for but i just remembered that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways winter is here and we noticed excemza starting flare up more but we started probotics and in a week i couldn&#x27;t believe how he cleared up.  still has a little behind knees that&#x27;s usually the worst spot for it.  but its about 90% clear better than any lotion.</li>
            <li> I have heard nothing but good things about Calendula cream, and the Weleda brand was recommended.  I was happy that the initial spot-test on my baby&#x27;s eczema showed improvement.  Unfortunately, when I applied the cream to an irritated area on his neck, he broke out in a full rash on his neck, back of his head, and forehead.  I won&#x27;t be using this on anything but his eczema from now on.</li>
            <li> I had a strange rash from pregnancy around my nostrils and chin. I tried everything and this cleared it up completely in a few days. I will&lt;br /&gt;Definitely keep this in the house!</li>
            <li> my son has eczema and this works wonders for him, i no longer have to use hydrocortisone which dries out his skin even more.</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong item but using it for body lotion. Thought it was for face! It is baby cream. All Weleda products I have ever used are terrific.</li>
            <li> Packaging looks similar but This is moisurizer, not diaper cream.  I needed the diaper cream. :(</li>
            <li> Love this brand and it helped with my son&#x27;s eczema. Plus I use it as a primer for when I put on my own make up.</li>
            <li> Bought this to help with baby&#x27;s eczema.  Seemed to work okay, but the scent was too strong and the product is very greasy.  I&#x27;ve since stopped using it.</li>
            <li> This cream is great!  It is gentle and light.  I&#x27;ve used it on my one month old&#x27;s diaper rash and her dry skin.  It didn&#x27;t do much for the rash but for dry skin it works wonders.  It has a gentle smell as well.</li>
            <li> I use this creme since my little boy was born. He is 3 and a half now....we still use it. Buy it over and over again. I think it says everything.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Good for Eczema baby who has an oat allergy...</li>
            <li> Best product for baby!!!!!</li>
            <li> the best diaper cream ever</li>
            <li> I started using this cream as an alternative to petroleum based creams for our new born. It is very thick and does have a strong smell at first but it works - really well. It takes about 3 days before I notice any change but all bumps and rough skin is gone by the 5th day. It&#x27;s best applied right after a bath. Petroleum based products work quicker but I don&#x27;t have to worry about potential carcinogens with calendula.</li>
            <li> We use this for baby diaper cream, eczema cream, and as an all day mosquito repellant (it contains marigolds which mosquitos hate).  It&#x27;s like my go-to cream for anything my kids need.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as California Baby calendula.  It&#x27;s also extremely thick and a little greasy.</li>
            <li> This baby cream has worked wonders on my daughter&#x27;s extra sensitive skin. Highly recommend it to all parents for babies sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used this when my baby was a newborn and had very sensitive skin.  The textur is a little sticky, but it works well.</li>
            <li> I have used many products for my beautiful baby and so far this product is working fine. It smells so nice too. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Amazing for healing skin cracks!</li>
            <li> This really worked well on our newborn baby. The weather in Singapore is really hot and humid so we were surprised by how effective this was on our baby&#x27;s bum. It&#x27;s also a good thing that baby loves this on his bum and calms down immediately once applied.</li>
            <li> my youngest daughter has slight atopy irritation on her body. we tried everything to find the cure. bought creams after creams and changed her meals,...etc. one day my wife went thru some blogs and learned about Weleda products. we gave it a try of course and after few weeks, we saw the difference. those tiny red bumps were smoothing out and now her skins are almost normal just like any other 2 year old girl. THANK YOU WELEDA FOR PRODUCTS THAT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hands or anywhere the skin is very dry and irritated, or bumpy.  Even helped my hand from sensitivity, irritation and stopped the itch.  Don&#x27;t know why or how,, but was the best result, I believe the main ingredient is very important for healing and calming the skin, this ingredient is the Calendula which has calming and healing property to it,  I knew about the Calendula, long time ago. as an Esthetician, i knew that the Calendula plant contributes to healing. I know this is a product for baby skin, but I use it myself and feel very safe using it on dry baby skin. I would very highly recommend this product.</li>
