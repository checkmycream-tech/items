            <li>This is a great lotion for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a really great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>As Larry David would put it, this product is prettay prettay good.</li>
            <li>Good for the summer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lotion, and good lotion at that.</li>
            <li>It was an incredibly good deal.</li>
            <li>It is watery and smells good</li>
            <li>Good product.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>They are both good products.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion for almost a year now, and I have to say that it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I really liked the smell when I got it</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and it moisturizes without being too oily or watery.</li>
            <li>I love putting it on before I got to bed because the smell is so good.</li>
            <li>In mint condition, and smells nice too.</li>
            <li>It is a strong cucumber smell that I didn&#x27;t find to be pleasant</li>
            <li>This is a good lotion for a great price that you can use for your whole body.  </li>
            <li>The company makes nice products that are super affordable, so it&#x27;s not a surprise that I&#x27;m a fan of this lotion, which is light-weight and pleasantly fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve had better brands.</li>
            <li>I love Suave.  </li>
            <li>Which means that although I love the smell I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the heart of winter when my skin REALLY needs more moisture and protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a great summertime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Just pay the money for a better quality lotion.</li>
            <li>keep this one in my locker at work even though its not my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>and i love the pump.</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s better for</li>
            <li>Lotion is ok...</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for dry skin and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent as well.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product without any scent that I was able to smell.  </li>
            <li>ON DRY SKIN WORKS PERFECTLY:</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a very good lotion.</li>
            <li>pump top is handy, though anything more than a light tap shoots the stuff straight out with some force.  </li>
            <li>Also, the aloe smell isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>Smells kind of girly but applies easily &amp; seems to work fast.</li>
            <li>i looked for cheap lotions online</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lotion for the entire family and this one is just great.</li>
            <li>and so this feels great because of the extra aloe in it.</li>
            <li>it does the job, was cheap</li>
            <li>I love so much, the fragance and how smell my skin and so refreshing and smooh my skin.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a good, soothing lotion for after the shower or general moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I would describe it as fresh and lightly botanical.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good deal that I couldn&#x27;t pass it up and purchased two bottles.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suave Aloe lotion isn&#x27;t greasy and it vanishes quickly.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly and does not leave the feeling that something has been put on your skin.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work amazing when it comes to just moisturizing my skin, but it works even better than regular bottles of Aloe Vera when it comes to healing my sunburns quickly!</li>
            <li>it does exactly what lotion should do as it should do anyways</li>
            <li>first time I bought it..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good, I like the smell, smells better than the aloe lotion i used a few years back</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a ltion expert, I think this is the first bottle I&#x27;ve bought in my 40 years.</li>
            <li>U get what u pay for a just a tiny bit more.</li>
            <li>This is inexpensive and very watery.</li>
            <li>When I bought this lotion from amazon it was only $3 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been continuing to use this over expensive alternatives for about a year now and have been perfectly happy.</li>
            <li>No complaint here.</li>
            <li>My sister is schizophrenic and very sensitive to odors in products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the thick lotion you are going to get with more expensive brands, but it is great for the price.  </li>
            <li>It might be strange but the smell makes me smile every time I use</li>
            <li>I currently use Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and Vaseline Aloe Fresh Hydrating Body Lotion with Aloe and Cucumber.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong, so it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>

            <li> Inexpensive Body lotion with Aloe.  It soothes your skin and replenishes just enough moisture.  As Larry David would put it, this product is prettay prettay good.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT FORM Y DRY SKIN ALSO THE ALOE AROMA IS GREAT,UNISEX AS WELL,ALOW IS BEST THING FOR LOTS OF SKIN PROBLEMS</li>
            <li> Ok moisturizer, but I&#x27;ve had better brands.</li>

It might be strange but the smell makes me smile every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suave Aloe lotion isn&#x27;t greasy and it vanishes quickly.  As a lotion it&#x27;s one of Suave&#x27;s lighter ones.  Which means that although I love the smell I wouldn&#x27;t use it during the heart of winter when my skin REALLY needs more moisture and protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a great summertime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I found the best price on Amazon. I really liked the smell when I got it and it works really great. I&#x27;ve been continuing to use this over expensive alternatives for about a year now and have been perfectly happy.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t relay information as to the effectiveness of this body lotion, because I was never able to use it.  I couldn&#x27;t get beyond the smell of the lotion.  It is a strong cucumber smell that I didn&#x27;t find to be pleasant - others might find it acceptable as we all have personal preferences.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lotion for the entire family and this one is just great. It is non -greasy,absorbs quickly and not too thick or thin. Good for the summer</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t jump to get 18oz of lotion at this price? It does the &amp;#34;job&amp;#34; just fine. Not overly oily nor is the aloe smell pungent. It&#x27;s lotion, and good lotion at that.</li>
            <li> Suave is not known for being a leader in shampoo, conditioner or lotion. They are known for being inexpensive. This is inexpensive and very watery. Just pay the money for a better quality lotion.</li>
            <li> I love so much, the fragance and how smell my skin and so refreshing and smooh my skin. Is a great lotion.</li>
            <li> My sister is schizophrenic and very sensitive to odors in products. This is the only lotion that will do for her.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of girly but applies easily &amp; seems to work fast. I&#x27;m not a ltion expert, I think this is the first bottle I&#x27;ve bought in my 40 years.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Suave for some time now, and I have to say it&#x27;s a great lotion. It smells nice, and it moisturizes without being too oily or watery. Great product!</li>
            <li> This lotion feels great on my body. You cannot beat the price. I have dry skin and so this feels great because of the extra aloe in it. If you have dry skin I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion for a great price that you can use for your whole body.  Nice clean scent as well.</li>
            <li> When I bought this lotion from amazon it was only $3 with free shipping. It was an incredibly good deal. This lotion is great for dry skin and it has a pleasant smell. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong, so it&#x27;s not overwhelming. Overall, this is a very good lotion.</li>
            <li> keep this one in my locker at work even though its not my favorite scent. it does the job, was cheap and i love the pump.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands often and need to apply lotion after. I currently use Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and Vaseline Aloe Fresh Hydrating Body Lotion with Aloe and Cucumber. The Vaseline one is the one I use for my hands because it&#x27;s not as thick as the Aveeno so when that ran out I purchased this as a replacement. This lotion only cost me less than $3 on amazon. It&#x27;s such a good deal that I couldn&#x27;t pass it up and purchased two bottles. I like that it isn&#x27;t sticky or feels thick after application. The scent is stronger than what I&#x27;m use to, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as I got use to it.</li>
            <li> It is watery and smells good&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s too watery so I guess it&#x27;s better for summer&lt;br /&gt;Also, it absorb fast,but leaves a sticky feeling</li>
            <li> Aloe with Cucumber Body Lotion for Unisex By Suave, 18 Ounce / GREAT PRODUCT / GREAT PRICE / SMELLS WONDERFUL AND I GREAT ON DRY SKIN WORKS PERFECTLY:</li>
            <li> Lotion is ok... U get what u pay for a just a tiny bit more.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for the price.  It&#x27;s not too watery and not too oily, and the smell is wonderful.  I love putting it on before I got to bed because the smell is so good.</li>
            <li> Great price for the perfect working lotion.Gives my body the perfect moisture and smells great. I use it all over and everyday.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product without any scent that I was able to smell.  Dries quickly and does not leave the feeling that something has been put on your skin.</li>
            <li> Good product.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a month now. Came as stated. In mint condition, and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> This is a really great moisturizer.  I like the Aloe/Cucumber and I like the Aloe.  They are both good products.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good, soothing lotion for after the shower or general moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump top is handy, though anything more than a light tap shoots the stuff straight out with some force.  Be careful using it, especially on the go.  Numerous times I&#x27;ve gone to get a squirt on my way out the door and had the thing spray across a wall or onto the floor.</li>
