            <li>Just sexy nice.  </li>

            <li>Stayed with original vendor and got a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>Still a great perfume at a decent price.</li>
            <li>This is a nice woodsy sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>GREAT value for the price...Love the fragrace so girly and soft!  </li>
            <li>Not a heavy scent so great for anyone.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume, but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li>It has a light feminine scent and isnt overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Loved it plus was delivered fast.</li>
            <li>Easy, prompt transaction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong but I will wear it til I finish the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>Love this parfum - stays on a long time and smells great.</li>
            <li>This gourmand-like dry-down is my favorite aspect of this fume, and what makes it special &amp; unique, imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap price.</li>
            <li>Every women I have known to have tried this scent has raved about how much they liked it.</li>
            <li>For those of you that like a light, non-intrusive, no musk fragrance, I stongly suggest you try it.</li>
            <li>Light and woodsy with a hint of  musk.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder another.</li>
            <li>This scent is a light, floral scent on her.</li>
            <li>I never saw that it was not the genuine product.  </li>
            <li>Great product for a younger girl.  </li>
            <li>It explains why the price is so cheap.</li>
            <li>Thank you for keeping it available.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong or too sweet.  </li>
            <li>I learned not to get too excited over cheap prices here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light clean floral.  </li>
            <li>I just received a new bottle right now and I am loving it even more..</li>
            <li>ET opens as a clean, clear, bright fruity-floral that is just a tad powdery, almost soap-like, and quite sweet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ordered this for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day, hoping it was the original scent that has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>So when I found this I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Now I am happy to be able to give credit to the designer by actually purchasing the real thing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like the original fragrance.</li>
            <li>Nothing smells this sexy to me; )</li>
            <li>Have gotten many positive reactions to the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this soft, sophisticated and delightful musky women&#x27;s fragrance that combines oriental floral tones with spices and subtle woodsy undertones.</li>
            <li>Thanks to someone telling me, I was able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I received this fragrance as a gift last year and loved it.  </li>
            <li>so I really wanted some more.</li>
            <li>Rather it is a medium sweet citrus and has become my all-day-every-day signature.  </li>
            <li>This is for the lady that knows how she likes to smell and won&#x27;t settle for sweet overly perfumed perfumes.</li>
            <li>This is a nice soft sweet smell.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect blend, not too sweet or floral, subtle smell of musk.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it,this is my second bottle smells really fresh and clean love it.</li>
            <li>This is light, feminine and when you layer it with body gel and body lotion, it makes a statement, and not that kind that causes you to wrinkle your nose and wonder who just left the room.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I first fell in love with this scent when it was first introduced.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for myself for Christamas and paid $62.00 for the same exact thing for my sister, Wish I would have founf it before because its such a great price at $29.00, look at the money I could have saved!!</li>
            <li>The white florals get amplified on my skin as it moves to the heart, so it&#x27;s not wearable in warm weather for me.</li>
            <li>a lot ... but not enough to own it.</li>
            <li>Fresh and not overbearing in scent.  </li>
            <li>not the real thing...very disappointed..don&#x27;t buy it...not worth the cheap price...</li>
            <li>This perfume by far is an outstanding choice.</li>
            <li>My other aunt asked me what it was because she thought I smelled so good</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s beautiful and very feminine without being heavy or cloying.  </li>
            <li>I was greatly surprised by the fact that it came with the whole set for such a great price .</li>
            <li>i get this as an everyday body spay it smells nice all day !</li>
            <li>Ellen Tracy has such a soothing, clean scent...with just a touch of sweet!</li>
            <li>very clean not sweet smell:)</li>
            <li>and I had to have it again for its rich, seductive sexy, romantic, and classic smell.</li>
            <li>Walmart used to carry this at a very reasonable price but discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>Great price for this perfume which is hard to find.  </li>
            <li>It smelled okay when I sprayed it, but a minute or two later, it was stinky.  </li>
            <li>This perfume, is so feminine, soft and light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mystery to me what is different about this perfume, which I have worn for many years and always get compliments on.  </li>
            <li>Had this many years ago didn&#x27;t think it would smell the same.</li>
            <li>My aunt had it first</li>
            <li>My first encounter with Ellen Tracy was a fragrance sample from an O magazine.</li>
            <li>I GOT THIS FOR MY DOCTOR FOR CHRISTMAS TO SHOW MY APPRECIATION FOR HER BEING ABLE TO SOLVE MY MEDICAL PROBLEM THAT I SUFFERED WITH FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li>So I was glad when Amazon had the same size, and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read the reviews saying to avoid buying, as it is a fake, but figured I&#x27;d take the chance, as there were great reviews too...!!  </li>
            <li>It smells even better on me than it did back then.  </li>
            <li>Yes thank you very much exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday perfum with a price I can live with.</li>
            <li>This perfume is soft and not over powering, it goes easily from day to evening, and is very feminine.  </li>
            <li>Mom was super excited to have it back, she&#x27;s never found a replacement.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume because it is very gentle smelling especially for older women.  </li>
            <li>It has long been my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>However, all of our items are new and fresh in stock.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews and some people said that this was not the real version, but I decided to purchase it anyway.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn the REAL Ellen Tracy before</li>
            <li>and I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Nothing out there really compares.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula was much stronger and lasted all day.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly fast shipping and product was as advertised.</li>
            <li>Delivered in a reasonable time,  a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but if you are looking to buy the real thing, leave it alone.</li>
            <li>Thanks OxKom.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Have been wearing for 15+ years so ordering as much as I can now.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Christmas gift for a neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;She really likes it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>However, like many other reviewers on this product, I don&#x27;t think it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I have received more compliments when I wear this perfume then any other perfume that I have ever worn.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this fragrance I was about 24 years old.</li>
            <li>well live for!</li>
            <li>When I found it on Amazon, I was relieved to not have t pay department store pricing for this older fragrance.  </li>
            <li>B000UZVJFK Ellen Tracy (Classic) by Ellen Tracy for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Parfum Spray]]    </li>
            <li>So, I would say, if you&#x27;re an older woman, give it a try.</li>
            <li>it does not last more than a second after spraying on..terrible product</li>
            <li>Was getting nervous about finding my wife&#x27;s cologne in time for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciated the price being right, and appreciated even more the shipment arriving a few days earlier than predicted.</li>
            <li>Paid much more a few years ago in department store.</li>
            <li>And, no, I do not see this as an evening scent: it is neither heavy, nor heady, nor overtly sexy.  </li>
            <li>and I received New Brand by Ellen Tracy -</li>
            <li>We found this scent by accident while doing our every 5 year search for a new &#x27;signature&#x27; fragrance that we each like to use.  </li>
            <li>I have had testers and new bottles</li>
            <li>cant live without it.</li>
            <li>It is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>It is very classy.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance but it only last a very short time</li>
            <li>I recommend it to a muture age group as the young do not perfer older mature scents as this.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very close to the same, but does not compare to older bottles I still have around.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very particular about fragrances and doesn&#x27;t like anything heavy or too sweet or musky.  </li>
            <li>I am even more disappointed because I cannot return my two bottles because they are considered to be a hazardous material.  </li>
            <li>Product as expected and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I was suprised as how large the bottle actually was.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite fragrance and is hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent, hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering some more since it is so hard to find</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the size.  </li>
            <li>Not a heavy floral scent.</li>
            <li>Tired of spending over 50.00 for a nice perfum</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this perfume for a very long time I had my first bottle 4 years ago</li>
            <li>I thought it would very expensive to purchase and to my surprise through Amazon the price was great.</li>
            <li>My mom has the real Hellen Tracy perfume and it stays a long time.  </li>
            <li>Ellen Tracy by Ellen Tracy is one of those subtle, lovely, old-South  fragrances from the past that says \\&quot;Rich &amp; Romantic\\</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t personally Used, this has been ordered numerous times for someone else, she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>no other like it..</li>
            <li>no other can compare...</li>
            <li>As it dries down, ET seems to show a gourmand character, very much like Omnia</li>
            <li>Very bad decision...it was perfect scent all around</li>
            <li>Luv the smell long lasting....very mature fragrance</li>
            <li>Not harsh and last quite long</li>

            <li> Still a great perfume at a decent price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice woodsy sweet smell.  </li>
            <li> GREAT value for the price...Love the fragrace so girly and soft!  </li>
            <li> Not a heavy scent so great for anyone.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> It has a light feminine scent and isnt overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Loved it plus was delivered fast.</li>
            <li> Easy, prompt transaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong but I will wear it til I finish the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> Love this parfum - stays on a long time and smells great.</li>
            <li> This gourmand-like dry-down is my favorite aspect of this fume, and what makes it special &amp; unique, imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheap price.</li>
            <li> Every women I have known to have tried this scent has raved about how much they liked it.</li>
            <li> For those of you that like a light, non-intrusive, no musk fragrance, I stongly suggest you try it.</li>
            <li> Light and woodsy with a hint of  musk.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder another.</li>
            <li> This scent is a light, floral scent on her.</li>
            <li> I never saw that it was not the genuine product.  </li>
            <li> Great product for a younger girl.  </li>
            <li> It explains why the price is so cheap.</li>
            <li> Thank you for keeping it available.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong or too sweet.  </li>
            <li> I learned not to get too excited over cheap prices here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light clean floral.  </li>
            <li> I just received a new bottle right now and I am loving it even more..</li>
            <li> ET opens as a clean, clear, bright fruity-floral that is just a tad powdery, almost soap-like, and quite sweet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ordered this for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day, hoping it was the original scent that has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> So when I found this I was so excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Now I am happy to be able to give credit to the designer by actually purchasing the real thing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the original fragrance.</li>
            <li> Nothing smells this sexy to me; )</li>
            <li> Have gotten many positive reactions to the scent.</li>
            <li> I love this soft, sophisticated and delightful musky women&#x27;s fragrance that combines oriental floral tones with spices and subtle woodsy undertones.</li>
            <li> Thanks to someone telling me, I was able to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I received this fragrance as a gift last year and loved it.  </li>
            <li> so I really wanted some more.</li>
            <li> Rather it is a medium sweet citrus and has become my all-day-every-day signature.  </li>
            <li> This is for the lady that knows how she likes to smell and won&#x27;t settle for sweet overly perfumed perfumes.</li>
            <li> This is a nice soft sweet smell.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect blend, not too sweet or floral, subtle smell of musk.</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it,this is my second bottle smells really fresh and clean love it.</li>
            <li> This is light, feminine and when you layer it with body gel and body lotion, it makes a statement, and not that kind that causes you to wrinkle your nose and wonder who just left the room.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I first fell in love with this scent when it was first introduced.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself for Christamas and paid $62.00 for the same exact thing for my sister, Wish I would have founf it before because its such a great price at $29.00, look at the money I could have saved!!</li>
            <li> The white florals get amplified on my skin as it moves to the heart, so it&#x27;s not wearable in warm weather for me.</li>
            <li> a lot ... but not enough to own it.</li>
            <li> Fresh and not overbearing in scent.  </li>
            <li> not the real thing...very disappointed..don&#x27;t buy it...not worth the cheap price...</li>
            <li> This perfume by far is an outstanding choice.</li>
            <li> My other aunt asked me what it was because she thought I smelled so good</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s beautiful and very feminine without being heavy or cloying.  </li>
            <li> I was greatly surprised by the fact that it came with the whole set for such a great price .</li>
            <li> i get this as an everyday body spay it smells nice all day !</li>
            <li> Ellen Tracy has such a soothing, clean scent...with just a touch of sweet!</li>
            <li> very clean not sweet smell:)</li>
            <li> and I had to have it again for its rich, seductive sexy, romantic, and classic smell.</li>
            <li> Walmart used to carry this at a very reasonable price but discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> Great price for this perfume which is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It smelled okay when I sprayed it, but a minute or two later, it was stinky.  </li>
            <li> This perfume, is so feminine, soft and light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mystery to me what is different about this perfume, which I have worn for many years and always get compliments on.  </li>
            <li> Had this many years ago didn&#x27;t think it would smell the same.</li>
            <li> My aunt had it first</li>
            <li> My first encounter with Ellen Tracy was a fragrance sample from an O magazine.</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS FOR MY DOCTOR FOR CHRISTMAS TO SHOW MY APPRECIATION FOR HER BEING ABLE TO SOLVE MY MEDICAL PROBLEM THAT I SUFFERED WITH FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li> So I was glad when Amazon had the same size, and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the reviews saying to avoid buying, as it is a fake, but figured I&#x27;d take the chance, as there were great reviews too...!!  </li>
            <li> It smells even better on me than it did back then.  </li>
            <li> Yes thank you very much exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday perfum with a price I can live with.</li>
            <li> This perfume is soft and not over powering, it goes easily from day to evening, and is very feminine.  </li>
            <li> Mom was super excited to have it back, she&#x27;s never found a replacement.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume because it is very gentle smelling especially for older women.  </li>
            <li> It has long been my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> However, all of our items are new and fresh in stock.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews and some people said that this was not the real version, but I decided to purchase it anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn the REAL Ellen Tracy before</li>
            <li> and I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Nothing out there really compares.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula was much stronger and lasted all day.  </li>
            <li> Incredibly fast shipping and product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Delivered in a reasonable time,  a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but if you are looking to buy the real thing, leave it alone.</li>
            <li> Thanks OxKom.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Have been wearing for 15+ years so ordering as much as I can now.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for a neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;She really likes it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> However, like many other reviewers on this product, I don&#x27;t think it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I have received more compliments when I wear this perfume then any other perfume that I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this fragrance I was about 24 years old.</li>
            <li> well live for!</li>
            <li> When I found it on Amazon, I was relieved to not have t pay department store pricing for this older fragrance.  </li>
            <li> B000UZVJFK Ellen Tracy (Classic) by Ellen Tracy for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Parfum Spray]]    </li>
            <li> So, I would say, if you&#x27;re an older woman, give it a try.</li>
            <li> it does not last more than a second after spraying on..terrible product</li>
            <li> Was getting nervous about finding my wife&#x27;s cologne in time for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciated the price being right, and appreciated even more the shipment arriving a few days earlier than predicted.</li>
            <li> Paid much more a few years ago in department store.</li>
            <li> And, no, I do not see this as an evening scent: it is neither heavy, nor heady, nor overtly sexy.  </li>
            <li> and I received New Brand by Ellen Tracy -</li>
            <li> We found this scent by accident while doing our every 5 year search for a new &#x27;signature&#x27; fragrance that we each like to use.  </li>
            <li> I have had testers and new bottles</li>
            <li> cant live without it.</li>
            <li> It is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> It is very classy.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance but it only last a very short time</li>
            <li> I recommend it to a muture age group as the young do not perfer older mature scents as this.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is very close to the same, but does not compare to older bottles I still have around.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s very particular about fragrances and doesn&#x27;t like anything heavy or too sweet or musky.  </li>
            <li> I am even more disappointed because I cannot return my two bottles because they are considered to be a hazardous material.  </li>
            <li> Product as expected and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I was suprised as how large the bottle actually was.  </li>
            <li> It is my favorite fragrance and is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I love this scent, hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering some more since it is so hard to find</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the size.  </li>
            <li> Not a heavy floral scent.</li>
            <li> Tired of spending over 50.00 for a nice perfum</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this perfume for a very long time I had my first bottle 4 years ago</li>
            <li> I thought it would very expensive to purchase and to my surprise through Amazon the price was great.</li>
            <li> My mom has the real Hellen Tracy perfume and it stays a long time.  </li>
            <li> Ellen Tracy by Ellen Tracy is one of those subtle, lovely, old-South  fragrances from the past that says \\&quot;Rich &amp; Romantic\\</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t personally Used, this has been ordered numerous times for someone else, she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> no other like it..</li>
            <li> no other can compare...</li>
            <li> As it dries down, ET seems to show a gourmand character, very much like Omnia</li>
            <li> Very bad decision...it was perfect scent all around</li>
            <li> Luv the smell long lasting....very mature fragrance</li>
            <li> Not harsh and last quite long</li>
            <li> Her response was &amp;#34;omg you can smell it!&amp;#34; It was not overpowering, just a subtle fresh note.</li>
            <li> It also does not seem to last long on the skin.  </li>
            <li> You leave a piece of you behind which is the sweet smelling fragrance of Ellen Tracy.</li>
            <li> I had expected a smaller bottle like I had purchased locally.  </li>
            <li> The perfume has a faint smell of Ellen Tracy that is overpowered by a strong alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> THE PERFUME BOX WAS WET, RATTLED WHEN SHAKEN WITH MULTIPLE PIECES</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to replace my long time discontinued perfume &amp;#34;Perhaps&amp;#34; by Mackie.</li>
            <li> It still lasts a long time and the &amp;#34;price&amp;#34; you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> It will smell different on other persons.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed,  perfume has no smell at all,  very pretty bottle, thank goodness it was cheap, and I only bought one bottle,  will never buy again.</li>
            <li> My mother is 75 years young and it is hard, finding a fragrance, that is not overpowering on her.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite over the years, hard to find and expensive.  </li>
            <li> THE OUTER BOX WAS WET AND SMELLED OF PERFUME.</li>
            <li> Be careful, this is a knock off.  </li>
            <li> Have a wide variety of products for this.</li>
            <li> Not real product as represented, returned for refund</li>
            <li> It lasts only few mintues.  </li>
            <li> While my wife was disappointed, it was too much of a hassle to return and wait for the &#x27;real&#x27; product I ordered.</li>
            <li> have spent hundreds of dollars on big name brands at other department stores costing 65.00 to 100.00 for a small bottle.</li>
            <li> There is none other that can compare to it.  </li>
            <li> so I received a gift set including the Perfume and a couple other items.  </li>
            <li> I have had an EXTREME problem with almost every fragrance I&#x27;ve encountered for years.</li>
            <li> the following is the response that I received from the company when I complained.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is DEFINATELY not the real thing.  </li>
            <li> but… the sprayer stopped working half way through the bottle</li>
            <li> Used to pay $35 for the little bottle when it was at the mall stores.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not available everywhere</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> I reordered a few times.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND</li>
            <li> I was really shocked by the price when I ordered it for the amount of PURE fragrance I got.</li>
            <li> for all the bad reviewers, this IS the REAL thing.  </li>
            <li> We apologize that you are not completely satisfied with the item you received.  </li>
            <li> As said by others this is not a genuine produce and smells awefull!</li>
            <li> For the price, give it a try; not many women don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> My wife a small supply as as not to tun out for a while.</li>
            <li> and I really miss it. :(  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to beat Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> In our area, Ellen Tracey can be hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have been using it or at least 6 years</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe some of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Too faint a scent; sprayer broke when I accidentally dropped, so at least 1/3 of perfume was wasted, since I can&#x27;t spray the bottle anymore.</li>
            <li> Wife wanted it so badly, couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li> I had been wearing this perfume for a few years, then it was discontinued and I have been unable to find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an office fragrance, you could do worse than this one.</li>
            <li> but ALAS there was hope, AMAZON.com.</li>
            <li> Silly me.  </li>
            <li> It smells expensive yet isn&#x27;t expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This may be used as a casual scent for any ocasion.  </li>
            <li> So frustrated because not only do I not have horrible smelling perfume</li>
            <li> this is a knock off, but either way, this camper is unhappy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Sad part is, I can&#x27;t even return it!</li>
            <li> Very sad that this scent has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that Amazon is selling counterfeit perfume :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed!</li>
            <li> The two bottles of Ellen Tracy that I ordered must be expired because they smell terrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If I could afford it I would take a bath in it. Love the fragrance. Clean &amp; fresh. Best best price around.</li>
            <li> Silly me.  I read the reviews and some people said that this was not the real version, but I decided to purchase it anyway.  It smelled okay when I sprayed it, but a minute or two later, it was stinky.  I&#x27;ve worn the REAL Ellen Tracy before and I know that this is a knock off version.  The Seller knows this and that is why the listing says that you cannot return it.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle doesn&#x27;t work well.  Have to jiggle and turn it after every squirt to get it to squirt again.  Hope it doesn&#x27;t stop working all together before the perfume is gone.</li>
            <li> Nice fragance.Cheap price.I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift a few years ago. The scent was just beautiful and I got so many compliments on it. Then I had heard that Liz Clairborne was no longer making it and I was very dissapointed. I took a shot at looking on Amazon and what a surprise to find it here and at such a great price!! I love it and I&#x27;m sure I will be buying more. Thanks</li>
            <li> Ellen Tracy for Women is one of the best perfumes/colognes for women ever made. It is a shame they decided to discontinue the production of this scent. Every women I have known to have tried this scent has raved about how much they liked it.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Smells terrific! So happy to find this scent, again!</li>

            <li> To All and Sundry:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day, hoping it was the original scent that has been discontinued.  My mom has been wearing this scent for years, she&#x27;s an RN and always gets compliments from her patients and their families.  Hospitals are always a good test for perfume!  For those of you that like a light, non-intrusive, no musk fragrance, I stongly suggest you try it. I used to find it everywhere online, now it seems it&#x27;s only at Amazon.  Mom was super excited to have it back, she&#x27;s never found a replacement.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself for Christamas and paid $62.00 for the same exact thing for my sister, Wish I would have founf it before because its such a great price at $29.00, look at the money I could have saved!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite go-to perfume. Ellen Tracy has such a soothing, clean scent...with just a touch of sweet! Sometimes it makes me feel better just smelling it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to beat Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> ET opens as a clean, clear, bright fruity-floral that is just a tad powdery, almost soap-like, and quite sweet. The white florals get amplified on my skin as it moves to the heart, so it&#x27;s not wearable in warm weather for me. As it dries down, ET seems to show a gourmand character, very much like Omnia - both are classified as oriental woodies, though. This gourmand-like dry-down is my favorite aspect of this fume, and what makes it special &amp; unique, imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything that I&#x27;ve tried (or own) in the Ellen Tracy fragrance line is office-appropriate. ET is no exception. If you&#x27;re looking for an office fragrance, you could do worse than this one. I like it ... a lot ... but not enough to own it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my mother who loves this scent and I don&#x27;t blame her, it&#x27;s beautiful and very feminine without being heavy or cloying.  We found this scent by accident while doing our every 5 year search for a new &#x27;signature&#x27; fragrance that we each like to use.  I found mine and then discovered this for her to try and she loved it.  She&#x27;s very particular about fragrances and doesn&#x27;t like anything heavy or too sweet or musky.  This is light, feminine and when you layer it with body gel and body lotion, it makes a statement, and not that kind that causes you to wrinkle your nose and wonder who just left the room.  I love this scent and if my mother ever find something she likes better, I think I&#x27;ll have to snag a bottle or two for myself for an alternative perfume because it&#x27;s just that lovely a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!  This is a great value.  It always arrives on time!</li>
            <li> been using this perfume since 1992, i love it</li>
            <li> Very lovely light scent. My cousin came by my house one day and as she stepped in I had to ask her what she was wearing.  Her response was &amp;#34;omg you can smell it!&amp;#34; It was not overpowering, just a subtle fresh note.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this perfume for a very long time I had my first bottle 4 years ago and I loved it!! I just received a new bottle right now and I am loving it even more..hmmmm...smells heavenly!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t personally Used, this has been ordered numerous times for someone else, she absolutely loves it. The shipping is always on time,.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the size.  I had expected a smaller bottle like I had purchased locally.  Instead, I received twice as much for a very good price.  It is my favorite fragrance and is hard to find.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for Xmas.  Walmart used to carry this at a very reasonable price but discontinued it.  When I found it on Amazon, I was relieved to not have t pay department store pricing for this older fragrance.  Still a great perfume at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I love this one also one of my favorite</li>
            <li> Ellen Tracy I love your perfume! It is the perfect blend, not too sweet or floral, subtle smell of musk. Perfect! Nothing out there really compares. Been a fan for 6 years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 bottles all were great products as described</li>
            <li> Great price for this perfume which is hard to find.  I get compliments all the time.  Think I will buy another bottle!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and it&#x27;s been discontinued for years.  So glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> GREAT value for the price...Love the fragrace so girly and soft!  I was really shocked by the price when I ordered it for the amount of PURE fragrance I got.</li>
            <li> I cannot buy this locally any more so it is wonderful to be able to get it on line.  It has long been my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Ellen Tracy&amp;#34; by Ellen Tracy for Women eau de parfum spray is a very light and pleasant fragrance.  I always get compliments when I wear it from both men and women.  I love to wear it in the summer; not overpowering at all!</li>
            <li> All of Ellen Tracy&#x27;s scents are supurb!  This is a nice woodsy sweet smell.  I recommend it to a muture age group as the young do not perfer older mature scents as this.  This may be used as a casual scent for any ocasion.  This is a nice soft sweet smell.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UZVJFK Ellen Tracy (Classic) by Ellen Tracy for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Parfum Spray]]    I had been wearing this perfume for a few years, then it was discontinued and I have been unable to find it anywhere.  Thanks to someone telling me, I was able to find it on Amazon.  This perfume, is so feminine, soft and light.  I still get compliments on it.  There is none other that can compare to it.  This perfume is soft and not over powering, it goes easily from day to evening, and is very feminine.  I hope I can continue to get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and this is the best price ever!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Have gotten many positive reactions to the scent. Not a heavy scent so great for anyone. Easy, prompt transaction.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday perfum with a price I can live with. Tired of spending over 50.00 for a nice perfum</li>
            <li> I get headaches from most perfumes but this one is perfect. I get compliments on it all the time. Hope they never discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume because it is very gentle smelling especially for older women.  I have been using it or at least 6 years and I always get compliments from all ages of people.  I feel very confident that I am not offending anyone when I wear it.  Unfortunately it is not available everywhere but I can always get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wife wanted it so badly, couldn&#x27;t find it locally. It&#x27;s the par-fum that she wears. Wont wear anything else, Wow!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mystery to me what is different about this perfume, which I have worn for many years and always get compliments on.  Another reviewer said the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last.  That was my experience as well.  The &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; formula was much stronger and lasted all day.  I don&#x27;t know whether the manufacturer changed up the formula, sold off the product or this is a knock off, but either way, this camper is unhappy with this purchase.  The fragrance is very close to the same, but does not compare to older bottles I still have around.  The color is slightly different as well, however the box is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price might be an indicator of the change.  Usually, good perfume carries a good price tag.  Who knows?</li>
            <li> OMG the best good price and the scent is very sexy every time I wear this people always ask me what do I have on this is a must have!! The price is a deal breaker</li>
            <li> Incredibly fast shipping and product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> THE OUTER BOX WAS WET AND SMELLED OF PERFUME. ON OPENING THE BOX THE PERFUME BOX WAS WET, RATTLED WHEN SHAKEN WITH MULTIPLE PIECES AND THERE WAS BUBBLES OF PRFUME BETWEEN BOX AND PLASTC WRAPPING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT YOU AND SENT MULTIPLE MESSAGES ASKING YOU TO REPLACE THE PERFUME OR GIVE ME CREDIT FOR THE SAME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ELLEN TRACY BY ELLEN TRACY FOR WOMEN 3.4 OZ EAU DE PERFUME.</li>
            <li> Very strong and nice perfume for this price, I didn&#x27;t order a gift set but they sent me a gift set for the same price! I recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful and light fragrance.  Was a gift for my mother and she loves it.</li>
            <li> It is nice and subtle. Not a heavy floral scent. It is very classy. I got it as a gift for my grandmother and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Had this many years ago didn&#x27;t think it would smell the same. smelled just as I remember ❤</li>
            <li> Ellen Tracy is one of my favorite scents. When I opened the package I was not disappointed!!&lt;br /&gt;The cologne scent is as I remember it. It isn&#x27;t heavy. Light and woodsy with a hint of  musk.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder another. Thankyou Amazon</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed! The two bottles of Ellen Tracy that I ordered must be expired because they smell terrible.  The perfume has a faint smell of Ellen Tracy that is overpowered by a strong alcohol smell. I am even more disappointed because I cannot return my two bottles because they are considered to be a hazardous material.  So frustrated because not only do I not have horrible smelling perfume, I can&#x27;t get my money back!!!</li>
            <li> Too faint a scent; sprayer broke when I accidentally dropped, so at least 1/3 of perfume was wasted, since I can&#x27;t spray the bottle anymore. I think this was a knock-off.</li>
            <li> I received this fragrance as a gift last year and loved it.  I received so many compliments.  I thought it would very expensive to purchase and to my surprise through Amazon the price was great.</li>
            <li> Great. I reordered a few times.</li>
            <li> Already love it...Great Value, fast service</li>
            <li> I love Ellen Tracy by Ellen Tracy. I have never had the problems that some are complaining about in these reviews. The scent stays with me without having to reapply. I have received more compliments when I wear this perfume then any other perfume that I have ever worn. People come up and ask me all the time &amp;#34;what are you wearing, you smell so good?&amp;#34; I will continue to purchase from Amazon as I cannot find it anywhere else at this price!  Ellen Tracy is always my go-to scent for any occasion! Love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> THIS I BELIEVE IS ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS FAVORITES, IF NOT THE FAVORITE.  IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND SO ONCE AGAIN I TURN TO AMAZON.  THE PRICE WAS AWESOME FOR THE SIZE.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. My aunt had it first and I loved it so I got some. My other aunt asked me what it was because she thought I smelled so good and I bought her some last year for Christmas. Then my mother thought that my aunt smelled good and she told her that it&#x27;s what I wear and she wanted some too. So, I bought this bottle for my mother for Christmas this year! Spread the love and perfume! :)</li>
            <li> Every time my mother uses this fragrance, she gets compliments. My mother is 75 years young and it is hard, finding a fragrance, that is not overpowering on her. Ellen Tracy is my mother&#x27;s signature fragrance and she wears it every day. I can only find it online, so I have to stock up on it. This scent is a light, floral scent on her. It will smell different on other persons. So, I would say, if you&#x27;re an older woman, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Fast service and a wonderful eau de parfum.  It smells expensive yet isn&#x27;t expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder when I run out of Ellen Tracy by Ellen Tracy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again!</li>
            <li> Delivered in a reasonable time,  a reasonable price. Most people don&#x27;t buy perfume without know how it smells, so if you like it, this is a good way to get it easily.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles of this parfume because of the totally incredible price.  Be careful, this is a knock off.  It is made somewhere in France.  Read and reread all the information.  I never saw that it was not the genuine product.  I feel this was my own mistake.  The parfume is well packaged and came bottled nicely but it is not Ellen Tracy.  It also does not seem to last long on the skin.  Great product for a younger girl.  This is not a slam against the product but if you are looking to buy the real thing, leave it alone.</li>
            <li> As said by others this is not a genuine produce and smells awefull!</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance in a roller ball form from my local wig shop for years. I always got so many compliments on the scent. So when I found this I was so excited to try it. It smells just like the scent I have been wearing for years. Now I am happy to be able to give credit to the designer by actually purchasing the real thing.</li>
            <li> EDIT Feb 2015: Just reordered as a gift for my wife. Stayed with original vendor and got a nice surprise.  They must&#x27;ve run out of the item ordered so I received a gift set including the Perfume and a couple other items.  Thanks OxKom.&lt;br /&gt;Also for all the bad reviewers, this IS the REAL thing.  When I opened the cover to check for damage, I got a whiff of the product and it&#x27;s the same scent my wife has been wearing for 15+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 STARS at this price this is a steal.  My wife&#x27;s favorite over the years, hard to find and expensive.  Can&#x27;t believe some of the negative reviews.  To each their own but it definitely doesn&#x27;t stink, not on my wife it doesn&#x27;t.  Not too strong or too sweet.  Just sexy nice.  Took a awhile to get here but still happy to get it at a great price.  Used to pay $35 for the little bottle when it was at the mall stores.</li>
            <li> The Fragrance was as I expected - great price, great service, and it smells - you guessed it, great!  Everyone loves this fragrance on me so I really wanted some more. I&#x27;m one happy camper!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would have a lighter scent. It&#x27;s a bit strong but I will wear it til I finish the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t buy it again. I loved &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; from Ellen Tracy and found they discontinued it. Very bad decision...it was perfect scent all around and I can&#x27;t find another that comes close. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> My perfume!!! Smells great and very affordable.  Always get great compliments&lt;br /&gt;on this fragrance!!! Can&#x27;t wait till this one runs out to get some more!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume and a great price!</li>
            <li> I love this scent!  It&#x27;s a light clean floral.  I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Been wearing it for years and receive many compliments.  Fresh and not overbearing in scent.  For the price, give it a try; not many women don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, great perfume. I love this scent, hard to find in stores.  Paid much more a few years ago in department store.</li>
            <li> I was greatly surprised by the fact that it came with the whole set for such a great price . I will be ordering some more since it is so hard to find and it&#x27;s the only fragrance my man loves.</li>
            <li> Delivery was good. However, like many other reviewers on this product, I don&#x27;t think it is the real deal. I have had many bottles of Ellen Tracy perfume from a variety of sources. I have had testers and new bottles and this is not the same fragrance. It lasts about 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> Thought I only bought the parfum. However,  a gift pack was delivered for the same price.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;She was very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to replace my long time discontinued perfume &amp;#34;Perhaps&amp;#34; by Mackie. This is a good replacement. Not too strong. Fragrance lasts for quite a while. Not overpowering but pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance !!!i get this as an everyday body spay it smells nice all day !very clean not sweet smell:)</li>
            <li> I noticed this on a saleswoman and asked her about it. I loved the clean scent. My partner loves it.</li>
            <li> In our area, Ellen Tracey can be hard to find. When I sawiton line, I bought. My wife a small supply as as not to tun out for a while. Arrived in good condition and was received on time.</li>
            <li> Very sad that this scent has been discontinued.  Have been wearing for 15+ years so ordering as much as I can now. Have a wide variety of products for this. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Luv the smell long lasting....very mature fragrance</li>
            <li> but… the sprayer stopped working half way through the bottle</li>
            <li> Men love this perfume, most women don&#x27;t , but I do &amp; who cares if women don&#x27;t .. It&#x27;s the men I want to please ...</li>
            <li> Product as expected and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Ellen Tracy by Ellen Tracy is one of those subtle, lovely, old-South  fragrances from the past that says \\&quot;Rich &amp; Romantic\\&quot; in the same breath. I have had an EXTREME problem with almost every fragrance I&#x27;ve encountered for years. Some have even caused Asthma attacks, but this one doesn&#x27;t offend my nose, breathing, or skin at all. My first encounter with Ellen Tracy was a fragrance sample from an O magazine. I fell in love with it from the start, but I waited for a reaction because I figured it was coming. To my delight &amp; surprise...NO REACTIONS!!!!!! I purchased the body powder, then the cologne &amp; body cream when I could no longer find the body powder...and I really miss it. :(  If there&#x27;s a way I could find to make it myself, I would! Any suggesstions?</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this fragrance I was about 24 years old. My mother had picked it up at a consignment shop. WHY on earth would anyone get rid of this is beyond me. This stuff is awesome!!! I remember stopping to put gas in my tank one day before leaving town and I was wearing this scent. I walked in between the tanks to go pay for my gas and when I came back through, this man approached me from another pump and asked me what was I wearing. I knew from that day forth that Ellen Tracy was the BEST, then I discovered that it was discontinued and boy was I hurt but ALAS there was hope, AMAZON.com. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great fast service and I love the product. Have used for years.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Gonna stock up on this fragrance! The smell is to die... well live for!</li>
            <li> not the real thing...very disappointed..don&#x27;t buy it...not worth the cheap price...it does not last more than a second after spraying on..terrible product..ripoff</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I have worn it for years.  They discontinued it and this is the only way I can find it.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS FOR MY DOCTOR FOR CHRISTMAS TO SHOW MY APPRECIATION FOR HER BEING ABLE TO SOLVE MY MEDICAL PROBLEM THAT I SUFFERED WITH FOR YEARS. SHE LOVED THE PARFUM. THIS IS ONE OF MY MANY FAVORITE SCENTS.</li>
            <li> I love this Parfum. But could not find it anywhere. And when I did they charged inflated prices for it. So I was glad when Amazon had the same size, and the price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my sophisticated fragrance I wear when I dress up. (Or even sometimes just with Jeans)</li>
            <li> My favorite scent - many compliments.  I have worn this fragrance for years.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells wonderful. It works well in spring and summer seasons. Very affordable. Quite possibly my favorite to wear!</li>
            <li> Good scent. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Not real product as represented, returned for refund</li>
            <li> Best parfum ever. Is my presentation card I love it.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Mom loved it and great price aswell</li>
            <li> This product is a counterfeit!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It lasts only few mintues.  My mom has the real Hellen Tracy perfume and it stays a long time.  Even the bottle looks different.  It explains why the price is so cheap. I learned not to get too excited over cheap prices here.</li>
            <li> I love this soft, sophisticated and delightful musky women&#x27;s fragrance that combines oriental floral tones with spices and subtle woodsy undertones. It is not overbearing.  It is a tantalizing scent that will last through the night.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews saying to avoid buying, as it is a fake, but figured I&#x27;d take the chance, as there were great reviews too...!!  Unfortunately it is DEFINATELY not the real thing.  I have Ellen Tracy perfume and love it.  This smells the same, but only lasts 5 minutes tops.  Disappointed that Amazon is selling counterfeit perfume :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum;&lt;br /&gt;I want to offer kudos to Amazon... perfume cannot be returned, but once I notified them of the problem, they are refunding my account.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the original fragrance. Ugh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this perfume for a while, I love it!  I am pleased with the product and the service I received from the seller.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance but it only last a very short time</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it,this is my second bottle smells really fresh and clean love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, but don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> I was suprised as how large the bottle actually was.  The delivery was efficient and the perfume arrived without a hitch!</li>
            <li> I was more than pleased with my purchase of Ellen Tracy. I have inquired about this item in many retail stores and none of them can match your price....&lt;br /&gt;Wow.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what this is, but it in not Ellen Tracy.  ET was my favorite perfume and was so upset when they&lt;br /&gt;discontinued it.  I should have known better.  Sad part is, I can&#x27;t even return it!</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> the product is amazing everyone says \\&quot;my god u smell great\\&quot; what are u wearing ELLEN TRACY..cant live without it.I buy like 3to 6 at a time and it last me about 2months..why because im a smoker dont like the way cig smell and no1 nows i even smoke they just cant get enough of my ELLEN TRACY...no other like it..no other can compare...</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for a neighbor.&lt;br /&gt;She really likes it.</li>
            <li> I first fell in love with this scent when it was first introduced.  After wandering away, I am now back!  For life!  It smells even better on me than it did back then.  And, no, I do not see this as an evening scent: it is neither heavy, nor heady, nor overtly sexy.  Rather it is a medium sweet citrus and has become my all-day-every-day signature.  Thank you for keeping it available.  Ellen Tracy: Please, Please, Please never discontinue!</li>
            <li> Ellen Tracy smell so wonderful,even when you leave the room people know you been there. You leave a piece of you behind which is the sweet smelling fragrance of Ellen Tracy. Love it!!!  What was also good I got a Excellent price deal by, buying on line. Will purchase it again of Amazon. Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> i bought it for my girlfriend. she loves it. there isnt a day where she doesnt wear it and for that i am thankful. i will be getting more.</li>
            <li> I received a substitute product, not what was advertised on the web site.  While my wife was disappointed, it was too much of a hassle to return and wait for the &#x27;real&#x27; product I ordered. I will have to find another online source for this as I can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Was getting nervous about finding my wife&#x27;s cologne in time for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Appreciated the price being right, and appreciated even more the shipment arriving a few days earlier than predicted.</li>
            <li> Love this parfum - stays on a long time and smells great. Great service and prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> service was great. I love the smell of this perfume and was told it is no longer being made so I was thrilled to find it.</li>
            <li> This perfume by far is an outstanding choice. I had it once before and remember the name of it and I had to have it again for its rich, seductive sexy, romantic, and classic smell. This is for the lady that knows how she likes to smell and won&#x27;t settle for sweet overly perfumed perfumes. the smell is luxurious and alluring and it&#x27;s a great buy for the price. I love this scent. I always have and I always will.&lt;br /&gt;Thx from Lorrie, San Antonio Texas.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent. I always get great comments.</li>
            <li> Nothing smells this sexy to me; )</li>
            <li> Excellent product at an awesome price with freakishly quick shipping, thank you</li>
            <li> Yes thank you very much exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This one &amp;#34;Ellen Tracy&amp;#34; is a bit stronger then just &amp;#34;Ellen&amp;#34;. It still lasts a long time and the &amp;#34;price&amp;#34; you can&#x27;t beat. I would recommend this to someone whom likes more of a Amber in their perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent hundreds of dollars on big name brands at other department stores costing 65.00 to 100.00 for a small bottle. But this is a affordable winner in my book!</li>
            <li> Excellent! Loved it plus was delivered fast.</li>
            <li> Not harsh and last quite long</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL.  WONDERFUL.  WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  So glad I could find it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for years- I love it!</li>
            <li> My item arrived just as promised! Great service!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume.  It has a light feminine scent and isnt overwhelming.  I get so many compliments from this and have given it as a gift to many.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed,  perfume has no smell at all,  very pretty bottle, thank goodness it was cheap, and I only bought one bottle,  will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the nice clean smell of the purfume and received it from the seller in no time.</li>
            <li> Timeless fragrance love it thank you.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this smell last December - a Christmas gift from a friend and have not stopped wearing it. Just lovely.</li>
