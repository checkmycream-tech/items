            <li>I was extremely happy to see amazon offers this!!!!</li>
            <li>The nemat amber scent is one of my all time favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>so im ordering more.</li>
            <li>Would be lovely if it were stronger and lasted more than a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>I have been using this oil for years and most of my family has started using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still lovely...</li>
            <li>He never fails to mention that I smell good whenever I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance but the bottles were very defective!!!</li>
            <li>It is portable and definitely easy to use.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely matter, however the scent is not as strong as I would like.  </li>
            <li>It is light, yet noticable.  </li>
            <li>the scent is slightly different from the thicker oils, sweeter, but still very nice</li>
            <li>I have been trying for years to find a light, sweet, floral perfume that is not overbearing and fits my personality.  </li>
            <li>However overall a good product.</li>
            <li>I really like to roll-on bottle, so easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Salam distributors are very reliable and the delivery is very quick.  </li>
            <li>It is warm and possibly makes the skin smell even warmer.</li>
            <li>Do not confuse with amber musk, which is a heavier scent that smells more masculine to me.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t have much data from which to write a review, but I love it so far.</li>
            <li>It makes me think of lying naked in front of a crackling fireplace or maybe sunbathing in someplace exotic.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is absolutely divine!</li>
            <li>It is nice but it is also very deep and masculine as well.</li>
            <li>The smell is unique and nice, though is hard to pick up sometimes</li>
            <li>Slight warm amber scent - exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but is not very strong.</li>
            <li>I am an absolute fan and would recommend everyone to try the line of fragrances from Salam distributors.</li>
            <li>on much more promptly than expected.  </li>
            <li>: After a few months, this Amber is the boyfriend&#x27;s favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I took a chance since I knew that I needed to try something new</li>
            <li>Long lasting light scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not smelling anything sweet or like Egyptian musk, as other folks have mentioned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really would like to send it back for a refund.</li>
            <li>Not really down with the whole essential oil craze</li>
            <li>The only place i had heard it could be purchased was hundreds of miles from where i live.  </li>
            <li>I like the roll-on applicator because I am disabled and cannot operate other methods of scented products and this little glass bottle fits very easily in your purse or bag.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Delightfully packaged &amp; my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> Not really down with the whole essential oil craze but I overheard someone raving about amber oil as a fragrance and thought I&#x27;d try it out.  I like how light and feminine this oil smells rather than overpowering like some oils and lacking irritating alcohol.  The roller seems to work well and the bottle size is perfect to throw in my purse or makeup case.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance but the bottles were very defective!!! I had to break open the bottle because the roll on didn&#x27;t work causing me to spill a lot of the oil. I was not very happy about that at all.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely matter, however the scent is not as strong as I would like.  The roller ball thing sometimes doesn&#x27;t dispense any liquid when I need it to.  The smell is unique and nice, though is hard to pick up sometimes</li>
            <li> The perfect fragrance for me, and Thank you!  I am a nurse who works close with patients, and Amber is subtle---just right.  Smells so good, it is aroma therapy for me.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought the amber scent. It smells nice but is not very strong. However overall a good product. I really like to roll-on bottle, so easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Just got this today so don&#x27;t have much data from which to write a review, but I love it so far. Slight warm amber scent - exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt. The smell of the amber oil is wonderful. Very subtle odor, which I wish would be a bit stronger..</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t smell it unless you put your nose in the bottle. I&#x27;ll never buy that again.  I really would like to send it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> The musk Amber oil arrived before the sellers anticipated time and was packaged very nicely. I like the roll-on applicator because I am disabled and cannot operate other methods of scented products and this little glass bottle fits very easily in your purse or bag. It is portable and definitely easy to use. I can apply it to my wrists or neck or under my knees and have the warm scent stay with me all day. It is nice but it is also very deep and masculine as well. I would call it a unisex fragrance. It is not feminine in the flowery sense. It is warm and possibly makes the skin smell even warmer. It makes me think of lying naked in front of a crackling fireplace or maybe sunbathing in someplace exotic.</li>
            <li> i love this! the scent is slightly different from the thicker oils, sweeter, but still very nice</li>
            <li> The nemat amber scent is one of my all time favorite scents.  It is light, yet noticable.  Earthy, yet feminine.  I always get compliments when wearing this.  Do not confuse with amber musk, which is a heavier scent that smells more masculine to me.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is absolutely divine! I have been trying for years to find a light, sweet, floral perfume that is not overbearing and fits my personality.  I friend of mine introduced me to Amber and I have been a fan ever since. I took a chance since I knew that I needed to try something new and I knew that I did not want to pay $24 for a 1.07 ounce bottle just in case I hated it. I decided to try the $8 roll on fragrance. Salam distributors are very reliable and the delivery is very quick.  I am an absolute fan and would recommend everyone to try the line of fragrances from Salam distributors.</li>
            <li> I put some on before going to work. I love the way it smells. Several people ask what I was wearing and I told them. Then the next day it was a little different so my co workers thought it was something else but both smells were very pleasant.  Its small though so im ordering more.</li>
            <li> I bought the amber one. It has a nice smell, but it&#x27;s very faint. I put it on and a moment later I can&#x27;t even smell it. Would be lovely if it were stronger and lasted more than a couple minutes. I don&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for years and most of my family has started using it. I could only find this at one store where I lived and we moved. I was extremely happy to see amazon offers this!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if I didn&#x27;t get a different bottle of this scent than all the other reviewers got. What I&#x27;m smelling is very heavy and musky to me. It&#x27;s still lovely... I&#x27;m just not smelling anything sweet or like Egyptian musk, as other folks have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: After a few months, this Amber is the boyfriend&#x27;s favorite scent. He never fails to mention that I smell good whenever I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> Every aspect of this process exceeded my expectations.  I rec&#x27;d the Amber Roll-on much more promptly than expected.  A friend wears it &amp; i have loved &amp; wanted the fragrance for 2 years.  The only place i had heard it could be purchased was hundreds of miles from where i live.  How wonderful &amp; convenient to find it on Amazon!!!!!</li>
            <li> it not smell nothing!! 😈</li>
            <li> The scent does not seem to stay on very long</li>
            <li> Long lasting light scent</li>
