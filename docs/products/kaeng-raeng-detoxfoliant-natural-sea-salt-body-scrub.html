            <li>Some aspects of the product are very nice, and maybe this is what you are looking for, but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me for the cost ($36.00).  </li>

            <li>I really liked the smell and texture of the scrub.  </li>
            <li>was provided a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Even though it smells nice, I use it at night so that I don&#x27;t smell like flowers during the daytime.  </li>
            <li>I actually really liked this product.</li>
            <li>Best part, the smell is light and clean and not over powering.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft, and the scent is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product for so many reasons!&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>In fact, my husband was so impressed with how soft my skin felt, that he asked if he could use it too.  </li>
            <li>First up is the body scrub... who doesn&#x27;t love a good scrub?!  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients and it smells great!  </li>
            <li>Smelled awesome, and I love that it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very glad I was given the opportunity to try this product for free.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this scrub, it feels so good and the skin feels so clean</li>
            <li>I have tried and have had enjoyed the Kaeng Rang detox drinks.  </li>
            <li>But I am in love with the scrub.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is made in the US.  </li>
            <li>even when I tried it with no water touching me, it still dissolved almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t find the smell to be particularly appealing</li>
            <li>and I agree with many of the statements of the others about the product.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin soft and smooth, one of the best sea salt scrubs I have tried to date.</li>
            <li>The skin feels smooth and hydrated afterwards to the point that I didn&#x27;t even need to moisturize it!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My only caution is the sea salt stings so don&#x27;t shave before using, lol!!  </li>
            <li>Now I have to keep it away from my girlfriend :)</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the vanilla-lavender fragrance -</li>
            <li>and I love them, as does my daughter who uses a scrub every time she showers.</li>
            <li>I love their products because they have such good ingredients!!</li>
            <li>The scent is so nice and it leaves your skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I too have been enjoying the benefits of the Kaeg Raeng</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great line of body products that use natural ingredients, leave your skin feeling amazing, and not break the bank then</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that my feet were oily and slippery afterwards, but I think that&#x27;s par for the course with most scrubs.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a wonderful product and I look forward to seeing what the rest of the body line has to offer.</li>
            <li>This is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am definitely satisfied with this sea salt body scrub.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the top layer just doesn&#x27;t want to slough off.</li>
            <li>I have bought too many body scrubs to count, from Bath &amp; Body Works, to the Body Shop, to Origins, and on and on.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing effect is my favorite aspect of this product.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, so good you will be slightly tempted to eat some, and probably could!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is nice, and unique.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product as I make my own sugar scrubs</li>
            <li>I have found you have to use a lot to get the full benefits, but it has a really nice feeling that is not overly greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product out!</li>
            <li>Since I pregnant I wanted something safe and natural and yet effective!!</li>
            <li>The Detoxfoliant does a wonderful job of both exfoliating and moisturizing the skin, so skin is left smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My legs feel fresh and silky, and my bathroom smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This is of course my personal view, and I am happy that many others enthusiastically love it.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and radiant my skin is since using the scrub.</li>
            <li>It is super luxurious and it leaves your skin so incredibly silky soft.  </li>
            <li>it smells great, feels light and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Out of the jar, the scrub isn&#x27;t too greasy or slippery, which makes it really easy to work with.</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of lavender and the feeling of smooth, moisturized skin, you will enjoy this scrub.</li>
            <li>It is so great to know that this product is all natural and chemical free..</li>
            <li>While that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it a great product, it sure does help.</li>
            <li>do appreciate that the ingredients are all-natural and are easily identifiable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one is made with sea salt which makes my skin feel so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>First impression: the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li>I love the slightly sweet scent and the relaxing lavender.</li>
            <li>This is made of fine sea salt vs course or even an even mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft after using, and retained a light, pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and pure, not like it has a lot of perfumes added to it.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation aspect dilutes away very quickly on the skin so it is basically a rich pomade which I have to hurry to spread around before it rinses away.</li>
            <li>which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li>Since this product is cruelty free, gluten free, non-gmo, AND made in America ...</li>
            <li>I am also on a gluten-free diet, and I appreciate that this product is free of gluten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a free sample size jar for of Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s Detoxfoliant for review and was not monetarily compensated for my review.</li>
            <li>This scrub makes my skin feel so creamy and smooth after each use.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t hydrate and smooth my skin as well as this product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing to do is use it right before bed so that the shea butter has plenty of time to soak into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely will be buying more!!</li>
            <li>No artificial perfume smell lingering around - smells light and clean!</li>
            <li>I liked this product generally speaking and love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>The scrub left my skin feeling incredibly moisturized for 3 days after my first use.  </li>
            <li>Two days later, and my legs are still feeling wonderfully hydrated, and the dull appearance of my skin has greatly improved.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell like heaven, but it smooths on the skin nicely and works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This body scrub is fantastically better than many other body scrubs that I have tried and it is much more affordable!</li>
            <li>However, even if you&#x27;re not on a cleanse, this is a great product to combine once or twice a week with dry brushing.</li>
            <li>KR detoxfoliant did a marvelous job to remove the dead cells exposing fresh skin.</li>
            <li>this is going to be something special.</li>
            <li>This product is natural and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This lavender-vanilla body scrub exceeded my expectations by leaving my skin full of moisture.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating granules are actually salt crystals in different sizes, which has a great exfoliating power!</li>
            <li>I LOVE bath products, but over the years I have become more conscientious of not only what I put IN my body, but also what I put ON my body.</li>
            <li>Not only does this stuff smell great, it makes being ready a lot faster.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>Over the past year I have become more aware of the products I use on my body and the things I put in my body, so I was thrilled to hear about Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s newest product and even more excited to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and unlike other scrubs, it disolves easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a gritty feel to your skin.  </li>
            <li>The scrub has a light lavender scent with a hint of vanilla (once I&#x27;m dry - which I love!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review the morning after use, and my skin is super soft and smooth still!  </li>
            <li>Your whole body will be smooth and beach-ready after use of this scrub.  </li>
            <li>cleanse for a few years, and this is a great complement to it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I love that it is completely all natural.</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed using this scrub and left my skin nice and soft and shiny</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural and I am not adding any toxins to my body.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a citrus lavender smell that is fresh and intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would make my skin react.</li>
            <li>A product doesn&#x27;t get much more natural than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having made several of my own salt scrubs &amp; being knowledgeable on how to make salt scrubs, I would not buy this product.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and leaves you feeling very natural and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li>The full size comes with a scooper for application, which would certainly be easier than using your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see whats next for Kaeng Raeng, especially if it means more Lavender Vanilla scented products :).</li>
            <li>It is so good to know I am only applying natural ingredients on my body.</li>
            <li>I think this had a nice mix of the salt/scrub texture with enough moisture to be able to scoop it out of the container without it being dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>But the oils remained so my skin was super soft - just not as soft as it could have been with a better exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>So excited for this new line.</li>
            <li>and I feel ready for the day!  </li>
            <li>First time using it</li>
            <li>At first, I thought maybe I was under the water</li>
            <li>That is why I gave three stars (&amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Everyone is different and everyone deserves to find skin products they love.</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely heavenly!</li>
            <li>my skin is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>What a smooth, natural product.</li>
            <li>The scrub itself is thick and had great texture.  </li>
            <li>The varying sizes of the salt really make a difference!</li>
            <li>I waited until I was one week in to a 14-day detox before my first use and between my detox and the Detoxfoliant</li>
            <li>I am an AVID lotion user after showers, but not after using Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s Detoxfoliant.</li>
            <li>I love the new Kaeng Raeng Detoxfoliant Natural Sea Salt Body Scrub.</li>
            <li>For this reason, this may feel too heavy in the summer time - but would be perfect for dry, winter skin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin so smooth and now I feel dry when I don&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it the night before an event so the moisturizers can soak in overnight on the fresh skin surface.</li>
            <li>Unlike other, similar products this has a more mild (pleasing) scent and the grain is more gentle which I really like for every-day use.</li>
            <li>I loved this body scrub, use it primarily on feet, elbows, and other dry skin areas</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved that I didn&#x27;t even need to apply lotion for a few days after using it!</li>
            <li>I tend to break out really easily on my chest and back, but I didn&#x27;t with this body scrub.</li>
            <li>I first used it as a scrub in my shower and it left my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scrub is marketed as an enhancement to the company&#x27;s cleanse, and exfoliation can certainly help the detox process.</li>
            <li>Most exfoliators leave my skin dry and tight, but this one does an amazing job at exfoliating AND hydrating the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my skin SUPER soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I used this to do a little detoxifying lymphatic massage on days 1 and 2, and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>I recently tried this scrub and found it works very well and leaves your skin extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>The lavender vanilla scent is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I really like this product..</li>
            <li>This summer, no parchment thanks to Kaeng Raeng scrub.</li>
            <li>Yes, I suppose I did, but really, it&#x27;s out of this world.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks to all of the natural ingredients in this product, my skin feels so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Now, he loves using it as much as I do!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>the smell is intoxicating and the results are intense.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using it with a lufa or some type of rag to maximize how much you can spread it.</li>
            <li>It felt really</li>
            <li>I am also picky and sensitive to scents (especially now during pregnancy) and the scrub smells fabulous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used over the counter body scrubs and even have tried to make a few on my own.</li>
            <li>product and many other cleansing and detoxification products can be found here at Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s website or at Amazon.</li>
            <li>you feel totally clean both inside and outside.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing, and highly moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Most exfoliating products tend to leave my skin a bit dry feeling, but I was pleasantly surprised after using Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s detoxfoliant.</li>
            <li>You can buy the ingredients at any whole food store (essential oils) and the sea salts at Walmart where the salt is located and find many directions for different variations on Pinterest or YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, I really liked the fact that once I rinsed it off a bit and dried my skin, I didn&#x27;t feel oily at all, just moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Many of them are too much or too little of something</li>
            <li>I only have one other salt scrub to compare it to, but I liked the other one better.  </li>
            <li>Although I typically don&#x27;t like the smell of lavender, I received a sample of this lavender/vanilla scrub and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try a different kind when this jar is empty.</li>
            <li>Love the smooth oil that stays behind on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting some more of Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s Detoxfoliant for my future showers!!</li>
            <li>As a devout Kaeng Raeng detox-er, I was super pumped to hear they were coming out with a body line, starting with a scrub.</li>
            <li>My skin stayed soft and smooth the entire day.  </li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers, I&#x27;m conscious of the foods I eat and the products I use.  </li>
            <li>and my skin feels so soft!!</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients really worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been doing Kaeng Raeng cleanses for a while now, so when I learned about their new all natural body line, I was stoked!!</li>
            <li>One facial scrubbing with this was just right.</li>
            <li>However, it did leave my skin smooth and &amp;#34;hydrated&amp;#34; due to the oil(s)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little clumpy like most natural scrubs</li>
            <li>But, the major difference was that my knees and elbows stayed smooth for a long time!</li>
            <li>I even used it on my face and my skin is VERY sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I am typically very sensitive to smells, and this was pleasing to me.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>It is such a relief to find beauty products where all of the ingredients are immediately recognizable.</li>
            <li>that was used in the ingredients,  The oiliness that was felt absorbed into my skin not too long after I toweled</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone wanting a natural way to scrub their way to radiant skin!</li>
            <li>Plus, all natural and organic?!</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural too (and pronounceable!)</li>
            <li>After one use my skin felt refreshed and very soft (NOT raw).</li>
            <li>I use the detoxfoliant both as a general body scrub, but also on my face (love the little cleansing scrub pad that comes with it).</li>
            <li>the new skin with natural oils, without leaving you TOO oily that you have oil stains on your clothes afterwards.</li>
            <li>I get dry skin on my elbows and upper arms and this makes thrm smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>While I dried myself off I also noticed how smooth and soft my skin was.</li>
            <li>As a mature woman of 60+ who has had several skin cancers removed I&#x27;m very selective with skin care</li>
            <li>I like the fragrance and soft emoliant texture.  </li>
            <li>and it works wonders to make the skin soft again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of oil, so it doesn&#x27;t just exfoliate and strip your skin of oils, it deposits natural oils to enhance your skin&#x27;s appearance and texture.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Kaeng Raeng for cleansing my body so it was a natural to want to try their sea salt scrub.  </li>
            <li>All natural ingredients -</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and radiant.  </li>
            <li>After sloughing off the old skin, it manages to moisturize and silk-ify</li>
            <li>A friend recommended that I try Kaeng Raeng Detoxfoliant all natural body scrub.</li>
            <li>Overall, it really works.</li>
            <li>I received the product this summer when the company sent it for free to a few customers to try.</li>
            <li>After rinsing off, my feet were incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I used the scrub in the shower as I was short on time, so I lathered up and let it sit for a couple minutes while I did a gentle scrub in an attempt to get everything off.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m a diehard fan of Lush&#x27;s Ocean Salt...</li>
            <li>other thing is that it makes such a fabulous gift.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed this in my first post-pregnancy bath and it left my skin feeling silky and the subtle  scent refreshed my senses!</li>
            <li>It smells decent in the container, but once you use it it smells different.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this scrub along with the cleanse whenever possible!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really been a huge scrub person, because I&#x27;ve never had issues with dry skin.</li>
            <li>As a long-time KR cleanse customer, I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some of the new skin care products and finally got around to it.  </li>
            <li>It was by no means bad smelling, but I was hoping for more of a light vanilla scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scrub itself is a light pink, reflective of the pink Himalayan sea salt in the scrub.</li>
            <li>Not only does it exfoliate and get rid of dead, dry skin leaving it soft and smooth, but it ALSO moisturizes!</li>
            <li>The only complaint I had about the product was that the smell of the scrub was not my favorite.</li>
            <li>This left my skin feeling so soft!</li>
            <li>I only have time to make 2-3 circular motions before the grit is completely gone.  </li>
            <li>really like that this product has minimal ingredients.</li>
            <li>Skin is left soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Third, I am really excited that there are TWO granule sizes of salt - this means the bigger salts get the rough stuff off, and the very small granules make my skin extra smooth.</li>
            <li>The result...amazingly soft and hydrated skin almost instantly.</li>
            <li>Made with only all-natural ingredients, this scrub leaves your skin soft and supple with no harmful effects to your skin or the environment.</li>
            <li>so using something like a lufa helps you use it to its natural potential.</li>
            <li>I am such a big fan of the cleanse, but sometimes I really feel it in the first few days.</li>
            <li>It did leave my skin feeling ultra-greasy though and really leaves a slick coating on the floor of the tub (be careful not to slip and fall--and warn the next person taking a shower or clean the tub after using it!)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have had difficulty finding an exfoliator that really does the job sloughing the rough callused skin on the feet, and smoothing the coarse skin on the knees and elbows, while also providing moisture to soften the skin, but this product does the trick!  </li>
            <li>The bigger ones get the overall job done, whereas the small ones give you that sparkling clean feeling after exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry to be the first non-5-star review, but I found this scrub to dissolve too quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was immediately excited to read the ingredients on the label of this scrub - there&#x27;s only a small handful, and the list only includes salt, shea butter, and essential oils.</li>
            <li>;, I had to really rinse and rinse to bring down that &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling but the morning after that scrub..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent aside, this body scrub left my skin feeling revitalized and fresh, not super dry as some scrubs do.</li>
            <li>It rinses easily, but leaves behind a moisturizing layer of oil.</li>
            <li>Residue on bottom of shower: This is most definitely a result of my using this on my feet while standing in the shower, but it did make the shower floor a little slick.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Some aspects of the product are very nice, and maybe this is what you are looking for, but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me for the cost ($36.00).  </li>

            <li> Even though it smells nice, I use it at night so that I don&#x27;t smell like flowers during the daytime.  </li>
            <li> I actually really liked this product.</li>
            <li> Best part, the smell is light and clean and not over powering.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft, and the scent is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for so many reasons!&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> In fact, my husband was so impressed with how soft my skin felt, that he asked if he could use it too.  </li>
            <li> First up is the body scrub... who doesn&#x27;t love a good scrub?!  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>

            <li> I love the smell of this scrub, it feels so good and the skin feels so clean</li>
            <li> I have tried and have had enjoyed the Kaeng Rang detox drinks.  </li>
            <li> But I am in love with the scrub.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is made in the US.  </li>
            <li> even when I tried it with no water touching me, it still dissolved almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t find the smell to be particularly appealing</li>
            <li> and I agree with many of the statements of the others about the product.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin soft and smooth, one of the best sea salt scrubs I have tried to date.</li>
            <li> The skin feels smooth and hydrated afterwards to the point that I didn&#x27;t even need to moisturize it!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My only caution is the sea salt stings so don&#x27;t shave before using, lol!!  </li>
            <li> Now I have to keep it away from my girlfriend :)</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the vanilla-lavender fragrance -</li>
            <li> and I love them, as does my daughter who uses a scrub every time she showers.</li>
            <li> I love their products because they have such good ingredients!!</li>
            <li> The scent is so nice and it leaves your skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I too have been enjoying the benefits of the Kaeg Raeng</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great line of body products that use natural ingredients, leave your skin feeling amazing, and not break the bank then</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that my feet were oily and slippery afterwards, but I think that&#x27;s par for the course with most scrubs.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a wonderful product and I look forward to seeing what the rest of the body line has to offer.</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I am definitely satisfied with this sea salt body scrub.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the top layer just doesn&#x27;t want to slough off.</li>
            <li> I have bought too many body scrubs to count, from Bath &amp; Body Works, to the Body Shop, to Origins, and on and on.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing effect is my favorite aspect of this product.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, so good you will be slightly tempted to eat some, and probably could!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is nice, and unique.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product as I make my own sugar scrubs</li>
            <li> I have found you have to use a lot to get the full benefits, but it has a really nice feeling that is not overly greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product out!</li>
            <li> Since I pregnant I wanted something safe and natural and yet effective!!</li>
            <li> The Detoxfoliant does a wonderful job of both exfoliating and moisturizing the skin, so skin is left smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My legs feel fresh and silky, and my bathroom smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is of course my personal view, and I am happy that many others enthusiastically love it.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and radiant my skin is since using the scrub.</li>
            <li> It is super luxurious and it leaves your skin so incredibly silky soft.  </li>
            <li> it smells great, feels light and leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Out of the jar, the scrub isn&#x27;t too greasy or slippery, which makes it really easy to work with.</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of lavender and the feeling of smooth, moisturized skin, you will enjoy this scrub.</li>
            <li> It is so great to know that this product is all natural and chemical free..</li>
            <li> While that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it a great product, it sure does help.</li>
            <li> do appreciate that the ingredients are all-natural and are easily identifiable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This one is made with sea salt which makes my skin feel so smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> First impression: the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the slightly sweet scent and the relaxing lavender.</li>
            <li> This is made of fine sea salt vs course or even an even mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft after using, and retained a light, pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and pure, not like it has a lot of perfumes added to it.</li>
            <li> The exfoliation aspect dilutes away very quickly on the skin so it is basically a rich pomade which I have to hurry to spread around before it rinses away.</li>
            <li> which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li> Since this product is cruelty free, gluten free, non-gmo, AND made in America ...</li>
            <li> I am also on a gluten-free diet, and I appreciate that this product is free of gluten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a free sample size jar for of Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s Detoxfoliant for review and was not monetarily compensated for my review.</li>
            <li> This scrub makes my skin feel so creamy and smooth after each use.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hydrate and smooth my skin as well as this product.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing to do is use it right before bed so that the shea butter has plenty of time to soak into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely will be buying more!!</li>
            <li> No artificial perfume smell lingering around - smells light and clean!</li>
            <li> I liked this product generally speaking and love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> The scrub left my skin feeling incredibly moisturized for 3 days after my first use.  </li>
            <li> Two days later, and my legs are still feeling wonderfully hydrated, and the dull appearance of my skin has greatly improved.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell like heaven, but it smooths on the skin nicely and works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This body scrub is fantastically better than many other body scrubs that I have tried and it is much more affordable!</li>
            <li> However, even if you&#x27;re not on a cleanse, this is a great product to combine once or twice a week with dry brushing.</li>
            <li> KR detoxfoliant did a marvelous job to remove the dead cells exposing fresh skin.</li>
            <li> this is going to be something special.</li>
            <li> This product is natural and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This lavender-vanilla body scrub exceeded my expectations by leaving my skin full of moisture.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating granules are actually salt crystals in different sizes, which has a great exfoliating power!</li>
            <li> I LOVE bath products, but over the years I have become more conscientious of not only what I put IN my body, but also what I put ON my body.</li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff smell great, it makes being ready a lot faster.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> Over the past year I have become more aware of the products I use on my body and the things I put in my body, so I was thrilled to hear about Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s newest product and even more excited to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and unlike other scrubs, it disolves easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a gritty feel to your skin.  </li>
            <li> The scrub has a light lavender scent with a hint of vanilla (once I&#x27;m dry - which I love!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review the morning after use, and my skin is super soft and smooth still!  </li>
            <li> Your whole body will be smooth and beach-ready after use of this scrub.  </li>
            <li> cleanse for a few years, and this is a great complement to it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I love that it is completely all natural.</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed using this scrub and left my skin nice and soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural and I am not adding any toxins to my body.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a citrus lavender smell that is fresh and intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would make my skin react.</li>
            <li> A product doesn&#x27;t get much more natural than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having made several of my own salt scrubs &amp; being knowledgeable on how to make salt scrubs, I would not buy this product.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and leaves you feeling very natural and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> The full size comes with a scooper for application, which would certainly be easier than using your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see whats next for Kaeng Raeng, especially if it means more Lavender Vanilla scented products :).</li>
            <li> It is so good to know I am only applying natural ingredients on my body.</li>
            <li> I think this had a nice mix of the salt/scrub texture with enough moisture to be able to scoop it out of the container without it being dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> But the oils remained so my skin was super soft - just not as soft as it could have been with a better exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> So excited for this new line.</li>
            <li> and I feel ready for the day!  </li>
            <li> First time using it</li>
            <li> At first, I thought maybe I was under the water</li>
            <li> That is why I gave three stars (&amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> Everyone is different and everyone deserves to find skin products they love.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely heavenly!</li>
            <li> my skin is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> What a smooth, natural product.</li>
            <li> The scrub itself is thick and had great texture.  </li>
            <li> The varying sizes of the salt really make a difference!</li>
            <li> I waited until I was one week in to a 14-day detox before my first use and between my detox and the Detoxfoliant</li>
            <li> I am an AVID lotion user after showers, but not after using Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s Detoxfoliant.</li>
            <li> I love the new Kaeng Raeng Detoxfoliant Natural Sea Salt Body Scrub.</li>
            <li> For this reason, this may feel too heavy in the summer time - but would be perfect for dry, winter skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin so smooth and now I feel dry when I don&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using it the night before an event so the moisturizers can soak in overnight on the fresh skin surface.</li>
            <li> Unlike other, similar products this has a more mild (pleasing) scent and the grain is more gentle which I really like for every-day use.</li>
            <li> I loved this body scrub, use it primarily on feet, elbows, and other dry skin areas</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved that I didn&#x27;t even need to apply lotion for a few days after using it!</li>
            <li> I tend to break out really easily on my chest and back, but I didn&#x27;t with this body scrub.</li>
            <li> I first used it as a scrub in my shower and it left my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scrub is marketed as an enhancement to the company&#x27;s cleanse, and exfoliation can certainly help the detox process.</li>
            <li> Most exfoliators leave my skin dry and tight, but this one does an amazing job at exfoliating AND hydrating the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my skin SUPER soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I used this to do a little detoxifying lymphatic massage on days 1 and 2, and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this scrub and found it works very well and leaves your skin extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> The lavender vanilla scent is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I really like this product..</li>
            <li> This summer, no parchment thanks to Kaeng Raeng scrub.</li>
            <li> Yes, I suppose I did, but really, it&#x27;s out of this world.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thanks to all of the natural ingredients in this product, my skin feels so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Now, he loves using it as much as I do!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> the smell is intoxicating and the results are intense.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using it with a lufa or some type of rag to maximize how much you can spread it.</li>
            <li> It felt really</li>
            <li> I am also picky and sensitive to scents (especially now during pregnancy) and the scrub smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used over the counter body scrubs and even have tried to make a few on my own.</li>
            <li> product and many other cleansing and detoxification products can be found here at Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s website or at Amazon.</li>
            <li> you feel totally clean both inside and outside.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing, and highly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Most exfoliating products tend to leave my skin a bit dry feeling, but I was pleasantly surprised after using Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s detoxfoliant.</li>
            <li> You can buy the ingredients at any whole food store (essential oils) and the sea salts at Walmart where the salt is located and find many directions for different variations on Pinterest or YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, I really liked the fact that once I rinsed it off a bit and dried my skin, I didn&#x27;t feel oily at all, just moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Many of them are too much or too little of something</li>
            <li> I only have one other salt scrub to compare it to, but I liked the other one better.  </li>
            <li> Although I typically don&#x27;t like the smell of lavender, I received a sample of this lavender/vanilla scrub and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try a different kind when this jar is empty.</li>
            <li> Love the smooth oil that stays behind on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be getting some more of Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s Detoxfoliant for my future showers!!</li>
            <li> As a devout Kaeng Raeng detox-er, I was super pumped to hear they were coming out with a body line, starting with a scrub.</li>
            <li> My skin stayed soft and smooth the entire day.  </li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I&#x27;m conscious of the foods I eat and the products I use.  </li>
            <li> and my skin feels so soft!!</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients really worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been doing Kaeng Raeng cleanses for a while now, so when I learned about their new all natural body line, I was stoked!!</li>
            <li> One facial scrubbing with this was just right.</li>
            <li> However, it did leave my skin smooth and &amp;#34;hydrated&amp;#34; due to the oil(s)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little clumpy like most natural scrubs</li>
            <li> But, the major difference was that my knees and elbows stayed smooth for a long time!</li>
            <li> I even used it on my face and my skin is VERY sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I am typically very sensitive to smells, and this was pleasing to me.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It is such a relief to find beauty products where all of the ingredients are immediately recognizable.</li>
            <li> that was used in the ingredients,  The oiliness that was felt absorbed into my skin not too long after I toweled</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone wanting a natural way to scrub their way to radiant skin!</li>
            <li> Plus, all natural and organic?!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural too (and pronounceable!)</li>
            <li> After one use my skin felt refreshed and very soft (NOT raw).</li>
            <li> I use the detoxfoliant both as a general body scrub, but also on my face (love the little cleansing scrub pad that comes with it).</li>
            <li> the new skin with natural oils, without leaving you TOO oily that you have oil stains on your clothes afterwards.</li>
            <li> I get dry skin on my elbows and upper arms and this makes thrm smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> While I dried myself off I also noticed how smooth and soft my skin was.</li>
            <li> As a mature woman of 60+ who has had several skin cancers removed I&#x27;m very selective with skin care</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance and soft emoliant texture.  </li>
            <li> and it works wonders to make the skin soft again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of oil, so it doesn&#x27;t just exfoliate and strip your skin of oils, it deposits natural oils to enhance your skin&#x27;s appearance and texture.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Kaeng Raeng for cleansing my body so it was a natural to want to try their sea salt scrub.  </li>
            <li> All natural ingredients -</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and radiant.  </li>
            <li> After sloughing off the old skin, it manages to moisturize and silk-ify</li>
            <li> A friend recommended that I try Kaeng Raeng Detoxfoliant all natural body scrub.</li>
            <li> Overall, it really works.</li>
            <li> I received the product this summer when the company sent it for free to a few customers to try.</li>
            <li> After rinsing off, my feet were incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I used the scrub in the shower as I was short on time, so I lathered up and let it sit for a couple minutes while I did a gentle scrub in an attempt to get everything off.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m a diehard fan of Lush&#x27;s Ocean Salt...</li>
            <li> other thing is that it makes such a fabulous gift.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed this in my first post-pregnancy bath and it left my skin feeling silky and the subtle  scent refreshed my senses!</li>
            <li> It smells decent in the container, but once you use it it smells different.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this scrub along with the cleanse whenever possible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a huge scrub person, because I&#x27;ve never had issues with dry skin.</li>
            <li> As a long-time KR cleanse customer, I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some of the new skin care products and finally got around to it.  </li>
            <li> It was by no means bad smelling, but I was hoping for more of a light vanilla scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scrub itself is a light pink, reflective of the pink Himalayan sea salt in the scrub.</li>
            <li> Not only does it exfoliate and get rid of dead, dry skin leaving it soft and smooth, but it ALSO moisturizes!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I had about the product was that the smell of the scrub was not my favorite.</li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling so soft!</li>
            <li> I only have time to make 2-3 circular motions before the grit is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> really like that this product has minimal ingredients.</li>
            <li> Skin is left soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Third, I am really excited that there are TWO granule sizes of salt - this means the bigger salts get the rough stuff off, and the very small granules make my skin extra smooth.</li>
            <li> The result...amazingly soft and hydrated skin almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Made with only all-natural ingredients, this scrub leaves your skin soft and supple with no harmful effects to your skin or the environment.</li>
            <li> so using something like a lufa helps you use it to its natural potential.</li>
            <li> I am such a big fan of the cleanse, but sometimes I really feel it in the first few days.</li>
            <li> It did leave my skin feeling ultra-greasy though and really leaves a slick coating on the floor of the tub (be careful not to slip and fall--and warn the next person taking a shower or clean the tub after using it!)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have had difficulty finding an exfoliator that really does the job sloughing the rough callused skin on the feet, and smoothing the coarse skin on the knees and elbows, while also providing moisture to soften the skin, but this product does the trick!  </li>
            <li> The bigger ones get the overall job done, whereas the small ones give you that sparkling clean feeling after exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to be the first non-5-star review, but I found this scrub to dissolve too quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was immediately excited to read the ingredients on the label of this scrub - there&#x27;s only a small handful, and the list only includes salt, shea butter, and essential oils.</li>
            <li> ;, I had to really rinse and rinse to bring down that &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling but the morning after that scrub..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent aside, this body scrub left my skin feeling revitalized and fresh, not super dry as some scrubs do.</li>
            <li> It rinses easily, but leaves behind a moisturizing layer of oil.</li>
            <li> Residue on bottom of shower: This is most definitely a result of my using this on my feet while standing in the shower, but it did make the shower floor a little slick.  </li>
            <li> Due to it being natural</li>
            <li> It made me a little bit nervous when I first tried it because the failed quickly dissolve and it feels like oil on your skin.</li>
            <li> Sometimes exfoliants leave my skin dry, but this product is the opposite--</li>
            <li> I started using it on some areas of dry skin I have on my arms and noticed a big difference.  </li>
            <li> and I only got a minimal scrub.  </li>
            <li> My wife started using this scrub a few weeks ago, and I noticed how soft her skin felt.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is different from other scrubs I&#x27;ve used in that the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; component melts away as you scrub.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it has taken me do long to write this review!</li>
            <li> My skin was soft, which usually happens with salt scrubs that I use.</li>
            <li> The ingrown hairs I occasionally get on my legs are few and far between, and I&#x27;m seeing less blackheads around my nose too!</li>
            <li> Next time I use this on my feet I will be sitting down to avoid this problem in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If a little bit went a long way in the shower that would be different, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Another perk is that KR&#x27;s product is a few dollars less than Lush&#x27;s product!  </li>
            <li> I used this on my rough elbows and on the bottoms of my feet where my skin has been particularly dry this summer.  </li>
            <li> I used it up at our cabin where the air is very dry</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s saying something as my hands are quite rough.  </li>
            <li> My calluses are faded and not as rough anymore.</li>
            <li> With the other one, at least I felt like I was getting enough exfoliation benefits before I was left with just the oil.  </li>
            <li> I found you could use it sparingly as a little went a long way.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer who described that the exfoliation dissolves too rapidly.</li>
            <li> There was no irritation; that had been a problem when I used other products.</li>
            <li> In the past after using body scrubs, my skin started to dry out and loose</li>
            <li> just wish they&#x27;d tone down the oil a bit...</li>
            <li> It is dry and I even have small bumps on my arms that just won&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li> This is a salt scrub and there is hardly any salt in it, not enough to slough off the dead skin at all.</li>
            <li> Slight medicinal smell</li>
            <li> I am now a convert and will definitely be using this at least twice a week!</li>
            <li> I have used this scrub every other day for the past four days, and on the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; days, my elbows and feet still feel moisturized and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not found a scrub that combines the two effectively - it is usually one or the other.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no dripping through your fingers, so no product wasted.</li>
            <li> and I end up throwing them away after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> it is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I usually drown myself in lotion after a shower, but I didn&#x27;t feel the need to do that after using this scrub.  </li>
            <li> My skin was well hydrated, but not overwhelmingly oily.  </li>
            <li> This is not a dissuasion for me - growing up on the beach and constantly being in salt-water, we welcomed that feeling, knowing it was cleaning our skin of gross crap and disinfecting it.</li>
            <li> This feeling does not bother me in the least bit, but some people might want to be informed of that beforehand.</li>
            <li> However, my feet lately have been looking grosser and grosser.</li>
            <li> I just think it is too expensive for what it is.  </li>
            <li> i am always skeptical about body scrubs.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with the Detoxfoliant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> Whenever a bad day is upon me I can go into the shower and feel like I am at the spa.  </li>
            <li> I will give anything a try once, but when something smells bad</li>
            <li> (my daughter said it smelled disgusting).  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried and have had enjoyed the Kaeng Rang detox drinks.  But I am in love with the scrub.  Whenever a bad day is upon me I can go into the shower and feel like I am at the spa.  I love that it is all natural and I am not adding any toxins to my body.  I love that it is made in the US.  It makes my skin feel so soft, and the scent is wonderful.  My bathroom smells like a spa and I feel ready for the day!  Now, I will try the glow for my face!</li>
            <li> I love this scrub! First time using it and my skin feels so soft!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to be the first non-5-star review, but I found this scrub to dissolve too quickly.  I only have time to make 2-3 circular motions before the grit is completely gone.  At first, I thought maybe I was under the water and it was rinsing off, but even when I tried it with no water touching me, it still dissolved almost immediately.  I only have one other salt scrub to compare it to, but I liked the other one better.  With the other one, at least I felt like I was getting enough exfoliation benefits before I was left with just the oil.  Also, I don&#x27;t find the smell to be particularly appealing (my daughter said it smelled disgusting).  I would compare it to the smell of the inside of a plastic bottle.  I&#x27;ll try a different kind when this jar is empty.</li>
            <li> Excellent scrub! Makes your skin very smooth and beautiful!</li>
            <li> As a Kaeng Raeng cleanse devotee, I was sent my a sample of this scrub through the company&#x27;s Ambassador Program.&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t tried any of their skin products, but I was just as impressed with this side of the brand as I am with their cleanse program.&lt;br /&gt;The scrub has a great smell and, more importantly, the texture was perfect. Out of the jar, the scrub isn&#x27;t too greasy or slippery, which makes it really easy to work with. There&#x27;s no dripping through your fingers, so no product wasted. It heats up as your exfoliating and leave behind a really smooth but not oily feeling. The salt grit isn&#x27;t too coarse which makes the exfoliation noticeable, but not too aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;Top notch ingredients make this product good for your skin on all levels. I would totally purchase a full-size product when I finish my current product.</li>
            <li> I liked this product generally speaking and love the way it makes my skin feel. I bought it based on the excellent recommendations and I agree with many of the statements of the others about the product. I like the fragrance and soft emoliant texture.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again though because of the price. I just think it is too expensive for what it is.  If a little bit went a long way in the shower that would be different, but it doesn&#x27;t. The exfoliation aspect dilutes away very quickly on the skin so it is basically a rich pomade which I have to hurry to spread around before it rinses away. That is why I gave three stars (&amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34;).  Some aspects of the product are very nice, and maybe this is what you are looking for, but this just didn&#x27;t do it for me for the cost ($36.00).  I agree with the other reviewer who described that the exfoliation dissolves too rapidly. This is of course my personal view, and I am happy that many others enthusiastically love it. Everyone is different and everyone deserves to find skin products they love. This one just wasn&#x27;t it for me.</li>
            <li> It is such a relief to find beauty products where all of the ingredients are immediately recognizable. I loved this body scrub, use it primarily on feet, elbows, and other dry skin areas and it works wonders to make the skin soft again. It smells wonderful, so good you will be slightly tempted to eat some, and probably could!</li>
            <li> I love a good body scrub. This one is made with sea salt which makes my skin feel so smooth and clean! The lavender and vanilla scent is nice.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;It makes your skin soft and smooth, one of the best sea salt scrubs I have tried to date. And the smell is wonderful and its not full of any harmful chemicals, and completely great for your skin!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for so many reasons!&lt;br /&gt;1) When looking at the ingredients list, you can not only pronounce all the ingredients, but you know them as well!&lt;br /&gt;2) The exfoliating granules are actually salt crystals in different sizes, which has a great exfoliating power! The bigger ones get the overall job done, whereas the small ones give you that sparkling clean feeling after exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;3) The smell is absolutely heavenly! It&#x27;s a citrus lavender smell that is fresh and intriguing.&lt;br /&gt;4) The scrub is incredibly hydrating! The skin feels smooth and hydrated afterwards to the point that I didn&#x27;t even need to moisturize it! Most exfoliators leave my skin dry and tight, but this one does an amazing job at exfoliating AND hydrating the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all comes together to reveal beautiful glowing and healthy skin! I use the scrub once a week on my body, and once or twice on my face. I could not be happier with this product! It&#x27;s definitely a must have product!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and wasn&#x27;t sure how this product would make my skin react. It actually calms my skin despite the several different types of salt. When I use it after shaving it tingles but appears to have healing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that this product has minimal ingredients. I can pronounce and recognize all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using, my skin feels hydrated and the oils are just enough without making my skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this scrub and found it works very well and leaves your skin extremely smooth. The lavender vanilla scent is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with it, is that I felt it was a bit too oily after rinsing...almost like  &amp;#34;baby oil&amp;#34;, I had to really rinse and rinse to bring down that &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling but the morning after that scrub..my skin is so smooth and soft. I really like this product..just wish they&#x27;d tone down the oil a bit...</li>
            <li> I love this product. The smell and texture are amazing. I get dry skin on my elbows and upper arms and this makes thrm smooth and moisturized. I highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample size of this product for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this scrub! I was immediately excited to read the ingredients on the label of this scrub - there&#x27;s only a small handful, and the list only includes salt, shea butter, and essential oils. A product doesn&#x27;t get much more natural than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice, and unique. The scrub itself is a light pink, reflective of the pink Himalayan sea salt in the scrub. The full size comes with a scooper for application, which would certainly be easier than using your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is different from other scrubs I&#x27;ve used in that the &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; component melts away as you scrub. It rinses easily, but leaves behind a moisturizing layer of oil. For this reason, this may feel too heavy in the summer time - but would be perfect for dry, winter skin. I don&#x27;t even feel the need for lotion after using this, which is amazing for an exfoliating product. My skin felt soft after using, and retained a light, pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scrub is marketed as an enhancement to the company&#x27;s cleanse, and exfoliation can certainly help the detox process. However, even if you&#x27;re not on a cleanse, this is a great product to combine once or twice a week with dry brushing.</li>
            <li> My husband got me this scrub, and it&#x27;s AWESOME! My skin is so smooth after I use it. It&#x27;s like having a luxury spa scrub at home. It makes a great gift! Try it and you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells divine. Very relaxing, and highly moisturizing. Didn&#x27;t even have to lotion up the next morning! Loved it.</li>
            <li> i am always skeptical about body scrubs. They are either too gritty or don&#x27;t seem to wash off well. So I was hesitant to try Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s body scrub. But I am so happy I did! The scrub actually seems to &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34; as you are scrubbing it into your body. I have red bumps on the backs of my arms and they actually smoothed out it was so nice to touch my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to the scrub was the bottom of my shower was tacky. Nothing cleaning it didn&#x27;t take care of.&lt;br /&gt;After trying this body scrub I am now a convert and will definitely be using this at least twice a week!</li>
            <li> As soon as I used the body scrub my skin instantly felt smoother. It&#x27;s made of oil, so it doesn&#x27;t just exfoliate and strip your skin of oils, it deposits natural oils to enhance your skin&#x27;s appearance and texture.  The detoxfoliant has also helped to extend the life of my tan.  It also smells wonderful. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Kaeng Raeng for cleansing my body so it was a natural to want to try their sea salt scrub.  I LOVE this stuff.  It smells wonderful and unlike other scrubs, it disolves easily and doesn&#x27;t leave a gritty feel to your skin.  Skin is left soft and moisturized.  I used it up at our cabin where the air is very dry and my skin becomes parchment-like.  This summer, no parchment thanks to Kaeng Raeng scrub.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Smells awesome!  Feels awesome!  I even used it on my face and my skin is VERY sensitive.  It did not make my skin red at all.  My only caution is the sea salt stings so don&#x27;t shave before using, lol!!  Love the smooth oil that stays behind on your skin.  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> As a long-time KR cleanse customer, I&#x27;ve been wanting to try some of the new skin care products and finally got around to it.  First up is the body scrub... who doesn&#x27;t love a good scrub?!  This one smells wonderful and the size of the salt grains are perfect.  I love the natural ingredients and it smells great!  The only downside was that I used this while standing in the shower.  The warm water immediately dissolved the salt and I only got a minimal scrub.  But the oils remained so my skin was super soft - just not as soft as it could have been with a better exfoliation.  Lesson learned: do this pedi-style and out of/prior to/just after your shower.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and it is really good.  It smells wonderful and it did a really good job making my hands feel softer and smoother --- and that&#x27;s saying something as my hands are quite rough.  Even 6 hours later I notice the difference.  Bonus - I found you could use it sparingly as a little went a long way.  Now I have to keep it away from my girlfriend :)</li>
            <li> Although I typically don&#x27;t like the smell of lavender, I received a sample of this lavender/vanilla scrub and I love it. It wasn&#x27;t overpowering like some are.&lt;br /&gt;Scent aside, this body scrub left my skin feeling revitalized and fresh, not super dry as some scrubs do. Since this product is cruelty free, gluten free, non-gmo, AND made in America ... I would totally recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This body scrub is one of my favorites.  I will list out the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Scent:  I enjoyed the vanilla-lavender fragrance - it is soothing and calming, and not overpowering.  I am typically very sensitive to smells, and this was pleasing to me.&lt;br /&gt;2. Texture/Consistency:  I think this had a nice mix of the salt/scrub texture with enough moisture to be able to scoop it out of the container without it being dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;3. Effectiveness:  I used this on my rough elbows and on the bottoms of my feet where my skin has been particularly dry this summer.  In two uses, I can tell a difference on my elbows and feet.  I have used this scrub every other day for the past four days, and on the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; days, my elbows and feet still feel moisturized and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Recipe: All natural ingredients - what&#x27;s not to like?!  I am also on a gluten-free diet, and I appreciate that this product is free of gluten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Slight medicinal smell - I didn&#x27;t find this offensive, but I could see where others might be put off by this factor.&lt;br /&gt;2. Residue on bottom of shower: This is most definitely a result of my using this on my feet while standing in the shower, but it did make the shower floor a little slick.  Next time I use this on my feet I will be sitting down to avoid this problem in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product, and recommend it if you are looking for an effective and all-natural scrub.  I was provided a sample of this product for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample size jar for of Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s Detoxfoliant for review and was not monetarily compensated for my review. I was excited to try this product as I make my own sugar scrubs and I love them, as does my daughter who uses a scrub every time she showers. After I cleansed myself and rinsed the soap off, I used the Detoxfoliant all over, I immediately noticed that I loved the smell, a nice blend of lavender and vanilla. Lavender is known to soothe the skin and the smell can put you in a relaxed state, Vanilla has antioxidant properties that make this scrub a pleasant experience. While I dried myself off I also noticed how smooth and soft my skin was. I noticed throughout the day that I could still feel the oils on my skin, it was not greasy either and when I got up the next morning I could still feel it. So for a product that lasts like that is ok in my book!!! I will definitely be getting some more of Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s Detoxfoliant for my future showers!! Go get some for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;This product and many other cleansing and detoxification products can be found here at Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s website or at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this scrub, it feels so good and the skin feels so clean and it glows. I love their products because they have such good ingredients!!</li>
            <li> Smelled awesome, and I love that it&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of lavender and the feeling of smooth, moisturized skin, you will enjoy this scrub. I have found you have to use a lot to get the full benefits, but it has a really nice feeling that is not overly greasy or oily. Do not use it after shaving because it burns!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! The Detoxfoliant does a wonderful job of both exfoliating and moisturizing the skin, so skin is left smooth and hydrated. Additionally, the fragrance is lovely--a lavender vanilla scent that provides a spa-like experience in your home; it truly soothes and relaxes.  I especially like the fact that this scrub is made of only all-natural ingredients:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have had difficulty finding an exfoliator that really does the job sloughing the rough callused skin on the feet, and smoothing the coarse skin on the knees and elbows, while also providing moisture to soften the skin, but this product does the trick!  Your whole body will be smooth and beach-ready after use of this scrub.  Nurture yourself and give it a try with confidence; you will be so glad you did!</li>
            <li> wholly s***! this stuff is AMAZING!! Not only does it smell like heaven, but it smooths on the skin nicely and works great on my sensitive skin. Did I mention the smell? Yes, I suppose I did, but really, it&#x27;s out of this world. I couldn&#x27;t be happier, and will definitely be a return customer.</li>
            <li> The smell is vanilla lavender .... I personally don&#x27;t think these two smells mesh well together.  It smells decent in the container, but once you use it it smells different.  I did follow the directions and stir it (with my finger) before use.  I also like my scrubs a bit grittier.  This is made of fine sea salt vs course or even an even mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having made several of my own salt scrubs &amp; being knowledgeable on how to make salt scrubs, I would not buy this product.  You can buy the ingredients at any whole food store (essential oils) and the sea salts at Walmart where the salt is located and find many directions for different variations on Pinterest or YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it do it&#x27;s job? Eh.  As I stated before, I like my scrubs grittier.  However, it did leave my skin smooth and &amp;#34;hydrated&amp;#34; due to the oil(s) that was used in the ingredients,  The oiliness that was felt absorbed into my skin not too long after I toweled dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this? No, but that&#x27;s only because I know how to make these to my tastes.  If you don&#x27;t want to make one or just don&#x27;t feel like it and you like a finer body scrub that smells like vanilla and lavender (which is good for sleeping) then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I love the new Kaeng Raeng Detoxfoliant Natural Sea Salt Body Scrub. The scent is so nice and it leaves your skin so smooth. It is so great to know that this product is all natural and chemical free..</li>
            <li> Love it! As soon as you open the jar you know this is going to be something special. The smell is amazing while also not overpowering your senses. After one use my skin felt refreshed and very soft (NOT raw). A wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I too have been enjoying the benefits of the Kaeg Raeng cleanse for a few years, and this is a great complement to it.  It is so good to know I am only applying natural ingredients on my body. Sometimes exfoliants leave my skin dry, but this product is the opposite--it smells great, feels light and leaves my skin so soft. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product out! I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on all different kinds of brands. Thanks to all of the natural ingredients in this product, my skin feels so smooth and soft it is unbelievable. This body scrub is fantastically better than many other body scrubs that I have tried and it is much more affordable! If you are looking for a great line of body products that use natural ingredients, leave your skin feeling amazing, and not break the bank then Kaeng Raeng is the perfect place!</li>
            <li> This scrub rocks my world.  It&#x27;s nothing but the best ingredients (as you would expect from a Kaeng Raeng product).  Like many of the other reviewers, I&#x27;m conscious of the foods I eat and the products I use.  When I found out Kaeng Raeng was making bath and body products I was ecstatic.  I know how dedicated this company is to making the best cleanses with the freshest, all-natural, organic ingredients.  The Detoxfoliant is just as awesome - it&#x27;s the perfect bath/shower product.  It makes my skin so soft and radiant.  And the lavender-vanilla fragrance is just incredible.  My favorite thing to do is use it right before bed so that the shea butter has plenty of time to soak into my skin.  The lavender-vanilla smell is so soothing to help me fall asleep.  In fact, my husband was so impressed with how soft my skin felt, that he asked if he could use it too.  Now, he loves using it as much as I do!&lt;br /&gt;The other thing is that it makes such a fabulous gift.  It&#x27;s such a wonderful product at a great price point.  I bought a few jars at once and have them in the closet already wrapped and ready to go.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with the Detoxfoliant.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scrub! Since I pregnant I wanted something safe and natural and yet effective!! It exceeded my expectations! I love how smooth and radiant my skin is since using the scrub. I am also picky and sensitive to scents (especially now during pregnancy) and the scrub smells fabulous! I love the slightly sweet scent and the relaxing lavender. Would recommend to anyone wanting a natural way to scrub their way to radiant skin!</li>
            <li> I have been doing Kaeng Raeng cleanses for a while now, so when I learned about their new all natural body line, I was stoked!! I use the detoxfoliant both as a general body scrub, but also on my face (love the little cleansing scrub pad that comes with it). The ingrown hairs I occasionally get on my legs are few and far between, and I&#x27;m seeing less blackheads around my nose too! I wish the body scrub was around before my wedding so my skin would&#x27;ve looked even better! So excited for this new line.</li>
            <li> I really liked the smell and texture of the scrub.  I don&#x27;t like that my feet were oily and slippery afterwards, but I think that&#x27;s par for the course with most scrubs.</li>
            <li> This scrub means business...the smell is intoxicating and the results are intense. My legs feel fresh and silky, and my bathroom smells amazing. I&#x27;m excited to see whats next for Kaeng Raeng, especially if it means more Lavender Vanilla scented products :).</li>
            <li> As a devout Kaeng Raeng detox-er, I was super pumped to hear they were coming out with a body line, starting with a scrub. Let&#x27;s just start with the ingredient list: not only can I pronounce everything, but I also know what everything is. You could practically eat this stuff. I LOVE bath products, but over the years I have become more conscientious of not only what I put IN my body, but also what I put ON my body. I have no guilt or fears when using this detoxfoliant. Second, the smell is divine. While that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it a great product, it sure does help. Third, I am really excited that there are TWO granule sizes of salt - this means the bigger salts get the rough stuff off, and the very small granules make my skin extra smooth. I&#x27;ve not found a scrub that combines the two effectively - it is usually one or the other. After sloughing off the old skin, it manages to moisturize and silk-ify the new skin with natural oils, without leaving you TOO oily that you have oil stains on your clothes afterwards. The only thing about this scrub that some people may not like is that, yes, it is made with salt - which will burn open cuts for like .01 seconds. This is not a dissuasion for me - growing up on the beach and constantly being in salt-water, we welcomed that feeling, knowing it was cleaning our skin of gross crap and disinfecting it. This feeling does not bother me in the least bit, but some people might want to be informed of that beforehand. Overall this is a wonderful product and I look forward to seeing what the rest of the body line has to offer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used salt and sugar scrubs that are all-natural from several different companies over the years. This is not my favorite. This is a salt scrub and there is hardly any salt in it, not enough to slough off the dead skin at all. It did leave my skin feeling ultra-greasy though and really leaves a slick coating on the floor of the tub (be careful not to slip and fall--and warn the next person taking a shower or clean the tub after using it!)&lt;br /&gt;This is also supposed to be a lavender vanilla scent but mine smells like all lavender. I like lavender and vanilla together, but not lavender alone.&lt;br /&gt;I do appreciate that the ingredients are all-natural and are easily identifiable.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used over the counter body scrubs and even have tried to make a few on my own. A friend recommended that I try Kaeng Raeng Detoxfoliant all natural body scrub. She said that the \\&quot;No preservatives, No Parabens, No Chemicals, Nothing artificial\\&quot; scrub is a MUST try and I am SO happy I did! In the past after using body scrubs, my skin started to dry out and loose it&#x27;s radiance. This lavender-vanilla body scrub exceeded my expectations by leaving my skin full of moisture. The scrub has a light lavender scent with a hint of vanilla (once I&#x27;m dry - which I love!). No artificial perfume smell lingering around - smells light and clean! I am definitely satisfied with this sea salt body scrub. I give it 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> My wife started using this scrub a few weeks ago, and I noticed how soft her skin felt.  I started using it on some areas of dry skin I have on my arms and noticed a big difference.  My wife says that my &amp;#34;gator-skin&amp;#34; is gone.  Even though it smells nice, I use it at night so that I don&#x27;t smell like flowers during the daytime.  Overall, it really works.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked this product. It made me a little bit nervous when I first tried it because the failed quickly dissolve and it feels like oil on your skin. I tend to break out really easily on my chest and back, but I didn&#x27;t with this body scrub. In fact, I really liked the fact that once I rinsed it off a bit and dried my skin, I didn&#x27;t feel oily at all, just moisturizer! I absolutely loved that I didn&#x27;t even need to apply lotion for a few days after using it! Not only does this stuff smell great, it makes being ready a lot faster. I love it!</li>
            <li> This detoxfoliant is AMAZING. I cannot believe it has taken me do long to write this review! I received the product this summer when the company sent it for free to a few customers to try. How amazing is that?! I tried it immediately knowing it would be great having tried and loved their smoothies. The result...amazingly soft and hydrated skin almost instantly. I love this product and I love that it is completely all natural. Great addition to the kaeng raeng family. Definitely a must try.</li>
            <li> As a mature woman of 60+ who has had several skin cancers removed I&#x27;m very selective with skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The KR detoxfoliant did a marvelous job to remove the dead cells exposing fresh skin. There was no irritation; that had been a problem when I used other products. I highly recommend using it the night before an event so the moisturizers can soak in overnight on the fresh skin surface. Sublime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I occasionally apply Retin A on my face to peel the damaged surface layer of skin and help rejuvinate under layers. Sometimes the top layer just doesn&#x27;t want to slough off. One facial scrubbing with this was just right. You can especially tell that the Shea butter moisturizers are not diluted. What a smooth, natural product. Just loved the experience and the results!</li>
            <li> Kaeng Raeng Detoxfoliant Natural Sea Salt Body Scrub is one of the best, if not the best scrubs on the market. Made with only all-natural ingredients, this scrub leaves your skin soft and supple with no harmful effects to your skin or the environment. Use daily or as often as needed to rejuvenate and revive your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed! My skin stayed soft and smooth the entire day.  Getting this for everyone for Christmas!!!! This product is natural and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin so smooth and now I feel dry when I don&#x27;t use it! Plus, all natural and organic?! Doesn&#x27;t get much better than that!</li>
            <li> The Kaeng Raeng Detoxfoliant body scrub was divine! The natural ingredients really worked wonders on my skin. I used this on my legs just prior to shaving, and I have never had smoother skin. Two days later, and my legs are still feeling wonderfully hydrated, and the dull appearance of my skin has greatly improved. The only complaint I had about the product was that the smell of the scrub was not my favorite. It was by no means bad smelling, but I was hoping for more of a light vanilla scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad I was given the opportunity to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> I just got this body scrub and the minute I opened it, I loved it.  It smells sooo good.  Like a vanilla creamsicle or an orange julius.  You just want to eat it!  The smell is great, but that&#x27;s just the beginning.  Using this product has that spa-like feeling we are always searching for in our bath and body purchases.  I have bought too many body scrubs to count, from Bath &amp; Body Works, to the Body Shop, to Origins, and on and on.  Many of them are too much or too little of something and I end up throwing them away after a few uses.  Not this one.  The scrub itself is thick and had great texture.  It is super luxurious and it leaves your skin so incredibly silky soft.  Do yourself a favor and order this!  You won&#x27;t regret it.  I look forward to using it every time I get in the shower.</li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling so soft! The smell is wonderful. It is easy to apply and leaves you feeling very natural and fresh afterwards. Apply some to part of your skin and then feel the parts where you didn&#x27;t apply it. You will definitely feel a difference. I would recommend using it with a lufa or some type of rag to maximize how much you can spread it. Due to it being natural it&#x27;s a little clumpy like most natural scrubs so using something like a lufa helps you use it to its natural potential. Definitely will be buying more!!</li>
            <li> I am such a big fan of this scrub! It smells amazing and pure, not like it has a lot of perfumes added to it. I first used it as a scrub in my shower and it left my skin really smooth. The varying sizes of the salt really make a difference! My skin was soft, which usually happens with salt scrubs that I use. But, the major difference was that my knees and elbows stayed smooth for a long time! It felt really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I used the scrub in conjunction with my Kaeng Raeng cleanse. I am such a big fan of the cleanse, but sometimes I really feel it in the first few days. I used this to do a little detoxifying lymphatic massage on days 1 and 2, and it was amazing. I did not feel any detoxifying side effects at all! I highly recommend using this scrub along with the cleanse whenever possible! And, they are both vegan which is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I got this scrub to review courtesy of Kaeng Raeng. I&#x27;ve never really been a huge scrub person, because I&#x27;ve never had issues with dry skin. However, my feet lately have been looking grosser and grosser. I used this scrub after my shower and rubbed it in for about five minutes. First impression: the scent is amazing. I could have stayed in there forever. The ingredients are all natural too (and pronounceable!) which is a huge plus. After rinsing off, my feet were incredibly soft. I&#x27;ve since used this 3x on my feet and they feel so much better! My calluses are faded and not as rough anymore. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of lavender and vanilla! Smells like being at a spa. Really enjoyed using this scrub and left my skin nice and soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Ever since having my daughter 2 years ago my skin has not been the same.  It is dry and I even have small bumps on my arms that just won&#x27;t go away.  One use of this and my skin felt softer than it has in years.  Bonus, it smells amazing! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this product. I love the smell and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. The scrub is gentle enough to use everyday. Works wonders on my feet and hands. Best part, the smell is light and clean and not over powering. When used in addition to the cleanse you feel totally clean both inside and outside.</li>
            <li> This body scrub does not disappoint! I enjoyed this in my first post-pregnancy bath and it left my skin feeling silky and the subtle  scent refreshed my senses! Unlike other, similar products this has a more mild (pleasing) scent and the grain is more gentle which I really like for every-day use. I look forward to more all-natural Kaeng Raeng products coming out!</li>
            <li> Over the past year I have become more aware of the products I use on my body and the things I put in my body, so I was thrilled to hear about Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s newest product and even more excited to give it a try. I waited until I was one week in to a 14-day detox before my first use and between my detox and the Detoxfoliant I have never felt better inside and out! I will give anything a try once, but when something smells bad it&#x27;s in instant turn off and that is NOT the case here- the lavender scent is heavenly! I used the scrub in the shower as I was short on time, so I lathered up and let it sit for a couple minutes while I did a gentle scrub in an attempt to get everything off. I am an AVID lotion user after showers, but not after using Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s Detoxfoliant. The scrub left my skin feeling incredibly moisturized for 3 days after my first use.  Without a doubt the newest addition to the Kaeng Raeng Family gets 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> Most exfoliating products tend to leave my skin a bit dry feeling, but I was pleasantly surprised after using Kaeng Raeng&#x27;s detoxfoliant. Not only does it exfoliate and get rid of dead, dry skin leaving it soft and smooth, but it ALSO moisturizes! The moisturizing effect is my favorite aspect of this product.</li>
            <li> Detoxfoliant is a Goddess-send! Such an amazing product. This scrub makes my skin feel so creamy and smooth after each use. Definitely something I will reorder! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I waited to use this scrub until I was doing a KR detox cleanse.  It left my skin SUPER soft and smooth.  I usually drown myself in lotion after a shower, but I didn&#x27;t feel the need to do that after using this scrub.  My skin was well hydrated, but not overwhelmingly oily.  I&#x27;m writing this review the morning after use, and my skin is super soft and smooth still!  I will definitely be purchasing this again.  Also, I&#x27;m a diehard fan of Lush&#x27;s Ocean Salt... but it doesn&#x27;t hydrate and smooth my skin as well as this product.  Another perk is that KR&#x27;s product is a few dollars less than Lush&#x27;s product!  Score!!!</li>
