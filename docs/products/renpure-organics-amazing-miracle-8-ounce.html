            <li>very nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>It really is an amazing miracle!</li>
            <li>Not the best condition but not horrible.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s warm, I like a combination of a Shea Moisture leave-in with Abba&#x27;s (grapefruit scented!)</li>
            <li>This stuff is purely amazing the scent, feel, I love everything about the way this makes my hair feel it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an honesty good product.</li>
            <li>The conditioner that comes with my hair color is good, but I run out after 3 shampoos.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these because it smells good and helped condition my hair after swimming.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be getting good reviews, but I for one don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Maybe good for hair</li>
            <li>- I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, But once a week for a nice shine is great.</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>Smells great, nice feel in the shower, but I can&#x27;t say it is an &amp;#34;amazing miracle&amp;#34; for damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it on amazon!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My hair looks great and is easy to comb out after shampooing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing miracle is truly amazing when used every day.  </li>
            <li>I came across a trial sample of Renpure Organics Amazing Miracle.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll keep looking for an amazing miracle.</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing when I use it.</li>
            <li>Renpure Organics Amazing Miracle was recommended to me by a Walgreen sales associate, and it truly does work wonders.  </li>
            <li>It also works nicely as a detangler.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not too over powering.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff :)</li>
            <li>Smells nice and takes care of you hair.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Yeah, that kind of hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look beautiful, bouncy, shiny &amp; healthy and best of all no toxic parabens and other chemicals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that I use a good conditioner so that I can maintain the length of my hair.</li>
            <li>Shiny, soft, manageable, and just awesome!</li>
            <li>I use once per week and has made my hair very smooth, healthy looking and seems to grow faster.</li>
            <li>Moving here from Chicago where we had wonderful Great Lakes water,  I am not used to the Florida hard water which has a lot of iron in it, so I tone up my hair with a peroxide-based toner about every 3 months and spend a lot of time in the sun as well.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok to use...</li>
            <li>We just moved this to subscribe and save :-).</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 2 months and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I also use the shampoo and love that too.</li>
            <li>I love these products - both shampoo too.</li>
            <li>And it just kept getting better each time I used it.</li>
            <li>I continue to use this instead of conditioner most of the time.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty amazing!  </li>
            <li>so I am glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried coconut oil, it worked much better.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as one would expect for being a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, but I like the smell, and it does okay.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Both my son and I love this product.</li>
            <li>It honestly was the best $5-ish I ever spent.</li>
            <li>I have used all top selling brands in salons and drug stores.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This hasn&#x27;t made my hair feel any better.</li>
            <li>Keratin and even adding baby oil to my ends has done much more.</li>
            <li>I love what this product does to my hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m liking it more each time I use it.</li>
            <li>I love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this Renpure product longer and love it for the&lt;br /&gt;amazing amount of body it gives my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this mask.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it&#x27;s pretty damn good.</li>
            <li>great for naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Smells great, leaves my hair soft and not greasy...</li>
            <li>old, and for the first time in my life, friends have started commenting on how great my hair looks and asking what I am doing to it!  </li>
            <li>Smells good, works real well.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is good for the whole day.</li>
            <li>Hair is easy to manage, comes out straight and shiny and smelling really good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a good conditioner and a decent price in the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; category.</li>
            <li>This product is giving it wonderful &#x27;body&#x27; and bounce, and now my hair is even becoming slightly curly.</li>
            <li>Provides lots of moisture for hair without weighing it down and smells great!  </li>
            <li>Their conditioners are on the richer heavier side if you have fine hair</li>
            <li>This product is fine.</li>
            <li>it has very natural ingredients for a good price.</li>
            <li>This is a great rather cheap alternative to going to a salon for a deep conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference every time.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and soft, but most of all, it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>, it was cheap</li>
            <li>, it is a cheap price -</li>
            <li>I need to use products which are silicon and sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s all organic and the price is very economical.</li>
            <li>what makes my medium blonde color-treated fine, straight hair most happy is dermorganic&#x27;s intensive hair repair masque or john masters&#x27; citrus neroli conditioner.</li>
            <li>based on amazon reviews, i had high hopes for this &#x27;amazing miracle&#x27; conditioner.</li>
            <li>but I need something more intense for problem hair!</li>
            <li>Better than salon conditioners, and its ingredients are more natural.</li>
            <li>It rinses out clean.</li>
            <li>Makes hair amazingly, miraculously soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>bottles of Ookisa conditioner for $112.46, including shipping and discovered that it is just a conditioner - nothing special at all.</li>
            <li>Nothing special though.</li>
            <li>Love this deep conditioner, smells great and its goodespecially for my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>Just calms all the frizz and leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Not as good of a deep reconstructing conditioner as some</li>
            <li>After trying to make my own natural hygiene products, I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>I really liked how this conditioned my  naturally wavy hair, though I did still have frizz.</li>
            <li>I love that it is organic and that it makes my hair really manageable.</li>
            <li>As a leave in treatment this Miracle cream really acts like a magic to my hair and it makes me run my fingres within my hari again and again.</li>
            <li>Above all this and that it is organic so you are using a good product into your hair.</li>
            <li>The Amazing Miracle has a great scent but is very, very THICK and CREAMY.</li>
            <li>Having used organic body care products for 20 years, I can tell fairly quickly about the quality (or lack of) in a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Many researchers also correlate a saturation of silicone and the 40 or so chemicals used in making them with the high increase in autoimmune diseases in women.  </li>
            <li>a huge wave of body is evident and I spray it and</li>
            <li>Noticed an improvement the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I ended up first getting this product for free at Wal-mart by way of a mail in rebate.  </li>
            <li>This is an EXCELLENT deep conditioner for long hair.</li>
            <li>it does just take a little and it smells and feels great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price and worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the way this product smells and how soft it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty normal and healthy.</li>
            <li>Love renpure products because they use natural ingredients and no sulfates.</li>
            <li>Sure, liquid plastic MAY leave your hair feeling soft, but I suggest a line like &amp;#34;Avalon,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Kiss</li>
            <li>It was great at detangling and this thick formula left my hair feeling good.</li>
            <li>have to wash again the next day a bit oily but the day of is nice</li>
            <li>Right now, you can \\&quot;Try it for free\\&quot; with a mail-in rebate at some stores - which is what I did.</li>
            <li>but the price is right (even without the rebate).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any special improvements in my hair.</li>
            <li>Reading the label proves the first two ingredients are water and glycerine - then 8 synthetic chemical ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This is a very gentle reconstructor.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different conditioners.</li>
            <li>I actually first purchased it at the drug store, then when I couldn&#x27;t find it again, ordered here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My normal hair is very thin/fine and has always been smooth and shiny until then.</li>
            <li>and I tried a ton of different products (even brand names and pricey products) to get it better.</li>
            <li>It looked healthy and shiny even the next day!  </li>
            <li>I use this mostly in the winter and after highlights to give my hair some of it&#x27;s moisture back.  </li>
            <li>#34;...icone&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>I think people with relatively \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair will probably love this -</li>
            <li>We have tried so many different products on their hair and have been dissatisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it didn&#x27;t feel quite \\&quot;silky\\</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I thought, &amp;#34;Well, it made my hair softer,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>not only makes it shine, but also makes it softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>My daughter gave me my first tube of it as a gift</li>
            <li>After so many research about the possible routine of curing my hair and turning it into healthier hair.</li>
            <li>i bought  it first time in RiteAid,but stopped selling the product.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair so silky and smooth-unbelieviable.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell and only use it once a week.</li>
            <li>I have long, curly, and dry/damaged hair, and when I use this product it feels so much better throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Thick, but not too thick, and does a good job moisturizing hair and smells great.</li>
            <li>I finally got it detangled, but it took a lot of work, which is not what I&#x27;m looking for with hair like mine, which tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my dry hair feel after using it.</li>
            <li>The first two weeks of living here, my baby fine hair practically stood straight up on end CONSTANTLY because of the dryness.  </li>
            <li>and it is certainly a staple in my hair regime.</li>
            <li>It also has an odd smell, in my opinion, almost like chemicals, which is kind of ironic considering the fact that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li>A few months ago I saw Renpure Amazing Miracle at the drugstore and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I thought my hair looked amazing even before it dried.  </li>
            <li>After leaving it in for three to five minutes, my hair is soft, silky, shiny, and completely tangle free.</li>
            <li>I mix it with a cheaper conditioner and apply it to wet hair and then add a bit more water, wait a couple of minutes and then rinse out.</li>
            <li>so I figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out much if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>This product really helped restore softness and shine, moisture and manageability.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that tends towards frizzy~</li>
            <li>I use this conditioner after I shampoo with baby shampoo (baby shampoo clarifies very well).  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel too much difference.</li>
            <li>He has very curly</li>
            <li>My hair is \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; and very prone to frizzing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the one who walks in with bone straight hair</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>And very Damaged......</li>
            <li>Sometimes I put it on overnight to really give my hair body.</li>
            <li>Then gently squeeze excess water from my strands before &amp;#34;t-shirt drying&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>And my hair can really tangle.  </li>
            <li>This is the first natural product that really works well.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Might use more as regular conditioner since all the ingredients are gentle and overall</li>
            <li>Anyway, I needed a good deep conditioner and I came across this low cost gem in my local grocery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be looking for another shampoo/conditioner to smooth and repair my dry hair.</li>
            <li>only wish it was bigger :)</li>
            <li>This is a decent product.</li>
            <li>Renpure Amazing Miracle conditions my hair without making the curls flat, and actually makes it shine, something no other product has done!  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for people who want organic, high quality products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Aubrey hair care products and their cosmetic line.  </li>
            <li>It untangles your hair fast and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li>This product really gets through the hair shaft and makes it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I am a bit sensitive to specific smells/scents and when I first used it, it has such a light, but fragrant, feminine scent.  </li>
            <li>I use this conditioner 3 or so times a weeks as a normal conditioner, but I leave it in my hair for about five minutes while I&#x27;m in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is, I have to leave the coconut oil in my hair for an hour before wash my hair, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t call your conditioner &amp;#34;Amazing Miracle&amp;#34; if it&#x27;s pretty much just standard conditioner.</li>
            <li>This helps to tame it and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li>Took the frizz away and my hair is soft but not puffy which is good because my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li>I always order it off Amazon because I cannot find it in the supermarket or pharmacy where I live.  </li>
            <li>and I am always on the lookout for something new that will soften and moisturize my hair.  </li>
            <li>Live this stuff and have used it for years</li>
            <li>of pure, organic coconut oil mixed in with your conditioner and left in for five to ten minutes, will leave your hair incredibly soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also always been very fine, straight, limp, and with no &#x27;body&#x27; at all, so I&#x27;ve worn it fairly short.</li>
            <li>Hormonal disruption is one of the main things that is causing our kids to go through early puberty and we do not yet know how that will play out on their reproductive health as adults.</li>
            <li>First purchased at my local Rite-Aid and now they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li>Left it on for 30mins wrapped in plastic and hot towel.</li>
            <li>I usually bunch up all of my hair on the top of my head and leave it in for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair SO soft!</li>
            <li>still soft - no frizz!</li>
            <li>So naturally, here I am buying two tubes!</li>
            <li>All natural so no toxins!</li>
            <li>I have long hair, and it only takes a few minutes during a shower to have soft and most important detangled hair.  </li>
            <li>Very thick, great for tangles in long hair.</li>
            <li>Some researchers/scientists now believe that so much plastic going into the body over time can lead to hormonal disruption; not good - especially for our children, who are far more susceptible!</li>
            <li>I need to go back and really look closely at the ingredients as it smells and acts like it has synthetic ingredients (many products that manufacturers claim to be all natural actually contain various forms of silicone - NOT a natural ingredient.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner and it&#x27;s so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>It can make the hair a little heavy after 2 or 3 days, but is just great when used daily.</li>
            <li>Makes the ends really soft.</li>
            <li>The bottle says this product is organic and is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and supple after use.  </li>
            <li>I would consider myself somewhat of a mixtress (I am an experimental research scientist) but for the price and performance I see no reason not to buy this product.</li>
            <li>As a hair professional, people ask me all the time what i use.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and bouncy when I use this.</li>
            <li>However, after using it several times, I noticed a real difference.  </li>
            <li>This product immediately fixed that.  </li>
            <li>I have natural kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li>With that being said I have found most natural/organic shampoos to be drying to my naturally thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you first of all that I&#x27;ve been struggling with my hair condition (dry, damaged, frizzy and unmanageble).</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and smooth without making my hair puffy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li>My hair is finally back to normal.</li>
            <li>Finally, a conditioner that is formulated from natural ingredients that works!</li>
            <li>It left my curly hair feeling amazingly soft , moisturized and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat coarse naturally curly hair that is greying and this conditioner</li>
            <li>I have colored hair with natural curl in it and this has been the only thing that doesn&#x27;t break the back of my neck out after prolonged use.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the extra few $$</li>
            <li>Wonderful for my thin, fine hair which gets challenged daily by sun, swimming (in summer) and dry cold (in winter)!  </li>
            <li>After about 3 months of using a very small amount of this product after my shampoo(about 3 times/week), and just leaving it in during the few minutes it takes to finish my shower, my hair has had a truly \\&quot;Amazing Miracle\\</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, fine hair with a lot of breakage.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry and frizzy long hair and this poduct really helps together with Renpure Organics Shampoo and Argan oil as a smoothing treatment.</li>
            <li>Wanting to \\&quot;use up\\&quot; items I tend to hang on to for far too long, I used it in my next shower.</li>
            <li>Since the use of this and the Ren Pure in the red bottles I have noticed less breakage.  </li>
            <li>The scent is much milder than other conditioners, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair slick and smooth like the unorganic kind, which, while I was slightly disappointed at the loss of ultra softness, I don&#x27;t mind, since the conditioner is, after all, organic.</li>
            <li>It also helped me to shampoo just the top of my head and down to the base of my skull and not the ends. :)</li>

            <li> It really is an amazing miracle!</li>
            <li> Not the best condition but not horrible.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s warm, I like a combination of a Shea Moisture leave-in with Abba&#x27;s (grapefruit scented!)</li>
            <li> This stuff is purely amazing the scent, feel, I love everything about the way this makes my hair feel it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an honesty good product.</li>
            <li> The conditioner that comes with my hair color is good, but I run out after 3 shampoos.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these because it smells good and helped condition my hair after swimming.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be getting good reviews, but I for one don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Maybe good for hair</li>
            <li> - I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, But once a week for a nice shine is great.</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> Smells great, nice feel in the shower, but I can&#x27;t say it is an &amp;#34;amazing miracle&amp;#34; for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found it on amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> My hair looks great and is easy to comb out after shampooing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing miracle is truly amazing when used every day.  </li>
            <li> I came across a trial sample of Renpure Organics Amazing Miracle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll keep looking for an amazing miracle.</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing when I use it.</li>
            <li> Renpure Organics Amazing Miracle was recommended to me by a Walgreen sales associate, and it truly does work wonders.  </li>
            <li> It also works nicely as a detangler.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and not too over powering.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff :)</li>
            <li> Smells nice and takes care of you hair.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Yeah, that kind of hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look beautiful, bouncy, shiny &amp; healthy and best of all no toxic parabens and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important that I use a good conditioner so that I can maintain the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> Shiny, soft, manageable, and just awesome!</li>
            <li> I use once per week and has made my hair very smooth, healthy looking and seems to grow faster.</li>
            <li> Moving here from Chicago where we had wonderful Great Lakes water,  I am not used to the Florida hard water which has a lot of iron in it, so I tone up my hair with a peroxide-based toner about every 3 months and spend a lot of time in the sun as well.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to use...</li>
            <li> We just moved this to subscribe and save :-).</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 months and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I also use the shampoo and love that too.</li>
            <li> I love these products - both shampoo too.</li>
            <li> And it just kept getting better each time I used it.</li>
            <li> I continue to use this instead of conditioner most of the time.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty amazing!  </li>
            <li> so I am glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried coconut oil, it worked much better.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as one would expect for being a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, but I like the smell, and it does okay.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Both my son and I love this product.</li>
            <li> It honestly was the best $5-ish I ever spent.</li>
            <li> I have used all top selling brands in salons and drug stores.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t made my hair feel any better.</li>
            <li> Keratin and even adding baby oil to my ends has done much more.</li>
            <li> I love what this product does to my hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m liking it more each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this Renpure product longer and love it for the&lt;br /&gt;amazing amount of body it gives my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this product for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Love this mask.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it&#x27;s pretty damn good.</li>
            <li> great for naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves my hair soft and not greasy...</li>
            <li> old, and for the first time in my life, friends have started commenting on how great my hair looks and asking what I am doing to it!  </li>
            <li> Smells good, works real well.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is good for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Hair is easy to manage, comes out straight and shiny and smelling really good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a good conditioner and a decent price in the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; category.</li>
            <li> This product is giving it wonderful &#x27;body&#x27; and bounce, and now my hair is even becoming slightly curly.</li>
            <li> Provides lots of moisture for hair without weighing it down and smells great!  </li>
            <li> Their conditioners are on the richer heavier side if you have fine hair</li>
            <li> This product is fine.</li>
            <li> it has very natural ingredients for a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a great rather cheap alternative to going to a salon for a deep conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference every time.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth and soft, but most of all, it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> , it was cheap</li>
            <li> , it is a cheap price -</li>
            <li> I need to use products which are silicon and sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s all organic and the price is very economical.</li>
            <li> what makes my medium blonde color-treated fine, straight hair most happy is dermorganic&#x27;s intensive hair repair masque or john masters&#x27; citrus neroli conditioner.</li>
            <li> based on amazon reviews, i had high hopes for this &#x27;amazing miracle&#x27; conditioner.</li>
            <li> but I need something more intense for problem hair!</li>
            <li> Better than salon conditioners, and its ingredients are more natural.</li>
            <li> It rinses out clean.</li>
            <li> Makes hair amazingly, miraculously soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> bottles of Ookisa conditioner for $112.46, including shipping and discovered that it is just a conditioner - nothing special at all.</li>
            <li> Nothing special though.</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioner, smells great and its goodespecially for my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> Just calms all the frizz and leaves my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Not as good of a deep reconstructing conditioner as some</li>
            <li> After trying to make my own natural hygiene products, I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> I really liked how this conditioned my  naturally wavy hair, though I did still have frizz.</li>
            <li> I love that it is organic and that it makes my hair really manageable.</li>
            <li> As a leave in treatment this Miracle cream really acts like a magic to my hair and it makes me run my fingres within my hari again and again.</li>
            <li> Above all this and that it is organic so you are using a good product into your hair.</li>
            <li> The Amazing Miracle has a great scent but is very, very THICK and CREAMY.</li>
            <li> Having used organic body care products for 20 years, I can tell fairly quickly about the quality (or lack of) in a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Many researchers also correlate a saturation of silicone and the 40 or so chemicals used in making them with the high increase in autoimmune diseases in women.  </li>
            <li> a huge wave of body is evident and I spray it and</li>
            <li> Noticed an improvement the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I ended up first getting this product for free at Wal-mart by way of a mail in rebate.  </li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT deep conditioner for long hair.</li>
            <li> it does just take a little and it smells and feels great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price and worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the way this product smells and how soft it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty normal and healthy.</li>
            <li> Love renpure products because they use natural ingredients and no sulfates.</li>
            <li> Sure, liquid plastic MAY leave your hair feeling soft, but I suggest a line like &amp;#34;Avalon,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Kiss</li>
            <li> It was great at detangling and this thick formula left my hair feeling good.</li>
            <li> have to wash again the next day a bit oily but the day of is nice</li>
            <li> Right now, you can \\&quot;Try it for free\\&quot; with a mail-in rebate at some stores - which is what I did.</li>
            <li> but the price is right (even without the rebate).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any special improvements in my hair.</li>
            <li> Reading the label proves the first two ingredients are water and glycerine - then 8 synthetic chemical ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This is a very gentle reconstructor.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different conditioners.</li>
            <li> I actually first purchased it at the drug store, then when I couldn&#x27;t find it again, ordered here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My normal hair is very thin/fine and has always been smooth and shiny until then.</li>
            <li> and I tried a ton of different products (even brand names and pricey products) to get it better.</li>
            <li> It looked healthy and shiny even the next day!  </li>
            <li> I use this mostly in the winter and after highlights to give my hair some of it&#x27;s moisture back.  </li>
            <li> #34;...icone&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> I think people with relatively \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair will probably love this -</li>
            <li> We have tried so many different products on their hair and have been dissatisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it didn&#x27;t feel quite \\&quot;silky\\</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I thought, &amp;#34;Well, it made my hair softer,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> not only makes it shine, but also makes it softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me my first tube of it as a gift</li>
            <li> After so many research about the possible routine of curing my hair and turning it into healthier hair.</li>
            <li> i bought  it first time in RiteAid,but stopped selling the product.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair so silky and smooth-unbelieviable.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell and only use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, and dry/damaged hair, and when I use this product it feels so much better throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Thick, but not too thick, and does a good job moisturizing hair and smells great.</li>
            <li> I finally got it detangled, but it took a lot of work, which is not what I&#x27;m looking for with hair like mine, which tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my dry hair feel after using it.</li>
            <li> The first two weeks of living here, my baby fine hair practically stood straight up on end CONSTANTLY because of the dryness.  </li>
            <li> and it is certainly a staple in my hair regime.</li>
            <li> It also has an odd smell, in my opinion, almost like chemicals, which is kind of ironic considering the fact that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I saw Renpure Amazing Miracle at the drugstore and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I thought my hair looked amazing even before it dried.  </li>
            <li> After leaving it in for three to five minutes, my hair is soft, silky, shiny, and completely tangle free.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a cheaper conditioner and apply it to wet hair and then add a bit more water, wait a couple of minutes and then rinse out.</li>
            <li> so I figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out much if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This product really helped restore softness and shine, moisture and manageability.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY curly hair.</li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that tends towards frizzy~</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner after I shampoo with baby shampoo (baby shampoo clarifies very well).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel too much difference.</li>
            <li> He has very curly</li>
            <li> My hair is \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; and very prone to frizzing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the one who walks in with bone straight hair</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> And very Damaged......</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put it on overnight to really give my hair body.</li>
            <li> Then gently squeeze excess water from my strands before &amp;#34;t-shirt drying&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> And my hair can really tangle.  </li>
            <li> This is the first natural product that really works well.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Might use more as regular conditioner since all the ingredients are gentle and overall</li>
            <li> Anyway, I needed a good deep conditioner and I came across this low cost gem in my local grocery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking for another shampoo/conditioner to smooth and repair my dry hair.</li>
            <li> only wish it was bigger :)</li>
            <li> This is a decent product.</li>
            <li> Renpure Amazing Miracle conditions my hair without making the curls flat, and actually makes it shine, something no other product has done!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for people who want organic, high quality products.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Aubrey hair care products and their cosmetic line.  </li>
            <li> It untangles your hair fast and leaves it so soft.</li>
            <li> This product really gets through the hair shaft and makes it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit sensitive to specific smells/scents and when I first used it, it has such a light, but fragrant, feminine scent.  </li>
            <li> I use this conditioner 3 or so times a weeks as a normal conditioner, but I leave it in my hair for about five minutes while I&#x27;m in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is, I have to leave the coconut oil in my hair for an hour before wash my hair, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t call your conditioner &amp;#34;Amazing Miracle&amp;#34; if it&#x27;s pretty much just standard conditioner.</li>
            <li> This helps to tame it and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li> Took the frizz away and my hair is soft but not puffy which is good because my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> I always order it off Amazon because I cannot find it in the supermarket or pharmacy where I live.  </li>
            <li> and I am always on the lookout for something new that will soften and moisturize my hair.  </li>
            <li> Live this stuff and have used it for years</li>
            <li> of pure, organic coconut oil mixed in with your conditioner and left in for five to ten minutes, will leave your hair incredibly soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also always been very fine, straight, limp, and with no &#x27;body&#x27; at all, so I&#x27;ve worn it fairly short.</li>
            <li> Hormonal disruption is one of the main things that is causing our kids to go through early puberty and we do not yet know how that will play out on their reproductive health as adults.</li>
            <li> First purchased at my local Rite-Aid and now they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> Left it on for 30mins wrapped in plastic and hot towel.</li>
            <li> I usually bunch up all of my hair on the top of my head and leave it in for 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair SO soft!</li>
            <li> still soft - no frizz!</li>
            <li> So naturally, here I am buying two tubes!</li>
            <li> All natural so no toxins!</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and it only takes a few minutes during a shower to have soft and most important detangled hair.  </li>
            <li> Very thick, great for tangles in long hair.</li>
            <li> Some researchers/scientists now believe that so much plastic going into the body over time can lead to hormonal disruption; not good - especially for our children, who are far more susceptible!</li>
            <li> I need to go back and really look closely at the ingredients as it smells and acts like it has synthetic ingredients (many products that manufacturers claim to be all natural actually contain various forms of silicone - NOT a natural ingredient.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner and it&#x27;s so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It can make the hair a little heavy after 2 or 3 days, but is just great when used daily.</li>
            <li> Makes the ends really soft.</li>
            <li> The bottle says this product is organic and is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and supple after use.  </li>
            <li> I would consider myself somewhat of a mixtress (I am an experimental research scientist) but for the price and performance I see no reason not to buy this product.</li>
            <li> As a hair professional, people ask me all the time what i use.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and bouncy when I use this.</li>
            <li> However, after using it several times, I noticed a real difference.  </li>
            <li> This product immediately fixed that.  </li>
            <li> I have natural kinky curly hair.</li>
            <li> With that being said I have found most natural/organic shampoos to be drying to my naturally thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you first of all that I&#x27;ve been struggling with my hair condition (dry, damaged, frizzy and unmanageble).</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and smooth without making my hair puffy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My hair is finally back to normal.</li>
            <li> Finally, a conditioner that is formulated from natural ingredients that works!</li>
            <li> It left my curly hair feeling amazingly soft , moisturized and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat coarse naturally curly hair that is greying and this conditioner</li>
            <li> I have colored hair with natural curl in it and this has been the only thing that doesn&#x27;t break the back of my neck out after prolonged use.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the extra few $$</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my thin, fine hair which gets challenged daily by sun, swimming (in summer) and dry cold (in winter)!  </li>
            <li> After about 3 months of using a very small amount of this product after my shampoo(about 3 times/week), and just leaving it in during the few minutes it takes to finish my shower, my hair has had a truly \\&quot;Amazing Miracle\\</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, fine hair with a lot of breakage.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry and frizzy long hair and this poduct really helps together with Renpure Organics Shampoo and Argan oil as a smoothing treatment.</li>
            <li> Wanting to \\&quot;use up\\&quot; items I tend to hang on to for far too long, I used it in my next shower.</li>
            <li> Since the use of this and the Ren Pure in the red bottles I have noticed less breakage.  </li>
            <li> The scent is much milder than other conditioners, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair slick and smooth like the unorganic kind, which, while I was slightly disappointed at the loss of ultra softness, I don&#x27;t mind, since the conditioner is, after all, organic.</li>
            <li> It also helped me to shampoo just the top of my head and down to the base of my skull and not the ends. :)</li>
            <li> My hair also feels slightly cleaner than with normal conditioner, which despite ultra softness, always feels like there&#x27;s leftover residue.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it does leave my hair softer than when I don&#x27;t use conditioner, and it&#x27;s nice and thick compared to the usual gloopy conditioner I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> As my hair began to dry it was obvious</li>
            <li> Actually holds hair in place if left wet almost like a gel, a healthier gel.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse curly hair, and this conditioner didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> It made my hair greasy right after washing and even worse the next day.</li>
            <li> I can only tell you it is comparable to the most expensive organic shampoos and conditioners in the market!</li>
            <li> ; They are more expensive but you can use less overall and be assured</li>
            <li> I use it 2-3X per week and have long hair.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have long, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It does not feel greasy and my hair is soft and fluffy</li>
            <li> This product is not available at a store near me, so I order 3-4 at a time.  </li>
            <li> how long I&#x27;ve had it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to try the other renpure products.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s expensive, its definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not that different from their other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> This hair conditioner is way short of being an &amp;#34;amazing miracle.&amp;#34; It smells like plastic and does not condition my hair as well as other products and lines like &amp;#34;Desert Essence,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Avalon,&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;Jason.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> it was the softest it had been in a long while!</li>
            <li> When applied and then dry, hair is not frizzy and is well manageable.</li>
            <li> I have dry and damaged hair</li>
            <li> rub it in, let it dry and</li>
            <li> I have dry curly medium length hair that is colored.  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly and very dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My kids have very dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry, often frizzy, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this originally to take care of a bad hair color experience that left me with a head of straw.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful with what I put on my skin and in my hair due to my MS.  </li>
            <li> I was shampooing and conditioning every day but after switching to every 2-3 days instead my hair got much less dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy, flyaway, and dry when I use this.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have parabens and other ingredients I choose to avoid.</li>
            <li> It shows up as dimethicone and other ingredients that end in &amp;</li>
            <li> I use it with other Renpure products.</li>
            <li> I started hearing about all the harmful chemicals in cosmetics, so I actively sought out products that contain no parabens, dyes, preservatives, etc.</li>
            <li> I usually buy 3 at a time because my hair is curly and really long.</li>
            <li> It repairs my color treated hair without weighing it down or feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit odd, and it doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair.</li>
            <li> Helps with my dry scalp particularly during this cold spell we are having.  </li>
            <li> If I use other conditioners they tend to make my hair feel heavy and weigh it down, but not with this!</li>
            <li> My oldest has thick, long hair</li>
            <li> Lower down on the label there are a few botanical/herbal ingredients but NONE of them are organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick, curly hair that was recently highlighted, and I tried this product because it has a money-back guarantee if you&#x27;re not satisfied, if you purchase it from Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I have previously found that normal conditioners...even the expensive ones...usually leave my hair shiny, but still very limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I went to Ulta Beauty with my sister and saw this and got it on a whim</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few years now</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a few years.</li>
            <li> but it seems like this one does tame frizz a little.</li>
            <li> Some consumer advocates need to get together and file a complaint against &amp;#34;Renpure&amp;#34; because the 4th ingredient in this so called &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; conditioner is Amodimethicone - basically silicone which is a man made (not organic) material comprised of plastic and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thin.....</li>
            <li> I like that this product is organic, however it did very little for my hair.</li>
            <li> Works well, I use once a week and it removes snarls and small tangles.</li>
            <li> i am not sure about the efficiency of the detangling though.</li>
            <li> Plus, you can use it everyday!</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, even after leaving on for 3-5 minutes, my hair felt as dry if not dryer upon rinsing?</li>
            <li> so it hard to know</li>
            <li> I also have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> My curly hair is in need of some serious hydration and repair.</li>
            <li> It became straw-like, dry, and flyaway - impossible even to get a comb through it.  </li>
            <li> Renpure has jumped on the &amp;#34;Organic Bandwagon&amp;#34; in order to falsely promote their product.  </li>
            <li> this is just a bunch of chemicals with a couple of botanical ingredients with false advertising.  </li>
            <li> It adds a lot of condition but also adds a lot of weight, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> you just got a stylists hair secret!</li>
            <li> My hair has always been extremely delicate [could not even take permanents because of terrible hair</li>
            <li> I wish they didn&#x27;t stop selling it in the stores :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I always order it off Amazon because I cannot find it in the supermarket or pharmacy where I live.  Provides lots of moisture for hair without weighing it down and smells great!  Plus it&#x27;s all organic and the price is very economical.</li>
            <li> Not the best i have ever used but very good!</li>
            <li> the label says it all.......AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! This product is a must have. especially for curly haired girls. love this!!!! It untangles your hair fast and leaves it so soft. If you have oily hair this may not be for you but if you need moisture.....Amazing. it&#x27;s an honesty good product. I usually buy 3 at a time because my hair is curly and really long. It&#x27;s well worth the price and worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it was bigger :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S I use it as a conditioner and/or leave in conditioner too.... works wonders</li>
            <li> This product is soooooooo great.  It makes my hair smooth and soft, but most of all, it smells amazing.  I am a bit sensitive to specific smells/scents and when I first used it, it has such a light, but fragrant, feminine scent.  I am so happy I took a chance and tried this product.  I recommend this product for people who want organic, high quality products.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT deep conditioner for long hair. Makes the ends really soft. I use it 2-3X per week and have long hair. I mix it with a cheaper conditioner and apply it to wet hair and then add a bit more water, wait a couple of minutes and then rinse out. I was shampooing and conditioning every day but after switching to every 2-3 days instead my hair got much less dry and damaged. It also helped me to shampoo just the top of my head and down to the base of my skull and not the ends. :)</li>
            <li> I love this. It makes my hair so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any special improvements in my hair. My curly hair is in need of some serious hydration and repair. It&#x27;s ok to use...but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Noticed an improvement the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I also have thick, curly hair and I am always on the lookout for something new that will soften and moisturize my hair.  This product did not seem to help at all.  After reading all the positive reviews, I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I am over 50 and have long, color treated hair. It&#x27;s important that I use a good conditioner so that I can maintain the length of my hair. I have tried many different conditioners. The conditioner that comes with my hair color is good, but I run out after 3 shampoos. I bought three 6 oz. bottles of Ookisa conditioner for $112.46, including shipping and discovered that it is just a conditioner - nothing special at all. I would rate it 2 stars, at best. A few months ago I saw Renpure Amazing Miracle at the drugstore and decided to try it. It was $6-something for an 8 oz bottle at Walgreens. My hair looks great and is easy to comb out after shampooing. It smells good too! The bottle says this product is organic and is made with natural ingredients. Now I use the subscribe-and-save at Amazon and get it for $5.94 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these because it smells good and helped condition my hair after swimming. I use it once a week even when not swimming. I actually first purchased it at the drug store, then when I couldn&#x27;t find it again, ordered here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My family has an ongoing quest for the perfect organic conditioner.  My daughters think this is it. My oldest has thick, long hair and she swears this is the only one that works well for her.  We just moved this to subscribe and save :-).</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 months and absolutely love it.  My hair is soft and supple after use.  I have colored hair with natural curl in it and this has been the only thing that doesn&#x27;t break the back of my neck out after prolonged use. I also use the shampoo and love that too.</li>
            <li> I started hearing about all the harmful chemicals in cosmetics, so I actively sought out products that contain no parabens, dyes, preservatives, etc. Most products out there that actually don&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals are really expensive - which is why I decided to try this.      I was very happy with the results. I use this conditioner 3 or so times a weeks as a normal conditioner, but I leave it in my hair for about five minutes while I&#x27;m in the shower.  After a summer of sun damage, my hair has been in need of some conditioning treatment.  This product has left my hair feeling fluffier and healthier after every wash.  I&#x27;m definitely going to try the other renpure products.  Right now, you can \\&quot;Try it for free\\&quot; with a mail-in rebate at some stores - which is what I did.</li>
            <li> Works well, I use once a week and it removes snarls and small tangles.</li>
            <li> The scent is much milder than other conditioners, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair slick and smooth like the unorganic kind, which, while I was slightly disappointed at the loss of ultra softness, I don&#x27;t mind, since the conditioner is, after all, organic. Other than that, it does leave my hair softer than when I don&#x27;t use conditioner, and it&#x27;s nice and thick compared to the usual gloopy conditioner I&#x27;ve used before. My hair also feels slightly cleaner than with normal conditioner, which despite ultra softness, always feels like there&#x27;s leftover residue. Overall a good buy. Will buy it again once I&#x27;m through with my current bottle.</li>
            <li> The Amazing Miracle has a great scent but is very, very THICK and CREAMY. I have thick, wavy hair and I only need about a nickel-sized amount. It adds a lot of condition but also adds a lot of weight, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> First purchased at my local Rite-Aid and now they stopped selling it. I love these products - both shampoo too.</li>
            <li> I had a friend (licensed cosmetologist) of mine bleach my hair 2 years ago and she fried it. It was a disaster. It would grow in all damaged and gross. My normal hair is very thin/fine and has always been smooth and shiny until then. Since it had been two years I figured I had totally ruined my hair and I tried a ton of different products (even brand names and pricey products) to get it better. Nothing worked. A few weeks ago I went to Ulta Beauty with my sister and saw this and got it on a whim, it was cheap so I figured I wouldn&#x27;t be out much if it didn&#x27;t work. NBD. But to my surprise it did. I put it on after I shampoo and leave it on for 5 minutes about 3 days a week. I noticed an immediate change. And it just kept getting better each time I used it. My hair is finally back to normal. Shiny, soft, manageable, and just awesome! I would recommend this to ANYONE! It really is an amazing miracle! LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this originally to take care of a bad hair color experience that left me with a head of straw.  This product really helped restore softness and shine, moisture and manageability.  I continue to use this instead of conditioner most of the time.  I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have parabens and other ingredients I choose to avoid. This price on Amazon has beat anything I can get locally.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. Actually holds hair in place if left wet almost like a gel, a healthier gel. I have VERY curly hair. i.e.: think an ethnic curly Keri Russell (actress) in &#x27;Felicity&#x27;. So you know! this works well. It&#x27;s a conditioner PLUS</li>
            <li> This product seems to be getting good reviews, but I for one don&#x27;t like it. The smell is a bit odd, and it doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair. I have EXTREMELY thick, curly hair that was recently highlighted, and I tried this product because it has a money-back guarantee if you&#x27;re not satisfied, if you purchase it from Walgreens. I left it in my hair for 5 minutes after shampooing, and when I got out of the shower I tried to detangle my hair and it looked a bit like a rat&#x27;s nest. I finally got it detangled, but it took a lot of work, which is not what I&#x27;m looking for with hair like mine, which tangles easily. It also has an odd smell, in my opinion, almost like chemicals, which is kind of ironic considering the fact that it&#x27;s organic. I will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> I have used the red set of shampoo/cond. for over 6 months now and I LOVE it. This is not as satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This really works.  I have to be careful with what I put on my skin and in my hair due to my MS.  This is the first natural product that really works well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now...I have very curly hair that tends towards frizzy~ Just calms all the frizz and leaves my hair nice and soft. Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought it with the \\&quot;Try Me Free\\&quot; rebate tag. Left it on for 30mins wrapped in plastic and hot towel. My hair is curly and very dry and frizzy. Took the frizz away and my hair is soft but not puffy which is good because my hair is very thick. Not as good of a deep reconstructing conditioner as some but the price is right (even without the rebate). Might use more as regular conditioner since all the ingredients are gentle and overall I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle reconstructor. It left my curly hair feeling amazingly soft , moisturized and bouncy.  It also works nicely as a detangler.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product smells and how soft it leaves my hair. My hair is pretty normal and healthy. I have a lot of hair. If I use other conditioners they tend to make my hair feel heavy and weigh it down, but not with this!</li>
            <li> great for naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner after I shampoo with baby shampoo (baby shampoo clarifies very well).  I apply it on my ends and work my way up.  I thought my hair looked amazing even before it dried.  It looked healthy and shiny even the next day!  I think it&#x27;s pretty amazing!  The smell is nice and not too over powering.  I have long, thick, fine hair with a lot of breakage.  Since the use of this and the Ren Pure in the red bottles I have noticed less breakage.  Good stuff :)</li>
            <li> I work at a drug store so I can say I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shampoos and conditioners. With that being said I have found most natural/organic shampoos to be drying to my naturally thick wavy hair. This was Awesome! It left my hair soft and smooth without making my hair puffy or weighing it down. I would absolutly and have recommended this to others.</li>
            <li> I ended up first getting this product for free at Wal-mart by way of a mail in rebate.  It worked because I am hooked.  This is a great rather cheap alternative to going to a salon for a deep conditioning treatment.  I use this mostly in the winter and after highlights to give my hair some of it&#x27;s moisture back.  I usually bunch up all of my hair on the top of my head and leave it in for 5 minutes.  It makes a huge difference every time.  The Wal-mart by my house stopped selling it so I am glad I can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is a deep conditioner everyone should try. It makes my hair SO soft! Smells great too!!</li>
            <li> This dries out my hair somehow. I don&#x27;t like it. Maybe good for hair that&#x27;s oily and not damaged but why deep condition if that&#x27;s the case?</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner and it&#x27;s so hard to find in stores. I&#x27;m glad I found it on amazon! Although it&#x27;s expensive, its definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.  Been using it for a few years now but I can no longer find it in the stores around here.  I will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s available through Amazon.  Makes my hair look beautiful, bouncy, shiny &amp; healthy and best of all no toxic parabens and other chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioner, smells great and its goodespecially for my natural curly hair. I bought this product before at CVS but when I went back to repurchase they no longer had it in stock. When i found it here on amazon I just had to buy it and so I did. Love renpure products because they use natural ingredients and no sulfates.</li>
            <li> This is like a regular conditioner. I didn&#x27;t feel too much difference. But since this is organic, I will finish this tube. I have tried coconut oil, it worked much better. The only thing is, I have to leave the coconut oil in my hair for an hour before wash my hair, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner i have ever used.</li>
            <li> I like how it feels and smells. i am not sure about the efficiency of the detangling though. i must try again and update my review</li>
            <li> Deepest penetration I&#x27;ve ever had! In my hair.</li>
            <li> Helps with my dry scalp particularly during this cold spell we are having.  It does not feel greasy and my hair is soft and fluffy</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not that different from their other conditioners.  I rotate constantly so it hard to know but it seems like this one does tame frizz a little. Their conditioners are on the richer heavier side if you have fine hair</li>
            <li> based on amazon reviews, i had high hopes for this &#x27;amazing miracle&#x27; conditioner. unfortunately, even after leaving on for 3-5 minutes, my hair felt as dry if not dryer upon rinsing? total surprise. what makes my medium blonde color-treated fine, straight hair most happy is dermorganic&#x27;s intensive hair repair masque or john masters&#x27; citrus neroli conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of conditionners, as i swim a lot in both swimming pools and sea water which both do damage the hair a lot.  Amazing miracle is truly amazing when used every day.  Hair is easy to manage, comes out straight and shiny and smelling really good.  It can make the hair a little heavy after 2 or 3 days, but is just great when used daily.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer states &amp;#34;Renpure uses 100% organic extracts.&amp;#34;  Read the label ingredients and discover there are ZERO organic ingredients.  Reading the label proves the first two ingredients are water and glycerine - then 8 synthetic chemical ingredients.  Lower down on the label there are a few botanical/herbal ingredients but NONE of them are organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product based on the lies of the manufacturer.  Renpure has jumped on the &amp;#34;Organic Bandwagon&amp;#34; in order to falsely promote their product.  Any product with labeleing which states &amp;#34;Amazing Miracle&amp;#34; is a red flag that it is a bunch of baloney!  Amazon should contact the manufacturer and make them change their label and advertising claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it is a cheap price - but you get what you pay for - this is just a bunch of chemicals with a couple of botanical ingredients with false advertising.  I highly recommend Aubrey hair care products and their cosmetic line.  Amazon sells it on their website.  I&#x27;ve been using Aubrey products for over 30 years and never had anything but great experience.</li>
            <li> Great produce ! Smells nice and takes care of you hair.&lt;br /&gt;After summer time at the beach it&#x27;s a perfect conditioner&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;I like it and I recommend it</li>
            <li> This is a decent product. It isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as one would expect for being a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, but I like the smell, and it does okay.</li>
            <li> This is a very deep conditioner. - I wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, But once a week for a nice shine is great.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!! After trying to make my own natural hygiene products, I decided to try this. Smells great, leaves my hair soft and not greasy...one of my faves!!</li>
            <li> Not the best condition but not horrible. I would spend money on it again, but I like some of renpure products.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money, in my opinion. It made my hair greasy right after washing and even worse the next day. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this conditioner.  I deep condition with it on a regular basis.  I&#x27;ve already purchased a back-up tube.</li>
            <li> Both my son and I love this product. He has very curly and I have wavy hair. When applied and then dry, hair is not frizzy and is well manageable.</li>
            <li> Live this stuff and have used it for years</li>
            <li> I like that this product is organic, however it did very little for my hair. I applied as directed but wasn&#x27;t impressed with the results. I&#x27;ll be looking for another shampoo/conditioner to smooth and repair my dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product is not available at a store near me, so I order 3-4 at a time.  I use once per week and has made my hair very smooth, healthy looking and seems to grow faster.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and it is certainly a staple in my hair regime. I am African(Caribbean)-American with...I dunno...3b(?) hair. My hair is \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; and very prone to frizzing. I&#x27;m the one who walks in with bone straight hair and I&#x27;m Diana Ross by the end of the evening. Yeah, that kind of hair. Anyway, I needed a good deep conditioner and I came across this low cost gem in my local grocery. It honestly was the best $5-ish I ever spent. I know it only says 3 minutes but I have found excellent results by using it with a plastic cap for about 30 minutes. After doing this weekly (alternating with a monthly protein conditioner) my hair flourished! This product is such a staple that I import it now that I have moved. I love this product! I would consider myself somewhat of a mixtress (I am an experimental research scientist) but for the price and performance I see no reason not to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have used all top selling brands in salons and drug stores. Tried them all! As a hair professional, people ask me all the time what i use. The truth is... i use renpur! I love it! We don&#x27;t sell it in our salon and i wish we could! I can only tell you it is comparable to the most expensive organic shampoos and conditioners in the market! If you want a great shampoo and conditioner this is it!! you just got a stylists hair secret! Try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already noted with another product by this company that I was not at all impressed. Having used organic body care products for 20 years, I can tell fairly quickly about the quality (or lack of) in a conditioner.  This hair conditioner is way short of being an &amp;#34;amazing miracle.&amp;#34; It smells like plastic and does not condition my hair as well as other products and lines like &amp;#34;Desert Essence,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Avalon,&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;Jason.&amp;#34;  I need to go back and really look closely at the ingredients as it smells and acts like it has synthetic ingredients (many products that manufacturers claim to be all natural actually contain various forms of silicone - NOT a natural ingredient. It shows up as dimethicone and other ingredients that end in &amp;#34;...icone&amp;#34;).  I would not recommend this product line or this conditioner. UPDATE: PS 5/25/2015 Some consumer advocates need to get together and file a complaint against &amp;#34;Renpure&amp;#34; because the 4th ingredient in this so called &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; conditioner is Amodimethicone - basically silicone which is a man made (not organic) material comprised of plastic and other chemicals. Some researchers/scientists now believe that so much plastic going into the body over time can lead to hormonal disruption; not good - especially for our children, who are far more susceptible! Hormonal disruption is one of the main things that is causing our kids to go through early puberty and we do not yet know how that will play out on their reproductive health as adults. Remember, if it goes on your scalp or skin, it goes into your body. Many researchers also correlate a saturation of silicone and the 40 or so chemicals used in making them with the high increase in autoimmune diseases in women.  Sure, liquid plastic MAY leave your hair feeling soft, but I suggest a line like &amp;#34;Avalon,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Kiss My Face,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Desert Essence.&amp;#34; They are more expensive but you can use less overall and be assured that they won&#x27;t bea health threat. Also, a tsp. of pure, organic coconut oil mixed in with your conditioner and left in for five to ten minutes, will leave your hair incredibly soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse curly hair, and this conditioner didn&#x27;t do much for me. I&#x27;ve almost finished the entire bottle and I&#x27;m wishing I hadn&#x27;t even bought it. I think people with relatively \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair will probably love this - but I need something more intense for problem hair!</li>
            <li> My kids have very dry, curly hair. We have tried so many different products on their hair and have been dissatisfied with the result. This product is truly a miracle. Their hair is so hydrated after we use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is purely amazing the scent, feel, I love everything about the way this makes my hair feel it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> While cleaning out by bathroom drawers I came across a trial sample of Renpure Organics Amazing Miracle. I have no idea how I got it or how long I&#x27;ve had it but I SO wish I knew it was there! Wanting to \\&quot;use up\\&quot; items I tend to hang on to for far too long, I used it in my next shower. At first I thought it didn&#x27;t feel quite \\&quot;silky\\&quot; enough but I dutifully followed the directions and left it on my head for the alloted time. All I can say is OMIGOSH!! As my hair began to dry it was obvious it was the softest it had been in a long while! Two days later... still soft - no frizz! No Fly-away! So naturally, here I am buying two tubes! THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li> Really like this product. Thick, but not too thick, and does a good job moisturizing hair and smells great. I think it&#x27;s worth the extra few $$ and I will buy this again. It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it&#x27;s pretty damn good.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and frizzy long hair and this poduct really helps together with Renpure Organics Shampoo and Argan oil as a smoothing treatment. Higly recommended!</li>
            <li> Have used this for a few years. It repairs my color treated hair without weighing it down or feeling greasy. Great product!</li>
            <li> Excellent mask!Makes my curls shiny and moisterized!</li>
            <li> Very thick, great for tangles in long hair. Love the smell. Better than salon conditioners, and its ingredients are more natural. Plus, you can use it everyday!</li>
            <li> All natural so no toxins! Love how it makes my dry hair feel after using it. Use it with the matching shampoo too.</li>
            <li> This is truly an &amp;#34;Amazing Miracle&amp;#34;.  I have colored my hair for years and it was like straw until I began to use this.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thin..... And very Damaged...... I tried every conditioner, every Paul Mitchell didn&#x27;t work. But Renpure Oraganics Works.. I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My hair is soft and bouncy when I use this. Sometimes I put it on overnight to really give my hair body. I&#x27;m sold on it.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t made my hair feel any better. Keratin and even adding baby oil to my ends has done much more.</li>
            <li> I found this at the grocery store soon after moving to Florida but they discontinued selling it (I was probably the only person buying it). Moving here from Chicago where we had wonderful Great Lakes water,  I am not used to the Florida hard water which has a lot of iron in it, so I tone up my hair with a peroxide-based toner about every 3 months and spend a lot of time in the sun as well.  This product really gets through the hair shaft and makes it soft and shiny.  I even signed up for the subscription so it&#x27;ll be delivered monthly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t call your conditioner &amp;#34;Amazing Miracle&amp;#34; if it&#x27;s pretty much just standard conditioner. This product is fine. Nothing special though. I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone and I&#x27;ll keep looking for an amazing miracle.</li>
            <li> Great product. Recommend it for anyone male/female with unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> I really liked how this conditioned my  naturally wavy hair, though I did still have frizz. It was great at detangling and this thick formula left my hair feeling good. I had to stop using it because I realized it contains oil from macadamia nuts, which is a nut I&#x27;m allergic to. Maybe this will work for you.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been extremely delicate [could not even take permanents because of terrible hair breakage],and it&#x27;s also always been very fine, straight, limp, and with no &#x27;body&#x27; at all, so I&#x27;ve worn it fairly short. After about 3 months of using a very small amount of this product after my shampoo(about 3 times/week), and just leaving it in during the few minutes it takes to finish my shower, my hair has had a truly \\&quot;Amazing Miracle\\&quot; happen !  I have previously found that normal conditioners...even the expensive ones...usually leave my hair shiny, but still very limp and lifeless. This product is giving it wonderful &#x27;body&#x27; and bounce, and now my hair is even becoming slightly curly. I&#x27;m 80 yrs. old, and for the first time in my life, friends have started commenting on how great my hair looks and asking what I am doing to it!  I Love It!!</li>
            <li> I love what this product does to my hair. After leaving it in for three to five minutes, my hair is soft, silky, shiny, and completely tangle free. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Smells good, works real well. It&#x27;s Organic. Great price! Good buy. Would recommend it. I have dry and damaged hair and I&#x27;m liking it more each time I use it. Would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry, often frizzy, naturally curly hair.  The first time I used this product I thought, &amp;#34;Well, it made my hair softer,&amp;#34; but I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.  However, after using it several times, I noticed a real difference.  Renpure Amazing Miracle conditions my hair without making the curls flat, and actually makes it shine, something no other product has done!  I use it as both a daily conditioner and a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, and dry/damaged hair, and when I use this product it feels so much better throughout the day.</li>
            <li> very nice conditioner. it does just take a little and it smells and feels great. i will reorder this again.</li>
            <li> Finally, a conditioner that is formulated from natural ingredients that works! Woo hoo! This is now on my must have list. I love it, love it, love it. I have somewhat coarse naturally curly hair that is greying and this conditioner not only makes it shine, but also makes it softer and more manageable. It even tames the snarls. I have been telling friends and family that they have to have this product.</li>
            <li> Gives my Type 4c hair shine and manageability. I use it for 5 min in the shower...and comb my hair immediately. Then gently squeeze excess water from my strands before &amp;#34;t-shirt drying&amp;#34;. I like the definition that I get using this technique.&lt;br /&gt;[In the winter I often follow up using almond and/or olive oil as a leave-in conditioner. When it&#x27;s warm, I like a combination of a Shea Moisture leave-in with Abba&#x27;s (grapefruit scented!) texturizing cream (followed by their shine spray).]</li>
            <li> Works great, moisturizes hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I have used this Renpure product longer and love it for the&lt;br /&gt;amazing amount of body it gives my thinning hair.  Just a&lt;br /&gt;small amount as the last thing to put on the hair, rub it in, let it dry and&lt;br /&gt;then a huge wave of body is evident and I spray it and&lt;br /&gt;it is good for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Does just what it says it does.  Conditions wonderfully.  When I moved to the desert, my hair was a wreck.  The first two weeks of living here, my baby fine hair practically stood straight up on end CONSTANTLY because of the dryness.  This product immediately fixed that.  It rinses out clean. Great smell.  Organic.  Can&#x27;t beat it.  I will definitely be ordering this on a regular basis. I LOVE this company!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Makes hair amazingly, miraculously soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my thin, fine hair which gets challenged daily by sun, swimming (in summer) and dry cold (in winter)!  I use this in place of regular conditioners (which &amp;#34;go with&amp;#34; the shampoo).  My hair is less frizzy, flyaway, and dry when I use this.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective product! I love that it is organic and that it makes my hair really manageable. My daughter gave me my first tube of it as a gift and this is my second.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you first of all that I&#x27;ve been struggling with my hair condition (dry, damaged, frizzy and unmanageble). After so many research about the possible routine of curing my hair and turning it into healthier hair. I need to use products which are silicon and sulfate free. As a leave in treatment this Miracle cream really acts like a magic to my hair and it makes me run my fingres within my hari again and again. Above all this and that it is organic so you are using a good product into your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my hair.  I have dry curly medium length hair that is colored.  This helps to tame it and make it more manageable.</li>
            <li> love this conditioner!! adds shine and softness...have to wash again the next day a bit oily but the day of is nice</li>
            <li> was concerned there&#x27;d be a lingering smell but didn&#x27;t happen... it just works great.. I need six words to post this</li>
            <li> Love this mask. i bought  it first time in RiteAid,but stopped selling the product.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair so silky and smooth-unbelieviable. The mask also smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the $.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky curly hair. This is my favorite conditioner. My hair feels amazing when I use it. I also love the smell and only use it once a week. I wish they didn&#x27;t stop selling it in the stores :( it has very natural ingredients for a good price.</li>
            <li> This appears to be working. My hair appears to be growing in thicker. I use it with other Renpure products.</li>
            <li> Smells great, nice feel in the shower, but I can&#x27;t say it is an &amp;#34;amazing miracle&amp;#34; for damaged hair. It&#x27;s just a good conditioner and a decent price in the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; category.</li>
            <li> I swim every day during the summer, and my hair was suffering from my dedication.  It became straw-like, dry, and flyaway - impossible even to get a comb through it.  Renpure Organics Amazing Miracle was recommended to me by a Walgreen sales associate, and it truly does work wonders.  The dryness disappeared immediately.  I have my hair back!</li>
            <li> In searching for a deep conditioner to try, I came across 5 stars reviews of this product on a website.  With reviews like that I had to try it.  I think it is great!!!  This reconstructor does the trick.  I have long hair, and it only takes a few minutes during a shower to have soft and most important detangled hair.  And my hair can really tangle.  In addition, styling is a breeze.  At this low price, give it a try.</li>
