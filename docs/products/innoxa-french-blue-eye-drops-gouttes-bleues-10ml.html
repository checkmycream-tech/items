    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These are the best eye drops I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Accidentally scratched my eye once and the chamomile (I&#x27;m guessing) soothed my eye&lt;</li>
            <li>my friend said it is very good</li>
            <li>I ideally wanted to get rid of that..</li>
            <li>These drops are great.  </li>
            <li>works great,  doesn&#x27;t burn like some off the others.</li>
            <li>Bring the whites out nicely!</li>
            <li>Excellent love this product...</li>
            <li>Three stars because it&#x27;s pleasant on the eyes for dryness and soreness.  </li>
            <li>but they felt really good and soothing in my eye.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Using in combination with Rohto Maximum Cool.... works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product I love it</li>
            <li>Love this soothing eye lotion!</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular though.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>you may have better luck</li>
            <li>I love these eyedrops, I used to buy eyelite by mavala, but they no longer have them.</li>
            <li>These are the next best thing.</li>
            <li>can not tell the difference in whites, does not burn more like a refreshing eye drop.</li>
            <li>I really love Innoxa and have ordered another bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love ibut..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Must say this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Lovely product.</li>
            <li>I get better results with another brand.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say it &#x27;blues&#x27; my eyes, but it is the most soothing eye drop I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Beautiful clear eyes!</li>
            <li>Good when you need a fast brightening of the eyes.</li>
            <li>Strongly doubt I will repurchase or even request as a gift.</li>
            <li>Very pricey which would be OK if this were better than any drops you can buy in any drugstore, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>AM A HUGE LOYAL INNOXA EYE DROP USER.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li>Blue drops, are amazing for your eyes.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Tried Innoxa for two maybe three days without success.  </li>
            <li>I like them very much because make my eyes look great after a few droops.</li>
            <li>Worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I felt that these drops didn&#x27;t do much at all and almost dimmed my blue eyes.</li>
            <li>However the drops did not work what so ever if anything my eyes got more red</li>
            <li>Many years ago I used a product called Collyre Bleu (or similar name).</li>
            <li>Did not do any better than regular eye drops.</li>
            <li>even more red then before I started using it</li>
            <li>Made my eyes more blue when I used it.</li>
            <li>More blue water than product.</li>
            <li>You can get more shelf life at the local drug store.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product but it is pretty much just a cool looking Visine, that expires in 30 days.</li>
            <li>Pretty blue bottle and easy application.</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, I don&#x27;t see much difference between Innoxa and regular eye drops that clear redness.</li>
            <li>but I am super sensitive.</li>
            <li>But certainly doesn&#x27;t change the color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine as a regular eye-drop though.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and did help to brighten my eyes.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Did not care for too much</li>
            <li>I also couldn&#x27;t tell if my eyes were really whiterâ€¦save your money and don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>Great for tired, irritated eyes.</li>
            <li>Very temporary.</li>
            <li>At this price point, expected much more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they changed the look of my eyes all that much</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything they said it would.  </li>
            <li>didnt really notice a change in my eyes...</li>
            <li>Ok wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>They are similarly priced so I&#x27;ll probably stick with this one since I kind of like seeing the blue in my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was excited to finally find this product ...</li>
            <li>Keeps my blue eyes blue - so refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I heard these really make your eyes look brighter, but when I put them in bright blue tears rolled down my face and left marks that I had to scrub off.</li>
            <li>I have used the drops consistently every morning for about one week and see no difference to the white of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a different brand or more expensive formula might work better</li>
            <li>(I have heard of the wonders of &amp;#34;blue drops&amp;#34; from co-workers who are on TV all the time as live hosts and need to have clear eyes).</li>
            <li>This is not a startling effect--like colored contact lenses--but the brightening up is worth the cost of the small bottle.</li>
            <li>These makes my eyes look crystal clear.</li>
            <li>The absolute only thing these drops did was temporary relief from dryness.</li>
            <li>I don t think that these drops did very much as far as whitening is concerned.</li>
            <li>I was really curious about these drops making my already blue eyes, more blue, so I dished out the 20 dollars to see if they worked.</li>
            <li>They just look normal and slightly naturally red.</li>
            <li>I first used husband&#x27;s drops for contact users irritated eyes, did nothing to ease my extreme pain.</li>
            <li>Hmm... they don&#x27;t clear your eyes and make them pure white like Visine or Clear Eyes, but on the other hand, the drops do feel soothing and my eyes aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;bloodshot&amp;#34; and bleary looking.</li>
            <li>The funky blue liquid is quite cool but does work as well as some other products to take the red away from your eyes if that&#x27;s what you are looking for</li>
            <li>thanks but no thanks</li>
            <li>So to me it was not worth the higher price.</li>

            <li> So to me it was not worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my eyes, but definitely noticed my blue/grey skin stains :/</li>
            <li> I use only a single drop, and that takes out any redness (form allergies) as well.  </li>
            <li> I have an astigmatism in both of my eyes, my eyes over work themselves on a daily basis which gives me terrible vision and frequent painful migraines, I originally bought these drops to make my whites whiter and in the process found the best thing for my migraines ever!</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s not returnable so be careful before you purchase it for red, irritated eyes.</li>
            <li> As a tip, apply this prior to putting on make up and putting on a shirt; otherwise, expect blue streaks down your face and chest.</li>
            <li> I use them regularly in the morning before putting my contacts in and these work just as well as my other brand.</li>
            <li> I have dry eyes</li>
            <li> but I recommend for dry eyes!</li>
            <li> It stings a little but there has been no visible change in white of eye or eye color.</li>
            <li> they help to prevent my migraines by relaxing my eyes and if I didn&#x27;t use the drops and got a migraine several dosages of these and a few minutes of relaxing</li>
            <li> it took a week for white of eyes but my dry eyes are no more.</li>
            <li> It is a subtle beauty secret and kinda fun!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the claim and reviews that it made the whites of your eyes appear brighter and whiter.</li>
            <li> The drops were soothing, but so are other drops that you can buy a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> any other drops could.</li>
            <li> Pretty useless.</li>
            <li> Well, the drops are soothing, However, it was no more soothing than an over the counter eye drops at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was not worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these drops everyday for 3 wks now and there totally mediocre, definately blue, and it definately gives a burning sensation that subsides after a minute everytime for me thus far.</li>
            <li> I used these drops and let the drops fall from my eyes down my cheeks and my cheeks</li>
            <li> I mean seriously red.</li>
            <li> I have blue eyes, between harsh sunlight and a job that requires hours of computer work, my eyes often look really dull.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything but make a mess in your eye.</li>
            <li> However, the drops are soothing and make my eyes feel a little refreshed in the morning.</li>
            <li> Innoxa &amp;#34;whitens&amp;#34; my cornea noticeably and lightens/brightens the iris a little.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money ... didnt even do a little of what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and it only made it worse, had to rinse the drops out, pronto.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and didn&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li> I would call them all but worthless, and frankly, not only not worth the money, but a true rip-off.</li>
            <li> Money wasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early thirties, hazel brown eyes, I just haven&#x27;t had a miraculous experience again mediocre.</li>
            <li> Waste of money...</li>
            <li> Basically it&#x27;s expensive eye drops with blue dye.</li>
            <li> I flushed my eye then kept closed for a few VOILA!!!!</li>
            <li> but it is soothing at least it didn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> At least not for me.</li>
            <li> Packaging is horrible, cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> This product sucks it made my eyes</li>
            <li> Seriously</li>
            <li> False advertising.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> what can I say the product is over rated was not impressed with the results</li>
            <li> Also very irritating even with followed directions.</li>
            <li> but the contents expire after 30 days which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> Another disappointing buy.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t seem to do anything :(</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t get that again. :-(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> These drops will make you go blind!!!</li>
            <li> gave me a terrible eye infection, face was swollen for 3 days.</li>
            <li> Hated to give it one star!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed !</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

            <li> gave me a terrible eye infection, face was swollen for 3 days.</li>
            <li> Bring the whites out nicely!</li>
            <li> I was excited to finally find this product ... I&#x27;ve used it now for over 3 wks It does nothing except stain anything it gets on</li>
            <li> turned my skin blue, I had to use it only before showering... Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my eyes, but definitely noticed my blue/grey skin stains :/</li>
            <li> Not as whitening as I thought they would be from the ad.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t whiten at all but feels soothing</li>
            <li> Love this soothing eye lotion!</li>
            <li> Very soothing and did help to brighten my eyes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make the whites of your eyes whiter but it is soothing at least it didn&#x27;t for me you may have better luck</li>
            <li> The product did not whiten around my eyes nor did it brighten the brown. I will not be ordering again, if anyone knows a products that actually does work pls let me know at princesabaj5@gmail.com thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the claim and reviews that it made the whites of your eyes appear brighter and whiter. The drops are blue and the color is supposed to counteract any yellow to the white area of the eye. I have used the drops consistently every morning for about one week and see no difference to the white of my eyes. My eyes still appear to have a yellow tinge and are bloodshot (work all day on the computer and lack of sleep). However, the drops are soothing and make my eyes feel a little refreshed in the morning. WARNING: I used these drops and let the drops fall from my eyes down my cheeks and my cheeks stained blue. I had to used makeup remover to get the stain out.</li>
            <li> Hmm... they don&#x27;t clear your eyes and make them pure white like Visine or Clear Eyes, but on the other hand, the drops do feel soothing and my eyes aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;bloodshot&amp;#34; and bleary looking. They just look normal and slightly naturally red. Perhaps a different brand or more expensive formula might work better (I have heard of the wonders of &amp;#34;blue drops&amp;#34; from co-workers who are on TV all the time as live hosts and need to have clear eyes). But it may not be this brand that does the trick.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> Yikes!  What a waste of money.  Did nothing to brighten my eyes or relieve redness.  The drops were soothing, but so are other drops that you can buy a lot cheaper.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent love this product...</li>
            <li> These drops are great.  Do not burn when you apply.  Brightens up eyes and takes the red and irritation away.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love these eyedrops, I used to buy eyelite by mavala, but they no longer have them. These are the next best thing.</li>
            <li> can not tell the difference in whites, does not burn more like a refreshing eye drop.</li>
            <li> Pretty blue bottle and easy application. However the drops did not work what so ever if anything my eyes got more red I mean seriously red. Also very irritating even with followed directions. All in all in does nothing the product advertise. At least not for me. Sooo</li>
            <li> Good when you need a fast brightening of the eyes.</li>
            <li> I could not tell any difference in eye color (blue) or the white whiter. Basically it&#x27;s expensive eye drops with blue dye.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything but make a mess in your eye. Such a bull product.&lt;br /&gt;Would of returned it but threw away the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Three stars because it&#x27;s pleasant on the eyes for dryness and soreness.  However, this product does NOT whiten eyes nor does it remove the redness.  I will buy it again; however, because of its soothing properties.  As a tip, apply this prior to putting on make up and putting on a shirt; otherwise, expect blue streaks down your face and chest.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Only thing it did was stain my shirt blue. Did not make my blue eyes any bluer. Not a product to be recommended to anyone. The manufacturer should be ashamed.</li>
            <li> what can I say the product is over rated was not impressed with the results wont buy it again or recommend it...</li>
            <li> Did not do what it promised to do. My eyes did not get white at all, not even close.</li>
            <li> It did help in relift/relax the eye abit. But not even abit of whitening at all.</li>
            <li> Beautiful clear eyes!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my eyes, only made them burn. I have dry eyes and it only made it worse, had to rinse the drops out, pronto. Packaging is horrible, cheap stuff. Shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to sell on internet.</li>
            <li> So I like the Collyre  Bleu Laiter drops but was enticed by the price of the Innoxa.  Forget about it!  Tried Innoxa for two maybe three days without success.  I&#x27;m back to Collyre Bleu no matter what the price. thanks but no thanks</li>
            <li> Keeps my blue eyes blue - so refreshing.  I really love Innoxa and have ordered another bottle.  Recommended to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Only need to use drops once a day with this product.eyes stay soothed all day.I love ibut..it took a week for white of eyes but my dry eyes are no more. I have contacts but use 15 minutes before putting contacts in..</li>
            <li> Using in combination with Rohto Maximum Cool.... works great!</li>
            <li> no result, just blue tears. I ordered one but was shipped and charged for two</li>
            <li> The funky blue liquid is quite cool but does work as well as some other products to take the red away from your eyes if that&#x27;s what you are looking for</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t some miracle eye-drop and no one noticed any difference in my eyes when I used it. It&#x27;s fine as a regular eye-drop though. I use them regularly in the morning before putting my contacts in and these work just as well as my other brand. They are similarly priced so I&#x27;ll probably stick with this one since I kind of like seeing the blue in my eyes. Nothing spectacular though.</li>
            <li> I like this product, because it does bring out the blue in my eyes. It is a subtle beauty secret and kinda fun!</li>
            <li> Blue drops, are amazing for your eyes. I like them very much because make my eyes look great after a few droops.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this product, but after ordering it, I can say it DOES brighten your eyes.  I have blue eyes, between harsh sunlight and a job that requires hours of computer work, my eyes often look really dull.  Innoxa &amp;#34;whitens&amp;#34; my cornea noticeably and lightens/brightens the iris a little.  This is not a startling effect--like colored contact lenses--but the brightening up is worth the cost of the small bottle. I use only a single drop, and that takes out any redness (form allergies) as well.  I especially like its moisturizing qualities.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product I love it</li>
            <li> Hated to give it one star! Didn&#x27;t do anything to my eyes!</li>
            <li> AM A HUGE LOYAL INNOXA EYE DROP USER. TRIED EYEDEW AND BURNED MY EYES AND JUST TOSSED OUT, WAS TRYING TO SAVE A COUPLE OF BUCKS BUT, A NO GO. SO, STICKING WITH MY INNOXA!! THEY ROCK!!</li>
            <li> works great,  doesn&#x27;t burn like some off the others.</li>
            <li> my friend said it is very good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and didn&#x27;t do anything.  The product expires in 28 days after opening...</li>
            <li> I have blue eyes andthese don&#x27;t seem to make them bluer. A vanity purchase on my part</li>
            <li> All I can say is it did NOT work.  I bought it for red eye and no change at all.  I followed the directions, I tried it several times, and no change at all.  And, it&#x27;s not returnable so be careful before you purchase it for red, irritated eyes.</li>
            <li> Did not care for too much but I am super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I heard these really make your eyes look brighter, but when I put them in bright blue tears rolled down my face and left marks that I had to scrub off. Next time, I just put one drop in each eye, but the tear ducts in the corners of my eyes were still stained. I also couldn&#x27;t tell if my eyes were really whiterâ€¦save your money and don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> I have an astigmatism in both of my eyes, my eyes over work themselves on a daily basis which gives me terrible vision and frequent painful migraines, I originally bought these drops to make my whites whiter and in the process found the best thing for my migraines ever! they help to prevent my migraines by relaxing my eyes and if I didn&#x27;t use the drops and got a migraine several dosages of these and a few minutes of relaxing took it all away. If you suffer from migraines caused by an astigmatism or overactive eyes I Highly recommend this!!! If you seek to simply whiten your eyes this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything at all. It was not worth the money and I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I did not see a noticeable change in appearance of my eyes from the Innoxa Blue Drops.  I did not have any allergic reaction to this product which is a plus but the contents expire after 30 days which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> These makes my eyes look crystal clear. Worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> I try to keep a bottle on hand, always! These are the best eye drops I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Accidentally scratched my eye once and the chamomile (I&#x27;m guessing) soothed my eye&lt;br /&gt;unlike any other drops could. I first used husband&#x27;s drops for contact users irritated eyes, did nothing to ease my extreme pain. Then I thought of my lil blue bottle of drops! I flushed my eye then kept closed for a few VOILA!!!! PAIN SUBSIDED!!! Great for tired, irritated eyes. I have tried everything (homeopathic included). Must say this is my favorite.  Btw: I do not wear contacts. Oh they do help with whitening</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t seem to do anything :(</li>
            <li> The absolute only thing these drops did was temporary relief from dryness. Very temporary. I would call them all but worthless, and frankly, not only not worth the money, but a true rip-off.</li>
            <li> The bottle (stopper) immediately malfunctioned.  Overpriced eye drops.  Feel like the same effect could be gotten at a drugstore for fraction of cost.</li>
            <li> Lovely product. Quite soothing eye drops</li>
            <li> It did not meet my expectations at all.</li>
            <li> It does not give me blue color</li>
            <li> Many years ago I used a product called Collyre Bleu (or similar name). I thought this was the same type of product as it claims to do the same thing. Quite honestly, I don&#x27;t see much difference between Innoxa and regular eye drops that clear redness. At this price point, expected much more</li>
            <li> This product does not do what it claims to do. Money wasted.</li>
            <li> This did nothing. Seriously</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these drops everyday for 3 wks now and there totally mediocre, definately blue, and it definately gives a burning sensation that subsides after a minute everytime for me thus far. I&#x27;m in my early thirties, hazel brown eyes, I just haven&#x27;t had a miraculous experience again mediocre. Strongly doubt I will repurchase or even request as a gift. Also I do keep mine refrigerated, just a caution to somewhat preserve the contents. Was gonna post a b4 and now, but there&#x27;s genuienly nothing to see but eyeballs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they changed the look of my eyes all that much but they felt really good and soothing in my eye.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I still have the yellow spots in my eyes from the sun. I ideally wanted to get rid of that..</li>
            <li> Did not do any better than regular eye drops. So to me it was not worth the higher price. So I will not buy them again.</li>
            <li> Waste of money ... didnt even do a little of what it said it would do. Very disappointed !</li>
            <li> I don t think that these drops did very much as far as whitening is concerned.</li>
            <li> I see no visible difference in the whites of my eyes. I get better results with another brand.</li>
            <li> This product sucks it made my eyes even more red then before I started using it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it &#x27;blues&#x27; my eyes, but it is the most soothing eye drop I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> False advertising. It stings a little but there has been no visible change in white of eye or eye color. I will go back to Visine when it&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li> this gives the impression that the drops will enhance the color of your eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Soothing eyes? Maybe. But certainly doesn&#x27;t change the color. My eyes are blue and there was no change.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything they said it would.  Another disappointing buy.  Won&#x27;t get that again. :-(</li>
            <li> Terrible. Does not even help your eyes. doesn&#x27;t help redness, add color, or irritation. Nothing. It&#x27;s basically water you&#x27;re dropping into your eye.</li>
            <li> I already have blue eyes and used it in the summer to moisturize my eyes. Worked well. Made my eyes more blue when I used it. Loved it.</li>
            <li> Pretty useless. Does not perform as directed.  More blue water than product. Waste of money!!!!</li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t work, not what I read it would do to help brighten eyes. so I will not try again</li>
            <li> didnt really notice a change in my eyes...</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me.  It did not make my eyes clearer nor did it remove redness.  Waste of money...</li>
            <li> I was really curious about these drops making my already blue eyes, more blue, so I dished out the 20 dollars to see if they worked. Honestly, I felt that these drops didn&#x27;t do much at all and almost dimmed my blue eyes. Also, I didn&#x27;t like the fact that the shelf life is only a month. I&#x27;d pass on this product if I were you.</li>
            <li> These drops will make you go blind!!!</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me.  I am returning to Collyre Bleau.</li>
            <li> Well, the drops are soothing, However, it was no more soothing than an over the counter eye drops at your local drug store. Save Your Money! I gave it ONE star for the attempt of the maker. It also has a short shelf life. You can get more shelf life at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> Product works just like it says.</li>
            <li> Very pricey which would be OK if this were better than any drops you can buy in any drugstore, but it&#x27;s not. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ok wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works well to moisture but I thought it would make the whites of my eyes whiter, or make my eyes sparkle or something haha but I recommend for dry eyes!</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product but it is pretty much just a cool looking Visine, that expires in 30 days. I will keep using it while I have it but won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> These drops are so soothing. I know I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I could not see any difference after having used this product.</li>
