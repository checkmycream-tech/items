            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>She was absolutely thrilled when she received it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have always wanted my own thinning shears.  </li>
            <li>Nice price.</li>

            <li>Plastic case is a nice plus for keeping it protected.</li>

            <li>... glad I bought these.</li>
            <li>I have used this Shears many times.  </li>
            <li>Glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li>I am completely pleased with these thinning shears.  </li>
            <li>my hair is a lot thinner now and love it.</li>
            <li>These work perfectly and are light enough that even a non-professional can use with ease.</li>
            <li>rarely pulls any hair, and it looks good after (more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; specially where the hair is spiky).</li>
            <li>Much better than the cheap, non-branded, non-Prime shears out there on Amazon.</li>
            <li>When using them make sure it&#x27;s not cutting the hairs that lay on top</li>
            <li>and then they worked fine.</li>
            <li>but it works fine</li>
            <li>Cheap but gets the job done and thinned my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li>super doper....</li>
            <li>They get the job done, but aren&#x27;t super quick.</li>
            <li>These shears work great, small and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>They handled doing my hair REALLY well, and my hair is super long and extremely thick...didn&#x27;t pull or hurt and thinned a great amount of hair out!</li>
            <li>This pair is very affordable, yet cuts very cleanly and is (so far) quite durable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it once, for the first time ever doing this sort of thing as I am no expert</li>
            <li>Its the first time I ever use one of these (followed UTUBE videos and bough by the reviews here); so  I cannot compare it to anything else -</li>
            <li>First set of thinning shears but it works just like I expect it too.</li>
            <li>These work great for thinning really thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe Lure thinning shears have any positive reviews.</li>
            <li>have used other thinning shears, but this one is by far Superior.  </li>
            <li>And for the price, I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>These work very well.</li>
            <li>They work VERY well, but upon arrival I noticed that they were already used for somebody else..</li>
            <li>These shears pull my hair and do NOT thin it out at all.</li>
            <li>I have used several pairs of cheap thinning shears...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for at home use!</li>
            <li>Seems to be very well made.</li>
            <li>These really helped me take the weight out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I keep the sides super short, but I like the top to be a couple of inches long.</li>
            <li>These easily take out large chunks of hair at a time, and cut easily through thick sections.</li>
            <li>Cuts clean, fits my big hands and does what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li>I love these, I cut some hair like an inch-an inch and a half away from my scalp and it really takes out the hideous bulk.</li>
            <li>cute while it lasted, but not worth the $$.</li>
            <li>could they really vary so much from one set of shears to the next?</li>
            <li>I have thick hair..very very thick...cant get better than that.</li>
            <li>I first bought it at a local dept. store.</li>
            <li>I take a section of my hair to be thinned out, and after 5-6 tries with these shears, my hair being pulled the whole time, there is only 1 or 2 hairs that have been &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; or more likely just ripped out of my head from these scissors</li>
            <li>After awhile that hair gets too heavy, and these little shears were great to take out some of the extra hair.</li>
            <li>The product description on Amazon clearly says, &amp;#34;Made in the US&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But I purchased the product because the description clearly says, &amp;#34;Made in the US&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Was skeptical at first on which one to buy glad</li>
            <li>Definitely works well; first time cutting my own hair and it turned out great according to random people on the street!</li>
            <li>and it can really thin the hair much more than you wanted if your not careful.  </li>
            <li>good cutting quality</li>
            <li>Stiff at first-</li>

            <li> Stiff at first-</li>
            <li> It looks like the blades may be slightly bent so that they can&#x27;t open and close smoothly regardless of how tight or loose the screw is.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect them to be so small.</li>
            <li> Then again, I&#x27;m no professional barber.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional stylist.  </li>
            <li> I ordered from Sundance Beauty and received scissors that were not new.</li>
            <li> you can store it back in the little case as well and zip it shut.</li>
            <li> Work as expected</li>
            <li> However it pulled my hair somewhat harder than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I have thick black hair, but this thinning scissors is easy to thin my hair.</li>
            <li> I use these every other hair cut to take some of the bulk out.  </li>
            <li> My beautician always leaves a few sections of my hair too long and these fix this without noticeable &amp;#34;chopped&amp;#34; spots.</li>
            <li> The only reason I haven&#x27;t owned thinning shears in the past was the cost.</li>
            <li> Had it less than a week and it already broke.</li>
            <li> They kinda get stuck in my hair, but I think that&#x27;s typical of non-professional grade thinning shears.</li>
            <li> , I have long curly hair that is very thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that someone returned them because they are so difficult to open</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s my fault or the shears&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Silly me, someone already left a comment concerning the false advertising, but I missed it somehow.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> This is frustrating because I chose these shears based on the fact that the description says it was made in USA.</li>
            <li> you want to thin out the hairs underneath.</li>
            <li> I use this to thin my hair.</li>
            <li> these are by far the worst.</li>
            <li> I Just received this shear today and I am very disappointed in the fact that it is actually made in China.</li>
            <li> or are these fake reviews?</li>
            <li> I would return them, but I am desperate for a pair.</li>
            <li> Thins his hair without cutting it all off.</li>
            <li> Make alot of noise and feel resistance while cutting.</li>
            <li> Ur obvi doing it wrong!</li>
            <li> Which I had found VERY weird.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> All these peoples reviews about them sucking or snagging are retarded.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good quality for the price.I would purchase again if needed.Does the job.</li>
            <li> Nice quality. Work as expected</li>
            <li> They get the job done. And for the price, I can&#x27;t really complain. But they don&#x27;t work very smoothly, and they tend to pull some hair out.</li>
            <li> These work great, I have long curly hair that is very thick.  I use these every other hair cut to take some of the bulk out.  I recommend watching the video on how to use thinning shears on you tube before doing it yourself.  You definitely don&#x27;t want to overuse these and it can really thin the hair much more than you wanted if your not careful.  good cutting quality... glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> Silly me, someone already left a comment concerning the false advertising, but I missed it somehow. This is frustrating because I chose these shears based on the fact that the description says it was made in USA. But no, the package definately says &amp;#34;China&amp;#34; on the back.</li>
            <li> Had it less than a week and it already broke. cute while it lasted, but not worth the $$. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> good quality shears at a great price.</li>
            <li> Definitely works well; first time cutting my own hair and it turned out great according to random people on the street! However it pulled my hair somewhat harder than I had expected. Then again, I&#x27;m no professional barber. A downside is that my haircut seems to attract prostitutes.</li>
            <li> They kinda get stuck in my hair, but I think that&#x27;s typical of non-professional grade thinning shears.</li>
            <li> These shears work great, small and easy to handle.  I never had any before, but this pair works and handles good.</li>
            <li> I have used this Shears many times.  I first bought it at a local dept. store. Then my friend asked if she could borrow it and she loved it.  Her birthday was coming up and I ordered one for her.  She was absolutely thrilled when she received it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other thinning shears, but this one is by far Superior.  Reminder - Do not cut horizontal across your hair; cut&lt;br /&gt;vertically.</li>
            <li> Cuts clean, fits my big hands and does what its suppose to do. I don&#x27;t have any complaints yet. I haven&#x27;t felt it pull yet either.</li>
            <li> These work very well.</li>
            <li> They get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted my own thinning shears.  These are wonderful quality and so easy to use. My beautician always leaves a few sections of my hair too long and these fix this without noticeable &amp;#34;chopped&amp;#34; spots.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I just started working at a hair salon. They work VERY well, but upon arrival I noticed that they were already used for somebody else.. Which I had found VERY weird. I would return them, but I am desperate for a pair.</li>
            <li> Stiff at first- I oiled mine and loosened them up a bit, and then they worked fine. Nice price.</li>
            <li> These shears pull my hair and do NOT thin it out at all. I have used several pairs of cheap thinning shears...these are by far the worst. They do not cut ANY of the hairs. I take a section of my hair to be thinned out, and after 5-6 tries with these shears, my hair being pulled the whole time, there is only 1 or 2 hairs that have been &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; or more likely just ripped out of my head from these scissors pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe Lure thinning shears have any positive reviews. could they really vary so much from one set of shears to the next? or are these fake reviews?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional stylist.  I got these shears to trim my bangs between haircuts.  They work great and don&#x27;t pull my hair!  Highly recommended for at home use!</li>
            <li> I ordered from Sundance Beauty and received scissors that were not new. I&#x27;m guessing that someone returned them because they are so difficult to open/close because someone had poured a bunch of oil on the screw so that it was running on the scissors and inside the package. The scissors themselves had hair on them. It looks like the blades may be slightly bent so that they can&#x27;t open and close smoothly regardless of how tight or loose the screw is. The seller did give me a refund and an apology, but I waited around on these to come when I could have been purchasing a pair that I can actually use. Also, the entire scissor is 5.5&amp;#34;, not just the blade. I didn&#x27;t really expect them to be so small.</li>
            <li> Not good. But it works.</li>
            <li> Seems to be very well made. Used it once, for the first time ever doing this sort of thing as I am no expert and it was great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well made and substantial these are for the price.  They worked perfectly and were exactly what was needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get these instead of paying incredible prices at a salon.</li>
            <li> It works well. Its the first time I ever use one of these (followed UTUBE videos and bough by the reviews here); so  I cannot compare it to anything else - but it works fine I think. rarely pulls any hair, and it looks good after (more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; specially where the hair is spiky). saving on barbers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning to use these on myself.  They tend to pull on my hair.  Not sure if that&#x27;s my fault or the shears&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Love them!!! All these peoples reviews about them sucking or snagging are retarded. Ur obvi doing it wrong! Was skeptical at first on which one to buy glad I went with these. Cheap but gets the job done and thinned my hair tremendously. Great smart buy. Glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li> They handled doing my hair REALLY well, and my hair is super long and extremely thick...didn&#x27;t pull or hurt and thinned a great amount of hair out! you can store it back in the little case as well and zip it shut.</li>
            <li> I got these to do my dog&#x27;s grooming they are perfect.</li>
            <li> I am completely pleased with these thinning shears.  They work great.  When using them make sure it&#x27;s not cutting the hairs that lay on top or they may show up as fly away hair.  you want to thin out the hairs underneath.</li>
            <li> Loved using it on my cat!  He looked like he went through the lawn mower though!  My neighbors all got a good kick out of it!</li>
            <li> super doper....they worked great!....I have thick hair..very very thick...cant get better than that. my hair is a lot thinner now and love it.</li>
            <li> Much better than the cheap, non-branded, non-Prime shears out there on Amazon. This pair is very affordable, yet cuts very cleanly and is (so far) quite durable.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that these scissors do take a lot of hair off compared to the double-sided thinning shears that I&#x27;m used to. These easily take out large chunks of hair at a time, and cut easily through thick sections.</li>
            <li> I use this to thin my hair. I have thick black hair, but this thinning scissors is easy to thin my hair. Great use!!!</li>
            <li> These really helped me take the weight out of my hair. I keep the sides super short, but I like the top to be a couple of inches long. After awhile that hair gets too heavy, and these little shears were great to take out some of the extra hair. They are a nice weight, and I can&#x27;t believe the quality for the price. The only reason I haven&#x27;t owned thinning shears in the past was the cost. They also come in a very nice case.</li>
            <li> I purchased to cut my dogs hair with. Works great. Thins his hair without cutting it all off.</li>
            <li> Good for the price, but nothing spectacular. They get the job done, but aren&#x27;t super quick.</li>
            <li> First set of thinning shears but it works just like I expect it too. Cuts the hair with ease and doesn&#x27;t pull any out. Plastic case is a nice plus for keeping it protected.</li>
            <li> Make alot of noise and feel resistance while cutting. But they serve there purpose.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly and are light enough that even a non-professional can use with ease. Great product!</li>
            <li> I Just received this shear today and I am very disappointed in the fact that it is actually made in China. The product description on Amazon clearly says, &amp;#34;Made in the US&amp;#34;. The the shear I received has the model #1016L and says, &amp;#34;China&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried out the shear. But I purchased the product because the description clearly says, &amp;#34;Made in the US&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can something described as &amp;#34;Made in the US&amp;#34; &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &amp;#34;China&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> These work great for thinning really thick hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I love these, I cut some hair like an inch-an inch and a half away from my scalp and it really takes out the hideous bulk.</li>
