            <li>It kind of had a funky smell too...</li>
            <li>I had lost quite a bit of volume in my breasts after losing weight so I decided to try this cream since it had so many good reviews .</li>
            <li>smells nice not to greasy.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t do anything but smell nice and make my boobs feel sticky.</li>
            <li>My wife loved it and would like to buy more if we have a chance to go to USA again.</li>
            <li>Both smell nice too.</li>
            <li>To be honest i didn&#x27;t notice any diffrence.</li>
            <li>But it feels nice on.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re wanting max results I&#x27;d use some very easy chest exercises you could google online to help the process.</li>
            <li>The price was great and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>it will be a litle economical (shipping wise) and their response was liek</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t need more than a minute or two to rub it in thoroughly.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t have that chemical perfume smell but more like the ingredients that the cream is made of which I like better.</li>
            <li>I hope it on many times a day for a month.</li>
            <li>feel like you would seriously be better off just exercises and stop wishing miracles will happen to your breasts.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>It make my breast more silky touch</li>
            <li>Way better compared applying K-Y jelly or oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not my favorite thing to smell like.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Im so pleased with the fragrance</li>
            <li>BUT IM SURE</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cute,</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>They are just so touchable and smooth that I feel like a guy, I can&#x27;t keep my own hands off them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>So when I put this on I made sure to rub in between my fingers as well.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>so I liked how amazon had it available.</li>
            <li>In terms of the effectiveness of the product&#x27;s claims, I can&#x27;t be sure.  </li>
            <li>Nice cream, pleasant smelling, and makes breasts very soft.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet in these places, but I think this rich, nice-smelling cream helps keep my skin supple.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference, but the smell is good and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>recommend strongly.</li>
            <li>but it does have a strong scent to it</li>
            <li>FREE sometingI did not expect eitehr ask for, to me</li>
            <li>However the shipping was fast and the packaging was nice.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find it on Amazon after failing to locate it anywhere locally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shea and cocoa butter based in a gel cream that does not seem to be filled with a bunch of cones which my skin can not tolerate.</li>
            <li>This is also free of parabens</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>When I now put on  my bra that lifted my breast and gave me great cleavage with my boobs touching each other now they don&#x27;t even touch.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this product.</li>
            <li>I got this product originally b/c</li>
            <li>The cream has a unique aroma.  </li>
            <li>I was a full 34dd I used the product because I started working out to tone up and lose my stomach.</li>
            <li>may not be the same product but the quality better and their customer service better</li>
            <li>I have not used it more than three consecutive days, each day it improves more than the last.</li>
            <li>this arrived quickly and I just couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>and it soaks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>It firms and adsorbs very fast!  </li>
            <li>It that real cocoa butter scent so it has to be strong.</li>
            <li>Skin appears firmer and more supple and feels very soft.</li>
            <li>but after a few seconds it becomes a light, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>Works great for firming even helped lift a little.  </li>
            <li>Deff worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am now trying to see how I can enhance naturally and feel confident again.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>They give you your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>The cream also has a very cocoa buttery smell which is pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a significant change</li>
            <li>I used it right away.</li>
            <li>The others were right</li>
            <li>I have used this product for two years now, after trying all sorts of other products, but this is clearly the best even for natural DD cups!</li>
            <li>Purely by happenstance I stumbled on Palmer&#x27;s Bust Cream being lauded on Makeup Alley, not so much as a bust cream, but instead an amazing firming and moisturizing facial cream.</li>
            <li>since I had my first child and have been breastfeeding her for 9 months.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars though because I really can&#x27;t stand how it smells!</li>
            <li>For more moderate breasts, this cream, along with exercise and diet, will work wonders.  </li>
            <li>I used this product consistently for a month or so</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been consistent</li>
            <li>It works pretty well on face for firming.</li>
            <li>hahaha, after loosing weight, it needs help too!</li>
            <li>This seems to be working pretty well.</li>
            <li>This product is highly recommended by my pregnant friend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, and so far, it didn&#x27;t really do much for my really light stretch marks and didn&#x27;t make my bust any firmer, but it makes my skin look and feel soft and great, and I love the cocoa smell.</li>
            <li>If you combine this cream with various breast lift exercises, you will notice your breasts becoming firmer and somewhat higher.  </li>
            <li>I look forward to seeing full results in a few weeks :)</li>
            <li>About 145lbs and a rather large bust</li>
            <li>Large but not in charge,</li>
            <li>certainly did what it said, after loosing 20 lbs I needed to tighten my akin and this did just that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a certain firming quality to the cream because they do seem a bit perkier which is much more than I ever expected.  </li>
            <li>i been using this for a bit and havent seen much results.</li>
            <li>also i dont really like the smell of ..</li>
            <li>I guess, this cream isn&#x27;t something very helpful.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend really enjoys them.</li>
            <li>Received shipment fast.</li>
            <li>Combining the cream really has helped.     </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re not going to see very noticeable result unless you exercise as well.</li>
            <li>This product did what I hoped it would, I was not expecting it to make my natural DD breasts look like fresh implants.</li>
            <li>one time I may have rubbed too much because a lot comes out</li>
            <li>no firmness felt real saggy.</li>
            <li>It does its job, and leaves your bosom feeling much perkier and tighter over time.</li>
            <li>really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>I think that is a reasonable amount of time to see if something is working..</li>
            <li>Within a week, my skin looks fresh and clear and my tone has improved.  </li>
            <li>but I think this is a quality product that does deliver the science of what a cream really can do.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it.</li>
            <li>Not too much.</li>
            <li>It does make my breasts softer but not so much of tightness yet.</li>
            <li>and I really do not know why this has not attained cult favorite status.</li>
            <li>And it really works at fading scars.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, i like it.</li>
            <li>I had really wanted this to work, but honestly I think I could probably get the same results rubbing regular lotion into my skin.</li>
            <li>It did ship fast.</li>
            <li>It improves the bust&#x27;s tone slightly after every use, I&#x27;m pretty sure because it is a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My breast feel mushy and light  when at first they were heavy and firmer at first before use of product.</li>
            <li>but I have already used half of its contents and I am still waiting for better results.  </li>
            <li>Non greasy,absorbs quickly and definitely has firming effect.</li>
            <li>I love this product it actually tight</li>
            <li>The smell is a little off putting to me, but not terrible.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t convinced by other reviews when they said that it absorbs quickly, but it does!</li>
            <li>so I feel safer slathering this all over myself - unlike some of the other firming creams available.</li>
            <li>It also makes your bust very soft.</li>
            <li>i would still give it a high rating for how soft it makes my breasts feel.  </li>
            <li>Munchkin &#x27;White Hot&#x27; Duck Bath Toy (Baby Product).</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it&#x27;s cheap, you&#x27;ll pay a lot of money for pills and other creams that barely show a difference.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>If you are over 40, it doesn&#x27;t work to firm your bust, but it does leave your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days, but so far I am extremely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 with a 6 month old.</li>
            <li>2 weeks so far, no change, but will keep using it.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 20 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30, and I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Opposite of the description much?</li>
            <li>So far, I have no rash (which I tend to get because my skin is sensitive).</li>
            <li>Lefty skin so soft and</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t make my skin nearly as soft as the body lotion.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell and not sure its really doing anything.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t pay attention to this review because there is so many positive ones, but i hope you can prove me wrong..</li>
            <li>I have tried Palmers for various reasons and none of their products live up to their hype.</li>
            <li>I am so uncomfortable going from feeling confident to not is real upsetting.</li>
            <li>so nothing major.</li>
            <li>Left skin soft but didn&#x27;t work like it was supposed too.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it made my boobs all soft and stuff, but I was looking for something that would make them perkier because my boobs are of the persuasion that they needed to get bigger before I knew what to do with them as a teenager,</li>
            <li>So far I been using this Palmerston coco butter firming cream for only 3 days</li>
            <li>And I almost feel like this stuff made it worse, like the softening was anti-firming, for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really thankful for the other reviewers cluing me in on this.</li>
            <li>I like it, the smell seems rather harsh at first</li>
            <li>In addition, a little cream goes a long way; the formula is very thick and will eventually rub all the way in although it does become a bit tacky right before it dries into a smooth finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Breasts are slightly higher, but not much, and that may also be due to the fact that I work out and do lots of chest exercises.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before and noticed a difference after a few uses and certainly noticed a difference after about a week of running out and not applying it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t bad, it smells and feels good.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When I now put on  my bra that lifted my breast and gave me great cleavage with my boobs touching each other now they don&#x27;t even touch.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this product.</li>
            <li> I got this product originally b/c</li>
            <li> The cream has a unique aroma.  </li>
            <li> I was a full 34dd I used the product because I started working out to tone up and lose my stomach.</li>
            <li> may not be the same product but the quality better and their customer service better</li>
            <li> I have not used it more than three consecutive days, each day it improves more than the last.</li>
            <li> this arrived quickly and I just couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> and it soaks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> It firms and adsorbs very fast!  </li>
            <li> It that real cocoa butter scent so it has to be strong.</li>
            <li> Skin appears firmer and more supple and feels very soft.</li>
            <li> but after a few seconds it becomes a light, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Works great for firming even helped lift a little.  </li>
            <li> Deff worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am now trying to see how I can enhance naturally and feel confident again.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> They give you your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> The cream also has a very cocoa buttery smell which is pretty strong.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a significant change</li>
            <li> I used it right away.</li>
            <li> The others were right</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two years now, after trying all sorts of other products, but this is clearly the best even for natural DD cups!</li>
            <li> Purely by happenstance I stumbled on Palmer&#x27;s Bust Cream being lauded on Makeup Alley, not so much as a bust cream, but instead an amazing firming and moisturizing facial cream.</li>
            <li> since I had my first child and have been breastfeeding her for 9 months.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars though because I really can&#x27;t stand how it smells!</li>
            <li> For more moderate breasts, this cream, along with exercise and diet, will work wonders.  </li>
            <li> I used this product consistently for a month or so</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been consistent</li>
            <li> It works pretty well on face for firming.</li>
            <li> hahaha, after loosing weight, it needs help too!</li>
            <li> This seems to be working pretty well.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended by my pregnant friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, and so far, it didn&#x27;t really do much for my really light stretch marks and didn&#x27;t make my bust any firmer, but it makes my skin look and feel soft and great, and I love the cocoa smell.</li>
            <li> If you combine this cream with various breast lift exercises, you will notice your breasts becoming firmer and somewhat higher.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing full results in a few weeks :)</li>
            <li> About 145lbs and a rather large bust</li>
            <li> Large but not in charge,</li>
            <li> certainly did what it said, after loosing 20 lbs I needed to tighten my akin and this did just that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a certain firming quality to the cream because they do seem a bit perkier which is much more than I ever expected.  </li>
            <li> i been using this for a bit and havent seen much results.</li>
            <li> also i dont really like the smell of ..</li>
            <li> I guess, this cream isn&#x27;t something very helpful.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really enjoys them.</li>
            <li> Received shipment fast.</li>
            <li> Combining the cream really has helped.     </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re not going to see very noticeable result unless you exercise as well.</li>
            <li> This product did what I hoped it would, I was not expecting it to make my natural DD breasts look like fresh implants.</li>
            <li> one time I may have rubbed too much because a lot comes out</li>
            <li> no firmness felt real saggy.</li>
            <li> It does its job, and leaves your bosom feeling much perkier and tighter over time.</li>
            <li> really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> I think that is a reasonable amount of time to see if something is working..</li>
            <li> Within a week, my skin looks fresh and clear and my tone has improved.  </li>
            <li> but I think this is a quality product that does deliver the science of what a cream really can do.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> Not too much.</li>
            <li> It does make my breasts softer but not so much of tightness yet.</li>
            <li> and I really do not know why this has not attained cult favorite status.</li>
            <li> And it really works at fading scars.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, i like it.</li>
            <li> I had really wanted this to work, but honestly I think I could probably get the same results rubbing regular lotion into my skin.</li>
            <li> It did ship fast.</li>
            <li> It improves the bust&#x27;s tone slightly after every use, I&#x27;m pretty sure because it is a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My breast feel mushy and light  when at first they were heavy and firmer at first before use of product.</li>
            <li> but I have already used half of its contents and I am still waiting for better results.  </li>
            <li> Non greasy,absorbs quickly and definitely has firming effect.</li>
            <li> I love this product it actually tight</li>
            <li> The smell is a little off putting to me, but not terrible.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t convinced by other reviews when they said that it absorbs quickly, but it does!</li>
            <li> so I feel safer slathering this all over myself - unlike some of the other firming creams available.</li>
            <li> It also makes your bust very soft.</li>
            <li> i would still give it a high rating for how soft it makes my breasts feel.  </li>
            <li> Munchkin &#x27;White Hot&#x27; Duck Bath Toy (Baby Product).</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it&#x27;s cheap, you&#x27;ll pay a lot of money for pills and other creams that barely show a difference.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> If you are over 40, it doesn&#x27;t work to firm your bust, but it does leave your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days, but so far I am extremely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 with a 6 month old.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks so far, no change, but will keep using it.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 20 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30, and I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Opposite of the description much?</li>
            <li> So far, I have no rash (which I tend to get because my skin is sensitive).</li>
            <li> Lefty skin so soft and</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t make my skin nearly as soft as the body lotion.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell and not sure its really doing anything.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t pay attention to this review because there is so many positive ones, but i hope you can prove me wrong..</li>
            <li> I have tried Palmers for various reasons and none of their products live up to their hype.</li>
            <li> I am so uncomfortable going from feeling confident to not is real upsetting.</li>
            <li> so nothing major.</li>
            <li> Left skin soft but didn&#x27;t work like it was supposed too.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it made my boobs all soft and stuff, but I was looking for something that would make them perkier because my boobs are of the persuasion that they needed to get bigger before I knew what to do with them as a teenager,</li>
            <li> So far I been using this Palmerston coco butter firming cream for only 3 days</li>
            <li> And I almost feel like this stuff made it worse, like the softening was anti-firming, for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really thankful for the other reviewers cluing me in on this.</li>
            <li> I like it, the smell seems rather harsh at first</li>
            <li> In addition, a little cream goes a long way; the formula is very thick and will eventually rub all the way in although it does become a bit tacky right before it dries into a smooth finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Breasts are slightly higher, but not much, and that may also be due to the fact that I work out and do lots of chest exercises.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before and noticed a difference after a few uses and certainly noticed a difference after about a week of running out and not applying it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, it smells and feels good.</li>
            <li> I continue to use every day.esp before putting on my breat enlarging suction domes because once I create vacuum and leave they maintain vacuum as long as I dont disturb them.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it really works.</li>
            <li> but it does fade and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Cocoa is the ingredient that can make your skin soft, and you can tell the different as long as you keep using it everyday.</li>
            <li> but  the next day my breast were loose</li>
            <li> That is what i thought and clearly this product is not for big to small boobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old with a 36FF bust and, out of fear of my bust beginning to sag, I bought this product in a small attempt to stave off this inevitable outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sometimes a litle curtesy comes a long way I am going to order somewhere else</li>
            <li> the cream has a thick feeling to it, which i dont really like either.</li>
            <li> My breasts are definitely firmer, and appear to have slightly changed in shape, and I have only used it for around four or five weeks.</li>
            <li> This helps a lot with extra skin due to weight loss.</li>
            <li> I use their regular firming lotion as well on other places</li>
            <li> It just left me more disappointed then when i started..</li>
            <li> I also use it on my body where I have rough, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> :(Glad i only paid 6-8 bucks for it.</li>
            <li> Some lotions helps a little and some of it actually irritates it.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t really enjoy the smell of cocoa butter, it isn&#x27;t bad enough that I can&#x27;t stand it.  </li>
            <li> Well, not working as l expected</li>
            <li> Will repost when container is empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hitting an age where my breasts are no longer as firm as they once where and I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to perk them back up.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles a few months back, I wanted to try it for awhile before writing a review.</li>
            <li> Be careful of getting this product close to under your eye.</li>
            <li> other reviews said to use and do chest exercise.</li>
            <li> and I am extremely hopeful.</li>
            <li> you may notice a small lift if you&#x27;re bust isn&#x27;t too big.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found this cream does wonders on other parts of the body</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this a try,  because it says it helps with those plus a bunch of other stuff.</li>
            <li> The only problem is after I use this I usually put perfume on to mask</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed no difference, other than just smoothness...but</li>
            <li> This is no way a miracle product for sagging breasts, as other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> When I stop, those poor puppies just turn into old saddlebags.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cream for less than a week</li>
            <li> It does have an odd smell</li>
            <li> You may get a slight irritation.</li>
            <li> did little in making my breasts feel as they did before breastfeeding and the pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works for bust but it works for other body parts</li>
            <li> but they do seem a little firmer.</li>
            <li> My eyes wetted a little from it</li>
            <li> Within a few days my husband mentioned that my stretch marks look like they&#x27;ve faded.</li>
            <li> Bought this to firm up my Brest.  </li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> WOW, was i wrong.</li>
            <li> I used the cream everyday morning and night and did not experience any change.</li>
            <li> The smell fades within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my slightly heavy chin area, and my face looks slimmer and structured.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, for people who has gained or lost few pounds.</li>
            <li> I had gastric bypass a few months ago and now everything is falling.  </li>
            <li> I have used it everyday now for a few days</li>
            <li> I also exfoliate my breasts in the shower and, I have to stay, if the cream weren&#x27;t meant to firm at all</li>
            <li> It helps to firm them as well.</li>
            <li> In case u are wondering about my size i am 5&#x27;4 weight 131 toned firm body from  head to toe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the bust cream for less than a week and see a small difference.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for the past 3 weeks</li>
            <li> this smell is not the usual Palmer&#x27;s smell we are all accustomed to.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m not sure if it works yet</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming though.</li>
            <li> I usually use vanilla perfume and they go well together.</li>
            <li> Hard to even get off of your hands.</li>
            <li> It was hard to use cover up liquid or powder over it.</li>
            <li> Unless you can afford surgery I&#x27;d recommend at least giving this a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works slowly need to be patient</li>
            <li> if you know what I mean?</li>
            <li> no longer feel like weak and saggy sacks of fat.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s wrong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve started to get really dry cracked sometimes painful skin in between my fingers.</li>
            <li> I am not happy and regret I ever used it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the rest of the bottle since there&#x27;s no sense in wasting it, but I won&#x27;t be reordering unless I feel like my breasts change for the worse after discontinuing this</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> some what the skin BUT teh customer service is very poor</li>
            <li> All it did was smell awful and waste my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Firstly, stinks.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find it that bad</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Will purchase again.  Works on my neck area too.</li>
            <li> I like it so far. Haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference, but the smell is good and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> i been using this for a bit and havent seen much results. other reviews said to use and do chest exercise. which i have been doing. it says to apply twice a day i apply once a day cause i tend to forget. also i dont really like the smell of .. the cream has a thick feeling to it, which i dont really like either.</li>
            <li> If you are over 40, it doesn&#x27;t work to firm your bust, but it does leave your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Well, not working as l expected</li>
            <li> I guess, this cream isn&#x27;t something very helpful. It wasn&#x27;t bad, it smells and feels good. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the texture. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days, but so far I am extremely satisfied with it. I am only 21, but my breast have become a bit saggy every since I had my first child and have been breastfeeding her for 9 months. My tummy is also a bit saggy with yucky stretch marks. Within a few days my husband mentioned that my stretch marks look like they&#x27;ve faded. I&#x27;m very happy with this product, I feel my skin tightening already. I gave it four stars though because I really can&#x27;t stand how it smells!</li>
            <li> I love this product it actually tight some what the skin BUT teh customer service is very poor, I wrote to them and ask if they have a program for customer that order in a consistence basis there products mayeb it will be a litle economical (shipping wise) and their response was liek I wa asking them fro them to give their product FREE sometingI did not expect eitehr ask for, to me tehy need to put somebody that have the skills to answer to customer porperly I wont order any of their product again sometimes a litle curtesy comes a long way I am going to order somewhere else may not be the same product but the quality better and their customer service better</li>
            <li> I recieved this cream about 4 days ago and I apply after showerimg and exfoliating. I like it, the smell seems rather harsh at first but after a few seconds it becomes a light, pleasant fragrance. I wasn&#x27;t convinced by other reviews when they said that it absorbs quickly, but it does! You won&#x27;t need more than a minute or two to rub it in thoroughly. It improves the bust&#x27;s tone slightly after every use, I&#x27;m pretty sure because it is a moisturizer. It also makes your bust very soft. When applying, I like to use it like foundation: I put a dime-nickle size dab on my finger and dot it all around my breasts then rub in a circular motion to ensure I cover them thoroughly. I will begin using it at night before bed as well, hopefully this will speed up any firming. I gave it four stars because right off the bat, I was impressed and I am extremely hopeful. I will be updating this review in a month or so to report any firming that I notice. Hope I was helpful.    EDIT: I have not noticed any firming with the use of this product, except a slight...thickening of the skin is the only way I could put it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as moveable after applying this. That being said, I would buy this cream again just for the softening it accomplishes. It is awesome! My boyfriend really enjoys them.</li>
            <li> Received shipment fast. I&#x27;ve been using the bust cream for less than a week and see a small difference. I&#x27;m 25 with a 6 month old. About 145lbs and a rather large bust</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a tightening of the skin and combined with chest excercises you may notice a small lift if you&#x27;re bust isn&#x27;t too big.</li>
            <li> Bought this to firm up my Brest.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet</li>
            <li> This product is good for elasticity of my skin.. I like and I still using in my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Nice cream, pleasant smelling, and makes breasts very soft.  My breasts are definitely firmer, and appear to have slightly changed in shape, and I have only used it for around four or five weeks. Breasts are slightly higher, but not much, and that may also be due to the fact that I work out and do lots of chest exercises.  If you combine this cream with various breast lift exercises, you will notice your breasts becoming firmer and somewhat higher.  This is an awesome product for the price you pay, but again, if you are saggy and large busted, dont expect miracles.  For more moderate breasts, this cream, along with exercise and diet, will work wonders.  The cream definitely helps with the toning and firmness and my boobs no longer feel like weak and saggy sacks of fat.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> .... if you combine it with various chest exercises. Alone it does quite well too but if you&#x27;re wanting max results I&#x27;d use some very easy chest exercises you could google online to help the process. After three weeks of use it has changed the feel and lift of my breasts. I&#x27;ve had three children, breast fed all under the impression my breasts wouldn&#x27;t sag afterwards, but they did. My youngest is now seven and doing the exercises alone did little in making my breasts feel as they did before breastfeeding and the pregnancy. Combining the cream really has helped.     Keep in mind this is no miracle cream, there&#x27;s no way a cream will give you the bust you had before pregnancy and you&#x27;re not going to see very noticeable result unless you exercise as well. I&#x27;ve also found this cream does wonders on other parts of the body a woman might find troublesome either after children or weight lose. Like the upper arms, thighs and chin/neck area.     The smell does have something to it but I don&#x27;t find it that bad, it doesn&#x27;t have that chemical perfume smell but more like the ingredients that the cream is made of which I like better. Bottom line, it&#x27;s cheap, you&#x27;ll pay a lot of money for pills and other creams that barely show a difference. This cream will work if you just combine it with a five minute exercise routine either once or twice a day and it&#x27;s a lot safer. Unless you can afford surgery I&#x27;d recommend at least giving this a try.</li>
            <li> I used this product consistently for a month or so and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all. It kind of had a funky smell too...</li>
            <li> This cream seems to be working but I have already used half of its contents and I am still waiting for better results.  I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks so far, no change, but will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any progress</li>
            <li> Ive only used this product for 2 days and already I can see a difference in the texture and firmness of my skin. I look forward to seeing full results in a few weeks :) Deff worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product works for me. I have not used it more than three consecutive days, each day it improves more than the last. This product did what I hoped it would, I was not expecting it to make my natural DD breasts look like fresh implants.</li>
            <li> This product is highly recommended by my pregnant friend. I use it almost everyday. Cocoa is the ingredient that can make your skin soft, and you can tell the different as long as you keep using it everyday. Great and safe for pregnant women!! You can trust this product.</li>
            <li> I was a full 34dd I used the product because I started working out to tone up and lose my stomach. I thought iit would tone up my breast firmness. I used the product one time I may have rubbed too much because a lot comes out but  the next day my breast were loose no firmness felt real saggy. I am not happy and regret I ever used it. I am so uncomfortable going from feeling confident to not is real upsetting. When I now put on  my bra that lifted my breast and gave me great cleavage with my boobs touching each other now they don&#x27;t even touch. My breast feel mushy and light  when at first they were heavy and firmer at first before use of product. I am now trying to see how I can enhance naturally and feel confident again.</li>
            <li> Helped quite a bit in the month I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> For the price, this is one great product. It does its job, and leaves your bosom feeling much perkier and tighter over time. I have used this product for two years now, after trying all sorts of other products, but this is clearly the best even for natural DD cups!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works for bust but it works for other body parts so I keep it!</li>
            <li> i ordered 19 pcs but only received 11pcs why ? palmers bust firming lotion deliver incomplete what happen to my order 19 pcs you deliver to me only 11pcs where is the rest ?</li>
            <li> I was so excited for this product. I thought after i read the reviews and only one (one star) review that it would actually work. WOW, was i wrong. I know what your thinking.. because i gave it on star you won&#x27;t pay attention to this review because there is so many positive ones, but i hope you can prove me wrong..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to work. I did, i swear. I hope it on many times a day for a month. I think that is a reasonable amount of time to see if something is working.. I think i actually become MORE insecure about my breasts because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 20 years old. I lost a lot of weight and this is why i brought the product. It is embarrassing to have had big boobs, dropped 2 sizes and have as it seems no elasticity left. I know miracles like this don&#x27;t happen over night or even in month but i am telling you, i didn&#x27;t see ANY improvement at all.. Not even a fading of the stretch mark lines! All it did was smell awful and waste my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like you would seriously be better off just exercises and stop wishing miracles will happen to your breasts. That is what i thought and clearly this product is not for big to small boobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish i would have never gotten my hopes up on this product.&lt;br /&gt;To those who it has worked for, i congratulate you but for me.. It just left me more disappointed then when i started..</li>
            <li> I got this product originally b/c I lost weight and have some stretch marks on my boobs.  I have also been struggling to find a face cream that does not make me break out, but that does help with fighting signs of aging.  I&#x27;m 30, and I have extremely sensitive skin.  Based on the reviews I read, I decided to try using this product on my face.  It works great!  Within a week, my skin looks fresh and clear and my tone has improved.  Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes, but it works great on eye lines.  I use it on my stomach, thighs, boobs, chest, face, and neck.  I love it.  The stretch marks on my chest are still there, but it&#x27;s only been a week and I can see a difference in the elasticity of my skin.  Based on the results I see on my face, I assume that it will help.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> I did not see or feel any difference!!. I used the cream everyday morning and night and did not experience any change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  The smell fades within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It make my breast more silky touch but idont feel any change on shape</li>
            <li> Cannot recommend. Firstly, stinks. Secondly, not absorbent. Hard to even get off of your hands. Almost feels like Elmer&#x27;s glue. And lastly, no freaking results.</li>
            <li> I have tried Palmers for various reasons and none of their products live up to their hype. Won&#x27;t buy this brand ever again.</li>
            <li> Left skin soft but didn&#x27;t work like it was supposed too.</li>
            <li> Its a great product. I have used this on my slightly heavy chin area, and my face looks slimmer and structured. My Bust area is firmer as well. I would recommend this product, for people who has gained or lost few pounds.</li>
            <li> This is great. Non greasy,absorbs quickly and definitely has firming effect. I continue to use every day.esp before putting on my breat enlarging suction domes because once I create vacuum and leave they maintain vacuum as long as I dont disturb them. Way better compared applying K-Y jelly or oils. recommend strongly.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something to help with stretch marks. Thought I&#x27;d give this a try,  because it says it helps with those plus a bunch of other stuff. Not crazy about the smell and not sure its really doing anything. The smell isn&#x27;t terrible. Smells like chocolate. It&#x27;s just not my favorite thing to smell like.</li>
            <li> It smells so good but I don&#x27;t see any difference lol</li>
            <li> I had gastric bypass a few months ago and now everything is falling.  I hoped this would help my sagging just a bit--and it has.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my bust is just a tad firmer after using the cream.  When I stop, those poor puppies just turn into old saddlebags.  The fragrance would be a problem if it was stronger, but as it is, it&#x27;s tolerable.  I&#x27;ll keep using the cream and praying for a miracle.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for results.  Will update later.</li>
            <li> after a while, made my skin like peel</li>
            <li> It is working I like how I can see results and I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 weeks. The only problem is after I use this I usually put perfume on to mask it cause I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Good for the skin, however it won&#x27;t lift anything but the cream is just awsome for the skin</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for the past 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a significant change but they do seem a little firmer. I plan on continuing the use of the product and combining it with push-ups and various chest exercises. However the shipping was fast and the packaging was nice.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and noticed a difference after a few uses and certainly noticed a difference after about a week of running out and not applying it. I love the smell. No cream can do miracles but I think this is a quality product that does deliver the science of what a cream really can do.</li>
            <li> I had lost quite a bit of volume in my breasts after losing weight so I decided to try this cream since it had so many good reviews . I&#x27;ve been using the cream for less than a week and I can already tell that my breasts have gotten firmer and fuller.  Update: it must&#x27;ve been wishful thinking, there was no fullness or firmness. This product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This was the biggest letdown I could&#x27;ve hoped for, like, ever. Yeah, it made my boobs all soft and stuff, but I was looking for something that would make them perkier because my boobs are of the persuasion that they needed to get bigger before I knew what to do with them as a teenager, so yeah. Large but not in charge, if you know what I mean? And I almost feel like this stuff made it worse, like the softening was anti-firming, for sure. Opposite of the description much?</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to use on my bust and neck area.  I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet in these places, but I think this rich, nice-smelling cream helps keep my skin supple.  I also use it on my body where I have rough, dry skin.  So far, I have no rash (which I tend to get because my skin is sensitive).</li>
            <li> This helps a lot with extra skin due to weight loss. Skin appears firmer and more supple and feels very soft. My husband really likes it. Oh- it smells good too!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Not too much. Didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference in firmness.</li>
            <li> Works great for firming even helped lift a little.  smells nice not to greasy.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but it does have a strong scent to it but it smells good. It that real cocoa butter scent so it has to be strong. It does make my breasts softer but not so much of tightness yet. I use it on my stomach as well after I exercise</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been consistent so I&#x27;m not sure if it really works. When I was using it. No results. I&#x27;ll keep trying to see what happens</li>
            <li> this arrived quickly and I just couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I used it right away. I have used it everyday now for a few days and I already notice a difference in the texture and fullness in my breasts. Im so pleased with the fragrance and it soaks into the skin quickly. will buy again .</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE WAY IT FEELS &amp; GO ON MY BDY DNT C RESULTS YET BUT IM SURE I WILL  I USE DAY &amp; NITE THANX</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do anything but smell nice and make my boobs feel sticky. moisturize..... but sticky. would not buy again</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Munchkin &#x27;White Hot&#x27; Duck Bath Toy (Baby Product). I buy this for my child, I hope he likes it. It as a toy,  it&#x27;s cute,</li>
            <li> No changes observed after applying twice a day for 1.5 months</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works slowly need to be patient I have been using About 3 weeks I a see difference I recommended..</li>
            <li> This cream tightens the skin temporarily, but does not lift. I use it on my breasts, chest, and neck. It works pretty well on face for firming.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s not going to miraculously give you that lift that defies gravity, but for me, my skin feels firmer and softer every time I use it.</li>
            <li> They give you your money&#x27;s worth. It smells wonderful</li>
            <li> My wife loved it and would like to buy more if we have a chance to go to USA again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed no difference, other than just smoothness...but the smell...I warn you...this smell is not the usual Palmer&#x27;s smell we are all accustomed to.</li>
            <li> Purely by happenstance I stumbled on Palmer&#x27;s Bust Cream being lauded on Makeup Alley, not so much as a bust cream, but instead an amazing firming and moisturizing facial cream. I was so happy to find it on Amazon after failing to locate it anywhere locally. The others were right and I really do not know why this has not attained cult favorite status. It&#x27;s shea and cocoa butter based in a gel cream that does not seem to be filled with a bunch of cones which my skin can not tolerate. It&#x27;s perfect at night and has been one of the best facial moisturizers I have ever used. A generous amount of C-Elast elastin, soy protein, peptides and Centellia Asiatica extract (gotu kola) which has been shown to help heal wounds and psoriasis for such a low price. And it really works at fading scars. I do wish the Sodium Polyacrylate and cocoa fragrance was not in this but neither has seemed to cause any problems or break outs. I&#x27;m really thankful for the other reviewers cluing me in on this. Going to stock up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks, and so far, it didn&#x27;t really do much for my really light stretch marks and didn&#x27;t make my bust any firmer, but it makes my skin look and feel soft and great, and I love the cocoa smell.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  after one week i could actually feel/see improvement.  i use on my back side too.  hahaha, after loosing weight, it needs help too!</li>
            <li> This is no way a miracle product for sagging breasts, as other reviewers have mentioned.  I am 20 years old with a 36FF bust and, out of fear of my bust beginning to sag, I bought this product in a small attempt to stave off this inevitable outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the cream as the directions say, twice a day; once in the morning and once at night after I&#x27;m showered.  I also exfoliate my breasts in the shower and, I have to stay, if the cream weren&#x27;t meant to firm at all i would still give it a high rating for how soft it makes my breasts feel.  They are just so touchable and smooth that I feel like a guy, I can&#x27;t keep my own hands off them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a certain firming quality to the cream because they do seem a bit perkier which is much more than I ever expected.  The cream also has a very cocoa buttery smell which is pretty strong.  Although I don&#x27;t really enjoy the smell of cocoa butter, it isn&#x27;t bad enough that I can&#x27;t stand it.  My breasts smell like they&#x27;re edible, lol.  In addition, a little cream goes a long way; the formula is very thick and will eventually rub all the way in although it does become a bit tacky right before it dries into a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy firming!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my breast after a years use</li>
            <li> Lefty skin so soft and certainly did what it said, after loosing 20 lbs I needed to tighten my akin and this did just that. Love this product. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my cousin, she is using this, just waiting for the result. I hope it work  .</li>
            <li> I love the smell and ingredients in this cream! It does help to rebuild collagen in the breasts. It helps to firm them as well. The price was great and the shipping was fast! I really like this cream. Ive been told that it works wonders for stretch marks as well.....I recommend this cream to anyone who wants to firm up...</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Incredible</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, i like it. Although it is a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> So far I been using this Palmerston coco butter firming cream for only 3 days now I&#x27;m not sure if it works yet I will keep you guys up to date.It does work very good on bruises any of the palmers line helps with the bruises,I have used the others and they do help a lot wit bruises.I will keep you guys up to date on the firming part I bought 2 of them cause I heard and read the reviews</li>
            <li> I work out 4 times a day and used this cream as directed and did not see any results. In case u are wondering about my size i am 5&#x27;4 weight 131 toned firm body from  head to toe. So no this has nothing to do with my size the cream just didn&#x27;t work.  :(Glad i only paid 6-8 bucks for it.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working pretty well. It firms and adsorbs very fast!  My bonus is the skin on my hands. See I wash my hands a lot and I&#x27;ve started to get really dry cracked sometimes painful skin in between my fingers. Some lotions helps a little and some of it actually irritates it. Ever since I stared using this it&#x27;s gotten better all the way around! So when I put this on I made sure to rub in between my fingers as well. I use their regular firming lotion as well on other places so it&#x27;s probably a combination of both. Both smell nice too. I&#x27;ve been told I smell like cookies and chocolate. :) Not overwhelming though. I usually use vanilla perfume and they go well together.</li>
            <li> No visible results yet. I&#x27;m going to continue to use. Will repost when container is empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hitting an age where my breasts are no longer as firm as they once where and I&#x27;ve been looking for a way to perk them back up. I had really wanted this to work, but honestly I think I could probably get the same results rubbing regular lotion into my skin. There was no visible firming or lift from this product after using it twice a day for about two months. I will continue to use the rest of the bottle since there&#x27;s no sense in wasting it, but I won&#x27;t be reordering unless I feel like my breasts change for the worse after discontinuing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this two stars because I feel like trial and error is the only way to find out which product will work for me specifically (since I think different people&#x27;s bodies react to things differently) and the price of this product allowed me to try it without investing a lot of money into it. This is also free of parabens so I feel safer slathering this all over myself - unlike some of the other firming creams available. The smell is a little off putting to me, but not terrible.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles a few months back, I wanted to try it for awhile before writing a review. I bought this to use on my face, as I was reading the reviews people mentioned they used it on they&#x27;re faces and I had wondered the same thing if it would work. To be honest i didn&#x27;t notice any diffrence. It does have an odd smell but it does fade and doesn&#x27;t last long. It also didn&#x27;t make my skin nearly as soft as the body lotion. It was hard to use cover up liquid or powder over it. But bc I had a tan I didn&#x27;t wear make up often. I used this product in the morning and at night for two months. Some products don&#x27;t work the same for everyone since we all have diffrent types of skin. I would recommend buying one bottle to try it to see if you like it and notice a diffrence. Also I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores so I liked how amazon had it available. It did ship fast. I have prime so that&#x27;s probably why.  Be careful of getting this product close to under your eye. You may get a slight irritation. My eyes wetted a little from it so nothing major.</li>
            <li> Estoy mas que satisfecha con el producto. Es de muy buena calidad. Y exacto a las referencias de las fotografías.</li>
            <li> The cream has a unique aroma.  Almost like coffee.  I don&#x27;t mind it.  In terms of the effectiveness of the product&#x27;s claims, I can&#x27;t be sure.  Still waiting.  But it feels nice on.</li>
            <li> I used it for several days and some tiny PIMPLES burst out on my chest so I had to stop. Not sure what&#x27;s wrong. Does anyone have similar experience?</li>
            <li> I applied it just 4-5 times n I already see a difference...</li>
    </ol>
