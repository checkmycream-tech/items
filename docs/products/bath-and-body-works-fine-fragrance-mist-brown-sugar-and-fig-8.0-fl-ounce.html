            <li>The packaging protected the spray bottle very well and I was very impressed with the condition it was in when it arrived.</li>

            <li>I love this spray..</li>
            <li>I love this scent and it always seems to arrive on time.</li>
            <li>The smell hasn&#x27;t changed love it</li>
            <li>Sure to please a variety of tastes.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Have to use a lot more than with the original.&lt;br /&gt;Can not complain about shippment and arrival wrapping.  </li>
            <li>Of course the cost was appropriate for the content,</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the price and how quickly I received it.  </li>
            <li>I actually ordered this because its a lovely, warm but not overpowering scent that makes me happy.  </li>
            <li>I love the clean smell...</li>
            <li>Other than that, the bottles shipped perfectly fine and the product was great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s quite a beautiful scent, a shame that it&#x27;s only seasonal.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite scent!</li>
            <li>Genuine seller .</li>
            <li>The packaging of the actual product itself is very nice.</li>
            <li>bath and body comes out with the original body splash in their stores.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and spray smells just as good as the last one I bought!</li>
            <li>Came in excellent shape, no leakage, or any negative at all.  </li>
            <li>Even my grandmother, who is sensitive to all fragrances, found this quite enjoyable to her sniffer.</li>
            <li>but this isn&#x27;t even worth spraying on.  </li>
            <li>for the actual fragrance itself, it&#x27;s a much softer version of Ralph Hot, but smells equally amazing, without the strong biting scent of alcohol</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many things in our little corner of Afghanistan that smell great, so this is a definite treat!</li>
            <li>My personal favorite.</li>
            <li>sad that Bath and Body Works discontinued this awesome fragrance.  </li>
            <li>A rich purple bottle with metallic designing on it, and the bottle itself is HUGE, especially for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Luckily this bottle should last me a long time, as it has so many ounces (8 oz) !</li>
            <li>This is the exact same stuff (: definitely will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect strong staying power anyway, as this is a body MIST, not an actual perfume.</li>
            <li>This arrived within a couple days of ordering, very timely.</li>
            <li>Was protected very well.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend absolutely loves it on me.</li>
            <li>The scent is warm and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Originally, I purchased this spray as a dupe for the sadly discontinued favorite perfume of mine, Ralph Lauren Ralph Hot.</li>
            <li>It is sweet and sultry and just right for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Brand new bottle.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who is scared, like I was, of ordering a scent online first without smelling it prior to the purchase.</li>
            <li>Not overly fruity or ridiculously sweet, like Aquolina Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live near a bath and body works, so when I do go they never have this scent</li>
            <li>The aroma is accurate, but~~much less in strength.  </li>
            <li>I almost feel like a female again when I put it on, hahaha.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>I regret spending my money on this because I feel completely ripped off.</li>
            <li>So disappointing, it&#x27;s basically a pretty bottle filled with water.</li>
            <li>As far as lasting power, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the perfume I am replacing this with.</li>

            <li> and it isn&#x27;t supposed to last long</li>
            <li> Again, if you see my other review for Pacifica Mediterranean Fig Perfume Roll-On, you&#x27;ll know that I am searching for a very specific scent.</li>
            <li> It actually lasts longer than other body sprays I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li> It does last a couple of hours on me, and leaves behind a faint sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just watered down garbage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like someone replaced half of the bottle with water and then repackaged it.  </li>
            <li> When I walk in my office in the morning, I spritz a little of this around and immediately get a boost.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by a few people to use this as a replacement, so I hurriedly ordered it after seeing the glowing reviews of this seasonal product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like an amber-y, vanilla with spice and an underlay of faint, dark fruit.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I work in an office with a lot of people and wax burners are sometimes overpowering or unpleasant if others don&#x27;t like the scent.  </li>
            <li> Just disappointed in Bath&amp; Bodies quality.  </li>

            <li> I love this spray..rec&#x27;d on time..smells wonderful</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many things in our little corner of Afghanistan that smell great, so this is a definite treat! I almost feel like a female again when I put it on, hahaha. :) It smells fantastic, and the size is perfect for the remaining 6 months or so that I&#x27;ll be over here. It arrived without breaking, too -- bonus! The scent is warm and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the price and how quickly I received it.  I was also very happy with how nicely it was packaged! My absolute favorite scent!</li>
            <li> Item arrived by specified date and was as described.</li>
            <li> Did not care for this at all!  The seller was great but this scent smells like burnt sugar.  Again, if you see my other review for Pacifica Mediterranean Fig Perfume Roll-On, you&#x27;ll know that I am searching for a very specific scent. (&amp;#34;Figs and Leaves&amp;#34; soap by LUSH)&lt;br /&gt;This totally misses the mark.  Reminds me of old lady perfume. Sorry</li>
            <li> Best perfume I&#x27;ve had. I was bummed when I found out Bath&amp;Body discontinued this but not to worry! This is the exact same stuff (: definitely will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> This is my signature smell &amp; I also ordered this overseas while on deployment. I was literally jumping for joy when I found out when my order had arrived. The packaging protected the spray bottle very well and I was very impressed with the condition it was in when it arrived. Satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love this scent and it always seems to arrive on time. I don&#x27;t live near a bath and body works, so when I do go they never have this scent so it&#x27;s nice that I can order it online.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this because its a lovely, warm but not overpowering scent that makes me happy.  I work in an office with a lot of people and wax burners are sometimes overpowering or unpleasant if others don&#x27;t like the scent.  When I walk in my office in the morning, I spritz a little of this around and immediately get a boost.  Maybe again after lunch.  Bonus points because I can spray it on me too!</li>
            <li> The smell hasn&#x27;t changed love it</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and spray smells just as good as the last one I bought!</li>
            <li> Originally, I purchased this spray as a dupe for the sadly discontinued favorite perfume of mine, Ralph Lauren Ralph Hot. It was recommended by a few people to use this as a replacement, so I hurriedly ordered it after seeing the glowing reviews of this seasonal product. I had never smelled it prior until opening the package myself. This arrived within a couple days of ordering, very timely. Was protected very well. The packaging of the actual product itself is very nice. A rich purple bottle with metallic designing on it, and the bottle itself is HUGE, especially for such a cheap price. 8 inches tall and 6 1/2 inches of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual fragrance itself, it&#x27;s a much softer version of Ralph Hot, but smells equally amazing, without the strong biting scent of alcohol you get with perfume. It&#x27;s like an amber-y, vanilla with spice and an underlay of faint, dark fruit. Not overpowering, but definitely there. Even my grandmother, who is sensitive to all fragrances, found this quite enjoyable to her sniffer. As far as lasting power, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the perfume I am replacing this with. I didn&#x27;t expect strong staying power anyway, as this is a body MIST, not an actual perfume. It does last a couple of hours on me, and leaves behind a faint sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite a beautiful scent, a shame that it&#x27;s only seasonal. Luckily this bottle should last me a long time, as it has so many ounces (8 oz) ! I have worn it several times. My boyfriend absolutely loves it on me. Sure to please a variety of tastes. Not overly fruity or ridiculously sweet, like Aquolina Pink Sugar. I recommend it to anyone who is scared, like I was, of ordering a scent online first without smelling it prior to the purchase.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t even smell this stuff.  It&#x27;s like someone replaced half of the bottle with water and then repackaged it.  I&#x27;m calling BS on this spray.  do NOT buy this!!!! It smells like nothing.  Just watered down garbage.  I regret spending my money on this because I feel completely ripped off.</li>
            <li> So disappointing, it&#x27;s basically a pretty bottle filled with water.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this spray for awhile now and it smells amazing. Bath and Body works definitely needs to bring this scent back. Other than that, the bottles shipped perfectly fine and the product was great!</li>
            <li> I love the smell. It actually lasts longer than other body sprays I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this smell! It is sweet and sultry and just right for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I love it !!!!. I love the clean smell...I  hope you never stop selling it. I recommend it .5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely. Brand new bottle. Great smell!!  Genuine seller . God bless !</li>
            <li> The aroma is accurate, but~~much less in strength.  Have to use a lot more than with the original.&lt;br /&gt;Can not complain about shippment and arrival wrapping.  Came in excellent shape, no leakage, or any negative at all.  Very secure.  Just disappointed in Bath&amp; Bodies quality.  Of course the cost was appropriate for the content, I suppose?!&lt;br /&gt;Hope bath and body comes out with the original body splash in their stores.</li>
            <li> I know its a mist and it isn&#x27;t supposed to last long but this isn&#x27;t even worth spraying on.  Forget it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. My personal favorite.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance,&lt;br /&gt;How sad that Bath and Body Works discontinued this awesome fragrance.  Thrilled I found this item on-line&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone</li>
