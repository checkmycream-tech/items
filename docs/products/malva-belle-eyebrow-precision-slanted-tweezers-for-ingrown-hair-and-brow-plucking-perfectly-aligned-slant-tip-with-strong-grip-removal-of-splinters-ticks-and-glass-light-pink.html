            <li>Great little set of tweezers!</li>
            <li>Ive purchased cheap brands and high end brands.</li>
            <li>This pair is worth a few bucks more that you pay; you get what you pay for in this case for sure.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product for someone able to spend a little more for a tweezers in order to save time and frustration.</li>
            <li>i probably spent more on the cheap ones than if i would of just bought these to start off with</li>
            <li>These tweezer come in a pretty pick color and they work wonders.</li>
            <li>I love all things make up or face related.</li>
            <li>They grip very well, not allowing the hair to slip out, and they are the perfect size, not too big, not too small.  </li>
            <li>I own other products by this company and have never had an issue or have been displeased.</li>
            <li>I have had trouble with the cheaply made tweezers as they hurt more pulling out hairs and some will not even grab any hair.</li>
            <li>Mine came in pink, and even though that doesn&#x27;t effect the usefulness it does make me like them more since they are pretty.</li>
            <li>but I find that these are better at gripping the hairs and get the little tiny hairs much easier.</li>
            <li>really well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they really are.</li>
            <li>I really like the color also.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It really got out the smallest of hairs.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>and they are very bothersome.</li>
            <li>I really like these tweezers.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for allowing me to try this out.</li>
            <li>highly recommend them if you are a tweezer connoisseur like me!</li>
            <li>shipped fast, no problems..</li>
            <li>I really like these.  </li>
            <li>Also the color doesn&#x27;t hurt either because I love pink.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>I also had this one and the price was twice as much</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how nice the really sharp slant of the tweezers was.  </li>
            <li>And they say it stays sharp no matter how many times you use them.</li>
            <li>I also love that they are pink!</li>
            <li>Pretty pink color and ultra sleek design are a huge plus...</li>
            <li>They make fixing my brows so much easier than my old tweezers!!</li>
            <li>My main concern was the aesthetic --</li>
            <li>As I searched the Amazon offerings for a replacement tweezers, I had many options, one of which was a straight replacement of the one I misplaced.  </li>
            <li>Tweezers are one of those products that I have to have multiples of and have them pretty much everywhere in my house because I have this issue where I get black hairs; the ones that are super hard,usually really short,and bug you if you can&#x27;t get them out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Thumbs up, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Everything about these tweezers is high quality.</li>
            <li>I would order these again for the normal price.</li>
            <li>I am able to target the hair and it actually gets pulled out by the tweezers rather than slipping through even if I do manage to zero in on it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many tweezers which were not perfectly alligned, so you have to find that sweet spot where you can get the hair.  </li>
            <li>I just have become too accustomed to being able to see the exact hair I&#x27;m aiming for with the thin tweezers</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the super decorative tweezers that are everywhere now (and they&#x27;re usually poorly made anyway), but a solid color that isn&#x27;t black or steel is a welcome addition.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp and pointy.  </li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t like pink right.</li>
            <li>This is a very pale pink, so it&#x27;s nice and unobtrusive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually purchase the cheap drug store tweezers but they won&#x27;t grip the hair well and it slips out, which causes me stress.  </li>
            <li>so it gets rid of those hard to reach hairs that linger around and fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
            <li>Recently lost a black one i bought a few weeks back &amp; now this is my favorite one!</li>
            <li>They are not as nice as the more expensive brands, but they are also not as expensive.  </li>
            <li>They are tough and well made and can easily pluck the shortest hair.</li>
            <li>These Tweezers by Malva Belle get these bothersome black hairs out with so much ease and quicker than any pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>They are a little large for my hands, but still usable.</li>
            <li>These are less expensive but also not as good.  </li>

            <li> this is a fantastic item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t pay to buy cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Well built with a precise tip.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend them to anyone who is looking for a new pair of tweezers that work the very best.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are so pretty but more than that</li>
            <li> The slant is just the exact angle you need to get even the most stubborn thing you need to remove out</li>
            <li> Perfect to get into the areas that are hard to get.</li>
            <li> Perfect for eyebrows and removing hard to get splinters.  </li>
            <li> They come in a really cute package, and seem to be very well made.  </li>
            <li> I recieved these for a very reduced price to try them out and love them.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great for shaping eyebrows and I like the sharp ends for removing splinters from my kids.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my tweezers and these little gems are wonderful..</li>
            <li> These work everywhere, making eyebrow tweezing relatively quick.  </li>
            <li> Ive received products for free because of my Instagram account and by far, these are my favorite tweezers.</li>
            <li> Very consistent.</li>
            <li> the light pink and silver are super cute!</li>
            <li> These are outstanding and make me feel sober!</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re pretty!</li>
            <li> When it comes to this problem alone I would definitely recommend these tweezers but the fact that they also work amazingly with plucking eyebrows</li>
            <li> Great little set of tweezers!</li>
            <li> Ive purchased cheap brands and high end brands.</li>
            <li> This pair is worth a few bucks more that you pay; you get what you pay for in this case for sure.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product for someone able to spend a little more for a tweezers in order to save time and frustration.</li>
            <li> i probably spent more on the cheap ones than if i would of just bought these to start off with</li>
            <li> These tweezer come in a pretty pick color and they work wonders.</li>
            <li> I love all things make up or face related.</li>
            <li> They grip very well, not allowing the hair to slip out, and they are the perfect size, not too big, not too small.  </li>
            <li> I own other products by this company and have never had an issue or have been displeased.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with the cheaply made tweezers as they hurt more pulling out hairs and some will not even grab any hair.</li>
            <li> Mine came in pink, and even though that doesn&#x27;t effect the usefulness it does make me like them more since they are pretty.</li>
            <li> but I find that these are better at gripping the hairs and get the little tiny hairs much easier.</li>
            <li> really well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they really are.</li>
            <li> I really like the color also.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It really got out the smallest of hairs.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> and they are very bothersome.</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for allowing me to try this out.</li>
            <li> highly recommend them if you are a tweezer connoisseur like me!</li>
            <li> shipped fast, no problems..</li>
            <li> I really like these.  </li>
            <li> Also the color doesn&#x27;t hurt either because I love pink.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I also had this one and the price was twice as much</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how nice the really sharp slant of the tweezers was.  </li>
            <li> And they say it stays sharp no matter how many times you use them.</li>
            <li> I also love that they are pink!</li>
            <li> Pretty pink color and ultra sleek design are a huge plus...</li>
            <li> They make fixing my brows so much easier than my old tweezers!!</li>
            <li> My main concern was the aesthetic --</li>
            <li> As I searched the Amazon offerings for a replacement tweezers, I had many options, one of which was a straight replacement of the one I misplaced.  </li>
            <li> Tweezers are one of those products that I have to have multiples of and have them pretty much everywhere in my house because I have this issue where I get black hairs; the ones that are super hard,usually really short,and bug you if you can&#x27;t get them out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Thumbs up, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Everything about these tweezers is high quality.</li>
            <li> I would order these again for the normal price.</li>
            <li> I am able to target the hair and it actually gets pulled out by the tweezers rather than slipping through even if I do manage to zero in on it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many tweezers which were not perfectly alligned, so you have to find that sweet spot where you can get the hair.  </li>
            <li> I just have become too accustomed to being able to see the exact hair I&#x27;m aiming for with the thin tweezers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the super decorative tweezers that are everywhere now (and they&#x27;re usually poorly made anyway), but a solid color that isn&#x27;t black or steel is a welcome addition.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp and pointy.  </li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like pink right.</li>
            <li> This is a very pale pink, so it&#x27;s nice and unobtrusive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually purchase the cheap drug store tweezers but they won&#x27;t grip the hair well and it slips out, which causes me stress.  </li>
            <li> so it gets rid of those hard to reach hairs that linger around and fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
            <li> Recently lost a black one i bought a few weeks back &amp; now this is my favorite one!</li>
            <li> They are not as nice as the more expensive brands, but they are also not as expensive.  </li>
            <li> They are tough and well made and can easily pluck the shortest hair.</li>
            <li> These Tweezers by Malva Belle get these bothersome black hairs out with so much ease and quicker than any pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> They are a little large for my hands, but still usable.</li>
            <li> These are less expensive but also not as good.  </li>
            <li> They are decent but I would pay the extra few dollars and get tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> And, I will be using them instead of my other old ones.  </li>
            <li> I misplaced my tweezers and needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a precision set of tweezers for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of different tweezers by a couple of different brands ranging from the super expensive Anatasia to tweezerman to other unknown brands.  </li>
            <li> These were decent but not amazing tweezers.  </li>
            <li> These tweezers are only average.</li>
            <li> The cheap tweezers that you get at Wally World don&#x27;t even compare when I use them I would feel like I was drunk because I kept missing the hair</li>
            <li> It was also rough or sharp.  </li>
            <li> The color is FAB, PINK!</li>
            <li> Tweezers of this quality would cost at least $8 at the store, but very likely $11-$20, and these are shipped to you.  </li>
            <li> In addition, my eye-hand coordination is below average.  </li>
            <li> It is made with a sturdy steel, they have sharp ends to grab the hairs tight and get them out.</li>
            <li> Gets the most annoying little hair.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would say this for a product so mundane as a tweezers</li>
            <li> then any other tweezers I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> This tweezers get hold of the hair firmly.  </li>
            <li> However I discovered that I have become too used to the thin tweezers to go back to fat tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I usually get these annoying hairs at least weekly sometimes more</li>
            <li> Not with these little beauties!</li>
            <li> A bit hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> no more ugly, bulk silver or black drug store tweezers for me.  </li>
            <li> Calibrated or not, this tweezers works for me like I have never experienced.  </li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> I use to wonder why it never hurt as bad at the salon as at home</li>
            <li> , I HATE tweeting!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great little set of tweezers! I like that the edge is pointy so it gets rid of those hard to reach hairs that linger around and fits comfortably in your hand. Great investment and they work really well!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received these items for testing &amp; review purposes!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received my Precision Eyebrow Tweezers and used them today. I love the bright pink color it is, I love the girly color of course. It is made with a sturdy steel, they have sharp ends to grab the hairs tight and get them out. These tweezers are great for shaping eyebrows and I like the sharp ends for removing splinters from my kids. This is a great pair of tweezers</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers! The slanted edge and point makes it very easy to grab the tiniest of hairs. Great price too!</li>
            <li> They are telling the truth when they say perfectly aligned.  I&#x27;ve had so many tweezers which were not perfectly alligned, so you have to find that sweet spot where you can get the hair.  These work everywhere, making eyebrow tweezing relatively quick.  They come in a really cute package, and seem to be very well made.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the super decorative tweezers that are everywhere now (and they&#x27;re usually poorly made anyway), but a solid color that isn&#x27;t black or steel is a welcome addition.  This is a very pale pink, so it&#x27;s nice and unobtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a discount for honestly reviewing it, so I&#x27;ll honestly say I might not spend the full amount on it.  Then again, at that price, to have it delivered to your door....  And, I will be using them instead of my other old ones.  Tweezers of this quality would cost at least $8 at the store, but very likely $11-$20, and these are shipped to you.  So, the pricing is totally fair.</li>
            <li> There is nothing quite like quality tweezers. I have had trouble with the cheaply made tweezers as they hurt more pulling out hairs and some will not even grab any hair. I recieved these for a very reduced price to try them out and love them. I would order these again for the normal price.</li>
            <li> The cheap tweezers that you get at Wally World don&#x27;t even compare when I use them I would feel like I was drunk because I kept missing the hair but I didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s just they didn&#x27;t work. These are outstanding and make me feel sober!</li>
            <li> I was chosen to test this product and provide my unbiased product review. These are great I love them. They allow me to get the tiniest hairs. I have always used ones from the drug store, and not cheap ones, I really didn&#x27;t think these were going to be any different but they really are. I really like the color also.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy. Alignment is perfect. Strong and durable. Easy to clean. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned. Love them!!</li>
            <li> BEST tweezers I have ever used. I wish they came in another color.</li>
            <li> this is a fantastic item. it gets all the hairs and there is no breakage. I love this item.</li>
            <li> Works well enough. My main concern was the aesthetic -- the light pink and silver are super cute!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the tweezers work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works well for the short hairs that waxing won&#x27;t grab!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tweezers I have even used! It is slim and petite. Perfect size.  this works great for eyebrows, &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34;, etc. The packaging was perfect. I think I will order another one!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was offered to me at reduced price for me to review, however that did not influence my opinion on this product.</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice. They aren&#x27;t as great as my Tweezermans, but they are better than the store brand.  The tips are nice and sharp and come together almost perfectly.  They are a little large for my hands, but still usable. Mine came in pink, and even though that doesn&#x27;t effect the usefulness it does make me like them more since they are pretty.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these tweezers!!! As a cosmetologist, finding a great pair of tweezers has been a challenge for me and these ones have exceeded my expectations. They feel good in the hand and have a sturdy grasp, i plan on purchasing another pair to keep at home (the pair I have know I keep in my station at work). Love them!!!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers for your brows. It really got out the smallest of hairs. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> A perfect pluck! I love the quality and durability.</li>
            <li> Beautiful,  fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love it.. These tweezer come in a pretty pick color and they work wonders. They are tough and well made and can easily pluck the shortest hair.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are only average. If used for eyebrows they don&#x27;t always hold on to the hair. I had to go to Sally&#x27;s and get Logo tweezers. The Logo tweezers are on Amazon, but you can&#x27;t tell how good they are by the picture, but they work so good that they put these to shame. The hair never slips through. Very consistent.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and hold.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are really nice and sturdy. I have used the same style tweezers from Revlon for two years but I find that these are better at gripping the hairs and get the little tiny hairs much easier. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great. You get what you pay for--generally.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t pay to buy cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Gets the most annoying little hair. Been wanting to get these but didn&#x27;t want to spend the money!! Glad i finally got them i probably spent more on the cheap ones than if i would of just bought these to start off with</li>
            <li> Recently lost a black one i bought a few weeks back &amp; now this is my favorite one!</li>
            <li> Excellent pair of tweezers, super sharp edges makes for easy grabbing of fine hairs.  Pretty pink color and ultra sleek design are a huge plus...no more ugly, bulk silver or black drug store tweezers for me.  Would have given 5 stars if it came with a case or slip cover of sorts.</li>
            <li> This tweezers get hold of the hair firmly.  Works really well.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.  Nice color.  Perfect to get into the areas that are hard to get.</li>
            <li> These are the best did my eye brows perfect i got this at discounted price in return leave review</li>
            <li> Well built with a precise tip.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are one of those products that I have to have multiples of and have them pretty much everywhere in my house because I have this issue where I get black hairs; the ones that are super hard,usually really short,and bug you if you can&#x27;t get them out. I usually get these annoying hairs at least weekly sometimes more and they are very bothersome. These Tweezers by Malva Belle get these bothersome black hairs out with so much ease and quicker than any pair of tweezers I&#x27;ve used before. I have scars under my chin from tweezers that just wouldn&#x27;t or couldn&#x27;t grab onto the hair so I would literally pinch my skin with the tweezers over and over again. I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore with this tweezer! When it comes to this problem alone I would definitely recommend these tweezers but the fact that they also work amazingly with plucking eyebrows it makes me that much more to recommend this tweezer by Malva Belle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> These tweezers are so pretty but more than that, I HATE tweeting! Not with these little beauties! They make  tweeting almost painless! Seriously! I use to wonder why it never hurt as bad at the salon as at home and now I think I know why! They have to use these!LOL! I was really surprised how nice the really sharp slant of the tweezers was.  And they say it stays sharp no matter how many times you use them. If it does they will be the best tweezers ever These tweezers have very smooth smooth and have perfectly aligned tips that allow you to get in there and tweeze that hair down at the root.  Plus, it cleans up in a snap! Just tweeze and rinse!They are perfect for my makeup bag, and it&#x27;s a really Nice to have in the first aid kit, too!</li>
            <li> These work very well, and are very nice. I will probably order another pair soon to keep in my purse.  They grip very well, not allowing the hair to slip out, and they are the perfect size, not too big, not too small.  I usually purchase the cheap drug store tweezers but they won&#x27;t grip the hair well and it slips out, which causes me stress.  This pair is worth a few bucks more that you pay; you get what you pay for in this case for sure.  Thumbs up, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best I ever had!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This item is really awesome. The tweezers are strong and precise with the shape of this tool. I truthfully own 4 tweezers that I have bought from name brand stores and from catalog companies. I cant take the pain of waxing or the irritation is causes to my skin. These tweezers are by far the best I have. I own other products by this company and have never had an issue or have been displeased. The angle this tool has is perfect and has a nice point to get that &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; hair out of the way. I would highly recommend this to any of my girlfriends and others, as I was very happy with this beauty tool. I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Grabs the tiniest hair!</li>
            <li> Very precise and strong tweezers.  Perfect for eyebrows and removing hard to get splinters.  I also love that they are pink!</li>
            <li> Love these! Great Quality super precise and cute to boot :)</li>
            <li> Probably one of the beset tweezers I&#x27;ve used in my life. There is no playing around with these guys! Great quality!! Would recommend to someone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size to hold and pluck. It removes easily</li>
            <li> Great! Very good tweezers, just bought a new pair from walmart and they didn&#x27;t work well, these grip great and they&#x27;re pretty!</li>
            <li> Perfect product...  Awesome reach and great grab</li>
            <li> These tweezers are pretty good. Although I thought they would be a bit sturdier.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a precision set of tweezers for a long time. These are awesome. Fit and finish are flawless and very durable. A+++</li>
            <li> These tweezers work well for tweezing eyebrow hairs.  However I discovered that I have become too used to the thin tweezers to go back to fat tweezers.  Because of this I don&#x27;t like them, but this is not because the tweezers don&#x27;t work well.  I just have become too accustomed to being able to see the exact hair I&#x27;m aiming for with the thin tweezers and it now bothers me that I can&#x27;t see the hair because the tweezers block my view when I am using them.  So, if you like wide blade tweezers these are great!</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers. They feel good in your hand, the slant makes it easy to target the exact hair that you were going for and they (most important of all) grip the hair securely. Thank you so much for allowing me to try this out. This is yet another product that I will never purchase from a drugstore again!</li>
            <li> Best tweezers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> These were decent but not amazing tweezers.  I have a lot of different tweezers by a couple of different brands ranging from the super expensive Anatasia to tweezerman to other unknown brands.  These are less expensive but also not as good.  I found the tip to be a bit bulkier,  It was also rough or sharp.  A bit hard to describe.  They are not as nice as the more expensive brands, but they are also not as expensive.  They are decent but I would pay the extra few dollars and get tweezerman.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Very good quality. I am very picky about my tweezers and these little gems are wonderful..highly recommend them if you are a tweezer connoisseur like me! shipped fast, no problems..Great, Great Great.</li>
            <li> I really like these.  They make fixing my brows so much easier than my old tweezers!!</li>
            <li> These are awesome I use them to pluck my eyebrows and they work so much better then any other tweezers I have used in the past.  Also the color doesn&#x27;t hurt either because I love pink.  Will purchase these in the future and stock up with one in the car, one in each bathroom etc....</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of tweezers in my life and I have to say these are my all time favorite. I love everything about these tweezers from the packaging and the beautiful color of pink they are to the way they can get even the smallest, shortest piece of hair. The slant is just the exact angle you need to get even the most stubborn thing you need to remove out plus they fit perfectly in you fingers. Everything about these tweezers is high quality. I totally recommend them to anyone who is looking for a new pair of tweezers that work the very best. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discount for my honest and unbiased review and am so glad I did!!</li>
            <li> Super sharp and pointy.  Easily pluck eyebrows with these.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these. Like seriously seriously love these. I love all things make up or face related. Ive purchased cheap brands and high end brands. Ive received products for free because of my Instagram account and by far, these are my favorite tweezers. The color is FAB, PINK! Who doesn&#x27;t like pink right. But the feel is wonderful and they pick up the finest hairs. Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Very simple to use and I love it</li>
            <li> Great quality !! Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would say this for a product so mundane as a tweezers but this is a terrific product.  I misplaced my tweezers and needed a new one.  I am disabled and my fingers don&#x27;t work very well.  In addition, my eye-hand coordination is below average.  But I muddle through.  As I searched the Amazon offerings for a replacement tweezers, I had many options, one of which was a straight replacement of the one I misplaced.  I also had this one and the price was twice as much but they claimed it was &amp;#34;calibrated&amp;#34; so I had to find out what that was all about.  Calibrated or not, this tweezers works for me like I have never experienced.  I am able to target the hair and it actually gets pulled out by the tweezers rather than slipping through even if I do manage to zero in on it.  I recommend this product for someone able to spend a little more for a tweezers in order to save time and frustration.</li>
