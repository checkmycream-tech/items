            <li>good for having guests staying the night</li>
            <li>It is a usable good quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>They do a good job of getting the glue in the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>These are good for cleaning, but the bristles fall out while brushing and sometimes get stuck in your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have already used a couple of them and they are really as good as advertised.</li>
            <li>good product for the price</li>
            <li>Quality is good for the price.</li>

            <li>Nice item and Good Quality .</li>
            <li>(so many toothbrushes!).  </li>
            <li>Price is amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought a 144 pack of these for when friends sleep over and don&#x27;t bring their own toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I just love that these toothbrushes are disposable, yet of good quality.</li>
            <li>Really nice for one</li>
            <li>so I have to find my own storage solution for the closet.  </li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>They will provide about a week of good, sturdy oral care and can be carried easily in hand bags, overnight bags, glove boxes or just about any travel bag.</li>
            <li>The brush is medium-soft to soft which is perfect for my purpose.  </li>
            <li>Came really fast, I use it to clean my guns, perfect!!</li>
            <li>you want a basic brush for all sorts of use that are super cheap and can just be thrown away after use (whether cleaning your teeth or cleaning anything) than these are a great buy and work perfectly!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find toothbrushes for a better price.</li>
            <li>My kids go through toothbrushes like most people</li>
            <li>I love.</li>
            <li>We ordered 3 more cases for the shelter, and we&#x27;ll use them for travel ourselves.</li>
            <li>and we would not be able to get the bristles out of his throat.  </li>
            <li>cheap toothbrushes, but they are meant to be since they are disposable, came in handy when I had guests sleep over</li>
            <li>Handle could be a bit sturdier, but then that would make them cost more...</li>
            <li>okay if you have a one-night guest at your house or something and they forgot their toothbrush.</li>
            <li>eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any leftover will be used for cleaning, perhaps brushing my dogs&#x27; teeth, packing for vacation, keeping in my purse for the times that I need to brush while I&#x27;m not home, leaving in the guest bathroom, and so many more.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s more eco-friendly</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Many come without anything to the emergency ward.</li>
            <li>cheep but ok for the cleaning packs.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect more than 1 time use for each brush.</li>
            <li>Since they are not specifically cleaning brushes I gave them a star more than I would have.</li>
            <li>I love her and her huge heart and help out with my own donations when I am able.</li>
            <li>and so far so good for us!  </li>
            <li>these are pretty flimsy...hoping to get a good deal for the Christmas Shoe Boxes our church fills.</li>
            <li>I think they are a pretty good value for using any time and all the time.</li>
            <li>Got to brush, we filled many bags to give before winter hit</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and do a great job.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t recommend replacing your normal toothbrush with one of these, they work great for being a cheap, disposable toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Incredible number of them for the price, and all individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>At this price (and the fact that they&#x27;re all wrapped), it&#x27;s easy to toss one into each of your suitcases, purse, office desk drawer, glove box of your car...</li>
            <li>These clean my teeth much better than drug store toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>these are just as good as the high dollar brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d do the job, the price is right, but I&#x27;d comparison shop and go with best price again next time.</li>
            <li>Came exactly as scripted and such a great price!</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are serving this purpose just fine.</li>
            <li>They are pretty firm, which is great for cleaning, maybe not so great for toothbrushing.  </li>
            <li>Consider donating to your own local shelters, I am sure they would appreciate them!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap and they feel like it.  </li>
            <li>We are using these to run fungal cultures on cats, so the fact they are individually sealed is a great benefit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to keep in a container for the occasional house guests.</li>
            <li>it was really cheap</li>
            <li>These brushes fill an important need for an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Great cost effect option for the kids need constant replacements</li>
            <li>work really well for detail work though, and are nice to keep in an emergency kit.</li>
            <li>Great deal, we&#x27;re great for what I needed will prolly buy again next year for the same use .highly recommended</li>
            <li>Bristles aren&#x27;t as secure as I&#x27;d like but what the hll.</li>
            <li>One of the most useful tools in my business is the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic idea.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic</li>
            <li>I like to massage my gums and give my teeth a light brush while watching TV after my evening meal.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are good and have lasted all week so far.  </li>
            <li>If you prefer a soft brush, this is a good one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect these toothbrushes to be great - they have less bristles than a normal brush, but hey, they are disposable and they work great for one or two uses.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;WORST: Since they are NOT reusable, they are not environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>Works fine, nice soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>I clean edges of things, jewelry..</li>
            <li>Grab a clean brush,  Use it..  Toss it.  </li>
            <li>Super cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly as you would expect, individually wrapped, great for the use I needed them for a homeless shelter donation.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are good, basic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Delighted that the toothbrushes are individually wrapped!</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect great quality, especially for the price, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of if you&#x27;re looking for a nice soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li>for 144 teeth brushes its ok, really cheep though</li>
            <li>they are individual wrapped, and it&#x27;s a good price.  </li>
            <li>Again great product for donation to missions and other projects that I am involved in.</li>
            <li>Priced well, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>and when I am out (will probably be a while), I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>Came FAST and just what I was hoping for!!  </li>
            <li>I needed a large volume of toothbrushes and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Great product for donation and much better quality than expected for this price, these are on my list to buy again, a big plus is that they are wrapped single and are sanitary, also good if you want to change your toothbrush often.</li>
            <li>Great for a few uses</li>
            <li>I was not expecting such nice quality.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money for the guests who come to your house with out a tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>They were VERY WELL packaged, each in its own clear and sanitary pack.</li>
            <li>They are a little smaller than a full size toothbrush but perfect for dogs.</li>
            <li>well done,at the right price.</li>
            <li>I did not count them but 144 looks right.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are just the right size and flexible for cleaning all your guns.  </li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of handle structure to make it useful, but the handle is also &#x27;hollowed-out&#x27; (if you can call it that), and not completely filled with a large amount of bulky plastic like a more popular disposable brand.</li>
            <li>The package I received was  a box filled with boxes filled with individually wrapped toothbrushes</li>
            <li>These brushes are all individually packed and a great back up for anyone.</li>
            <li>: There is NO weird smell  to the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I have a hangup about using the same toothbrush for more than a day.  </li>
            <li>The product description was exactly what we received.</li>
            <li>and I love that they came individually packed.</li>
            <li>Should be funny.</li>
            <li>Would be great for cleaning, don&#x27;t expect much if you are planning to actually brush human teeth.</li>
            <li>They did exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This item is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>They are NOT biodegradable, just be aware, they are made of plastic.</li>
            <li>But for the price, I have a long term supply of perfectly functional toothbrushes for a small price.</li>
            <li>This is a very disposible toothbrush as in it will not last more than 1 wk if you brush your teeth was recommended.</li>
            <li>I use these to clean my guns and little intricate devices and as many as come in a pack</li>
            <li>Pretty flimsy handles but very functional for what we use them for.</li>
            <li>Nice having a new toothbrush every couple of days instead of having to clean the more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The white, plastic handles are not as strong as the $2 each models but hold up with repeated use.</li>
            <li>but I love using a fresh toothbrush every other day!</li>
            <li>Bristles are a little rigid for everyday use, but wonderful for overnight guests who forget their toiletries and when you need a backup in your purse.  </li>
            <li>The Toothbrush it about the best thing for cleaning my bike (the gears and chain) and for cleaning other items that need a bristle to clean (concrete, tough stains,...).  </li>
            <li>thank you so much .i will use these for backup toothbrush and for cleaning my glock.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush were cheap and the bristles kept coming out when I brushed my teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought this for the whole family to use for two weeks while we are on antibiotics and being retested.</li>
            <li>These are cheap toothbrushes, but totally serviceable for what they are:</li>
            <li>Much easier to just bring these and throw them away when we leave than to pack everyone&#x27;s electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>They do the job ... and are quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>The brushes are called SparkleFresh which made me think they are ready to use portable toothbrushes with toothpaste.</li>
            <li>so you have to be gentle when brushing.  </li>
            <li>I am not in the dental industry, but kids get sooo much candy</li>
            <li>(I actually ordered batteries and needed something to take me over the $35 free shipping threshold and picked these.)  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap enough you can do that.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t worry much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, very basoc.</li>
            <li>They are very basic toothbrushes, but fit the bill when you need a bunch there is a chance they may become disposable, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But they seemed to work well enough, and was comfortable on the gums.</li>
            <li>They are a little small and the handle is not that sturdy but when guests come to the vacation home and forget their toothbrush, they are perfect!</li>
            <li>When cleaning my bike I can scrub the gears and chain and just throw it away and not bother trying to clean and reuse a greasy brush again later.  </li>
            <li>Individual packaging keeps it clean.  </li>
            <li>We bought these to donate to the local shelter and did not expect them to last long, BUT they are pretty good.</li>
            <li>As she was once homeless herself, so I think she has a better understanding of how much those basic necessities that most of us take for granted truly mean.</li>
            <li>Each of the brushes are individually wrapped (not bad if you needed some throw-aways on a trip or to keep in the glove box for meetings).  </li>
            <li>: If you try to walk around the house with the toothbrush in your mouth (Come on, you KNOW you do)&lt;br /&gt;saliva will travel down the ridge on top of the handle and drip off the end.&lt;br /&gt;LOL</li>
            <li>OK but didn&#x27;t realize that they only had half as many bristles as regular tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bristles are REALLY soft ... good for a baby or delicate</li>
            <li>For the price and the order these are fairly decent.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how many disposable toothbrushes arrived at such a low price.</li>
            <li>Chances are, most will be thrown away, but buying this box of 144 toothbrushes for less than $12 is a lot cheaper than the candy that I normally buy and that I&#x27;m tempted, and often do,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love that I got 144 toothbrushes for less than $12!  </li>
            <li>only reason it isn&#x27;t 5 stars is because it&#x27;s like SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>The handle is strong enough to finish the job but don&#x27;t compare this to regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>When some one comes for the weekend and forgets their tooth brush, it beats running out for a new one.</li>
            <li>Finally, my boyfriend and I came up with the idea of buying a box of cheap disposable toothbrushes so that I wouldn&#x27;t feel such aversion to brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They came directly inside the main packaging.  </li>
            <li>Soft toothbrushes are good for cleaning teeth without damaging the enamel, and massaging and cleaning the gums; hard brushes like these probably won&#x27;t hurt you if you use them occasionally, but could be damaging, I think, if used every day.</li>
            <li>My friends gladly use these over other alternatives such as your finger or skipping altogether.</li>
            <li>Cheap and not worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Im not sure how many years will go by, before I exhaust this pack.</li>
            <li>Many years ago while on active duty I bought a box of 100 or so disposable toothbrushes similar to these for cleaning guns.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t hard either - they are more like medium to medium/soft.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced and are even individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>The ad describes these as having soft bristles with polished tips.  </li>
            <li>I teach early childhood</li>
            <li>You get long use out of the whole box!</li>
            <li>For both purposes I think the brushes and handle are too soft.  </li>
            <li>I cannot remember where I got them or how much I paid, however, after I ran out I resorted to the Dollar Tree and getting maybe ten for a buck.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft.  </li>
            <li>6 children who lose their toothbrushes frequently...</li>
            <li>The brush isn&#x27;t soft at all</li>
            <li>I have overnight guests who forget their toothbrush and some who stay unexpectedly.  </li>
            <li>: These are not sturdy enough to use for more-than-once cleaning of ANYTHING other than baby teeth and fine</li>
            <li>Unlike some other disposable tooth brushes, this one is made from &#x27;just the right amount&#x27; of plastic so as to minimize any guilt feelings about using a disposable.</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended we replace our toothbrush, but I was worried about what day in the cycle we should replace and even more, whether the strep would be gone with a single round of antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>each brush is indvidually wrapped and that&#x27;s exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>These are a little better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>A large quantity of product for not very much.</li>
            <li>I almost only gave 3 stars, but then again realistically what can someone really expect when buying 144 individually wrapped toothbrushes for about 12 dollars.</li>
            <li>I bought these because an old friend of mine was completely paranoid about using the same toothbrush twice!</li>
            <li>have had a few that the bristles come out in your teeth when your brushing, but again, what we need them for which is basically a quick brush and throw away after one use when my kids have friends spend the night they work</li>
            <li>Very good for deep cleaning around the house, tons of those little cheap toothbrushes so you can dispose of one as it gets filthy and grimey.</li>
            <li>The major issue is the bristles come off while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth</li>
            <li>One use only, clearly.</li>
            <li>I realize that terms like \\&quot;soft\\&quot; and \\&quot;hard\\&quot; are relative and subjective, but I would not call these toothbrushes soft.  </li>
            <li>She does teen bags as well as adult bags, but they all need toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>i use them for work alot of the other types are over priced and you cannot reach your whole mouth with some of them</li>
            <li>These are not designed for heavy extensive use each, but each brush can work effectively for at least a couple of days, and for the price</li>
            <li>Be careful and brush very softly.</li>
            <li>pretty much anywhere you might find yourself wishing you could brush your teeth and not feel bad about disposing it after a couple of uses because they&#x27;re so very inexpensive!</li>

            <li> - I found these to be a great alternative.  </li>
            <li> But for the purpose of a one time use its a great value</li>
            <li> These work great for the price on the dogs I groom.</li>
            <li> I am a return customer, these are great, we make hygiene bags for the homeless and everyone gets one of these.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for our camper, work great and don&#x27;t have to worry about packing a toothbrush or forgetting it at the camper.</li>

            <li> All the parents loved it.</li>
            <li> They are good toothbrushes too</li>
            <li> These fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> good for having guests staying the night</li>
            <li> It is a usable good quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> They do a good job of getting the glue in the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> These are good for cleaning, but the bristles fall out while brushing and sometimes get stuck in your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have already used a couple of them and they are really as good as advertised.</li>
            <li> good product for the price</li>
            <li> Quality is good for the price.</li>
            <li> We use these brushes to clean molds, they work like a charm, we needed to buy bulk and these were the best value.</li>
            <li> Nice item and Good Quality .</li>
            <li> (so many toothbrushes!).  </li>
            <li> Price is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought a 144 pack of these for when friends sleep over and don&#x27;t bring their own toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I just love that these toothbrushes are disposable, yet of good quality.</li>
            <li> Really nice for one</li>
            <li> so I have to find my own storage solution for the closet.  </li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> They will provide about a week of good, sturdy oral care and can be carried easily in hand bags, overnight bags, glove boxes or just about any travel bag.</li>
            <li> The brush is medium-soft to soft which is perfect for my purpose.  </li>
            <li> Came really fast, I use it to clean my guns, perfect!!</li>
            <li> you want a basic brush for all sorts of use that are super cheap and can just be thrown away after use (whether cleaning your teeth or cleaning anything) than these are a great buy and work perfectly!  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find toothbrushes for a better price.</li>
            <li> My kids go through toothbrushes like most people</li>
            <li> I love.</li>
            <li> We ordered 3 more cases for the shelter, and we&#x27;ll use them for travel ourselves.</li>
            <li> and we would not be able to get the bristles out of his throat.  </li>
            <li> cheap toothbrushes, but they are meant to be since they are disposable, came in handy when I had guests sleep over</li>
            <li> Handle could be a bit sturdier, but then that would make them cost more...</li>
            <li> okay if you have a one-night guest at your house or something and they forgot their toothbrush.</li>
            <li> eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any leftover will be used for cleaning, perhaps brushing my dogs&#x27; teeth, packing for vacation, keeping in my purse for the times that I need to brush while I&#x27;m not home, leaving in the guest bathroom, and so many more.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s more eco-friendly</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Many come without anything to the emergency ward.</li>
            <li> cheep but ok for the cleaning packs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect more than 1 time use for each brush.</li>
            <li> Since they are not specifically cleaning brushes I gave them a star more than I would have.</li>
            <li> I love her and her huge heart and help out with my own donations when I am able.</li>
            <li> and so far so good for us!  </li>
            <li> these are pretty flimsy...hoping to get a good deal for the Christmas Shoe Boxes our church fills.</li>
            <li> I think they are a pretty good value for using any time and all the time.</li>
            <li> Got to brush, we filled many bags to give before winter hit</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and do a great job.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t recommend replacing your normal toothbrush with one of these, they work great for being a cheap, disposable toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Incredible number of them for the price, and all individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> At this price (and the fact that they&#x27;re all wrapped), it&#x27;s easy to toss one into each of your suitcases, purse, office desk drawer, glove box of your car...</li>
            <li> These clean my teeth much better than drug store toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> these are just as good as the high dollar brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d do the job, the price is right, but I&#x27;d comparison shop and go with best price again next time.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as scripted and such a great price!</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are serving this purpose just fine.</li>
            <li> They are pretty firm, which is great for cleaning, maybe not so great for toothbrushing.  </li>
            <li> Consider donating to your own local shelters, I am sure they would appreciate them!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap and they feel like it.  </li>
            <li> We are using these to run fungal cultures on cats, so the fact they are individually sealed is a great benefit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to keep in a container for the occasional house guests.</li>
            <li> it was really cheap</li>
            <li> These brushes fill an important need for an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Great cost effect option for the kids need constant replacements</li>
            <li> work really well for detail work though, and are nice to keep in an emergency kit.</li>
            <li> Great deal, we&#x27;re great for what I needed will prolly buy again next year for the same use .highly recommended</li>
            <li> Bristles aren&#x27;t as secure as I&#x27;d like but what the hll.</li>
            <li> One of the most useful tools in my business is the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic idea.  </li>
            <li> These are fantastic</li>
            <li> I like to massage my gums and give my teeth a light brush while watching TV after my evening meal.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are good and have lasted all week so far.  </li>
            <li> If you prefer a soft brush, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect these toothbrushes to be great - they have less bristles than a normal brush, but hey, they are disposable and they work great for one or two uses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;WORST: Since they are NOT reusable, they are not environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> Works fine, nice soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> I clean edges of things, jewelry..</li>
            <li> Grab a clean brush,  Use it..  Toss it.  </li>
            <li> Super cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> These are exactly as you would expect, individually wrapped, great for the use I needed them for a homeless shelter donation.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are good, basic toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Delighted that the toothbrushes are individually wrapped!</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t expect great quality, especially for the price, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of if you&#x27;re looking for a nice soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> for 144 teeth brushes its ok, really cheep though</li>
            <li> they are individual wrapped, and it&#x27;s a good price.  </li>
            <li> Again great product for donation to missions and other projects that I am involved in.</li>
            <li> Priced well, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> and when I am out (will probably be a while), I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> Came FAST and just what I was hoping for!!  </li>
            <li> I needed a large volume of toothbrushes and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Great product for donation and much better quality than expected for this price, these are on my list to buy again, a big plus is that they are wrapped single and are sanitary, also good if you want to change your toothbrush often.</li>
            <li> Great for a few uses</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such nice quality.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money for the guests who come to your house with out a tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> They were VERY WELL packaged, each in its own clear and sanitary pack.</li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than a full size toothbrush but perfect for dogs.</li>
            <li> well done,at the right price.</li>
            <li> I did not count them but 144 looks right.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are just the right size and flexible for cleaning all your guns.  </li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of handle structure to make it useful, but the handle is also &#x27;hollowed-out&#x27; (if you can call it that), and not completely filled with a large amount of bulky plastic like a more popular disposable brand.</li>
            <li> The package I received was  a box filled with boxes filled with individually wrapped toothbrushes</li>
            <li> These brushes are all individually packed and a great back up for anyone.</li>
            <li> : There is NO weird smell  to the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I have a hangup about using the same toothbrush for more than a day.  </li>
            <li> The product description was exactly what we received.</li>
            <li> and I love that they came individually packed.</li>
            <li> Should be funny.</li>
            <li> Would be great for cleaning, don&#x27;t expect much if you are planning to actually brush human teeth.</li>
            <li> They did exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> They are NOT biodegradable, just be aware, they are made of plastic.</li>
            <li> But for the price, I have a long term supply of perfectly functional toothbrushes for a small price.</li>
            <li> This is a very disposible toothbrush as in it will not last more than 1 wk if you brush your teeth was recommended.</li>
            <li> I use these to clean my guns and little intricate devices and as many as come in a pack</li>
            <li> Pretty flimsy handles but very functional for what we use them for.</li>
            <li> Nice having a new toothbrush every couple of days instead of having to clean the more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The white, plastic handles are not as strong as the $2 each models but hold up with repeated use.</li>
            <li> but I love using a fresh toothbrush every other day!</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little rigid for everyday use, but wonderful for overnight guests who forget their toiletries and when you need a backup in your purse.  </li>
            <li> The Toothbrush it about the best thing for cleaning my bike (the gears and chain) and for cleaning other items that need a bristle to clean (concrete, tough stains,...).  </li>
            <li> thank you so much .i will use these for backup toothbrush and for cleaning my glock.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush were cheap and the bristles kept coming out when I brushed my teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought this for the whole family to use for two weeks while we are on antibiotics and being retested.</li>
            <li> These are cheap toothbrushes, but totally serviceable for what they are:</li>
            <li> Much easier to just bring these and throw them away when we leave than to pack everyone&#x27;s electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> They do the job ... and are quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> The brushes are called SparkleFresh which made me think they are ready to use portable toothbrushes with toothpaste.</li>
            <li> so you have to be gentle when brushing.  </li>
            <li> I am not in the dental industry, but kids get sooo much candy</li>
            <li> (I actually ordered batteries and needed something to take me over the $35 free shipping threshold and picked these.)  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap enough you can do that.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t worry much.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, very basoc.</li>
            <li> They are very basic toothbrushes, but fit the bill when you need a bunch there is a chance they may become disposable, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But they seemed to work well enough, and was comfortable on the gums.</li>
            <li> They are a little small and the handle is not that sturdy but when guests come to the vacation home and forget their toothbrush, they are perfect!</li>
            <li> When cleaning my bike I can scrub the gears and chain and just throw it away and not bother trying to clean and reuse a greasy brush again later.  </li>
            <li> Individual packaging keeps it clean.  </li>
            <li> We bought these to donate to the local shelter and did not expect them to last long, BUT they are pretty good.</li>
            <li> As she was once homeless herself, so I think she has a better understanding of how much those basic necessities that most of us take for granted truly mean.</li>
            <li> Each of the brushes are individually wrapped (not bad if you needed some throw-aways on a trip or to keep in the glove box for meetings).  </li>
            <li> : If you try to walk around the house with the toothbrush in your mouth (Come on, you KNOW you do)&lt;br /&gt;saliva will travel down the ridge on top of the handle and drip off the end.&lt;br /&gt;LOL</li>
            <li> OK but didn&#x27;t realize that they only had half as many bristles as regular tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bristles are REALLY soft ... good for a baby or delicate</li>
            <li> For the price and the order these are fairly decent.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how many disposable toothbrushes arrived at such a low price.</li>
            <li> Chances are, most will be thrown away, but buying this box of 144 toothbrushes for less than $12 is a lot cheaper than the candy that I normally buy and that I&#x27;m tempted, and often do,</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love that I got 144 toothbrushes for less than $12!  </li>
            <li> only reason it isn&#x27;t 5 stars is because it&#x27;s like SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> The handle is strong enough to finish the job but don&#x27;t compare this to regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> When some one comes for the weekend and forgets their tooth brush, it beats running out for a new one.</li>
            <li> Finally, my boyfriend and I came up with the idea of buying a box of cheap disposable toothbrushes so that I wouldn&#x27;t feel such aversion to brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They came directly inside the main packaging.  </li>
            <li> Soft toothbrushes are good for cleaning teeth without damaging the enamel, and massaging and cleaning the gums; hard brushes like these probably won&#x27;t hurt you if you use them occasionally, but could be damaging, I think, if used every day.</li>
            <li> My friends gladly use these over other alternatives such as your finger or skipping altogether.</li>
            <li> Cheap and not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure how many years will go by, before I exhaust this pack.</li>
            <li> Many years ago while on active duty I bought a box of 100 or so disposable toothbrushes similar to these for cleaning guns.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t hard either - they are more like medium to medium/soft.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> They are reasonably priced and are even individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> The ad describes these as having soft bristles with polished tips.  </li>
            <li> I teach early childhood</li>
            <li> You get long use out of the whole box!</li>
            <li> For both purposes I think the brushes and handle are too soft.  </li>
            <li> I cannot remember where I got them or how much I paid, however, after I ran out I resorted to the Dollar Tree and getting maybe ten for a buck.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft.  </li>
            <li> 6 children who lose their toothbrushes frequently...</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t soft at all</li>
            <li> I have overnight guests who forget their toothbrush and some who stay unexpectedly.  </li>
            <li> : These are not sturdy enough to use for more-than-once cleaning of ANYTHING other than baby teeth and fine</li>
            <li> Unlike some other disposable tooth brushes, this one is made from &#x27;just the right amount&#x27; of plastic so as to minimize any guilt feelings about using a disposable.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended we replace our toothbrush, but I was worried about what day in the cycle we should replace and even more, whether the strep would be gone with a single round of antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> each brush is indvidually wrapped and that&#x27;s exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> These are a little better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> A large quantity of product for not very much.</li>
            <li> I almost only gave 3 stars, but then again realistically what can someone really expect when buying 144 individually wrapped toothbrushes for about 12 dollars.</li>
            <li> I bought these because an old friend of mine was completely paranoid about using the same toothbrush twice!</li>
            <li> have had a few that the bristles come out in your teeth when your brushing, but again, what we need them for which is basically a quick brush and throw away after one use when my kids have friends spend the night they work</li>
            <li> Very good for deep cleaning around the house, tons of those little cheap toothbrushes so you can dispose of one as it gets filthy and grimey.</li>
            <li> The major issue is the bristles come off while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth</li>
            <li> One use only, clearly.</li>
            <li> I realize that terms like \\&quot;soft\\&quot; and \\&quot;hard\\&quot; are relative and subjective, but I would not call these toothbrushes soft.  </li>
            <li> She does teen bags as well as adult bags, but they all need toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> i use them for work alot of the other types are over priced and you cannot reach your whole mouth with some of them</li>
            <li> These are not designed for heavy extensive use each, but each brush can work effectively for at least a couple of days, and for the price</li>
            <li> Be careful and brush very softly.</li>
            <li> pretty much anywhere you might find yourself wishing you could brush your teeth and not feel bad about disposing it after a couple of uses because they&#x27;re so very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> depending on how hard you brush, also good for odd jobs that require small brushes such as cleaning</li>
            <li> also plan to use these to creating care packages for people spending the night at the hospital with sick loved ones.</li>
            <li> These are decent toothbrushes, if a little softer than I like.</li>
            <li> Bristles are pretty hard/sharp if you brush too hard it might damage your gums, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> These work for what we need them for and that is simply disposable toothbrushes, not very sturdy and will only last a time or two-</li>
            <li> even if my guests forget theirs and only use each one a single time.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my guest rental - they&#x27;re certainly not a high quality tooth brush, but they&#x27;re individually wrapped for sanitation and the case price cannot be beat...</li>
            <li> In other words, if you are buying these for personal use, this will be the last box of toothbrushes you&#x27;ll have to buy in your lifetime.</li>
            <li> I spent the next five minutes rinsing nylon out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I use them constantly for cleaning a wide assortment of things.</li>
            <li> they are not for long use at all.</li>
            <li> Even if they weren&#x27;t falling out, they&#x27;re so soft, it would be impossible to clean anything off your teeth with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They really only last a few uses before their bristles start bending or falling out.</li>
            <li> These are meant for single or (maybe) two times use.</li>
            <li> I still have plenty left for my overnight guests and for any other reason!</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re not a brush you&#x27;ll keep for six months, the handle is a little too flexible, and I don&#x27;t know how long those bristles will last.</li>
            <li> I thought that for one of the brushes, it left a slightly &#x27;off&#x27; taste in my mouth after use, but that might have just been my mouth&#x27;s &#x27;body-chemistry&#x27; that day.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;3o Tuft&#x27; and &#x27;Case Pack 144&#x27; was a little confusing to us in the ad title but we ordered it anyway because of the positive customer reviews we read.</li>
            <li> I found myself buying new toothbrushes every week!!, &amp; now I&#x27;m happily not.  </li>
            <li> I put a box in my desk at work, gave a box to my sister for her overnight forgetful guests, and gave a box to my parents for the guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li> They were what I expected, though I would prefer that they have stiffer bristles.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last a long time, but then I can spend an awful lot more on a toothbrush and it won&#x27;t last long either.</li>
            <li> They also come in handy for miscellaneous uses around the house like brushing out hair and &#x27;gunk&#x27; from our combs, scrubbing around the base of bathroom faucets, etc.</li>
            <li> I gagged when I used one due to the bristles falling out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered these and we are sending to the soldiers for Christmas along with some other items  </li>
            <li> We use these for cleaning firearms and other things around the house.  </li>
            <li> No germs by using same toothbrush everyday!</li>
            <li> Preferred the other ones I ordered</li>
            <li> We have had a recurring case of strep in our house, with one active infection and two carriers.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get in behind that last molar as well but that just take a bit of extra work.</li>
            <li> However, toothbrushes in the stores are so expensive that you cannot really consider buying them for cleaning these types of items.  </li>
            <li> Only purchase I have not liked from Amazon.</li>
            <li> We put a few in the glove compartment for use when we&#x27;re out for a while, especially on long car trips.</li>
            <li> I gave this brush 4 stars instead of 5 because the handle bends slightly during use.  </li>
            <li> They hurt my gums a little when I tried one out</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending big bucks on fancy brushes, and decided to give these a try.  </li>
            <li> and we do a few projects to highlight National Dental Health Care Month.  </li>
            <li> Would I use these everyday, no.</li>
            <li> I hate traveling with my primary toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> #34;soft bristles&amp;#34;, but this is so soft it makes me insecure that they&#x27;re cleaning well.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re travelling and don&#x27;t want to pack an expensive electric toothbrush, and, like me, hate those stubby little &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; toothbrushes (it always pops free of the cover/handle thing in the middle of brushing), this brush will serve you nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, all my OTHER toothbrushes I&#x27;ve EVER had were &#x27;mobile-friendly&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus since they are like 20 something in each small box</li>
            <li> cause I just couldn&#x27;t get past it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these for cleaning small parts, and to use when travelling.  </li>
            <li> It can be used as a cleaning tool for small area at home.</li>
            <li> Very few bristles in them.  </li>
            <li> The 144 brushes are broken down into boxes of 24.  </li>
            <li> : If you brush hard these WILL bend; Handle is UNCOMFORTABLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> one thing I don&#x27;t like about these is that they are rather hard.  </li>
            <li> I am a fanatic about brushing myself and now I keep some in my car so I can brush on the go whenever I need to.</li>
            <li> Many of the bristles come out during brushing, making for an unpleasant and annoying experience for those on the go.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute worst toothbrushes of all time.</li>
            <li> It results in mediocre tooth brushing and poor parts cleaning.  </li>
            <li> and I hate packing and unpacking a wet toothbrush every day.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for cold season</li>
            <li> These brushes shed bristles like crazy and no one likes picking bristles out of their mouth.</li>
            <li> I was afraid my son would get choked</li>
            <li> Purchased as a dirty santa/white elephant gift.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel badly about tossing it</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  </li>
            <li> I feel so disgusting about using an already-used toothbrush that I would literally go weeks without brushing my teeth</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> These disposable toothbrushes are awesome!  I have a lot of house guests and someone always forgets to bring their toothbrush.  Theses came in a larger box that contained 6 smaller boxes with 24 toothbrush each (144 in total)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Great for a few uses&lt;br /&gt;- Medium firmness bristles&lt;br /&gt;- Disposable!</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose of being used in care packages.</li>
            <li> I bought these for cold season so I could pitch my tooth brush whenever I needed to so I wasn&#x27;t constantly reinfecting myself. I woke up today with a sore throat so I threw that toothbrush away (I think I have been using it for a month).&lt;br /&gt;I have a handful in my emergency kit and another handful in my toiletry bag. I&#x27;ll never forget my toothbrush again.&lt;br /&gt;I also plan to use these to creating care packages for people spending the night at the hospital with sick loved ones.</li>
            <li> Great bulk item.  Sent to a facility.  I couldn&#x27;t find toothbrushes for a better price.</li>
            <li> Purchased for filling Operation Christmas Child Boxes.  OK but didn&#x27;t realize that they only had half as many bristles as regular tooth brushes.  They will still work for our needs.</li>
            <li> My kids go through toothbrushes like most people do water lol. I got tired of spending big bucks on fancy brushes, and decided to give these a try.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the brushes. They will provide about a week of good, sturdy oral care and can be carried easily in hand bags, overnight bags, glove boxes or just about any travel bag. They are perfect for overnight guests also! I will never buy another store brand brush again...these are just as good as the high dollar brushes.</li>
            <li> We use these brushes to clean molds, they work like a charm, we needed to buy bulk and these were the best value. It wasa bonus for us that they work so well in the application that we use them in.</li>
            <li> Many of the bristles come out during brushing, making for an unpleasant and annoying experience for those on the go.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as you would expect, individually wrapped, great for the use I needed them for a homeless shelter donation.</li>
            <li> Got to brush, we filled many bags to give before winter hit</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for giving out to the homeless. Recommend to all. I hope to be ordering every year.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap and they feel like it.  These brushes shed bristles like crazy and no one likes picking bristles out of their mouth.</li>
            <li> using these to make &amp;#34;bristlebots&amp;#34; perfect choice.</li>
            <li> well done,at the right price.</li>
            <li> BEST: Great for guest one-time-use tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Each brush is individually wrapped in easy-to-open plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are REALLY soft ... good for a baby or delicate gums.&lt;br /&gt;Head is small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD: There is NO weird smell  to the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MEH: If you brush hard these WILL bend; Handle is UNCOMFORTABLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMUSING: If you try to walk around the house with the toothbrush in your mouth (Come on, you KNOW you do)&lt;br /&gt;saliva will travel down the ridge on top of the handle and drip off the end.&lt;br /&gt;LOL Seriously, all my OTHER toothbrushes I&#x27;ve EVER had were &#x27;mobile-friendly&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD: These are not sturdy enough to use for more-than-once cleaning of ANYTHING other than baby teeth and fine jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORST: Since they are NOT reusable, they are not environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> We are using these to run fungal cultures on cats, so the fact they are individually sealed is a great benefit.</li>
            <li> I bought these because my son kept getting strep throat and I wanted to throw them away to keep him from getting reinfected.  I was not expecting such nice quality.  The bristles are soft and do a great job.  I am a fanatic about brushing myself and now I keep some in my car so I can brush on the go whenever I need to.</li>
            <li> Great for grandchildren who forget there toothbrush.  They are all wrapped individually.  Good for two brushings (night &amp; morning)  then in the trash they go.  I love.</li>
            <li> We bought these to donate to the local shelter and did not expect them to last long, BUT they are pretty good. The white, plastic handles are not as strong as the $2 each models but hold up with repeated use. The bristles are good and have lasted all week so far.  The price is great. We ordered 3 more cases for the shelter, and we&#x27;ll use them for travel ourselves.</li>
            <li> These are a little better than I expected.  The brush heads are good, basic toothbrushes.  The cheap part is all in the handle which is short and thin.  But for the price, I have a long term supply of perfectly functional toothbrushes for a small price.</li>
            <li> I bought a 144 pack of these for when friends sleep over and don&#x27;t bring their own toothbrush. While I don&#x27;t recommend replacing your normal toothbrush with one of these, they work great for being a cheap, disposable toothbrush. My friends gladly use these over other alternatives such as your finger or skipping altogether.</li>
            <li> I just love that these toothbrushes are disposable, yet of good quality. It is a must have in our house during strep season...and at a price that makes changing toothbrushes every 48 hours a good thing!!</li>
            <li> I keep them in a drawer in the bathroom. When some one comes for the weekend and forgets their tooth brush, it beats running out for a new one. these can be used and tossed when they leave.</li>
            <li> I almost only gave 3 stars, but then again realistically what can someone really expect when buying 144 individually wrapped toothbrushes for about 12 dollars. For the price and the order these are fairly decent. Great for bulk care package or hygiene packs.</li>
            <li> Cheap and not worth the money.  I bought these to make blessing bags but I&#x27;m embarrassed about it.  These are horrible.  Very few bristles in them.  I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> I had to throw away all but two of these brushes.  As soon as you start brushing the bristles start falling off into your mouth.  I was afraid my son would get choked and we would not be able to get the bristles out of his throat.  I gagged when I used one due to the bristles falling out.&lt;br /&gt;I would not advise anyone to buy these brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my children lose, drop, travel with and forget toothbrushes all the time!!  They walk around with toothbrush in their mouth &amp; leave it places when they&#x27;re rushing around.  So, this is great.  I found myself buying new toothbrushes every week!!, &amp; now I&#x27;m happily not.  Saving $$ too.  Great for sleepovers too.</li>
            <li> Ordered these to put in sacks for the homeless, good sturdy toothbrushes. No issues.</li>
            <li> I received my package just as advertised . thank you so much .i will use these for backup toothbrush and for cleaning my glock. perrrrfect I will order from these fokes again</li>
            <li> I am using these for cleaning!  They are reasonably priced and are even individually wrapped. They are pretty firm, which is great for cleaning, maybe not so great for toothbrushing.  I clean edges of things, jewelry.. anything you need to get &amp;#34;inbetween&amp;#34; with.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how many disposable toothbrushes arrived at such a low price. It&#x27;s great to have around when my niece and nephew spend the night and have forgotten their toothbrushes at home.  It&#x27;s also great to keep in a container for the occasional house guests.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush were cheap and the bristles kept coming out when I brushed my teeth</li>
            <li> No gun cleaning kit should be without this box of brushes.  Grab a clean brush,  Use it..  Toss it.  Repeat.</li>
            <li> I got these for cleaning (not my teeth but around the house).  The Toothbrush it about the best thing for cleaning my bike (the gears and chain) and for cleaning other items that need a bristle to clean (concrete, tough stains,...).  However, toothbrushes in the stores are so expensive that you cannot really consider buying them for cleaning these types of items.  I found these and gave these a chance!  These are great!  They are basic toothbrushes with standard bristles and a plastic handle.  They are just a basic toothbrush for pennies.  This is exactly what I wanted.  When cleaning my bike I can scrub the gears and chain and just throw it away and not bother trying to clean and reuse a greasy brush again later.  Each of the brushes are individually wrapped (not bad if you needed some throw-aways on a trip or to keep in the glove box for meetings).  The package I received was  a box filled with boxes filled with individually wrapped toothbrushes (so many toothbrushes!).  I did not count them but 144 looks right.  Plus since they are like 20 something in each small box you can put a box in the shed and have it for yard work and keep a box in the house for household cleaning.  This is just convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a basic brush for all sorts of use that are super cheap and can just be thrown away after use (whether cleaning your teeth or cleaning anything) than these are a great buy and work perfectly!  I am very happy with these and when I am out (will probably be a while), I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> We have had a recurring case of strep in our house, with one active infection and two carriers. My doctor recommended we replace our toothbrush, but I was worried about what day in the cycle we should replace and even more, whether the strep would be gone with a single round of antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for the whole family to use for two weeks while we are on antibiotics and being retested. Our ENT thought it was a great idea. These are cheap toothbrushes, but totally serviceable for what they are: Disposable. Great price too. I would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> cheap toothbrushes, but they are meant to be since they are disposable, came in handy when I had guests sleep over which is what I ordered them for, can get a couple uses out of them...depending on how hard you brush, also good for odd jobs that require small brushes such as cleaning</li>
            <li> I ordered these and we are sending to the soldiers for Christmas along with some other items  hope they are good</li>
            <li> Came really fast, I use it to clean my guns, perfect!!</li>
            <li> I got these brushes to donate to various dental health causes (like a project in Nicaragua).  Tried one myself.  Works fine, nice soft bristles.  Handle could be a bit sturdier, but then that would make them cost more...</li>
            <li> I bought this for the local Humane society as it was what they put on their wish list.  I am guessing they like it.</li>
            <li> Really nice for one the go i use them for work alot of the other types are over priced and you cannot reach your whole mouth with some of them</li>
            <li> Perfectly serviceable toothbrushes for a weekend getaway or camping trip. Much easier to just bring these and throw them away when we leave than to pack everyone&#x27;s electric toothbrushes. Incredible number of them for the price, and all individually wrapped. Very nice!</li>
            <li> Nice item and Good Quality . I recommend it</li>
            <li> Well packaged, sterile, and sturdy. Bristles are pretty hard/sharp if you brush too hard it might damage your gums, but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I bought these toothbrushes to use in a tinkering and craft project. The brushes were perfect for this use! But I won&#x27;t recommend for dental use.</li>
            <li> We use these for cleaning firearms and other things around the house.  Pretty flimsy handles but very functional for what we use them for.</li>
            <li> I have a hangup about using the same toothbrush for more than a day.  I feel so disgusting about using an already-used toothbrush that I would literally go weeks without brushing my teeth cause I just couldn&#x27;t get past it.  Finally, my boyfriend and I came up with the idea of buying a box of cheap disposable toothbrushes so that I wouldn&#x27;t feel such aversion to brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is, it works.  I don&#x27;t expect these toothbrushes to be great - they have less bristles than a normal brush, but hey, they are disposable and they work great for one or two uses.  They aren&#x27;t hard either - they are more like medium to medium/soft.  They do the trick.  I&#x27;m happy and my boyfriend is happy too.</li>
            <li> The ad describes these as having soft bristles with polished tips.  I realize that terms like \\&quot;soft\\&quot; and \\&quot;hard\\&quot; are relative and subjective, but I would not call these toothbrushes soft.  They are medium-hard.  Soft toothbrushes are good for cleaning teeth without damaging the enamel, and massaging and cleaning the gums; hard brushes like these probably won&#x27;t hurt you if you use them occasionally, but could be damaging, I think, if used every day.</li>
            <li> We use these in the restrooms at work.  The staff LOVES them.  They do the job ... and are quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> The product description was exactly what we received. They are just what we wanted. A good product for a very fair price</li>
            <li> Prompt service. Delighted that the toothbrushes are individually wrapped! Will be giving then away once school starts.</li>
            <li> They really only last a few uses before their bristles start bending or falling out. I guess they work okay if you have a one-night guest at your house or something and they forgot their toothbrush. I won&#x27;t be getting them again, though.</li>
            <li> I found the product misleading. The brushes are called SparkleFresh which made me think they are ready to use portable toothbrushes with toothpaste. My mistake, I suppose, but would not order again. Only purchase I have not liked from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m passing these out on Halloween this year. Preventing cavities and diabetes one house at a time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty though. It will be a reminder for children to brush after eating that candy. When they&#x27;re sorting through all of it at the end of the night, they&#x27;ll find it in their bucket. Chances are, most will be thrown away, but buying this box of 144 toothbrushes for less than $12 is a lot cheaper than the candy that I normally buy and that I&#x27;m tempted, and often do, eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any leftover will be used for cleaning, perhaps brushing my dogs&#x27; teeth, packing for vacation, keeping in my purse for the times that I need to brush while I&#x27;m not home, leaving in the guest bathroom, and so many more.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes themselves were individually wrapped, but they did not come in any container or case so I have to find my own storage solution for the closet.  They came directly inside the main packaging.  I guess it&#x27;s more eco-friendly that way so I am still giving 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I don&#x27;t like about these is that they are rather hard.  They hurt my gums a little when I tried one out so you have to be gentle when brushing.  I bought these for guests so I didn&#x27;t expect great quality, especially for the price, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of if you&#x27;re looking for a nice soft toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was buying like 50 for 20 bucks to use as disposable toothbrushes in my dog grooming business. These were like 1000 for like ten bucks it was really cheap but they are perfect! I would use them as a human! They are a little smaller than a full size toothbrush but perfect for dogs. Great for disposable purposes.</li>
            <li> I teach early childhood and we do a few projects to highlight National Dental Health Care Month.  These were the perfect price and size to give out to the children when they make their own tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I bought these because an old friend of mine was completely paranoid about using the same toothbrush twice! I&#x27;m not as strict as her but I love using a fresh toothbrush every other day! You get long use out of the whole box!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for...these are pretty flimsy...hoping to get a good deal for the Christmas Shoe Boxes our church fills.</li>
            <li> The best.. Im not sure how many years will go by, before I exhaust this pack. each brush is indvidually wrapped and that&#x27;s exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Got these for my elderly parent,mahonia struggling with thrush.  This item has been a godsend!  I don&#x27;t feel badly about tossing it and so far so good for us!  -a</li>
            <li> I purchased these for cleaning small parts, and to use when travelling.  For both purposes I think the brushes and handle are too soft.  The handle bends when you try to apply force.  It results in mediocre tooth brushing and poor parts cleaning.  For travelling the one advantage is you don&#x27;t have to worry about repacking or replacing it.</li>
            <li> I use these to clean my guns and little intricate devices and as many as come in a pack I can just toss them when im done.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done but tge fibers fall out. This is a very disposible toothbrush as in it will not last more than 1 wk if you brush your teeth was recommended.</li>
            <li> best thing for traveling and overnight guest and/or for those who forget their toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I gave these out instead of Candy for Halloween. All the parents loved it. I am not in the dental industry, but kids get sooo much candy - I found these to be a great alternative.  They are good toothbrushes too</li>
            <li> Many years ago while on active duty I bought a box of 100 or so disposable toothbrushes similar to these for cleaning guns.  I cannot remember where I got them or how much I paid, however, after I ran out I resorted to the Dollar Tree and getting maybe ten for a buck.  I kept searching for &amp;#34;gun cleaning brushes” and found nothing--then it occurred to me to search for toothbrushes instead.  Found them earlier this week, just arrived today.  I recommend stocking up now because just like everything else in this world the prices will do nothing but climb.  (I actually ordered batteries and needed something to take me over the $35 free shipping threshold and picked these.)  Remember, these are DISPOSABLE and meant to be used once.  The brushes are just the right size and flexible for cleaning all your guns.  I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> We were running a donation drive and needed toothbrushes.  These fit the bill perfectly. Would I use these everyday, no. But for the purpose of a one time use its a great value and I love that they came individually packed.</li>
            <li> Super cheaply made.  The bristles are like Barbie hair material....not like standard toothbrush bristles.  One use only, clearly.</li>
            <li> I give these toothbrushes to the incoming veterans at the VA Hospital. Many come without anything to the emergency ward. These brushes fill an important need for an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived on time in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> No germs by using same toothbrush everyday!</li>
            <li> Priced well, shipped quickly. Again great product for donation to missions and other projects that I am involved in. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Worth the money for the guests who come to your house with out a tooth brush.  You don&#x27;t have to end up paying three or four dollars on a tooth brush for guests who use it once or twice.  These brushes are all individually packed and a great back up for anyone.</li>
            <li> Great cost effect option for the kids need constant replacements</li>
            <li> good for having guests staying the night</li>
            <li> cheep but ok for the cleaning packs. for 144 teeth brushes its ok, really cheep though</li>
            <li> It is a usable good quality for the price.  Individual packaging keeps it clean.  The handle is strong enough to finish the job but don&#x27;t compare this to regular toothbrush.  The brush is soft.  It can be used as a cleaning tool for small area at home.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what we use them for. They are a little small and the handle is not that sturdy but when guests come to the vacation home and forget their toothbrush, they are perfect! Price is amazing.</li>
            <li> Very good for deep cleaning around the house, tons of those little cheap toothbrushes so you can dispose of one as it gets filthy and grimey. Very good for around the house.</li>
            <li> I use these for glue brushes in my shop. They do a good job of getting the glue in the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a dirty santa/white elephant gift.  Should be funny.</li>
            <li> 6 children who lose their toothbrushes frequently... this works to solve that problem!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my guest rental - they&#x27;re certainly not a high quality tooth brush, but they&#x27;re individually wrapped for sanitation and the case price cannot be beat...even if my guests forget theirs and only use each one a single time. At this price (and the fact that they&#x27;re all wrapped), it&#x27;s easy to toss one into each of your suitcases, purse, office desk drawer, glove box of your car...pretty much anywhere you might find yourself wishing you could brush your teeth and not feel bad about disposing it after a couple of uses because they&#x27;re so very inexpensive!</li>
            <li> These work great for the price on the dogs I groom. I even give the same toothbrush I use to the owner so they are encouraged to brush their dog at home too.</li>
            <li> Came FAST and just what I was hoping for!!  Worth the money.  They last for quite a while if you&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t want to dispose them after one use.</li>
            <li> Bought these to throw in my suitcase as a disposable toothbrush.  I hate traveling with my primary toothbrush.  Well it&#x27;s nice they are individual wrapped, and it&#x27;s a good price.  The major issue is the bristles come off while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth and you start spitting out bristles and sometimes they poke your gums and make them bleed!!! Be careful and brush very softly. Don&#x27;t expect more than 1 time use for each brush. They&#x27;re cheap enough you can do that.</li>
            <li> These are good for cleaning, but the bristles fall out while brushing and sometimes get stuck in your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work really well for detail work though, and are nice to keep in an emergency kit.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last a long time, but then I can spend an awful lot more on a toothbrush and it won&#x27;t last long either.</li>
            <li> These clean my teeth much better than drug store toothbrushes. I was given one in the hospital and had to find them. They don&#x27;t get in behind that last molar as well but that just take a bit of extra work. My teeth feel almost polished after brushing.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute worst toothbrushes of all time. My wife and I forgot our toothbrushes when we packed for our trip, and the hotel gave us these… /things/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as it entered my mouth, the bristles started falling out. I got one stuck in my throat and I almost vomited into the sink. I spent the next five minutes rinsing nylon out of my mouth. Even if they weren&#x27;t falling out, they&#x27;re so soft, it would be impossible to clean anything off your teeth with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THESE THINGS.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I need. A large quantity of product for not very much.</li>
            <li> Good for to go tooth brush!!! The brush isn&#x27;t soft at all but it is disposable so I won&#x27;t worry much.</li>
            <li> I am a return customer, these are great, we make hygiene bags for the homeless and everyone gets one of these.</li>
            <li> Great deal, we&#x27;re great for what I needed will prolly buy again next year for the same use .highly recommended</li>
            <li> Perfect, perfect, perfect. Know how you want to brush after lunch at work, but it&#x27;s skeevy to have a damp toothbrush living in your desk? Or how you friends kids come over with no toothbrush? Or how you have to replace toothbrushes after everyone gets the flu?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem solved.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as scripted and such a great price!</li>
            <li> Ordered these for our camper, work great and don&#x27;t have to worry about packing a toothbrush or forgetting it at the camper. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love that I got 144 toothbrushes for less than $12!  Bristles are a little rigid for everyday use, but wonderful for overnight guests who forget their toiletries and when you need a backup in your purse.  The 144 brushes are broken down into boxes of 24.  I put a box in my desk at work, gave a box to my sister for her overnight forgetful guests, and gave a box to my parents for the guest bathroom.  I still have plenty left for my overnight guests and for any other reason!</li>
            <li> Nice having a new toothbrush every couple of days instead of having to clean the more expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;I recycle these too. Bristles aren&#x27;t as secure as I&#x27;d like but what the hll.</li>
            <li> These were just what we needed to send to Honduras with the missions group.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other disposable tooth brushes, this one is made from &#x27;just the right amount&#x27; of plastic so as to minimize any guilt feelings about using a disposable. It has just the right amount of handle structure to make it useful, but the handle is also &#x27;hollowed-out&#x27; (if you can call it that), and not completely filled with a large amount of bulky plastic like a more popular disposable brand. Note: I thought that for one of the brushes, it left a slightly &#x27;off&#x27; taste in my mouth after use, but that might have just been my mouth&#x27;s &#x27;body-chemistry&#x27; that day.</li>
            <li> One of the most useful tools in my business is the toothbrush. I use them constantly for cleaning a wide assortment of things. These toothbrushes are serving this purpose just fine. Thanks</li>
            <li> perfect for what we needed them for</li>
            <li> Soooo convenient with teenagers on the go and guests appreciate these in guest room. I also take some to work.</li>
            <li> These are not designed for heavy extensive use each, but each brush can work effectively for at least a couple of days, and for the price I think they are a pretty good value for using any time and all the time.</li>
            <li> We use these to brush dog teeth at grooming shop.  Nothing fancy, very basoc. Would be great for cleaning, don&#x27;t expect much if you are planning to actually brush human teeth.</li>
            <li> No. I requested the pre-pasted.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic idea.  I have overnight guests who forget their toothbrush and some who stay unexpectedly.  These are fantastic</li>
            <li> The &#x27;3o Tuft&#x27; and &#x27;Case Pack 144&#x27; was a little confusing to us in the ad title but we ordered it anyway because of the positive customer reviews we read. The order indeed contained 144 individually wrapped brushes. We have already used a couple of them and they are really as good as advertised. We put a few in the glove compartment for use when we&#x27;re out for a while, especially on long car trips. They also come in handy for miscellaneous uses around the house like brushing out hair and &#x27;gunk&#x27; from our combs, scrubbing around the base of bathroom faucets, etc. A great buy!</li>
            <li> good product for the price</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! These are meant for single or (maybe) two times use. They were VERY WELL packaged, each in its own clear and sanitary pack. They did exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Quality is good for the price. I bought these for humanitarian use in disaster areas. These are NOT intended to provide years of service. Strictly a guess is that you can expect 6-12 months use from these at best. In other words, if you are buying these for personal use, this will be the last box of toothbrushes you&#x27;ll have to buy in your lifetime.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly as described.  The brush is medium-soft to soft which is perfect for my purpose.  I like to massage my gums and give my teeth a light brush while watching TV after my evening meal.  I gave this brush 4 stars instead of 5 because the handle bends slightly during use.  The handle could be stiffer.  I would buy again and recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> These are disposable toothbrushes that I use for cleaning. They were what I expected, though I would prefer that they have stiffer bristles. Since they are not specifically cleaning brushes I gave them a star more than I would have. For disposable toothbrushes I&#x27;d give the same rating. They&#x27;d do the job, the price is right, but I&#x27;d comparison shop and go with best price again next time.</li>
            <li> Preferred the other ones I ordered</li>
            <li> I needed a large volume of toothbrushes and this fit the bill. They are very basic toothbrushes, but fit the bill when you need a bunch there is a chance they may become disposable, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My cousin helps run a charity in her hometown where she fills donated backpacks with all of these donated items and they are then distributed to the homeless in her area. She does teen bags as well as adult bags, but they all need toothbrushes. As she was once homeless herself, so I think she has a better understanding of how much those basic necessities that most of us take for granted truly mean. I love her and her huge heart and help out with my own donations when I am able. This was a gross of disposable toothbrushes, a dozen dozen, 144. Consider donating to your own local shelters, I am sure they would appreciate them!</li>
            <li> For the price the quality is great and customer service was awesome!</li>
            <li> Great product for donation and much better quality than expected for this price, these are on my list to buy again, a big plus is that they are wrapped single and are sanitary, also good if you want to change your toothbrush often.</li>
            <li> We travel a lot and I hate packing and unpacking a wet toothbrush every day.  This solves the problem.  I use it and then toss it.  Also nice to have if someone in the family has a cold.</li>
            <li> Used these in Christmas homeless care packages. These worked great because I can add 4 or 5 to each bag. Great for families.</li>
            <li> These work for what we need them for and that is simply disposable toothbrushes, not very sturdy and will only last a time or two- have had a few that the bristles come out in your teeth when your brushing, but again, what we need them for which is basically a quick brush and throw away after one use when my kids have friends spend the night they work great- they are not for long use at all.</li>
            <li> These are decent toothbrushes, if a little softer than I like. They are NOT biodegradable, just be aware, they are made of plastic. But they&#x27;re not a brush you&#x27;ll keep for six months, the handle is a little too flexible, and I don&#x27;t know how long those bristles will last. If you&#x27;re travelling and don&#x27;t want to pack an expensive electric toothbrush, and, like me, hate those stubby little &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; toothbrushes (it always pops free of the cover/handle thing in the middle of brushing), this brush will serve you nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it isn&#x27;t 5 stars is because it&#x27;s like SUPER soft. The purchase page does say &amp;#34;soft bristles&amp;#34;, but this is so soft it makes me insecure that they&#x27;re cleaning well.  But they seemed to work well enough, and was comfortable on the gums. If you prefer a soft brush, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> Perfect for our needs.</li>
