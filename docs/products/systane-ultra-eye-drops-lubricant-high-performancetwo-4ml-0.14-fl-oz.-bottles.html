            <li>Love these eye drops for use during the day.</li>
            <li>5 stars for the eye drops themselves, I love Systane but 3 stars for the amount of product.</li>
            <li>Beware a lot of good deals on this kind of stuff are not such good deals.&lt;br /&gt;Frank</li>
            <li>Better to choose the 3x10 Ml one more easy to use and save......</li>
            <li>These feel pretty good.</li>
            <li>Is it me or does it seem like these bottles aren&#x27;t very full?</li>
            <li>So far, I think it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>Nice travel size and the product works great for keep dry eyes lubricated.</li>
            <li>Just had double cataract surgery and these are great drops to lubricate the eyes.</li>
            <li>He gives me a pocket full FREE each time I see him.</li>
            <li>but the product is nothing special for the price.  </li>
            <li>Best thick eye drops that i have found.</li>
            <li>Good product for dry eyes!</li>
            <li>but it would be nice if the bottle was smaller</li>
            <li>But other than that,it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Very good relief for dry eyes, can be used several times a day.  </li>
            <li>The eye doctor said this would be better then the Visine I bought for my mild case of dry eye.  </li>
            <li>To even better relieve my condition, I take vitamin E, fish oil and flax seed oil daily.</li>
            <li>I liked the price, but when I received the order and checked the expiration date on the product it was due to expire in about one month.</li>
            <li>but why make the bottle so large?</li>
            <li>and I remember when I went to my eye doctor I got a bottle even smaller (only one) and it was way more $$.  </li>
            <li>When I first put it in my eyes during the day I got instant relief.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m paying full price for half the product.</li>
            <li>Wake up to itchy and dry eyes and after putting a couple of drops in to both eyes my eyes were quickly back to normal without any problems for the rest of that day.</li>

            <li> but I wanted to comment as I noticed the negative reviews about being a small bottle for the price</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only drops that gives my eyes moisture and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> I had PRK over a year ago and still get dryness. These feel pretty good. Only complaint is the price for such a small bottle. It&#x27;s ridiculous. But other than that,it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Best thick eye drops that i have found.</li>
            <li> First rate product, excellent price</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li> I liked the price, but when I received the order and checked the expiration date on the product it was due to expire in about one month. Beware a lot of good deals on this kind of stuff are not such good deals.&lt;br /&gt;Frank</li>
            <li> but I wanted to comment as I noticed the negative reviews about being a small bottle for the price and I remember when I went to my eye doctor I got a bottle even smaller (only one) and it was way more $$.  I will update this once I&#x27;ve used them.  So far, I think it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> works well but it stings my eyes a bit, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> It is hard to squeeze and drop ...... Better to choose the 3x10 Ml one more easy to use and save......</li>
            <li> after using these for a few days my dry eyes went away!</li>
            <li> Love these eye drops for use during the day. I have extremely dry eyes. I use these in conjunction with Refresh Liquigel Lubricant Eye Drops, which I use before I go to bed. To even better relieve my condition, I take vitamin E, fish oil and flax seed oil daily.</li>
            <li> It is as described.  Recommended by my eye Dr.</li>
            <li> Nice travel size and the product works great for keep dry eyes lubricated.</li>
            <li> Good product for dry eyes!</li>
            <li> Eyes worked great. Wake up to itchy and dry eyes and after putting a couple of drops in to both eyes my eyes were quickly back to normal without any problems for the rest of that day. Excelleny product, will buy again</li>
            <li> Very good relief for dry eyes, can be used several times a day.  Recommended by my eye doctor.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the eye drops themselves, I love Systane but 3 stars for the amount of product. Is it me or does it seem like these bottles aren&#x27;t very full? The bottle says 4 mL (.14 FL OZ) which maybe it truly is that amount inside but why make the bottle so large? It seriously looks like it&#x27;s only half full. I&#x27;m not going to squeeze all of it out to measure but it would be nice if the bottle was smaller so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m paying full price for half the product.</li>
            <li> The eye doctor said this would be better then the Visine I bought for my mild case of dry eye.  When I first put it in my eyes during the day I got instant relief.  However at night it didn&#x27;t help at all.  I had to get up in the middle of the night and use the Visine so I could get some comfort for the rest of the night.  So this was just another waste of money for me.  I like the spout but the product is nothing special for the price.  The bottles are also very small like travel or trial sizes.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Ophthalmologist. He gives me a pocket full FREE each time I see him.</li>
            <li> Just had double cataract surgery and these are great drops to lubricate the eyes.</li>
            <li> Love these eye drops, but shipping is outrageous for this product. Will probably buy at a local retailer next time.</li>
