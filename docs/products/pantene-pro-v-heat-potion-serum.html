            <li> My hair is like a sponge with smoothing serums, and usually remains frizzy, but with this product applied to the top back layer and the ends, it actually produces smoothed curls! So excited!</li>
            <li> Love it! Just a drop shines and silkens my short hair. I screw off the top to get my one drop. It should last a long time.</li>
            <li> This works great for hair that Is thick.I use it on my hair after I flat iron it. It efficiently adds shine and keeps my hair from poofing and frizzing under windy or humid conditions. Though I have alot of hair I do not need to use a lot of this product. Just a couple pumps per section (4sections) works well. Its cheap but works like it cost 20$. Lol</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum. I&#x27;m about a year and half into my transitioning(I have 3c/4a hair) and this is a great product that I use at the end of my twist out/braid out regimens as well as when I pull them apart. It&#x27;s not heavy at all and adds a great shine. Not to mention I love the smell! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Changes my dull hair to shiny hair with just a few squirts!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even with coupon.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I use it both on wet and dry hair and it goes help control frizz.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it and was pleased with the results. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells soooo good, I love using it!  I have curly hair so my hair just drinks in moisture!</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair when its wet, and by the time it dries, it looks so soft, shiny, and healthy. Really my favorite hair product. I get comments on how healthy my hair looks every day.</li>
            <li> Too oily and not even spray more of a stream. Spray into palm and apply. Do not spray directly on hair.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It loved my hair.  Shine and more manageable.  I stocked up thinking I may run out!</li>
            <li> My neighbor uses this and it looks great but when I tried, since I do not have thick hair, it clumped by hair together in small strange masses, but my hair was shiny.</li>
            <li> It smells good if you put it in your hair. Its kind of greasy and seems to sit on top of your hair. Again the smell is great, but I&#x27;m not sure it does much of anything. I use it after straightening my African-American type 4a hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazingggg. My hair is color-treated hair and had been currently bleached. This serum makes my hair shinier but not seems oily, smoother and especially non-sticky.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product an I love it . I&#x27;m 100% natural an got my hair blown out an press. I&#x27;ve used this after an wrap my hair ps ... Just a little bit will do . It been day three an I use just alil in the morn an my hair is soft bouncing an behaving to be natural . I&#x27;m 100% African American an I use less oil in my hair an I love when the wind blow an my hair snaps back that healthy hair. Thank Pantene</li>
            <li> Better than the other products I have used.</li>
            <li> You get the shine but I wish It had more moisturizing properties</li>
            <li> Pantene is great. Love the fragrance of the oil. Just not a very big bottle.</li>
            <li> still in progress work moe</li>
            <li> To the point, after applying there was no shine. -  the atomizer squirts are extremely limited - I to take the entire cap off - pour it in the palm of my hand - apply -  and still there was no shine.  Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Having used the shampoo and conditioner from this line I decided to purchase this serum.The bottle doesn&#x27;t explicitly state its function but I was assuming it would add some shine to my hair and control frizz to  some extent it does neither.I gave it 1 star cus it smells good.If you&#x27;re looking for a good polish for relaxed African hair try Garnier Sleek and Shine.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff. It works well and I have very thick, corse hair.  It does not feel like an oil, but it does moisturize like an oil.  My only complaint is that it is expensive-  3.99 for this small bottle.  But when I look at what Oprah&#x27;s hairstylist is charging for his stuff, maybe it isn&#x27;t that expensive.  I would buy it again, but I think I am going to start searching for an alternative.</li>
            <li> I like how this product leave my hair every time i shower. Love the smell. the quality of the product was perfect, above my expectations. I used the Pantene Pro-V Smooth &amp; Shine Anti-Frizz Serum which was amazing i do not know why they stop doing this serum.</li>
            <li> This is the most yummy smelling oil I have ever smell. Love argan oil. It is so good for the hair. It is also good if you are ever too blow dry it.</li>
            <li> Did not work well for my hair in the summer!</li>
            <li> Just a bottle of silicone. Silicone can coat your hair and looks shining. Nothing more. Not good for long-term use.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is super cheap. I hate it.</li>
            <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> They had fast and prompt service and is exactly what they described!! Love their product, great quality and will buy again!!</li>
