            <li>These hair rollers work great!</li>
            <li>For myself, I think this product works perfect.</li>
            <li>It is great!  </li>
            <li>Makes the perfect curl/wave that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>so again, might not be the best for thicker hair.</li>
            <li>(It seems sleeping on sponge rollers is still the best solution for us.)</li>
            <li>I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>(an X-acto knife will fix the problem, but it&#x27;s best to avoid it).</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m very happy with these hair rollers.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this Remington product.  </li>

            <li>I bought these per the reviews that said how wonderful these rollers were.  </li>

            <li>I thought I had chosen the best set to achieve what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The Remington Heated clip hair set is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Saves a LOT of time and gives the perfect flowy curl</li>
            <li>And they make gorgeous curls!  </li>
            <li>I take everything off, I spray my hair and I have a head of beautiful bouncy</li>
            <li>The presentation of the rollers is attractive on a counter.</li>
            <li>The curlers are great.  </li>
            <li>I think the product is great.  </li>
            <li>A great product that will pay for itself in no time.  </li>
            <li>If anyone has some helpful info that could eliminate this problem, I would be happy to know.  </li>
            <li>Having the clips heated sounded like a great idea.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li>The thing I liked best was taking them out.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>The product is great but DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM DISCOUNT JUNGLE.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve found that the curler and heated clip has produced great curls</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a great deal when I paid $45 for these at a retail store.</li>
            <li>These curlers were great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably the best, in that it heats up very quickly, which is, after all, why I use this type of product.  </li>
            <li>(Incidentally, I think it&#x27;s great that this set has so many rollers!</li>
            <li>What good does having metal plates inside the clips do if they won&#x27;t even keep the rollers in place.  </li>
            <li>The had a really good grip and did not fall out like</li>
            <li>THIS WAS A GOOD PURCHASE.</li>
            <li>They are really good curlers.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good item for med-thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried and tried to establish a good grip and no matter what</li>
            <li>, the rollers hold the heat, they don&#x27;t burn your hair, and the curl lasts a good while.</li>
            <li>I feel that they are a good tool.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, great curls, lots of fun!</li>
            <li>I bought these rollers this morning and am very pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li>Okay, let me start off by saying, these are GREAT for girl time at home..</li>
            <li>Rather than investing their money in an attractive presentation, Remington should concentrate more on the practical application.</li>
            <li>What a great way to get a curly hairdo with no fuss and no expensive fees to pay a hairstylist!!!</li>
            <li>The heated clips make ALL the difference and the curl on my very straight hair with no perm was AWESOME and you need to GET SOME!!!   </li>
            <li>love EVERYTHING about this set!</li>
            <li>These hot rollers are not the best but not the worset.     </li>
            <li>Nano Silver then you know it would be my first choice as Nano Silver is THE best technology now</li>
            <li>ENJOY!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got them!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased!</li>
            <li>Use these quite often and LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>Works great and is so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li>One tip: I had some fly away hairs that I went over with my curling iron to smooth out.</li>
            <li>you are in the market for heated curlers, this product works great and is a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>but they do hold and produce nice results.</li>
            <li>I really liked this set.  </li>
            <li>nice for us tree-huggers.    </li>
            <li>Nice to know, also not in the booklet.    </li>
            <li>It is neat and tidy with the clips on each roller</li>
            <li>(kind of a mauve)</li>
            <li>Yes, I achieved some nice bounce and curls with this set.  </li>
            <li>curlers begin to warm via a metal rack in the case within a minute or so of turning it on.  </li>
            <li>Everything packs up nicely.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been so impressed with how quickly they heat up, and how quickly they curl your hair!</li>
            <li>The Remington H-2050 T-Studio Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers with Tourmaline provide beautiful curls that have staying power - used with the right hair products for your hair</li>
            <li>These curlers have been the best I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>even though they don&#x27;t seem to get too hot, they do a great job on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Well lo and behold, I had nice bouncy, full curls!</li>
            <li>in order not to burn kinks into your hair, you have to make sure to clip from the bottom of the roller and not the side or top, after you have gotten your hair rolled onto it.  </li>
            <li>That does not seem convenient to me nor healthy for my hair.      </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these heated hair rollers.</li>
            <li>I am more of an intuitive user than a manual reader, so I plugged the unit in and waited.</li>
            <li>The Remington H-2050 is just OK.  </li>
            <li>and they said I shouldn&#x27;t have the rollers plugged in for more than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I have not even come close to burning myself, and I absolutely love these rollers.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these rollers.</li>
            <li>this is a safe purchase.</li>
            <li>, I can attest to the fact that her curls look much better and are more durable when using these ceramic curlers (what the hell has marriage turned me into that</li>
            <li>and it did ok</li>
            <li>I LOVE this set</li>
            <li>This heated curler set is simple and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Her hair is more course and curly than mine, and she had lovely results.</li>
            <li>On my hair, I didn&#x27;t  notice any better results, just quicker results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think clips with teeth would be a lot better.</li>
            <li>But like every heated roller set I&#x27;ve ever owned, the top of head rollers just don&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li>I love the case it comes in, I love the clips they hold my hair well.</li>
            <li>By placing the clips on the rollers so the opening was upwards and the pinch part of the clip was downwards, I avoided the line that many others have mentioned the rollers leaving in their hair</li>
            <li>If you use them every day, make sure you have the counter space.</li>
            <li>so the roller clips may hold thinner hair better; although, that may be the ones that end up with the crease.</li>
            <li>Allowing in theory a faster curl, and potentially a better curl.    </li>
            <li>Slightly better than a gimmick, but still room for improvement and refinement.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to put life, bounce and curl into my hair.</li>
            <li>They worked ok...</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of it, I could just grab the clip and unroll my hair without actually touching the roller.</li>
            <li>Probably just to exchange them, unless I research and find a product that I want to try even more.    </li>
            <li>My hair looks so healthy and everyone notices.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking at Remington and Conair rollers for a while, and this model, as well as a similar model, seemed perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these rollers.</li>
            <li>I love the way they are stacked and the clips help keep everything neat and in place.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m OK with that.</li>
            <li>She lives in a different state, so I got a gift card from Amazon.com, which was the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>- The unit is very large and takes up a good part of a bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t produced a good photo of the clips for those of you interested in them, so I will describe one of the many flaws with this set of rollers.  </li>
            <li>love the clip, being a dual heating technique, it really heats the hair quickly and when you unroll...absolutely gorgeous!</li>
            <li>The clips are generally a good idea, and the rollers stay in pretty well--</li>
            <li>When I have time, I like to let the curlers cool in my hair, but even when I&#x27;ve had to take them out while still warm</li>
            <li>I have had many, many hot curlers over the years and was thrilled when I got a chance to review a set.  </li>
            <li>Takes up more counter space than I have available in the bathroom</li>
            <li>It takes up a bit more space than I have free.  </li>
            <li>Remington claims that with their &#x27;titanium tourmaline ionic conditioning&#x27; that it will seal your hair cuticle to repel humidity &amp; static for &#x27;incredible&#x27; lasting frizz free shine.  </li>
            <li>This results in curls \\&quot;setting up\\&quot; more quickly, because the heat is distributed more rapidly.  </li>
            <li>I love this item, very fast warm up, super easy to use, specially love the clip lock.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of a clip instead of the metal fasteners that most sets use, but they don&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li>The roller clips grip well, are easy to put in my hair and to take out.  </li>
            <li>The clips are easy to use.</li>
            <li>found the rollers easy to use, once I got the hang of putting them in without burning my fingers.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use, my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught or torn in them, and they leave my hair shiny and wavy.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;stadium seating&#x27; design makes it easy to remove or return rollers without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li>The clips are easy to use and don&#x27;t rip my hair.</li>
            <li>I FOUND THEM EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re so easy to use.</li>
            <li>you turn on the switch, the set heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use.</li>
            <li>but my hair curls easily.</li>
            <li>and I found it easy to wrap my hair around them.  </li>
            <li>I find them easy to loosen or fall out even if I am sitting still.</li>
            <li>The rollers are easy to use, and do not pull when you&#x27;re taking them out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, these rollers are really easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>In spite of using a strong hairspray, the curls didn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li>gave me wonderfully beautiful curls that lasted quite a bit longer than I could have possibly hoped for.  </li>
            <li>And the quantity is perfect for me, I don&#x27;t have much hair though, but if you would need more just do them by section, remember it only takes 5-10minutes to get curls.    </li>
            <li>I find that my curls hold beautifully after only 10 minutes and my hair looks shinier, and they last.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The curlers heat up quickly, and are easy to use (even for someone who doesn&#x27;t use curlers more than once a year).</li>
            <li>The curlers are soft, the clips attach directly to the curlers in the storage unit so you won&#x27;t lose them, but most importantly, my hair looked great!  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s something that I could manage to live with if I really loved this set.  </li>
            <li>You get smooth, beautiful, big and bouncy curls in FIVE minutes!</li>
            <li>They get hot fast and do make great curls.  </li>
            <li>(I have fine hair.)  </li>
            <li>The curlers stay in nicely and are pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li>This product worked just fine to curl my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and they seem to move around alot.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it was a bit of a challenge to curl the hair around my ears and forehead without feeling the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is that the base/case that the rollers are on IS kind of large.  </li>
            <li>There is a nice distribution of sizes, including large rollers, which some brands skimp on.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, but it did keep this from being a fie-star product.</li>
            <li>With these rollers my curl looked beautiful when I first took them out, and then it completely fell out within minutes.  </li>
            <li>I use the rollers along with a curling brush, to smooth out the crease in the front, which fixes the problem for me.  </li>
            <li>If you are a bit of a hair-challenged dork like me, stick with a cheap set.</li>
            <li>The smooth rollers are comfortable to grip w/o over heating your hair and fingers.  </li>
            <li>The rollers form a medium curl and the clip helps smooth out frizzies.  </li>
            <li>As much as I wanted to LOVE this set, the most important reason for using hair rollers is so that it will give your hair body...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine why in the world a company would design and manufacture hair clips that are SMOOTH?  </li>
            <li>but I simply can&#x27;t give this product a GREAT rating.    </li>
            <li>the clips don&#x27;t hold rollers securely to hair.  </li>
            <li>and they work fantastic with the existing Remington clips, or as a replacement.</li>
            <li>sure what would solve the problem is if the clips had some good sized teeth to grab the hair next to the scalp and hang</li>
            <li>Good head, like the soft surface but the clips leave ridges in your hair that you have to straighten out with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>The Remington T/Studio H2050 hot rollers are the best hair product I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time, if ever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before, but these are really easy to use!  </li>
            <li>First the good news: These rollers set your hair fast and they&#x27;re easy to use.    </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these rollers to family, friends and anyone looking for a timesaving, effective roller.</li>
            <li>And to be honest, if I have to work so hard to rig a way to prevent this from happening, I can&#x27;t in good conscience rate these rollers more than a 3.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about these when I bought them.  </li>
            <li>these are so fun to use!</li>
            <li>The curlers are a bit on the warm side when handling but other than that I am more than satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Since I was in the market to purchase some new hair styling products, I was thrilled when this was offered to me from the Vine program.    </li>
            <li>Even if you are a beginner, this product is quite fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Heat up real fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m heading back to the store to return this crappy set and get the kind with more of a claw clip....</li>
            <li>What I also love about them is the fact that they heat up quick, and really within minutes you have curls!</li>
            <li>IT IS RIGHT!</li>
            <li>believe these rollers are best suited for those w average-thickness hair, but not someone w thick</li>
            <li>I love the flocked roller, so much easier on my hair, they never pull.  </li>
            <li>I went straight home and watched a bunch of youtube videos to make sure I knew how to roll without looking like I was from the 50s.  </li>
            <li>I found these things to be true in my opinion:    1.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of things to prevent this, but simply haven&#x27;t found a good way to keep this from happening yet.  </li>
            <li>Within five minutes, they reach optimum temperature and achieve maximum effectiveness within ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you do have to make sure you got it just right first.</li>
            <li>These are easy for me to use and makes my hair soft and healthy looking again.</li>
            <li>Really looked forward to receiving these rollers, but they get TOO HOT!!!  </li>
            <li>The Remington H-2050 Heated Clip Hair Setter is one of THE BEST hair products I&#x27;ve gotten to try in the past five years!</li>
            <li>I use the smaller rollers on the top of my head and the larger ones on the bottom, it came out beautiful and full for my photo shoot.</li>
            <li>These are a great solution for a busy working mom, like me, who doesn&#x27;t have much time to get ready in the morning!</li>
            <li>I have not yet experienced the &#x27;bend&#x27; in your hair like some other reveiwers</li>
            <li>Also, I have thick, stick-straight, somewhat coarse hair, and the clips, while moderately effective, do not seem to want to stay on my hair because of the lack of \\&quot;teeth.\\&quot;  While the flocked rollers are nice and fairly grippy, the clips themselves are made of smooth metal and tend to slide off.  </li>
            <li>The curlers do heat up quite quickly, which I consider a plus.  </li>
            <li>The curlers heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Although the clips grip the hair well, they do leave dents, particularly on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>But overall, these work better than most.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly just as the description says.</li>
            <li>One of my 2 largest complaints about this product is the fact that since the clips get HOT, someone in the design department forgot to coat / layer the top of the clips with some sort of coating or substance that would not heat up as hot as the rollers.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and evenly</li>
            <li>I like the set up and quick heating and velvet covered rollers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The roller heat up quickly, a must for those of us who always seem to be rushed in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>The heat up time was quick.</li>
            <li>Conair SPC10R Super Clips]]  from Amazon</li>
            <li>I needed a quick solution for a gift for my sister-in-law and wanted it to arrive before Christmas.</li>
            <li>They were ready to use in under 2 minutes and after 10 minutes in my hair they left great curls.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve burned myself a jillion times from VERY HOT curling irons</li>
            <li>The good:  - Strong tight curls faster than any curlers I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li>They heat up very quickly and are ready to use in no time at all.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use and hold the heat very well.  </li>
            <li>While I have read some reviews that you can fix this with touching up with a straight iron I refuse to spend money on a hot roller set that does not allow me to fix my hair with speed.  </li>
            <li>Fast, easy, convenient.  </li>
            <li>The heat is perfect and I have long lasting curls.</li>
            <li>I had nice full, bouncy waves that lasted the entire day.</li>
            <li>I specifically bought rollers to add volume to my straight, somewhat fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very striaght hair that is fine but dense.  </li>
            <li>, I thought it must have been an error, but I did think that if something was posted as being available for a certain price on Amazon that they would be obliged to honor it.       </li>
            <li>The clips are smooth and I really need something with teeth to hang on.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing how the curl last without scorching your hair.  </li>
            <li>The clip on the curler in the unit makes it look neat and tidy, but it adds an extra step.  </li>
            <li>I used them once, and 3 people commented on how different and nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Okay, the truth is out: I&#x27;m an old school electric curler girl.  </li>
            <li>-- I had the soft wavy curls that I love.  </li>
            <li>three sets of electric rollers I have owned, these are by far the ones I like the most.</li>
            <li>Bulky and sometimes leaves a crimp line on your hair if you don&#x27;t position your curls right.</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>I also could not get the clips just right</li>
            <li>These clips store right on the the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then if you don&#x27;t have the clips sitting just right</li>
            <li>Also apparently they have to be very precisely placed on the rails.  </li>
            <li>here&#x27;s a concept for appliances that get hot: an automatic shutoff, would be a nice tweak to future editions of this product.    </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get too hot, but still warm enough.</li>
            <li>I will try another kind, this is my first experience with hot rollers, and for now I&#x27;m back to my trusty revlon ceramic heat curling iron I&#x27;ve used for 12 yrs!!</li>
            <li>and I want to have a really nice style, it doesn&#x27;t take long at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The large covered case with clear lid is appealing and sturdy.</li>
            <li>and I had to buy clips to hold the roller in and the case is too large to store!</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that I used them a few times so that I had a bit more experience with them before writing a review.  </li>
            <li>And they only take 90 seconds to heat up, which is really good on those busy weekday mornings.  </li>
            <li>The set heats up quickly and curls hair fast</li>
            <li>the good side, my hair seemed silkier and way less &#x27;fried&#x27; using these.</li>
            <li>However, because of the \\&quot;melting\\&quot; that I experienced initially, I will take back the set.  </li>
            <li>Very fast and no</li>
            <li>And the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since using the set, I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments and I really couldn&#x27;t be happier!  </li>
            <li>It also has the same flaw that most electric rollers have, which no fool proof way of fastening them so that they stay in the hair.  </li>
            <li>I do not find the clips too hot to handle at all</li>
            <li>They can be *really* hot plastic.  </li>
            <li>The cons stated the rollers and clips were too hot, and would burn their fingers/hands.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought the clips felt hot but its managable.</li>
            <li>I think its a very well-made and fun set, and I would highy recommend it.</li>
            <li>Her results were noticeably better with this set than with my standard hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are more than enough rollers for my hair</li>
            <li>The ends are so hot, I got blisters on my 1st use.</li>
            <li>but sheesh, you figure when the rollers are IN your hair, you shouldn&#x27;t have to tilt your head from side to side because the HOT clips are burning the tips of your ears, your cheekbone, your cheek, etc.  </li>
            <li>There are absolutely no teeth, no spikes, no rubber (not that I&#x27;d want warm or hot &#x27;rubber&#x27; on my hair) at all to HOLD ONTO or grip your hair.  </li>
            <li>(Remington: perhaps you would design some different clips for those of us who would love to have an option for clips that grip your hair?)  </li>
            <li>so if you think you&#x27;d be able to manage or tolerate the clips and you only want waves (not curls) in your hair, then you may like this set a lot.  </li>
            <li>I had decided to stop using hot curlers as it was damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>I grabbed the first roller-which you pick up by the clasp which holds it in place-and my fingers began to burn...</li>
            <li>They can withstand hot roller heat, but you can&#x27;t heat them up in the unit as you would the Remington Clips.  </li>
            <li>Some people are complaining that they are too hot, but I find that picking them up by the clip, or handling the velour part of the roll is not a problem.</li>
            <li>As far as the crimping at the hairline goes, I did not have that problem (maybe it depends on the type of hair of you have), but it seems that a significant amount of others have had it...</li>
            <li>Unlike some other brands, EACH hair roller came with it&#x27;s own clip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several similar products in the past and this curler set is easily the best.  </li>
            <li>I tried using wire prong fasteners from an older set of hot rollers, but the sizes weren&#x27;t right and the rollers just fell out.  </li>
            <li>If you take your hair seriously, and already do well with rollers, these are GREAT.</li>
            <li>If you leave the rollers in for maybe a half hour at most, you get a nice curl that holds for the entire day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really work, and I agree with most reviewers it does leave a mark on your hair, no big deal</li>
            <li>Overall, these rollers are convenient, fast, and I LOVE the way they sit in the case.</li>
            <li>The Large and the Extra Large rollers are most beneficial to me because of the length of my hair.  </li>
            <li>They get hot fast.  </li>
            <li>so I would recommend that you do not leave it unattended for a long time while pre-heating to be safe.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t do that with this one and have everything LOOK organized as much as nothing will lay flat on the top cover because it&#x27;s slanted.    </li>
            <li>course, a lot depends on your hair type, so if you have long, fine hair you probably want to heat up the curlers for 10 minutes or so and leave them in for a good half hour or more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy these again; the only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c they cost more than I originally wanted to spend.</li>
            <li>except to say that I personally have had smooth curls or waves when I first release my hair from the rollers.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;The curlers are easy to handle because the parts that heat up are not on the outside, but are on the interior of the clip and on the slots along the side of the curlers.  </li>
            <li>but the set I got had all Jumbo and Large</li>
            <li>The rollers are large and medium.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;The case itself is large, with a translucent plastic hinged lid that has no latch.</li>
            <li>The unit is all pro, and quite large, which means it will delight any woman who is a salon-owner-wanna-be.</li>
            <li>The unit itself does have a large footprint on your vanity/counter</li>
            <li>but I like the fact that two-thirds of the rollers are large.</li>
            <li>What happens is that when you remove the rollers from your head, you have a large crease where the roller was hanging from your head.  </li>
            <li>The good, the bad, the beautiful: Let me start by saying I keep trying to use hot rollers, never with much success unless I use them on someone other than myself.</li>
            <li>It takes me an extra 15 mins in the morn to do my hair.. which is fine by me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but without heated clips it is the same 1/3 less curl results same as the Pro Ion Ceramic but just lasts a bit longer than the Pro. Remington with the heated clips and the Ion Ceramic with wax core is still the BEST now.     </li>
            <li>With my older hair roller set, I stored it on the bottom - the first layer in the basket with my hair styling equipment.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are ready to go in TWO minutes.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that I haven&#x27;t used them much</li>
            <li>Very pood</li>
            <li>The Remington Rollers are a real timesaver in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have stick straight hair and the curlers from this</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the easiest to use, but once you get a hang of it they work very well.  </li>
            <li>did like that these heated up fast</li>
            <li>I just wish they&#x27;d had the whole clip covered with the plate</li>
            <li>Yes, it heats fast, but the clips leave \\&quot;ridges\\&quot; in my hair which are very unsightly.</li>
            <li>They really helped hold curl in my naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li>And that was after sleeping with them and going out on a very humid day.      </li>
            <li>never lasts, no matter how much hair spray you use.   </li>
            <li>I really like the idea of a heated clip to help set the curls.</li>
            <li>I have a modern bob</li>
            <li>but I like to spice it up with volume and curls on my stubborn straight hair.</li>
            <li>Its a very nice-looking set too, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>I need body and bounce in my stick straight hair, and there&#x27;s nothing like electric curlers to give my hair some movement.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted them to work, but can&#x27;t take the pain.</li>
            <li>They heat really well.  </li>
            <li>The rollers &amp; clips heat up FAST.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are &#x27;coated&#x27; with velvet so that the part that touches your hair is gentle on it.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely straight hair.</li>
            <li>But what I really wanted, I got none of;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does heat up fast.</li>
            <li>I thought they would be on the rollers themselves, which would probably be too much intense heat for the hair.</li>
            <li>However, the clips are not very snug and on top of that they leave indentations in your hair.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Also, if you don&#x27;t enjoy 2nd degree burns, find another brand.</li>
            <li>Take me 5 min,to get whole head rolled up, with in 10 min.</li>
            <li>There are no teeth at all, only a smooth surface, that keeps these things in place.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have never had curlers work this fast before.  </li>
            <li>I have several different setters but really liked the clips on this one.</li>
            <li>So far I have not been able to overheat them enough to burn myself.  </li>
            <li>I could see this working a lot better for a person with normal or fine hair, but for girls with thick or coarser hair, a 1\\&quot; large-barrel curling iron would be much faster.  </li>
            <li>I have never owned a pair of hot rollers, but after reading all the reviews I decided to jump on it and try something new.</li>
            <li>I can believe how easy these are to use and how long the curls lasts.      </li>
            <li>Now the other new: The plastic heated clips, which you would think are some magic technology, are in fact just hot plastic.  </li>
            <li>If you have long hair just use all the large on the top of the head and use the medium under and you should turn out fabulous because you can always brush thru it to loosen the curl or take your fingers thru it a few more times so the roller sizes should not be a problem for long hair.</li>
            <li>Most other mfgs make the unit so that it&#x27;s longer in length but slimmer in width.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>But, if you want nice waves that last a long time, skip this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the ceramic rollers with ceramic clip combination do a far better job of curling her hair, and faster to boot--which I, as her husband who is typically waiting by the door while she gets ready, very much appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rollers are smooth and I have yet to get one tangled in my long hair.  </li>
            <li>I want smaller curls and can roll smaller section but for the most part I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they sold small and Jumbo to use in it though.   </li>
            <li>Just where I want height the most, the clip ruins it.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I thought maybe it would settle down a bit in an hour or two, but no ... it remained HUGE!</li>
            <li>I ordered clips from many places and found they weren&#x27;t strong enough and after a minute of so, starting slipping out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, didn&#x27;t burn my fingers or my head, and put big bouncy curls in my poker-straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Rather decent Christmas gift</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think they got hot enough</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this hot roller set is that the rollers sit horizontally in the case, not vertically like traditional sets.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know if mine are an older manufacture, or newer?</li>
            <li>The stated warm-up time is 90 seconds, but I found a full 2 minutes worked a little better(!)</li>
            <li>Additionally, the entire apparatus is kind of large (about the width of 1 1/2 toasters and half the height), so storing it can be a bit of a hassle if you don&#x27;t have a lot of space.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these rollers to any and ALL hair</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this set of rollers, but they didn&#x27;t impress me.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I highly recommend these curlers.</li>
            <li>It only took a few minutes to smooth that out with a curling iron - easy peasy.    </li>
            <li>However, if you can get past the inconvenience, the resultant curls are lovely, large and voluminous.  </li>
            <li>word of caution, because curler placement is important, rolling takes a little longer at first.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the one thing that I did have an issue with was the rollers slipping because the clip has a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>The quantity of rollers is great as my hair is thick and long and I can curl it all at once.  </li>
            <li>but if you are looking for a good set of hot curlers, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li>Overall, they&#x27;re far better rollers than the ones she already had, but she has an issue primarily with their small size and ill-conceived clip handle design.</li>
            <li>The velvet on the surface of the curlers coax the hair around the roll nicely and the clips grab without pulling, even if you are clumsy like me.</li>
            <li>The label states that the ends of the curlers get hotter than normal.  </li>
            <li>Normally my hair does not take a curl no matter what product or tools I use.</li>
            <li>The biggest downside being that they seem to get hotter than normal curlers.  </li>
            <li>She received notice of the gift on line within a few minutes,  and was able to order something immediately.  </li>
            <li>I LIVE IN A VERY HUMID AREA AND MY OLD ROLLER CURLED MY HAIR</li>
            <li>The clips themselves are simple to use, easy to remove and put back in place once you roll up your hair in the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did try these rollers with other clips (both jaw clips and traditional wire clips), but they don&#x27;t really fit right.  </li>
            <li>I think if Remington simply redesigned their clips then it would be a pretty decent set.</li>
            <li>With my old hot rollers, I would curl my hair and by the time I got to the office, every last curl had come out and my hair would be straight.  </li>
            <li>and I am now searching for a new set of rollers.  </li>
            <li>As for the \\&quot;new technology,\\&quot; who knows?</li>
            <li>There is no where on site to just reqt a new clip</li>
            <li>They take up a bit more space on my vanity, but after a few uses, I&#x27;ve put my old set into the yard sale box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We love the curls that come up, but it took us a little practice in rolling them so that a funky hairstyle wasn&#x27;t the result!     </li>
            <li>They are not recessed very far.</li>
            <li>By pinning my hair up 1st then rolling the underside 1st, the middle part second, and the top part last, I find each roller sits on top of the last roller and avoids any problems of rollers slipping out.</li>
            <li>rollers with no small.  </li>
            <li>The key is to start in the back and/or sides, doing the top, front sections last, so rollers don&#x27;t flop forward.</li>
            <li>Bottom line....while they work if you do not want lines in your hair left by clips then keep looking for another hot roller set.</li>
            <li>I got the Pro Ion Ceramic Instant Heat first</li>
            <li>First, this set is big!</li>
            <li>big selling point for me is IT HEATS UP FAST!  </li>
            <li>Seems pretty solidly constructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the clips did not get hot enough to burn me nor did they slide off the roller    </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and these clips aren&#x27;t tight enough to hold it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time ever trying such a product, I&#x27;ve always used hot curlers and flat irons.  </li>
            <li>If I had to purchase these, I personally would not be happy with this set mainly because of how the clips have no &#x27;grip&#x27; in them and how uncomfortable they are when they are in my hair.  </li>
            <li>They are way too hot to handle, so trying to put a lot of hair on them resulted in frequent burning, but not putting enough resulted in scorched ends.  </li>
            <li>The curls were a nice size, but even using the smaller rollers, in small pieces, they didn&#x27;t curl the bottom of my hair.</li>
            <li>My curls came out soft and bouncy and very natural.  </li>
            <li>It does have a rather large base, so if that matters to you, like if you intend to store this in a vanity drawer, measure first to make sure it will fit.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the added damage drying my hair, curling with the hot rollers and then having to use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li>While the heated clips provide the advantage of a quick set, I can&#x27;t seem to keep the one in the front area above my bangs from putting a crimp just above the root of that section of hair.  </li>
            <li>- The heating elements are obviously quite hot, but they are also easily accessible by little fingers.</li>
            <li>it has a total of 20 rollers...8 medium ( 1\\&quot;) rollers and 12 large rollers ( 1 1/4\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li>but my ends are smooth and the hair has a little shine.      </li>
            <li>Her hair is fine and straight, and mine is thick and curly, but the rollers couldn&#x27;t figure it out.  </li>
            <li>And this is with the weather cooperating completely</li>
            <li>I find them equally soft on the hair.  </li>
            <li>and of course stay away from brushing them unless you want to relax them to just soft body.     </li>
            <li>It heats up faster than the Pro one and is not messy.   </li>
            <li>You only have to heat them up for 2 minutes and they are ready to go and the curl was at least 1/3 more than with the Pro Ion set.</li>
            <li>My old unit takes FOREVER to heat up.  </li>
            <li>I have had professional body waves that do not take at</li>
            <li>I found they actually heat up as fast as my curling</li>
            <li>The rollers are soft felt-like material that doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair.</li>
            <li>I could no longer style it and looked like an old grannie.  </li>
            <li>The curls last all day as long as you allow them to cool before running your fingers through them</li>
            <li>The only things I can think of that would make this set better is to add a few grip dots on the clips surface</li>
            <li>I have thin hair that is straight on top, and curly/wavy on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I have really long hair, and it&#x27;s naturally curly, but hot rollers still help me with managibilty.</li>
            <li>If you can handle the whole roller straight out of the unit after it&#x27;s been heated up then it&#x27;s not a good hot roller in my book!</li>
            <li>My daughter was not happy with our first try when I curled it horizontally, but was pleased with the second attempt when I used them vertically.</li>
            <li>A couple of simple design features, such as an LED not just for power but one that changed color or blinked when hot,</li>
            <li>but THOSE really burned my hands with steam and was so messy that I tossed them in the corner and started trying Hot Rollers.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a great idea having hot clips as well as the roller, but because of that, the rollers sit in the base on a line, which produces the line in the hair.  </li>
            <li>First you burn the heck out of your fingers, second the curl does last at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried both the medium &amp; large rollers, I&#x27;ve tried heating it up for longer, leaving them in for longer and for some reason, the shape and body just won&#x27;t hold as long.  </li>
            <li>I have large and medium size rollers for my long hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And this thing is going to last for a long time as it&#x27;s very well made and high</li>
            <li>They heat up fast and do not take long at all to get curls in your hair.  </li>
            <li>Also the clips leave real dents in my hair, not just minor ones.  </li>
            <li>Also, since the clips are heated, they get hot on the edges and require some careful handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair, and most sets have nowhere near enough for my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will agree that they do get hot, but, that is what makes them work so well and keeps the curls lasting much longer than other heated rollers I have used!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the rollers heat so well (quickly and evenly) rhat a curl will take to the hair in just a little while.  </li>
            <li>Maybe someone with shorter, less difficult hair would have better luck, but for someone with difficult to curl hair, this product is not the best solution.  </li>
            <li>Curls last pretty long.    </li>
            <li>I generally wear weaves and I&#x27;ve never had curls like this in it before!</li>
            <li>The heated clips are such a great idea, curling the hair that usually gets very little actual heat.  </li>
            <li>But the main reason I&#x27;m taking these back is because the crease/dent it left in my hair.  </li>
            <li>The do heat up fast and the result is great, minus the ugly line it leaves.</li>
            <li>I gave this only four stars only because the clips get hot and if you don&#x27;t have them firmly fastened in hair, you can feel some intense heat on your ears.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Advice to keep hot rollers away from sensitive ears and foreheads: I have a few inexpensive men&#x27;s pocket combs.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick hair down to almost my waist and loved these setters.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely long and thick and I have a problem getting a nice curl to stay in my hair all day long!</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, if you use electric rollers in general, this set is quick, and delivers a firm curl in a reasonably short period of time.</li>
            <li>The rollers are large enough to give bouncy loose curls without ending up looking like a poodle.</li>
            <li>Essentially this is a new innovation in the &#x27;curler market&#x27; (if there is such a thing).  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for any of you out there that long for curls and have been let down from so many other devises.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who like myself has long thick hair and wants to go from straight to curly in minutes.</li>
            <li>only problem I had was one other reviewers have mentioned -- that the clip left a slight \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; at the top of my hair afterward.</li>
            <li>With other hot rollers, you can hold them by the ends or middle, but that isn&#x27;t an option with this model.</li>
            <li>Pass onit other products much nicer and convenient.</li>
            <li>they did heat up fast, but not extremely hot to touch    </li>
            <li>If I blow dry my hair straight, it looks flat.</li>
            <li>The dual heating seals the hair and there is not a single hair out of place.  </li>
            <li>It is a little large, so will be harder to pack when taking on vacation, but really like product.</li>
            <li>I have hair that does NOT like to hold a curl, and conventional curling methods (iron, regular hot rollers) don&#x27;t work well for me -- or they work, but an hour later, my hair looks like I never did a thing to it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The set contains PLENTY of rollers in the larger size, which I generally prefer...</li>
            <li>When I unpacked them and plugged them in for the first time, there were a few rollers on the lower \\&quot;rack\\&quot;that got a melted plastic like substance on them (may be 3 of them).  </li>
            <li>just a slight crimp which I am certain is an issue of technique while using this product</li>
            <li>so they are less slick and grip the hair better and to change the color of the rollers and the storage case to polished jet black with polished hot pink combination accents with hot pink rollers with Jet black hot pink striped clips.</li>
            <li>Generally, I leave my rollers in for 5 short minutes and have curl that lasts an entire day!  </li>
            <li>These are essentially curlers, but instead of just normal plastic clips, they have wide clips with metal that also heats up.  </li>
            <li>A little concerned because of some of the reviews, but ordered it anyway because I wanted the large &amp; med.</li>
            <li>My friend does not use the clips and just bought the large round plastic claw hair clips from a beauty supply store so that she can get a tighter hold</li>
            <li>The curlers do get a little hotter than other rollers do, so you have to work quickly and</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> These hair rollers work great!</li>
            <li> For myself, I think this product works perfect.</li>
            <li> It is great!  </li>
            <li> Makes the perfect curl/wave that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> so again, might not be the best for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> (It seems sleeping on sponge rollers is still the best solution for us.)</li>
            <li> I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li> (an X-acto knife will fix the problem, but it&#x27;s best to avoid it).</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m very happy with these hair rollers.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this Remington product.  </li>
            <li> This the the very best set I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought these per the reviews that said how wonderful these rollers were.  </li>
            <li> The clips hold my hair perfectly and after about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Awesome purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> I thought I had chosen the best set to achieve what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> The Remington Heated clip hair set is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Saves a LOT of time and gives the perfect flowy curl</li>
            <li> And they make gorgeous curls!  </li>
            <li> I take everything off, I spray my hair and I have a head of beautiful bouncy</li>
            <li> The presentation of the rollers is attractive on a counter.</li>
            <li> The curlers are great.  </li>
            <li> I think the product is great.  </li>
            <li> A great product that will pay for itself in no time.  </li>
            <li> If anyone has some helpful info that could eliminate this problem, I would be happy to know.  </li>
            <li> Having the clips heated sounded like a great idea.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li> The thing I liked best was taking them out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> The product is great but DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM DISCOUNT JUNGLE.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve found that the curler and heated clip has produced great curls</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a great deal when I paid $45 for these at a retail store.</li>
            <li> These curlers were great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably the best, in that it heats up very quickly, which is, after all, why I use this type of product.  </li>
            <li> (Incidentally, I think it&#x27;s great that this set has so many rollers!</li>
            <li> What good does having metal plates inside the clips do if they won&#x27;t even keep the rollers in place.  </li>
            <li> The had a really good grip and did not fall out like</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A GOOD PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> They are really good curlers.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good item for med-thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried and tried to establish a good grip and no matter what</li>
            <li> , the rollers hold the heat, they don&#x27;t burn your hair, and the curl lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> I feel that they are a good tool.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, great curls, lots of fun!</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers this morning and am very pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li> Okay, let me start off by saying, these are GREAT for girl time at home..</li>
            <li> Rather than investing their money in an attractive presentation, Remington should concentrate more on the practical application.</li>
            <li> What a great way to get a curly hairdo with no fuss and no expensive fees to pay a hairstylist!!!</li>
            <li> The heated clips make ALL the difference and the curl on my very straight hair with no perm was AWESOME and you need to GET SOME!!!   </li>
            <li> love EVERYTHING about this set!</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are not the best but not the worset.     </li>
            <li> Nano Silver then you know it would be my first choice as Nano Silver is THE best technology now</li>
            <li> ENJOY!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got them!</li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased!</li>
            <li> Use these quite often and LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> Works great and is so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li> One tip: I had some fly away hairs that I went over with my curling iron to smooth out.</li>
            <li> you are in the market for heated curlers, this product works great and is a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> but they do hold and produce nice results.</li>
            <li> I really liked this set.  </li>
            <li> nice for us tree-huggers.    </li>
            <li> Nice to know, also not in the booklet.    </li>
            <li> It is neat and tidy with the clips on each roller</li>
            <li> (kind of a mauve)</li>
            <li> Yes, I achieved some nice bounce and curls with this set.  </li>
            <li> curlers begin to warm via a metal rack in the case within a minute or so of turning it on.  </li>
            <li> Everything packs up nicely.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been so impressed with how quickly they heat up, and how quickly they curl your hair!</li>
            <li> The Remington H-2050 T-Studio Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers with Tourmaline provide beautiful curls that have staying power - used with the right hair products for your hair</li>
            <li> These curlers have been the best I have used so far.  </li>
            <li> even though they don&#x27;t seem to get too hot, they do a great job on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Well lo and behold, I had nice bouncy, full curls!</li>
            <li> in order not to burn kinks into your hair, you have to make sure to clip from the bottom of the roller and not the side or top, after you have gotten your hair rolled onto it.  </li>
            <li> That does not seem convenient to me nor healthy for my hair.      </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these heated hair rollers.</li>
            <li> I am more of an intuitive user than a manual reader, so I plugged the unit in and waited.</li>
            <li> The Remington H-2050 is just OK.  </li>
            <li> and they said I shouldn&#x27;t have the rollers plugged in for more than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> I have not even come close to burning myself, and I absolutely love these rollers.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these rollers.</li>
            <li> this is a safe purchase.</li>
            <li> , I can attest to the fact that her curls look much better and are more durable when using these ceramic curlers (what the hell has marriage turned me into that</li>
            <li> and it did ok</li>
            <li> I LOVE this set</li>
            <li> This heated curler set is simple and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Her hair is more course and curly than mine, and she had lovely results.</li>
            <li> On my hair, I didn&#x27;t  notice any better results, just quicker results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think clips with teeth would be a lot better.</li>
            <li> But like every heated roller set I&#x27;ve ever owned, the top of head rollers just don&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li> I love the case it comes in, I love the clips they hold my hair well.</li>
            <li> By placing the clips on the rollers so the opening was upwards and the pinch part of the clip was downwards, I avoided the line that many others have mentioned the rollers leaving in their hair</li>
            <li> If you use them every day, make sure you have the counter space.</li>
            <li> so the roller clips may hold thinner hair better; although, that may be the ones that end up with the crease.</li>
            <li> Allowing in theory a faster curl, and potentially a better curl.    </li>
            <li> Slightly better than a gimmick, but still room for improvement and refinement.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to put life, bounce and curl into my hair.</li>
            <li> They worked ok...</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of it, I could just grab the clip and unroll my hair without actually touching the roller.</li>
            <li> Probably just to exchange them, unless I research and find a product that I want to try even more.    </li>
            <li> My hair looks so healthy and everyone notices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at Remington and Conair rollers for a while, and this model, as well as a similar model, seemed perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these rollers.</li>
            <li> I love the way they are stacked and the clips help keep everything neat and in place.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m OK with that.</li>
            <li> She lives in a different state, so I got a gift card from Amazon.com, which was the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> - The unit is very large and takes up a good part of a bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t produced a good photo of the clips for those of you interested in them, so I will describe one of the many flaws with this set of rollers.  </li>
            <li> love the clip, being a dual heating technique, it really heats the hair quickly and when you unroll...absolutely gorgeous!</li>
            <li> The clips are generally a good idea, and the rollers stay in pretty well--</li>
            <li> When I have time, I like to let the curlers cool in my hair, but even when I&#x27;ve had to take them out while still warm</li>
            <li> I have had many, many hot curlers over the years and was thrilled when I got a chance to review a set.  </li>
            <li> Takes up more counter space than I have available in the bathroom</li>
            <li> It takes up a bit more space than I have free.  </li>
            <li> Remington claims that with their &#x27;titanium tourmaline ionic conditioning&#x27; that it will seal your hair cuticle to repel humidity &amp; static for &#x27;incredible&#x27; lasting frizz free shine.  </li>
            <li> This results in curls \\&quot;setting up\\&quot; more quickly, because the heat is distributed more rapidly.  </li>
            <li> I love this item, very fast warm up, super easy to use, specially love the clip lock.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of a clip instead of the metal fasteners that most sets use, but they don&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li> The roller clips grip well, are easy to put in my hair and to take out.  </li>
            <li> The clips are easy to use.</li>
            <li> found the rollers easy to use, once I got the hang of putting them in without burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to use, my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught or torn in them, and they leave my hair shiny and wavy.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;stadium seating&#x27; design makes it easy to remove or return rollers without burning your fingers.</li>
            <li> The clips are easy to use and don&#x27;t rip my hair.</li>
            <li> I FOUND THEM EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re so easy to use.</li>
            <li> you turn on the switch, the set heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> but my hair curls easily.</li>
            <li> and I found it easy to wrap my hair around them.  </li>
            <li> I find them easy to loosen or fall out even if I am sitting still.</li>
            <li> The rollers are easy to use, and do not pull when you&#x27;re taking them out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, these rollers are really easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> In spite of using a strong hairspray, the curls didn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> gave me wonderfully beautiful curls that lasted quite a bit longer than I could have possibly hoped for.  </li>
            <li> And the quantity is perfect for me, I don&#x27;t have much hair though, but if you would need more just do them by section, remember it only takes 5-10minutes to get curls.    </li>
            <li> I find that my curls hold beautifully after only 10 minutes and my hair looks shinier, and they last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curlers heat up quickly, and are easy to use (even for someone who doesn&#x27;t use curlers more than once a year).</li>
            <li> The curlers are soft, the clips attach directly to the curlers in the storage unit so you won&#x27;t lose them, but most importantly, my hair looked great!  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s something that I could manage to live with if I really loved this set.  </li>
            <li> You get smooth, beautiful, big and bouncy curls in FIVE minutes!</li>
            <li> They get hot fast and do make great curls.  </li>
            <li> (I have fine hair.)  </li>
            <li> The curlers stay in nicely and are pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li> This product worked just fine to curl my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and they seem to move around alot.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it was a bit of a challenge to curl the hair around my ears and forehead without feeling the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is that the base/case that the rollers are on IS kind of large.  </li>
            <li> There is a nice distribution of sizes, including large rollers, which some brands skimp on.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, but it did keep this from being a fie-star product.</li>
            <li> With these rollers my curl looked beautiful when I first took them out, and then it completely fell out within minutes.  </li>
            <li> I use the rollers along with a curling brush, to smooth out the crease in the front, which fixes the problem for me.  </li>
            <li> If you are a bit of a hair-challenged dork like me, stick with a cheap set.</li>
            <li> The smooth rollers are comfortable to grip w/o over heating your hair and fingers.  </li>
            <li> The rollers form a medium curl and the clip helps smooth out frizzies.  </li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to LOVE this set, the most important reason for using hair rollers is so that it will give your hair body...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why in the world a company would design and manufacture hair clips that are SMOOTH?  </li>
            <li> but I simply can&#x27;t give this product a GREAT rating.    </li>
            <li> the clips don&#x27;t hold rollers securely to hair.  </li>
            <li> and they work fantastic with the existing Remington clips, or as a replacement.</li>
            <li> sure what would solve the problem is if the clips had some good sized teeth to grab the hair next to the scalp and hang</li>
            <li> Good head, like the soft surface but the clips leave ridges in your hair that you have to straighten out with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The Remington T/Studio H2050 hot rollers are the best hair product I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time, if ever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before, but these are really easy to use!  </li>
            <li> First the good news: These rollers set your hair fast and they&#x27;re easy to use.    </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these rollers to family, friends and anyone looking for a timesaving, effective roller.</li>
            <li> And to be honest, if I have to work so hard to rig a way to prevent this from happening, I can&#x27;t in good conscience rate these rollers more than a 3.  </li>
            <li> I was excited about these when I bought them.  </li>
            <li> these are so fun to use!</li>
            <li> The curlers are a bit on the warm side when handling but other than that I am more than satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Since I was in the market to purchase some new hair styling products, I was thrilled when this was offered to me from the Vine program.    </li>
            <li> Even if you are a beginner, this product is quite fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Heat up real fast and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m heading back to the store to return this crappy set and get the kind with more of a claw clip....</li>
            <li> What I also love about them is the fact that they heat up quick, and really within minutes you have curls!</li>
            <li> IT IS RIGHT!</li>
            <li> believe these rollers are best suited for those w average-thickness hair, but not someone w thick</li>
            <li> I love the flocked roller, so much easier on my hair, they never pull.  </li>
            <li> I went straight home and watched a bunch of youtube videos to make sure I knew how to roll without looking like I was from the 50s.  </li>
            <li> I found these things to be true in my opinion:    1.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of things to prevent this, but simply haven&#x27;t found a good way to keep this from happening yet.  </li>
            <li> Within five minutes, they reach optimum temperature and achieve maximum effectiveness within ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you do have to make sure you got it just right first.</li>
            <li> These are easy for me to use and makes my hair soft and healthy looking again.</li>
            <li> Really looked forward to receiving these rollers, but they get TOO HOT!!!  </li>
            <li> The Remington H-2050 Heated Clip Hair Setter is one of THE BEST hair products I&#x27;ve gotten to try in the past five years!</li>
            <li> I use the smaller rollers on the top of my head and the larger ones on the bottom, it came out beautiful and full for my photo shoot.</li>
            <li> These are a great solution for a busy working mom, like me, who doesn&#x27;t have much time to get ready in the morning!</li>
            <li> I have not yet experienced the &#x27;bend&#x27; in your hair like some other reveiwers</li>
            <li> Also, I have thick, stick-straight, somewhat coarse hair, and the clips, while moderately effective, do not seem to want to stay on my hair because of the lack of \\&quot;teeth.\\&quot;  While the flocked rollers are nice and fairly grippy, the clips themselves are made of smooth metal and tend to slide off.  </li>
            <li> The curlers do heat up quite quickly, which I consider a plus.  </li>
            <li> The curlers heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Although the clips grip the hair well, they do leave dents, particularly on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> But overall, these work better than most.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly just as the description says.</li>
            <li> One of my 2 largest complaints about this product is the fact that since the clips get HOT, someone in the design department forgot to coat / layer the top of the clips with some sort of coating or substance that would not heat up as hot as the rollers.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and evenly</li>
            <li> I like the set up and quick heating and velvet covered rollers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The roller heat up quickly, a must for those of us who always seem to be rushed in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> The heat up time was quick.</li>
            <li> Conair SPC10R Super Clips]]  from Amazon</li>
            <li> I needed a quick solution for a gift for my sister-in-law and wanted it to arrive before Christmas.</li>
            <li> They were ready to use in under 2 minutes and after 10 minutes in my hair they left great curls.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve burned myself a jillion times from VERY HOT curling irons</li>
            <li> The good:  - Strong tight curls faster than any curlers I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> They heat up very quickly and are ready to use in no time at all.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use and hold the heat very well.  </li>
            <li> While I have read some reviews that you can fix this with touching up with a straight iron I refuse to spend money on a hot roller set that does not allow me to fix my hair with speed.  </li>
            <li> Fast, easy, convenient.  </li>
            <li> The heat is perfect and I have long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> I had nice full, bouncy waves that lasted the entire day.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought rollers to add volume to my straight, somewhat fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very striaght hair that is fine but dense.  </li>
            <li> , I thought it must have been an error, but I did think that if something was posted as being available for a certain price on Amazon that they would be obliged to honor it.       </li>
            <li> The clips are smooth and I really need something with teeth to hang on.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing how the curl last without scorching your hair.  </li>
            <li> The clip on the curler in the unit makes it look neat and tidy, but it adds an extra step.  </li>
            <li> I used them once, and 3 people commented on how different and nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Okay, the truth is out: I&#x27;m an old school electric curler girl.  </li>
            <li> -- I had the soft wavy curls that I love.  </li>
            <li> three sets of electric rollers I have owned, these are by far the ones I like the most.</li>
            <li> Bulky and sometimes leaves a crimp line on your hair if you don&#x27;t position your curls right.</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> I also could not get the clips just right</li>
            <li> These clips store right on the the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then if you don&#x27;t have the clips sitting just right</li>
            <li> Also apparently they have to be very precisely placed on the rails.  </li>
            <li> here&#x27;s a concept for appliances that get hot: an automatic shutoff, would be a nice tweak to future editions of this product.    </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get too hot, but still warm enough.</li>
            <li> I will try another kind, this is my first experience with hot rollers, and for now I&#x27;m back to my trusty revlon ceramic heat curling iron I&#x27;ve used for 12 yrs!!</li>
            <li> and I want to have a really nice style, it doesn&#x27;t take long at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The large covered case with clear lid is appealing and sturdy.</li>
            <li> and I had to buy clips to hold the roller in and the case is too large to store!</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I used them a few times so that I had a bit more experience with them before writing a review.  </li>
            <li> And they only take 90 seconds to heat up, which is really good on those busy weekday mornings.  </li>
            <li> The set heats up quickly and curls hair fast</li>
            <li> the good side, my hair seemed silkier and way less &#x27;fried&#x27; using these.</li>
            <li> However, because of the \\&quot;melting\\&quot; that I experienced initially, I will take back the set.  </li>
            <li> Very fast and no</li>
            <li> And the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using the set, I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments and I really couldn&#x27;t be happier!  </li>
            <li> It also has the same flaw that most electric rollers have, which no fool proof way of fastening them so that they stay in the hair.  </li>
            <li> I do not find the clips too hot to handle at all</li>
            <li> They can be *really* hot plastic.  </li>
            <li> The cons stated the rollers and clips were too hot, and would burn their fingers/hands.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought the clips felt hot but its managable.</li>
            <li> I think its a very well-made and fun set, and I would highy recommend it.</li>
            <li> Her results were noticeably better with this set than with my standard hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are more than enough rollers for my hair</li>
            <li> The ends are so hot, I got blisters on my 1st use.</li>
            <li> but sheesh, you figure when the rollers are IN your hair, you shouldn&#x27;t have to tilt your head from side to side because the HOT clips are burning the tips of your ears, your cheekbone, your cheek, etc.  </li>
            <li> There are absolutely no teeth, no spikes, no rubber (not that I&#x27;d want warm or hot &#x27;rubber&#x27; on my hair) at all to HOLD ONTO or grip your hair.  </li>
            <li> (Remington: perhaps you would design some different clips for those of us who would love to have an option for clips that grip your hair?)  </li>
            <li> so if you think you&#x27;d be able to manage or tolerate the clips and you only want waves (not curls) in your hair, then you may like this set a lot.  </li>
            <li> I had decided to stop using hot curlers as it was damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> I grabbed the first roller-which you pick up by the clasp which holds it in place-and my fingers began to burn...</li>
            <li> They can withstand hot roller heat, but you can&#x27;t heat them up in the unit as you would the Remington Clips.  </li>
            <li> Some people are complaining that they are too hot, but I find that picking them up by the clip, or handling the velour part of the roll is not a problem.</li>
            <li> As far as the crimping at the hairline goes, I did not have that problem (maybe it depends on the type of hair of you have), but it seems that a significant amount of others have had it...</li>
            <li> Unlike some other brands, EACH hair roller came with it&#x27;s own clip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several similar products in the past and this curler set is easily the best.  </li>
            <li> I tried using wire prong fasteners from an older set of hot rollers, but the sizes weren&#x27;t right and the rollers just fell out.  </li>
            <li> If you take your hair seriously, and already do well with rollers, these are GREAT.</li>
            <li> If you leave the rollers in for maybe a half hour at most, you get a nice curl that holds for the entire day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They really work, and I agree with most reviewers it does leave a mark on your hair, no big deal</li>
            <li> Overall, these rollers are convenient, fast, and I LOVE the way they sit in the case.</li>
            <li> The Large and the Extra Large rollers are most beneficial to me because of the length of my hair.  </li>
            <li> They get hot fast.  </li>
            <li> so I would recommend that you do not leave it unattended for a long time while pre-heating to be safe.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do that with this one and have everything LOOK organized as much as nothing will lay flat on the top cover because it&#x27;s slanted.    </li>
            <li> course, a lot depends on your hair type, so if you have long, fine hair you probably want to heat up the curlers for 10 minutes or so and leave them in for a good half hour or more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy these again; the only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c they cost more than I originally wanted to spend.</li>
            <li> except to say that I personally have had smooth curls or waves when I first release my hair from the rollers.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;The curlers are easy to handle because the parts that heat up are not on the outside, but are on the interior of the clip and on the slots along the side of the curlers.  </li>
            <li> but the set I got had all Jumbo and Large</li>
            <li> The rollers are large and medium.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;The case itself is large, with a translucent plastic hinged lid that has no latch.</li>
            <li> The unit is all pro, and quite large, which means it will delight any woman who is a salon-owner-wanna-be.</li>
            <li> The unit itself does have a large footprint on your vanity/counter</li>
            <li> but I like the fact that two-thirds of the rollers are large.</li>
            <li> What happens is that when you remove the rollers from your head, you have a large crease where the roller was hanging from your head.  </li>
            <li> The good, the bad, the beautiful: Let me start by saying I keep trying to use hot rollers, never with much success unless I use them on someone other than myself.</li>
            <li> It takes me an extra 15 mins in the morn to do my hair.. which is fine by me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but without heated clips it is the same 1/3 less curl results same as the Pro Ion Ceramic but just lasts a bit longer than the Pro. Remington with the heated clips and the Ion Ceramic with wax core is still the BEST now.     </li>
            <li> With my older hair roller set, I stored it on the bottom - the first layer in the basket with my hair styling equipment.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are ready to go in TWO minutes.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that I haven&#x27;t used them much</li>
            <li> Very pood</li>
            <li> The Remington Rollers are a real timesaver in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I have stick straight hair and the curlers from this</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the easiest to use, but once you get a hang of it they work very well.  </li>
            <li> did like that these heated up fast</li>
            <li> I just wish they&#x27;d had the whole clip covered with the plate</li>
            <li> Yes, it heats fast, but the clips leave \\&quot;ridges\\&quot; in my hair which are very unsightly.</li>
            <li> They really helped hold curl in my naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li> And that was after sleeping with them and going out on a very humid day.      </li>
            <li> never lasts, no matter how much hair spray you use.   </li>
            <li> I really like the idea of a heated clip to help set the curls.</li>
            <li> I have a modern bob</li>
            <li> but I like to spice it up with volume and curls on my stubborn straight hair.</li>
            <li> Its a very nice-looking set too, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I need body and bounce in my stick straight hair, and there&#x27;s nothing like electric curlers to give my hair some movement.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted them to work, but can&#x27;t take the pain.</li>
            <li> They heat really well.  </li>
            <li> The rollers &amp; clips heat up FAST.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are &#x27;coated&#x27; with velvet so that the part that touches your hair is gentle on it.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely straight hair.</li>
            <li> But what I really wanted, I got none of;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does heat up fast.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be on the rollers themselves, which would probably be too much intense heat for the hair.</li>
            <li> However, the clips are not very snug and on top of that they leave indentations in your hair.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Also, if you don&#x27;t enjoy 2nd degree burns, find another brand.</li>
            <li> Take me 5 min,to get whole head rolled up, with in 10 min.</li>
            <li> There are no teeth at all, only a smooth surface, that keeps these things in place.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have never had curlers work this fast before.  </li>
            <li> I have several different setters but really liked the clips on this one.</li>
            <li> So far I have not been able to overheat them enough to burn myself.  </li>
            <li> I could see this working a lot better for a person with normal or fine hair, but for girls with thick or coarser hair, a 1\\&quot; large-barrel curling iron would be much faster.  </li>
            <li> I have never owned a pair of hot rollers, but after reading all the reviews I decided to jump on it and try something new.</li>
            <li> I can believe how easy these are to use and how long the curls lasts.      </li>
            <li> Now the other new: The plastic heated clips, which you would think are some magic technology, are in fact just hot plastic.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair just use all the large on the top of the head and use the medium under and you should turn out fabulous because you can always brush thru it to loosen the curl or take your fingers thru it a few more times so the roller sizes should not be a problem for long hair.</li>
            <li> Most other mfgs make the unit so that it&#x27;s longer in length but slimmer in width.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> But, if you want nice waves that last a long time, skip this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the ceramic rollers with ceramic clip combination do a far better job of curling her hair, and faster to boot--which I, as her husband who is typically waiting by the door while she gets ready, very much appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rollers are smooth and I have yet to get one tangled in my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I want smaller curls and can roll smaller section but for the most part I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they sold small and Jumbo to use in it though.   </li>
            <li> Just where I want height the most, the clip ruins it.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I thought maybe it would settle down a bit in an hour or two, but no ... it remained HUGE!</li>
            <li> I ordered clips from many places and found they weren&#x27;t strong enough and after a minute of so, starting slipping out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, didn&#x27;t burn my fingers or my head, and put big bouncy curls in my poker-straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Rather decent Christmas gift</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think they got hot enough</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this hot roller set is that the rollers sit horizontally in the case, not vertically like traditional sets.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know if mine are an older manufacture, or newer?</li>
            <li> The stated warm-up time is 90 seconds, but I found a full 2 minutes worked a little better(!)</li>
            <li> Additionally, the entire apparatus is kind of large (about the width of 1 1/2 toasters and half the height), so storing it can be a bit of a hassle if you don&#x27;t have a lot of space.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these rollers to any and ALL hair</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this set of rollers, but they didn&#x27;t impress me.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I highly recommend these curlers.</li>
            <li> It only took a few minutes to smooth that out with a curling iron - easy peasy.    </li>
            <li> However, if you can get past the inconvenience, the resultant curls are lovely, large and voluminous.  </li>
            <li> word of caution, because curler placement is important, rolling takes a little longer at first.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the one thing that I did have an issue with was the rollers slipping because the clip has a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> The quantity of rollers is great as my hair is thick and long and I can curl it all at once.  </li>
            <li> but if you are looking for a good set of hot curlers, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Overall, they&#x27;re far better rollers than the ones she already had, but she has an issue primarily with their small size and ill-conceived clip handle design.</li>
            <li> The velvet on the surface of the curlers coax the hair around the roll nicely and the clips grab without pulling, even if you are clumsy like me.</li>
            <li> The label states that the ends of the curlers get hotter than normal.  </li>
            <li> Normally my hair does not take a curl no matter what product or tools I use.</li>
            <li> The biggest downside being that they seem to get hotter than normal curlers.  </li>
            <li> She received notice of the gift on line within a few minutes,  and was able to order something immediately.  </li>
            <li> I LIVE IN A VERY HUMID AREA AND MY OLD ROLLER CURLED MY HAIR</li>
            <li> The clips themselves are simple to use, easy to remove and put back in place once you roll up your hair in the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did try these rollers with other clips (both jaw clips and traditional wire clips), but they don&#x27;t really fit right.  </li>
            <li> I think if Remington simply redesigned their clips then it would be a pretty decent set.</li>
            <li> With my old hot rollers, I would curl my hair and by the time I got to the office, every last curl had come out and my hair would be straight.  </li>
            <li> and I am now searching for a new set of rollers.  </li>
            <li> As for the \\&quot;new technology,\\&quot; who knows?</li>
            <li> There is no where on site to just reqt a new clip</li>
            <li> They take up a bit more space on my vanity, but after a few uses, I&#x27;ve put my old set into the yard sale box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We love the curls that come up, but it took us a little practice in rolling them so that a funky hairstyle wasn&#x27;t the result!     </li>
            <li> They are not recessed very far.</li>
            <li> By pinning my hair up 1st then rolling the underside 1st, the middle part second, and the top part last, I find each roller sits on top of the last roller and avoids any problems of rollers slipping out.</li>
            <li> rollers with no small.  </li>
            <li> The key is to start in the back and/or sides, doing the top, front sections last, so rollers don&#x27;t flop forward.</li>
            <li> Bottom line....while they work if you do not want lines in your hair left by clips then keep looking for another hot roller set.</li>
            <li> I got the Pro Ion Ceramic Instant Heat first</li>
            <li> First, this set is big!</li>
            <li> big selling point for me is IT HEATS UP FAST!  </li>
            <li> Seems pretty solidly constructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the clips did not get hot enough to burn me nor did they slide off the roller    </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and these clips aren&#x27;t tight enough to hold it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time ever trying such a product, I&#x27;ve always used hot curlers and flat irons.  </li>
            <li> If I had to purchase these, I personally would not be happy with this set mainly because of how the clips have no &#x27;grip&#x27; in them and how uncomfortable they are when they are in my hair.  </li>
            <li> They are way too hot to handle, so trying to put a lot of hair on them resulted in frequent burning, but not putting enough resulted in scorched ends.  </li>
            <li> The curls were a nice size, but even using the smaller rollers, in small pieces, they didn&#x27;t curl the bottom of my hair.</li>
            <li> My curls came out soft and bouncy and very natural.  </li>
            <li> It does have a rather large base, so if that matters to you, like if you intend to store this in a vanity drawer, measure first to make sure it will fit.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the added damage drying my hair, curling with the hot rollers and then having to use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> While the heated clips provide the advantage of a quick set, I can&#x27;t seem to keep the one in the front area above my bangs from putting a crimp just above the root of that section of hair.  </li>
            <li> - The heating elements are obviously quite hot, but they are also easily accessible by little fingers.</li>
            <li> it has a total of 20 rollers...8 medium ( 1\\&quot;) rollers and 12 large rollers ( 1 1/4\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> but my ends are smooth and the hair has a little shine.      </li>
            <li> Her hair is fine and straight, and mine is thick and curly, but the rollers couldn&#x27;t figure it out.  </li>
            <li> And this is with the weather cooperating completely</li>
            <li> I find them equally soft on the hair.  </li>
            <li> and of course stay away from brushing them unless you want to relax them to just soft body.     </li>
            <li> It heats up faster than the Pro one and is not messy.   </li>
            <li> You only have to heat them up for 2 minutes and they are ready to go and the curl was at least 1/3 more than with the Pro Ion set.</li>
            <li> My old unit takes FOREVER to heat up.  </li>
            <li> I have had professional body waves that do not take at</li>
            <li> I found they actually heat up as fast as my curling</li>
            <li> The rollers are soft felt-like material that doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair.</li>
            <li> I could no longer style it and looked like an old grannie.  </li>
            <li> The curls last all day as long as you allow them to cool before running your fingers through them</li>
            <li> The only things I can think of that would make this set better is to add a few grip dots on the clips surface</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that is straight on top, and curly/wavy on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, and it&#x27;s naturally curly, but hot rollers still help me with managibilty.</li>
            <li> If you can handle the whole roller straight out of the unit after it&#x27;s been heated up then it&#x27;s not a good hot roller in my book!</li>
            <li> My daughter was not happy with our first try when I curled it horizontally, but was pleased with the second attempt when I used them vertically.</li>
            <li> A couple of simple design features, such as an LED not just for power but one that changed color or blinked when hot,</li>
            <li> but THOSE really burned my hands with steam and was so messy that I tossed them in the corner and started trying Hot Rollers.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a great idea having hot clips as well as the roller, but because of that, the rollers sit in the base on a line, which produces the line in the hair.  </li>
            <li> First you burn the heck out of your fingers, second the curl does last at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the medium &amp; large rollers, I&#x27;ve tried heating it up for longer, leaving them in for longer and for some reason, the shape and body just won&#x27;t hold as long.  </li>
            <li> I have large and medium size rollers for my long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And this thing is going to last for a long time as it&#x27;s very well made and high</li>
            <li> They heat up fast and do not take long at all to get curls in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Also the clips leave real dents in my hair, not just minor ones.  </li>
            <li> Also, since the clips are heated, they get hot on the edges and require some careful handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and most sets have nowhere near enough for my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will agree that they do get hot, but, that is what makes them work so well and keeps the curls lasting much longer than other heated rollers I have used!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the rollers heat so well (quickly and evenly) rhat a curl will take to the hair in just a little while.  </li>
            <li> Maybe someone with shorter, less difficult hair would have better luck, but for someone with difficult to curl hair, this product is not the best solution.  </li>
            <li> Curls last pretty long.    </li>
            <li> I generally wear weaves and I&#x27;ve never had curls like this in it before!</li>
            <li> The heated clips are such a great idea, curling the hair that usually gets very little actual heat.  </li>
            <li> But the main reason I&#x27;m taking these back is because the crease/dent it left in my hair.  </li>
            <li> The do heat up fast and the result is great, minus the ugly line it leaves.</li>
            <li> I gave this only four stars only because the clips get hot and if you don&#x27;t have them firmly fastened in hair, you can feel some intense heat on your ears.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Advice to keep hot rollers away from sensitive ears and foreheads: I have a few inexpensive men&#x27;s pocket combs.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair down to almost my waist and loved these setters.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely long and thick and I have a problem getting a nice curl to stay in my hair all day long!</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, if you use electric rollers in general, this set is quick, and delivers a firm curl in a reasonably short period of time.</li>
            <li> The rollers are large enough to give bouncy loose curls without ending up looking like a poodle.</li>
            <li> Essentially this is a new innovation in the &#x27;curler market&#x27; (if there is such a thing).  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for any of you out there that long for curls and have been let down from so many other devises.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who like myself has long thick hair and wants to go from straight to curly in minutes.</li>
            <li> only problem I had was one other reviewers have mentioned -- that the clip left a slight \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; at the top of my hair afterward.</li>
            <li> With other hot rollers, you can hold them by the ends or middle, but that isn&#x27;t an option with this model.</li>
            <li> Pass onit other products much nicer and convenient.</li>
            <li> they did heat up fast, but not extremely hot to touch    </li>
            <li> If I blow dry my hair straight, it looks flat.</li>
            <li> The dual heating seals the hair and there is not a single hair out of place.  </li>
            <li> It is a little large, so will be harder to pack when taking on vacation, but really like product.</li>
            <li> I have hair that does NOT like to hold a curl, and conventional curling methods (iron, regular hot rollers) don&#x27;t work well for me -- or they work, but an hour later, my hair looks like I never did a thing to it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The set contains PLENTY of rollers in the larger size, which I generally prefer...</li>
            <li> When I unpacked them and plugged them in for the first time, there were a few rollers on the lower \\&quot;rack\\&quot;that got a melted plastic like substance on them (may be 3 of them).  </li>
            <li> just a slight crimp which I am certain is an issue of technique while using this product</li>
            <li> so they are less slick and grip the hair better and to change the color of the rollers and the storage case to polished jet black with polished hot pink combination accents with hot pink rollers with Jet black hot pink striped clips.</li>
            <li> Generally, I leave my rollers in for 5 short minutes and have curl that lasts an entire day!  </li>
            <li> These are essentially curlers, but instead of just normal plastic clips, they have wide clips with metal that also heats up.  </li>
            <li> A little concerned because of some of the reviews, but ordered it anyway because I wanted the large &amp; med.</li>
            <li> My friend does not use the clips and just bought the large round plastic claw hair clips from a beauty supply store so that she can get a tighter hold</li>
            <li> The curlers do get a little hotter than other rollers do, so you have to work quickly and</li>
            <li> The unit itself is a little large, and as a casual user of hot rollers, I don&#x27;t really like leaving it on my bathroom counter all the time as it takes up a lot of room.</li>
            <li> These might work for someone who is trying to tame unruly curls, but for someone with straight hair, find an alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now addicted to them and use them every other day, I love the look.</li>
            <li> Previous reviewers have complained of creases at the scalp, and I did have 2 or 3 but that can be easily remedied by adjusting the position of the clip.  </li>
            <li> (hair is pretty thick, but not real long).  </li>
            <li> H-2050 set is not only long in length but also in wide in it&#x27;s width AND since the rollers are displayed in a &#x27;stadium type&#x27; arrangement, it&#x27;s also much taller on it&#x27;s highest point than other brands.  </li>
            <li> only minor problem I found with the rollers (</li>
            <li> The clips have flat plates on the insides and nothing to keep them in your hair well.  </li>
            <li> so I gave it to a relative who has long hair and bought this Remington set.</li>
            <li> and then I was flat again.</li>
            <li> There weren&#x27;t quite enough rollers for my whole head, but I have thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any creases, however my curls were too loose to last through the day.  </li>
            <li> If you have a need for loose curls for a short amount of time, this is it!  </li>
            <li> The clip also leaves a big crease in my hair on the upper portion of the hair - not pretty.</li>
            <li> Because of this, the base is a bit larger than other models, but I really don&#x27;t see a better way to design this since the clips are attached to the curlers to be heated simultaneously with the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cons:  Takes up way too much space, hard to use without burning your fingers because the heating contact point is across the length of the roller &amp; I burnt my fingers trying to get my hair onto the roller.  </li>
            <li> Do not be tempted to sit the clip back on the heating element, as it will melt the plastic and cause the clip to get stuck in the closed position</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found if I don&#x27;t leave the rollers in too long</li>
            <li> The extra heat this set provides with the heated clips may be the thing someone with harder to curl hair may need to gain a wave</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t wait that long in the AM</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I did quite a bit of research and decided to start wet setting my hair but the only problem was I looked like I was wearing a curly afro.</li>
            <li> Last week,  after wet setting my hair, I decided to put in the Remington rollers to see what would happen.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, to my waist, and finding rollers to curl it, and have the curls stay in place, is a daunting task.</li>
            <li> So I purchased clips from AMAZON, both for the slipping issue and any potential creasing</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick, straight hair</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars only because the clips do not hold tight enough.</li>
            <li> I READ MANY REVIEWS AND WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL ABOUT BUYING THESE</li>
            <li> and this is VERY minor)</li>
            <li> If I let my hair air dry, and put in the rollers, I get volume.</li>
            <li> My hair does not feel dry at all after using these rollers and that in itself is an advantage.</li>
            <li> my hair did not frizz although I have coarse, thick, naturally curly hair    </li>
            <li> product appears to be well designed and the case is not too big, about a foot wide and a little less deep than that, so storage is not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However* I did find the slick surface on the inside of the clips did not provide as much grip to make tight rolls as clips that had teeth on the ends.</li>
            <li> If my hair doesn&#x27;t loose it&#x27;s volumizing curl in a 12 hour day at the office you can bet</li>
            <li> They are loose and floppy and end up leaving dents in the hair.  </li>
            <li> The cooling time was fast, and I had very little trouble removing them without tangles.</li>
            <li> They were somewhat heavy, but they aren&#x27;t meant to be left in for long.</li>
            <li> only gripe at all is that the on/off switch is hidden on the side of the unit.</li>
            <li> If you have really short hair and need the small size rollers then forget it these rollers are too big.</li>
            <li> There was only a small section left</li>
            <li> So no matter how tight and how well you roll your hair up with these rollers, the clips lack the &#x27;grip&#x27; it would take to hold onto your hair to create long lasting waves or curls in your hair since they will be certain will slip - at least a little afteryou &#x27;clip&#x27; the roller onto your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to find clips that hold that much hair, even in the smallest sections.  </li>
            <li> You will see a curl in as little as five or ten minutes after wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even with the length and texture of my hair, however, I can usually get a decent curl that last as least a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding rollers in a size that actually hold enough of my hair</li>
            <li> They do fall off and get all mixed up if you turn the case sideways or upside down - so just don&#x27;t do that!</li>
            <li> She also complained about the handles to open each clip are too tiny even for her child size hands</li>
            <li> That makes it rough for someone who always worries about leaving something on when leaving the house.  </li>
            <li> And I agree that one should be careful reaching for one lest you burn yourself on an unoccupied slot.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t consider myself inexperienced at this.  </li>
            <li> carefully so you don&#x27;t burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> Pros:  operate with lid closed, on/off switch    </li>
            <li> My hands, fingers, ears and face are raw, especially the palms of my hands and the tips of my fingers.</li>
            <li> In my attempt for a tighter roll, I tried using less hair and the clips just sprung from my head across the room, and almost landed in the toilet where they belong!!!  </li>
            <li> My MAJOR complaint about this set are the darn CLIPS.  </li>
            <li> One other mention</li>
            <li> I purchased these curlers not having any expectation other then them being easier to use because of the clips.</li>
            <li> I did not notice my curls styling in any longer than with other heated roller sets.</li>
            <li> They are a bit cumbersome due to the way they use a clip.</li>
            <li> Handling the rollers/clips can be difficult since they are extremely hot.  </li>
            <li> The clips did not leave lines in my hair like some other curlers and they did not get stuck in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I hate the kind with the little metal pins.</li>
            <li> meaning I got a little body but not really a curl.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair, very, very thick and naturally wavy.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re just not worth it.</li>
            <li> However, even the largest of the rollers is apparrently too small for my wife&#x27;s long hair, and the they are also stiffer than her Conair rollers.  </li>
            <li> Leaving them in for about 10 minutes gives me curl which holds up for about a day and a half.</li>
            <li> I did have to touch those parts up slightly with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> It heats up in less than two minutes</li>
            <li> This heats up in less than 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Others have mentioned the clips crimping the hair, which I can confirm it also slightly does.    </li>
            <li> does not exist on my clips- odd?</li>
            <li> If I could leave less stars than one I would.</li>
            <li> For that main reason, I am sorry</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> and I find it teetering off the edge, very dangerous, especially with the exposed hot metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold the roller tight to the scalp (which would make it nicer)</li>
            <li> so the curls were too tight for me.   </li>
            <li> You can forget about a tight roll.  </li>
            <li> hope you don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and spend your hard earned money on this set of crapola!</li>
            <li> Granted, I have very long (past my waist) hair which is difficult to hold a curl, but even using these on the very ends of my hair was not effective.</li>
            <li> I am not good w flat irons, curling irons or rollers.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the little pack and go types.</li>
            <li> I DO like how this made my hair a little smoother and shinier.  </li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re pink!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my time on these rollers.  </li>
            <li> The clips themselves are relatively heavy, so</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is one of my clips was broken.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled about how wide &amp; tall this set is</li>
            <li> There is a slot in the rollers where they sit firmly on the heating element lengthwise.</li>
            <li> but I personally had not experienced yet).    </li>
            <li> Now that she has used these a while she still thinks the clip handles are slightly too small</li>
            <li> The worst part for me (as with many other reviewers) is that the clip doesn&#x27;t hold the roller.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no way to hold the clasp, or the roller, without seriously burning your hands and fingers.</li>
            <li> NOT COOL GUYS!   </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold the roller tight enough to get a good set--but they also leave you with a nasty crease that&#x27;s virtually impossible to disguise.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not even talking about if there is even a little bit of humidity!</li>
            <li> The rollers themselves are somewhat small in width.</li>
            <li> the metal U shaped clips that usually come with a curler set.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was the clips or the curlers</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in these rollers, they simply didn&#x27;t heat up enough and lost the heat after a couple of minutes!</li>
            <li> I have tried heated rollers in the past, they always pull my hair and the curl</li>
            <li> No more dangling cords!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> about 1-2\\&quot; past my shoulders.    </li>
            <li> Heavy unit!</li>
            <li> Instead, there are 2 small inserts on the clips themselves.</li>
            <li> My hair was smoother than usual and the bounce from the curl stayed in    6.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is avoid the small metal strip.  </li>
            <li> My wife wanted me to revise the review to note that she was wrong about the curlers being too small for her long hair.  </li>
            <li> I was quite doubtful at getting nice curls from this as I have been so disappointed with other brands.  </li>
            <li> These have to be the worst set of hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever owned and unfortunately, the most expensive!  </li>
            <li> I will qualify this by saying that I have exceptionally long hair that is difficult to curl.  </li>
            <li> The clips have a hard time holding onto my hair.  </li>
            <li> like not dealing with metal clips that heat up, are hard to hook on and unhook and store.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I used them at least three times since.  </li>
            <li> At least 10 of my friends bought it</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder length hair and can use almost all 20 rollers.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> My hair went from being fairly long to broken off, really difficult to manage and quite frizzy.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I have to curl very, very small sections at a time, which can take up to an hour and fifteen minutes.  </li>
            <li> We found them just a bit less expensive at Target.</li>
            <li> Also, they heat up in, like, 90 seconds or something ridiculous.</li>
            <li> , I was unable to clip it tight to the scalp.</li>
            <li> instead of ugly solid browns and tans and auto shut off when you forget to unplug it, and maybe a heat selector so pick the heat intensity levels.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very, very thick hair that does not hold curl well...</li>
            <li> So, needless to say, I have hard to curl</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I try I am unable to get curls without the clips creating lines in my hair.  </li>
            <li> If that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, I had some weird crimp mark in each strand where the clip holders were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I need to find a way to keep the curl in my thin hair.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work any worse, either.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating to say the least.  </li>
            <li> only complaint with the Remington H-2050 is that it crimps my style in the worst place.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I was terribly disappointed because of the crimps in my hair caused by the clips.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re no good if you can&#x27;t put them in your hair!</li>
            <li> That being said, I find these rollers slightly difficult to work with.  </li>
            <li> Heated rollers are basically metal with a covering that heat up--nothing complicated about that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning this sad set of rollers and am on a quest to find another set with the metal pins.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I managed to use all of the rollers, however, they failed to stay in place, so they dangled, burning my ears and the side of my face as well.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem enduring painful or uncomfortable procedures in the name of beauty, but this was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> buy these unless you like spending ridiculous amounts of money for bad products.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, the clips are awful.  </li>
            <li> These were yet another disappointment for me.</li>
            <li> I was very wrong in my assumption.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair that was chemically straightened and damaged so badly that I cannot wear my hair</li>
            <li> The bad:  </li>
            <li> the ridge isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these rollers are a real disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I got some atrocious kinks and bends at the roots that I had to recurl with a curling iron to fix.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The clips I purchased were: [[ASIN:B000R87B1Q</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m always losing those stupid pins that come with the set, and the curlers&#x27; ridges can hurt.  </li>
            <li> I cliped them farther around from the base to prevent lines</li>
            <li> /&gt;The curlers are set lengthwise on a heated bar in the base unit.  </li>
            <li> I was SO disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I have owned 6-8 sets of hair rollers in 30 years and these are the worst!</li>
            <li> The clips are worthless!!!  </li>
            <li> It leaves this horrible line in your hair from where the roller sits on the heating element.  </li>
            <li> HORRIBLY!!  </li>
            <li> HORRIBLE.</li>

            <li> The Remington H-2050 Heated Clip Hair Setter is one of THE BEST hair products I&#x27;ve gotten to try in the past five years! My hair is extremely long and thick and I have a problem getting a nice curl to stay in my hair all day long! And this is with the weather cooperating completely, I&#x27;m not even talking about if there is even a little bit of humidity! So, needless to say, I have hard to curl hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love EVERYTHING about this set! The rollers are ready to go in TWO minutes.  The dual heating seals the hair and there is not a single hair out of place.  You get smooth, beautiful, big and bouncy curls in FIVE minutes! FIVE, I&#x27;m NOT kidding! So, even when I&#x27;m in a rush and I want to have a really nice style, it doesn&#x27;t take long at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using the set, I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments and I really couldn&#x27;t be happier!  Even if you&#x27;re on the fence about buying these, I&#x27;d say go for it! I highly recommend these rollers to any and ALL hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I like the fact that there are TWO different size rollers.  The Large and the Extra Large rollers are most beneficial to me because of the length of my hair.  I have a hard time finding rollers in a size that actually hold enough of my hair and I do use ALL the rollers that are provided for each use.  Depending on the length and thickness of your hair, this will obviously vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor problem I found with the rollers (and this is VERY minor) is that the base/case that the rollers are on IS kind of large.  Therefore, it does need to be stored in the closet in my bathroom.  They do take up quite a bit of room to just be left out on the vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the clip, being a dual heating technique, it really heats the hair quickly and when you unroll...absolutely gorgeous! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! Remington is a well-known name that I&#x27;ve come to trust over the years.  Not only for quality, but for value as well!</li>
            <li> These hair rollers work great! I will agree that they do get hot, but, that is what makes them work so well and keeps the curls lasting much longer than other heated rollers I have used! As far as the crimping at the hairline goes, I did not have that problem (maybe it depends on the type of hair of you have), but it seems that a significant amount of others have had it...I would suggest that for those that do encounter this problem, that possibly buying another type of hair clip may solve it? For myself, I think this product works perfect.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the 5th set of electric style rollers that I have owned.  It&#x27;s probably the best, in that it heats up very quickly, which is, after all, why I use this type of product.  It also has the same flaw that most electric rollers have, which no fool proof way of fastening them so that they stay in the hair.  This product has a squeeze clip that fastens over the roller, once it is wrapped with your hair.  It also heats up, to transfer heat to the hair from both the inside and the out.  It also will leave a \\&quot;crease\\&quot; in the lock of hair, from where is clips on.  No way to avoid it.  I use the rollers along with a curling brush, to smooth out the crease in the front, which fixes the problem for me.  Meanwhile, if you use electric rollers in general, this set is quick, and delivers a firm curl in a reasonably short period of time.</li>
            <li> A little concerned because of some of the reviews, but ordered it anyway because I wanted the large &amp; med. rollers with no small.  It is great!  Leaves no mark in my hair (hair is pretty thick, but not real long).  Makes the perfect curl/wave that lasts all day.  It is a little large, so will be harder to pack when taking on vacation, but really like product.</li>
            <li> I bought these last year and I have to say that I haven&#x27;t used them much and I am now searching for a new set of rollers.  I liked the idea of a clip instead of the metal fasteners that most sets use, but they don&#x27;t hold very well.  The clip also leaves a big crease in my hair on the upper portion of the hair - not pretty.</li>
            <li> I have owned 6-8 sets of hair rollers in 30 years and these are the worst! I cannot hold curl well and I had to buy clips to hold the roller in and the case is too large to store! Pass onit other products much nicer and convenient.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my time on these rollers.  The clips are worthless!!!  What good does having metal plates inside the clips do if they won&#x27;t even keep the rollers in place.  Very pood design.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure what would solve the problem is if the clips had some good sized teeth to grab the hair next to the scalp and hang on.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did and spend your hard earned money on this set of crapola!</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I used them a few times so that I had a bit more experience with them before writing a review.  That being said, I find these rollers slightly difficult to work with.  The clips themselves are relatively heavy, so in order not to burn kinks into your hair, you have to make sure to clip from the bottom of the roller and not the side or top, after you have gotten your hair rolled onto it.  Also, I have thick, stick-straight, somewhat coarse hair, and the clips, while moderately effective, do not seem to want to stay on my hair because of the lack of \\&quot;teeth.\\&quot;  While the flocked rollers are nice and fairly grippy, the clips themselves are made of smooth metal and tend to slide off.  Because of this, I have to curl very, very small sections at a time, which can take up to an hour and fifteen minutes.  However, if you can get past the inconvenience, the resultant curls are lovely, large and voluminous.  I could see this working a lot better for a person with normal or fine hair, but for girls with thick or coarser hair, a 1\\&quot; large-barrel curling iron would be much faster.  Additionally, the entire apparatus is kind of large (about the width of 1 1/2 toasters and half the height), so storing it can be a bit of a hassle if you don&#x27;t have a lot of space.  In the end, there are definitely pros/cons, and while I wouldn&#x27;t choose it again for myself, it might work for someone else.</li>
            <li> (As related by Lori Buxman) The Remington Rollers are a real timesaver in the morning.  They heat up very quickly and are ready to use in no time at all.  The quantity of rollers is great as my hair is thick and long and I can curl it all at once.  The roller clips grip well, are easy to put in my hair and to take out.  Generally, I leave my rollers in for 5 short minutes and have curl that lasts an entire day!  The presentation of the rollers is attractive on a counter. I would highly recommend these rollers to family, friends and anyone looking for a timesaving, effective roller.</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers for my Mother&#x27;s birthday present.  She couldn&#x27;t be happier.  They are easy to use and hold the heat very well.  She has arthritus in her hands but found the clips simple to handle.</li>
            <li> These rollers work for my hair/ I have long, fine hair. They get hot fast.  The clips are easy to use. They don&#x27;t hold the roller tight to the scalp (which would make it nicer) but they do hold and produce nice results. The key is to start in the back and/or sides, doing the top, front sections last, so rollers don&#x27;t flop forward. I have curly hair that was chemically straightened and damaged so badly that I cannot wear my hair \\&quot;natural\\&quot; anymore. I am not good w flat irons, curling irons or rollers. These are easy for me to use and makes my hair soft and healthy looking again. i don&#x27;t know what I would do w my hair if I didn&#x27;t have ionic rollers. It takes me an extra 15 mins in the morn to do my hair.. which is fine by me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe these rollers are best suited for those w average-thickness hair, but not someone w thick hair-- I don&#x27;t think the clips would hold well. The rollers themselves are somewhat small in width. so again, might not be the best for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> The curlers are great.  I have thick shoulder length hair and can use almost all 20 rollers.  I love the flocked roller, so much easier on my hair, they never pull.  I have not used clips like this before, but after a couple of times to get used to them I find them equally soft on the hair.  The curlers do heat up quite quickly, which I consider a plus.  Leaving them in for about 10 minutes gives me curl which holds up for about a day and a half. I do not find the clips too hot to handle at all, I pull the roller off the heating element using the clip handle, place the roller on the counter and unclip the clip again using the handle.  Roll up the hair and reclip.  Of course you shouldn&#x27;t touch the exposed heating element in the curler, I would think that would be obvious.   I think the product is great.  It does have a rather large base, so if that matters to you, like if you intend to store this in a vanity drawer, measure first to make sure it will fit.  One other mention, I purchased an \\&quot;ionized\\&quot; hairbrush which is supposed to help make hair smoother and softer and darn if it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I really liked this set.  I have had many, many hot curlers over the years and was thrilled when I got a chance to review a set.  My curls came out soft and bouncy and very natural.  The heated clips was a plus, added to the quickness of the set.  The had a really good grip and did not fall out like the metal U shaped clips that usually come with a curler set.  I have medium length hair, very, very thick and naturally wavy.  It is very hard to find clips that hold that much hair, even in the smallest sections.  I ordered clips from many places and found they weren&#x27;t strong enough and after a minute of so, starting slipping out of my hair.  These clips did not do it.  I am not sure if it was the clips or the curlers but if you are looking for a good set of hot curlers, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I have hair that does NOT like to hold a curl, and conventional curling methods (iron, regular hot rollers) don&#x27;t work well for me -- or they work, but an hour later, my hair looks like I never did a thing to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the Remington rollers with the heated clips definitely give me a lasting curl! My hair after using them can only be dubbed \\&quot;Texas-sized.\\&quot; I thought maybe it would settle down a bit in an hour or two, but no ... it remained HUGE! So definitely believe the instructions when they tell you to only leave them in for a couple of minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the rollers easy to use, once I got the hang of putting them in without burning my fingers. They were somewhat heavy, but they aren&#x27;t meant to be left in for long. (Incidentally, I think it&#x27;s great that this set has so many rollers! I have really thick hair, and most sets have nowhere near enough for my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was one other reviewers have mentioned -- that the clip left a slight \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; at the top of my hair afterward. I did have to touch those parts up slightly with a curling iron. It wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, but it did keep this from being a fie-star product.</li>
            <li> For those of you having problems with the creases it makes on your hair, try curling the hair so that the curler is verticle, not horizontal.  My daughter was not happy with our first try when I curled it horizontally, but was pleased with the second attempt when I used them vertically.</li>
            <li> I was quite doubtful at getting nice curls from this as I have been so disappointed with other brands.  I was very wrong in my assumption.  I have stick straight hair and the curlers from this gave me wonderfully beautiful curls that lasted quite a bit longer than I could have possibly hoped for.  The curlers are a bit on the warm side when handling but other than that I am more than satisfied.  I would recommend this for any of you out there that long for curls and have been let down from so many other devises.  A great product that will pay for itself in no time.  A+++ in my book for something that I will treasure for quite some time to come.  Now I have wonderus hair.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the easiest to use, but once you get a hang of it they work very well.  They get hot fast and do make great curls.  Now I need to find a way to keep the curl in my thin hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers this morning and am very pleased with the result.  They heat up quickly, didn&#x27;t burn my fingers or my head, and put big bouncy curls in my poker-straight hair.  Previous reviewers have complained of creases at the scalp, and I did have 2 or 3 but that can be easily remedied by adjusting the position of the clip.  It only took a few minutes to smooth that out with a curling iron - easy peasy.    I would definitely buy these again; the only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 instead of 5 stars is b/c they cost more than I originally wanted to spend.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers are not the best but not the worset.     Pros....They heat up fast and do not take long at all to get curls in your hair.  They come with two sizes of curlers which allows you to have some creativity.  There is 10 of each size which allows you to have enough of just one size curl if that is the look you are after.  The curls last all day as long as you allow them to cool before running your fingers through them and of course stay away from brushing them unless you want to relax them to just soft body.     Cons....No matter how hard I try I am unable to get curls without the clips creating lines in my hair.  While I have read some reviews that you can fix this with touching up with a straight iron I refuse to spend money on a hot roller set that does not allow me to fix my hair with speed.  Not to mention the added damage drying my hair, curling with the hot rollers and then having to use a flat iron.  That does not seem convenient to me nor healthy for my hair.      Bottom line....while they work if you do not want lines in your hair left by clips then keep looking for another hot roller set.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in these rollers, they simply didn&#x27;t heat up enough and lost the heat after a couple of minutes! Granted, I have very long (past my waist) hair which is difficult to hold a curl, but even using these on the very ends of my hair was not effective. By the time I left the house before work the curl was totally gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning these pronto.</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers because they were streamlined, there were a lot of them and I have a lot of hair.  Like other reviewers, I was terribly disappointed because of the crimps in my hair caused by the clips.  I tried using wire prong fasteners from an older set of hot rollers, but the sizes weren&#x27;t right and the rollers just fell out.  Very frustrating to say the least.  Also, the heat source is not the roller itself, but the clamp that has a metal sheath inside that heats up.  These have to be the worst set of hot rollers I&#x27;ve ever owned and unfortunately, the most expensive!  Do not buy these!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these heated hair rollers. They&#x27;re easy to use, my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught or torn in them, and they leave my hair shiny and wavy. The entire product is well-designed. The &#x27;stadium seating&#x27; design makes it easy to remove or return rollers without burning your fingers. The clips are easy to use and don&#x27;t rip my hair. The unit itself is a little large, and as a casual user of hot rollers, I don&#x27;t really like leaving it on my bathroom counter all the time as it takes up a lot of room. However, if I were curling my hair every day, I&#x27;d make room for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe at all is that the on/off switch is hidden on the side of the unit. I am more of an intuitive user than a manual reader, so I plugged the unit in and waited. And waited. It never heated. I was SO disappointed! I didn&#x27;t see a switch on the front or back, so I unplugged it and tried another outlet. Same outcome. Only then did I consult the manual. Oops, there was an on/off switch, but located on the side!</li>
            <li> The good:  - Strong tight curls faster than any curlers I&#x27;ve used before.  - The clips hold the curlers in place.  - There are enough curlers to do an entire head of hair in one \\&quot;batch.\\&quot;  - The curlers heat up quickly.  - The product is not overpackaged -- nice for us tree-huggers.    The bad:  - The curlers aren&#x27;t very big so the curls were too tight for me.   - Although the clips grip the hair well, they do leave dents, particularly on the top of my head. (I have fine hair.)  - The curlers heat up in a couple of minutes, but they continue to get hotter.  - There is no automatic shut-off. That makes it rough for someone who always worries about leaving something on when leaving the house.  - I had to pick up each curler by its clip, squeeze the clip to release the curler onto the counter, and then pick up the curler from the counter. The clip on the curler in the unit makes it look neat and tidy, but it adds an extra step.  - The heating elements are obviously quite hot, but they are also easily accessible by little fingers. They are not recessed very far. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want this product around children.   - The unit is very large and takes up a good part of a bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> The clips have a hard time holding onto my hair.  I have very fine hair and these clips aren&#x27;t tight enough to hold it.  The clips are smooth and I really need something with teeth to hang on.  I also don&#x27;t care for the lines left in my hair from the plates on the clips.  I want my hair curled, not crimped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is big, too.  Takes up more counter space than I have available in the bathroom and I find it teetering off the edge, very dangerous, especially with the exposed hot metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like that these heated up fast and I will continue to use them, but only leave them in a couple minutes before the crimp lines start to set in.  I also like the flocked roller.  I just wish they&#x27;d had the whole clip covered with the plate so it wouldn&#x27;t leave the lines in my hair and I wish they&#x27;d find a way to make a smaller unit.</li>
            <li> The Remington H-2050 is just OK.  Yes, it heats fast, but the clips leave \\&quot;ridges\\&quot; in my hair which are very unsightly. This is something I would have wanted to know before I purchased this model. If anyone has some helpful info that could eliminate this problem, I would be happy to know.  Should I just return it to Amazon?</li>
            <li> First the good news: These rollers set your hair fast and they&#x27;re easy to use.    Now the other new: The plastic heated clips, which you would think are some magic technology, are in fact just hot plastic.  They can be *really* hot plastic.  I had mine plugged in for about 10 minutes and the clips started **melting**.  To Remington&#x27;s credit, they&#x27;re probably not too toxic, because they didn&#x27;t smell like a lot of melting plastic does.  But they were the consistency of peanut butter.    I called Remington and they said I shouldn&#x27;t have the rollers plugged in for more than 15 minutes.  I didn&#x27;t see that in the instruction leaflet anywhere.  Also apparently they have to be very precisely placed on the rails.  Nice to know, also not in the booklet.    A couple of simple design features, such as an LED not just for power but one that changed color or blinked when hot, and, hey! here&#x27;s a concept for appliances that get hot: an automatic shutoff, would be a nice tweak to future editions of this product.    I&#x27;ll be looking around before deciding whether to get them again.</li>
            <li> I READ MANY REVIEWS AND WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL ABOUT BUYING THESE BUT I MUST SAY THAT I AM SO GLAD I DID. I LIVE IN A VERY HUMID AREA AND MY OLD ROLLER CURLED MY HAIR BUT THE CURLS WOULD NOT LAST. I DON&#x27;T HAVE THAT PROBLEM WITH THESE. I FOUND THEM EASY TO USE AND I DID NOT BURN MY FINGERS. THE CURLS LASTED ALL DAY EVEN IN THE RAIN AND HUMIDITY. THIS WAS A GOOD PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my way back to return these!  I thought I&#x27;d like it since there were 20 curlers and not my regular 12.  After trying repeatedly, THE CURLERS WON&#x27;T STAY IN MY HAIR....they just dangle.  There is nothing holding hair into place.  I&#x27;d give 0 stars if there was a place for it!.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a pair of hot rollers, but after reading all the reviews I decided to jump on it and try something new. They really work, and I agree with most reviewers it does leave a mark on your hair, no big deal but it&#x27;s there. I&#x27;m now addicted to them and use them every other day, I love the look. What I also love about them is the fact that they heat up quick, and really within minutes you have curls! It&#x27;s truly amazing. And the quantity is perfect for me, I don&#x27;t have much hair though, but if you would need more just do them by section, remember it only takes 5-10minutes to get curls.    I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They really helped hold curl in my naturally straight hair. Warmed up in about 10 minutes and left in for about 10 to 15. Didn&#x27;t get too hot, but still warm enough. I would definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> I read about 75 reviews of these rollers before I purchased them.  The cons stated the rollers and clips were too hot, and would burn their fingers/hands.  My retort:  these are heated rollers with heated clips.  Handle with care!  I have not even come close to burning myself, and I absolutely love these rollers.  The heated clips are such a great idea, curling the hair that usually gets very little actual heat.  The rollers are smooth and I have yet to get one tangled in my long hair.  The stated warm-up time is 90 seconds, but I found a full 2 minutes worked a little better(!) and the curls are set in about 5.  How can you argue with that? Overall, these rollers are convenient, fast, and I LOVE the way they sit in the case.</li>
            <li> Good head, like the soft surface but the clips leave ridges in your hair that you have to straighten out with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was searching for heated rollers and this product came up. They had this product priced low, I thought it must have been an error, but I did think that if something was posted as being available for a certain price on Amazon that they would be obliged to honor it.       They didn&#x27;t.     They sent me a tube of hand cream as a &#x27;consolation&#x27; instead (uh?) and a check for the amount I had paid to Amazon.   NOT COOL GUYS!   If you made the error and didn&#x27;t &#x27;proof&#x27; your pages you should be prepared to have people buy at the price you offered it at.    I will not buy from such a company now.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this set of rollers, but they didn&#x27;t impress me.  I will qualify this by saying that I have exceptionally long hair that is difficult to curl.  Even with the length and texture of my hair, however, I can usually get a decent curl that last as least a couple of hours.  With these rollers my curl looked beautiful when I first took them out, and then it completely fell out within minutes.  I was really disappointed.  Maybe someone with shorter, less difficult hair would have better luck, but for someone with difficult to curl hair, this product is not the best solution.  (It seems sleeping on sponge rollers is still the best solution for us.)</li>
            <li> I purchased these curlers not having any expectation other then them being easier to use because of the clips. I never expected them to actually make a difference on how long the curl holds in my hair.  With my old hot rollers, I would curl my hair and by the time I got to the office, every last curl had come out and my hair would be straight.  Well I used these and my curls lasted over 24 hours!  And that was after sleeping with them and going out on a very humid day.      I am very impressed.  I hope they continue to work so well!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these rollers. We found them just a bit less expensive at Target. I have tried heated rollers in the past, they always pull my hair and the curl never lasts, no matter how much hair spray you use.   I got these and they&#x27;re so easy to use. The holders are heated too, which I think is what makes your curl last forever. I put them in my hair, do my make up, and take them out. I spray with hair spray and I&#x27;m set. If my hair doesn&#x27;t loose it&#x27;s volumizing curl in a 12 hour day at the office you can bet this is a safe purchase. I&#x27;ll never go back to anything else. Also, they heat up in, like, 90 seconds or something ridiculous. My stamp of approval is with the Remington T-Sudio Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers with Tourmaline!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this set a year ago from a retail store.  Unfortunately, these rollers are a real disappointment.  As other reviewers have said, the clips are awful.  They don&#x27;t hold the roller tight enough to get a good set--but they also leave you with a nasty crease that&#x27;s virtually impossible to disguise.  I did try these rollers with other clips (both jaw clips and traditional wire clips), but they don&#x27;t really fit right.  Overall, I do not recommend this roller set to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was excited about these when I bought them.  Having the clips heated sounded like a great idea.  Well, I&#x27;ve used them several times now and have decided not to use them again.  The clips have flat plates on the insides and nothing to keep them in your hair well.  Because of this, the curlers slide out of my hair over and over again.  Also the clips leave real dents in my hair, not just minor ones.  With all that and the room they take up they&#x27;re just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair down to almost my waist and loved these setters. I have several different setters but really liked the clips on this one. My friend does not use the clips and just bought the large round plastic claw hair clips from a beauty supply store so that she can get a tighter hold but I didn&#x27;t have that problem at all. I use the smaller rollers on the top of my head and the larger ones on the bottom, it came out beautiful and full for my photo shoot. I really like the idea of a heated clip to help set the curls. I cliped them farther around from the base to prevent lines and I used a setting spray (hairspray works too) before rolling them and my curls lasted all day. I might purchase a second set for those days I want smaller curls and can roll smaller section but for the most part I really like this product.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: My wife wanted me to revise the review to note that she was wrong about the curlers being too small for her long hair.  Now that she has used these a while she still thinks the clip handles are slightly too small but she likes the variety of sizes and still maintains that these ceramic curlers work faster and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the guy who waits for her to get her hair done and is put in the position of judging the ultimate results so we can get out the door on time, I can attest to the fact that her curls look much better and are more durable when using these ceramic curlers (what the hell has marriage turned me into that I think of these things?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff.  Rather decent Christmas gift I imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In considering this product you should know that the rollers and clips are successively smaller towards the back.  However, even the largest of the rollers is apparrently too small for my wife&#x27;s long hair, and the they are also stiffer than her Conair rollers.  She also complained about the handles to open each clip are too tiny even for her child size hands (she&#x27;s 5&#x27; tall and only about 100 lbs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the ceramic rollers with ceramic clip combination do a far better job of curling her hair, and faster to boot--which I, as her husband who is typically waiting by the door while she gets ready, very much appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: I predict that she&#x27;ll try these at least a few more times and either prefer them or dump &#x27;em.  Overall, they&#x27;re far better rollers than the ones she already had, but she has an issue primarily with their small size and ill-conceived clip handle design.</li>
            <li> I have a modern bob but I like to spice it up with volume and curls on my stubborn straight hair. I used Caruso curlers and they work but THOSE really burned my hands with steam and was so messy that I tossed them in the corner and started trying Hot Rollers. I got the Pro Ion Ceramic Instant Heat first and it did ok but the set I got had all Jumbo and Large so I gave it to a relative who has long hair and bought this Remington set. It heats up faster than the Pro one and is not messy.   The heated clips make ALL the difference and the curl on my very straight hair with no perm was AWESOME and you need to GET SOME!!!   You only have to heat them up for 2 minutes and they are ready to go and the curl was at least 1/3 more than with the Pro Ion set. It is neat and tidy with the clips on each roller and so it was faster to do too!   The rollers are large and medium.....no Jumbos. If you have long hair just use all the large on the top of the head and use the medium under and you should turn out fabulous because you can always brush thru it to loosen the curl or take your fingers thru it a few more times so the roller sizes should not be a problem for long hair. If you have really short hair and need the small size rollers then forget it these rollers are too big. It would be nice if they sold small and Jumbo to use in it though.   I LOVE this set and it even has a space in the back to store the cord.   The only things I can think of that would make this set better is to add a few grip dots on the clips surface so they are less slick and grip the hair better and to change the color of the rollers and the storage case to polished jet black with polished hot pink combination accents with hot pink rollers with Jet black hot pink striped clips. instead of ugly solid browns and tans and auto shut off when you forget to unplug it, and maybe a heat selector so pick the heat intensity levels. Conair Infiniti Nano Silver Ion ceramic is my SECOND choice but if Conair had heated clips like Remington did on that Nano Silver then you know it would be my first choice as Nano Silver is THE best technology now but without heated clips it is the same 1/3 less curl results same as the Pro Ion Ceramic but just lasts a bit longer than the Pro. Remington with the heated clips and the Ion Ceramic with wax core is still the BEST now.     Hope this helps you&#x27;all! ENJOY!!</li>
            <li> This heated curler set is simple and it works wonderfully. Even if you are a beginner, this product is quite fun and easy to use. Its a very nice-looking set too, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you turn on the switch, the set heats up very quickly. The velvet on the surface of the curlers coax the hair around the roll nicely and the clips grab without pulling, even if you are clumsy like me. I find that my curls hold beautifully after only 10 minutes and my hair looks shinier, and they last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case itself is large, with a translucent plastic hinged lid that has no latch. At first I thought the clips felt hot but its managable. It heats up in less than two minutes so I would recommend that you do not leave it unattended for a long time while pre-heating to be safe. I think its a very well-made and fun set, and I would highy recommend it.</li>
            <li> Pro:    Heat up real fast and easy to use.  Curls last pretty long.    Con:    Bulky and sometimes leaves a crimp line on your hair if you don&#x27;t position your curls right.</li>
            <li> They are really good curlers.  At first I didn&#x27;t think they got hot enough (I had some curler&#x27;s from the 90&#x27;s) but even though they don&#x27;t seem to get too hot, they do a great job on my hair.  And they only take 90 seconds to heat up, which is really good on those busy weekday mornings.  Also, they only take five minutes to curl my hair.  I&#x27;m glad I got them!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that is straight on top, and curly/wavy on the bottom. If I blow dry my hair straight, it looks flat. If I let my hair air dry, and put in the rollers, I get volume. I bought these at Target this weekend for $35. I used them once, and 3 people commented on how different and nice my hair looks. They are easy to use. I only need about 5 rollers for my hair. One tip: I had some fly away hairs that I went over with my curling iron to smooth out. These are a great solution for a busy working mom, like me, who doesn&#x27;t have much time to get ready in the morning!</li>
            <li> Okay, the truth is out: I&#x27;m an old school electric curler girl.  I need body and bounce in my stick straight hair, and there&#x27;s nothing like electric curlers to give my hair some movement.  However, I&#x27;m always losing those stupid pins that come with the set, and the curlers&#x27; ridges can hurt.  No pain, no gain, right?  But that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m head over heals -- er, curls -- for this set.  The curlers are soft, the clips attach directly to the curlers in the storage unit so you won&#x27;t lose them, but most importantly, my hair looked great!  I put the curlers all over my head, and took them out again as soon as I&#x27;d finished curling the strand.  So in what -- 90 seconds maybe? -- I had the soft wavy curls that I love.  Fast, easy, convenient.  Whoo-hoo!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this hot roller set is that the rollers sit horizontally in the case, not vertically like traditional sets. The rollers have a slit that let them sit across a heating element bar.  This slit means that extra care is needed when rolling hair. If the ends of your hair slip into the slit, it leaves a crease.  The second oddity about the rollers is the clips - they have two metal plates inside. These plates are similar to the material used in straightening irons, and they help heat the curl from the outside.  That&#x27;s the basic concept here: Your curls are heated from the inside (curler) and the outside (clip) simultaneously.  This results in curls \\&quot;setting up\\&quot; more quickly, because the heat is distributed more rapidly.  My daughter and I both used the rollers multiple times. Her hair is more course and curly than mine, and she had lovely results. Her results were noticeably better with this set than with my standard hot rollers.  On my hair, I didn&#x27;t  notice any better results, just quicker results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution, because curler placement is important, rolling takes a little longer at first. Do not be tempted to sit the clip back on the heating element, as it will melt the plastic and cause the clip to get stuck in the closed position (an X-acto knife will fix the problem, but it&#x27;s best to avoid it). Also, since the clips are heated, they get hot on the edges and require some careful handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with these hair rollers. They take up a bit more space on my vanity, but after a few uses, I&#x27;ve put my old set into the yard sale box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice to keep hot rollers away from sensitive ears and foreheads: I have a few inexpensive men&#x27;s pocket combs.  After clipping the roller in place, I slip one of these between the roller and my skin to keep the heat away from my ears.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and shoulder length.  It always gets frizzy when I use curling irons - there was no frizz, just a slight crimp which I am certain is an issue of technique while using this product and I am working on fixing this - but my ends are smooth and the hair has a little shine.      Very happy with this Remington product.  Rebus</li>
            <li> As heated roller sets go, I&#x27;d give this one a thumbs up. The rollers are large enough to give bouncy loose curls without ending up looking like a poodle. The set heats up quickly and curls hair fast--I get the curls I want in 10 minutes maximum. There are two negatives in my opinion. First, this set is big! If you&#x27;re short on counter or dresser space, this is not for you. Also, the type of clip does leave a ridge in hair. The clips are generally a good idea, and the rollers stay in pretty well--but I think clips with teeth would be a lot better. I&#x27;ve found if I don&#x27;t leave the rollers in too long the ridge isn&#x27;t too bad. But like every heated roller set I&#x27;ve ever owned, the top of head rollers just don&#x27;t stay in. Teeth on the clips might help this problem too. As for the \\&quot;new technology,\\&quot; who knows? Sounds like a lot of babble to me. Heated rollers are basically metal with a covering that heat up--nothing complicated about that. But overall, these work better than most.</li>
            <li> Okay, let me start off by saying, these are GREAT for girl time at home.. My girls and I don&#x27;t wear curlers every day, but when we do makeup, nails, facials, etc. these are so fun to use! And they&#x27;re pink!!! (kind of a mauve) They heat up quickly just as the description says. The curlers stay in nicely and are pretty comfortable. We love the curls that come up, but it took us a little practice in rolling them so that a funky hairstyle wasn&#x27;t the result!     Anyway, I highly recommend these curlers. Great quality, great curls, lots of fun!</li>
            <li> This the the very best set I have ever used. I love the case it comes in, I love the clips they hold my hair well. The heat is perfect and I have long lasting curls. I highly recommend this to anyone who like myself has long thick hair and wants to go from straight to curly in minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought these per the reviews that said how wonderful these rollers were.  I am so disappointed.  It leaves this horrible line in your hair from where the roller sits on the heating element.  I thought it was a great idea having hot clips as well as the roller, but because of that, the rollers sit in the base on a line, which produces the line in the hair.  The do heat up fast and the result is great, minus the ugly line it leaves.</li>
            <li> This product worked just fine to curl my hair but I did not notice any difference in the curls made with this roller set versus one which does not have heated clips. It didn&#x27;t work any worse, either. These type of clips are way easier to use than the metal wire U shaped clips may sets have. *However* I did find the slick surface on the inside of the clips did not provide as much grip to make tight rolls as clips that had teeth on the ends. By pinning my hair up 1st then rolling the underside 1st, the middle part second, and the top part last, I find each roller sits on top of the last roller and avoids any problems of rollers slipping out. By placing the clips on the rollers so the opening was upwards and the pinch part of the clip was downwards, I avoided the line that many others have mentioned the rollers leaving in their hair but you do have to make sure you got it just right first. The extra heat this set provides with the heated clips may be the thing someone with harder to curl hair may need to gain a wave but my hair curls easily. *Longevity* of my curls has always been my problem. I did not notice my curls styling in any longer than with other heated roller sets. Just my two cents.</li>
            <li> The good, the bad, the beautiful: Let me start by saying I keep trying to use hot rollers, never with much success unless I use them on someone other than myself. These were no different. They are a bit cumbersome due to the way they use a clip. It takes a bit of dexterity to open and clip them while juggling a hank of unruly hair, unlike slide-on types. And I agree that one should be careful reaching for one lest you burn yourself on an unoccupied slot. I also could not get the clips just right, I was unable to clip it tight to the scalp. Now keep in mind that all the above could be the USER and not the PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;On the good side, my hair seemed silkier and way less &#x27;fried&#x27; using these. The unit is all pro, and quite large, which means it will delight any woman who is a salon-owner-wanna-be. If you use them every day, make sure you have the counter space. These aren&#x27;t the little pack and go types. If you take your hair seriously, and already do well with rollers, these are GREAT. If you are a bit of a hair-challenged dork like me, stick with a cheap set.</li>
            <li> I love this!  Works great and is so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big selling point for me is IT HEATS UP FAST!  My old unit takes FOREVER to heat up.  I just can&#x27;t wait that long in the AM so I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time.  This heats up in less than 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more than enough rollers for my hair and I found it easy to wrap my hair around them.  My hair doesn&#x27;t snag on these rollers at all.  The clips hold my hair perfectly and after about 10 minutes I take everything off, I spray my hair and I have a head of beautiful bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this thing is going to last for a long time as it&#x27;s very well made and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, there&#x27;s no way I can keep it on my bathroom counter.  It takes up a bit more space than I have free.  So, I set it up on a shelf and that works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate having a space in the back of the unit for the plug.  No more dangling cords!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product 2 years ago and still use it now and then.  The smooth rollers are comfortable to grip w/o over heating your hair and fingers.  The rollers form a medium curl and the clip helps smooth out frizzies.  I give this product 4 stars only because the clips do not hold tight enough. I find them easy to loosen or fall out even if I am sitting still. I have long, thick, wavy hair so the roller clips may hold thinner hair better; although, that may be the ones that end up with the crease.</li>
            <li> My 11 year-old daughter wanted these for Christmas.  We&#x27;ve been so impressed with how quickly they heat up, and how quickly they curl your hair! My daughter has very, very thick hair that does not hold curl well...and these rollers do the trick.  Awesome purchase!</li>
            <li> OUCH! The label states that the ends of the curlers get hotter than normal.  IT IS RIGHT! These go back! The ends are so hot, I got blisters on my 1st use. They do a ncie job curling and leave a shine. They&#x27;re no good if you can&#x27;t put them in your hair! I really wanted them to work, but can&#x27;t take the pain.</li>
            <li> This is a really good item for med-thick hair.  My hair is fine and they seem to move around alot.  They heat really well.  The only issue I have is one of my clips was broken.  There is no where on site to just reqt a new clip and I couldn&#x27;t send back because I needed for my daughter&#x27;s dance recital.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair does not take a curl no matter what product or tools I use. This hair setter set, along with some product, actually set my hair! My hair set in about 7 minutes. I had nice full, bouncy waves that lasted the entire day. The curlers heat up quickly, and are easy to use (even for someone who doesn&#x27;t use curlers more than once a year). Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been rolling, curling, straightening and styling my hair in some way, shape or form for over 20 years so I don&#x27;t consider myself inexperienced at this.  Since I was in the market to purchase some new hair styling products, I was thrilled when this was offered to me from the Vine program.    Remington claims that with their &#x27;titanium tourmaline ionic conditioning&#x27; that it will seal your hair cuticle to repel humidity &amp; static for &#x27;incredible&#x27; lasting frizz free shine.  I have used them about 10 times now and I still have not found that it repels humidity.  I have fairly thick, straight hair about 1-2\\&quot; past my shoulders.    Pros:  Unlike some other brands, EACH hair roller came with it&#x27;s own clip.  The rollers &amp; clips heat up FAST.  Mfg claims it heats up in 90 seconds and I&#x27;d have to agree.  The rollers are &#x27;coated&#x27; with velvet so that the part that touches your hair is gentle on it.  The set contains PLENTY of rollers in the larger size, which I generally prefer...it has a total of 20 rollers...8 medium ( 1\\&quot;) rollers and 12 large rollers ( 1 1/4\\&quot;).  Perhaps it&#x27;s the tourmaline in the rollers but I do think that it made my hair a SMIDGE (so minute that only I noticed) shinier.  It has a cord storage compartment so your cord won&#x27;t be left dangling everywhere.    CONS:  The entire unit is BIG for storage.  Most other mfgs make the unit so that it&#x27;s longer in length but slimmer in width.  This Remington TStudio  H-2050 set is not only long in length but also in wide in it&#x27;s width AND since the rollers are displayed in a &#x27;stadium type&#x27; arrangement, it&#x27;s also much taller on it&#x27;s highest point than other brands.  So for those who prefer to store their hair roller sets under their sink, in  a drawer or in a cabinet of some sort, the height of this set may be an issue for storage.  I found no benefit except a visual appeal of having this set designed so &#x27;tall&#x27;.  I have a basket underneath my vanity in which I store my hair rollers, curling iron, straightener, hair dryer, etc.  With my older hair roller set, I stored it on the bottom - the first layer in the basket with my hair styling equipment.  I can&#x27;t do that with this one and have everything LOOK organized as much as nothing will lay flat on the top cover because it&#x27;s slanted.    As much as I wanted to LOVE this set, the most important reason for using hair rollers is so that it will give your hair body...whatever style you are trying to achieve...this set has never held the shape in my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried both the medium &amp; large rollers, I&#x27;ve tried heating it up for longer, leaving them in for longer and for some reason, the shape and body just won&#x27;t hold as long.  (I have a theory that I will include below.)    One of my 2 largest complaints about this product is the fact that since the clips get HOT, someone in the design department forgot to coat / layer the top of the clips with some sort of coating or substance that would not heat up as hot as the rollers.  I&#x27;m not a wimp...I&#x27;ve burned myself a jillion times from VERY HOT curling irons but sheesh, you figure when the rollers are IN your hair, you shouldn&#x27;t have to tilt your head from side to side because the HOT clips are burning the tips of your ears, your cheekbone, your cheek, etc.  I found that using this set has not saved me time because I use the rollers on one side of my head at a time so I can tilt my head a bit while I put on my makeup so it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.      My MAJOR complaint about this set are the darn CLIPS.  I can&#x27;t imagine why in the world a company would design and manufacture hair clips that are SMOOTH?  There are absolutely no teeth, no spikes, no rubber (not that I&#x27;d want warm or hot &#x27;rubber&#x27; on my hair) at all to HOLD ONTO or grip your hair.  So no matter how tight and how well you roll your hair up with these rollers, the clips lack the &#x27;grip&#x27; it would take to hold onto your hair to create long lasting waves or curls in your hair since they will be certain will slip - at least a little afteryou &#x27;clip&#x27; the roller onto your hair.  I&#x27;ve tried and tried to establish a good grip and no matter what, it always slips an inch or two at minimum after I&#x27;ve let go.    I have not yet experienced the &#x27;bend&#x27; in your hair like some other reveiwers have so I can&#x27;t comment on that except to say that I personally have had smooth curls or waves when I first release my hair from the rollers.    If I had to purchase these, I personally would not be happy with this set mainly because of how the clips have no &#x27;grip&#x27; in them and how uncomfortable they are when they are in my hair.  I&#x27;m not thrilled about how wide &amp; tall this set is but that&#x27;s something that I could manage to live with if I really loved this set.  I think if Remington simply redesigned their clips then it would be a pretty decent set. (Remington: perhaps you would design some different clips for those of us who would love to have an option for clips that grip your hair?)  For that main reason, I am sorry but I simply can&#x27;t give this product a GREAT rating.    With that said, I realize that reviewers here don&#x27;t have qualms about the clips (although I cannot understand why) so if you think you&#x27;d be able to manage or tolerate the clips and you only want waves (not curls) in your hair, then you may like this set a lot.  I DO like how this made my hair a little smoother and shinier.  My hair does not feel dry at all after using these rollers and that in itself is an advantage.</li>
            <li> I bought these and I think they suck. My hair stayed curly for maybe an hour (yes, I used hairspray). If that wasn&#x27;t bad enough, I had some weird crimp mark in each strand where the clip holders were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I had a set of curlers with the metal pins that held the rollers in place. I&#x27;m returning this sad set of rollers and am on a quest to find another set with the metal pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy these unless you like spending ridiculous amounts of money for bad products.</li>
            <li> These are essentially curlers, but instead of just normal plastic clips, they have wide clips with metal that also heats up.  Allowing in theory a faster curl, and potentially a better curl.    In practice it somewhat holds up.  The biggest downside being that they seem to get hotter than normal curlers.  Handling the rollers/clips can be difficult since they are extremely hot.  Others have mentioned the clips crimping the hair, which I can confirm it also slightly does.    Essentially this is a new innovation in the &#x27;curler market&#x27; (if there is such a thing).  Slightly better than a gimmick, but still room for improvement and refinement.</li>
            <li> I have extremely straight hair. I have tried many products to put life, bounce and curl into my hair. These were yet another disappointment for me. They worked ok...meaning I got a little body but not really a curl. The body lasted about 2 hours and then I was flat again. (just as an FYI...I have had professional body waves that do not take at all)&lt;br /&gt;So, my point is, These rollers work but if you have hair like mine which resists all change then keep looking.</li>
            <li> Really looked forward to receiving these rollers, but they get TOO HOT!!!  Burned the tips of my fingers and the clips don&#x27;t hold rollers securely to hair.  They are loose and floppy and end up leaving dents in the hair.  Very disappointed in this product.  Will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I just spend an hour in the store looking at all the roller sets and sizes.  I thought I had chosen the best set to achieve what I wanted.  I specifically bought rollers to add volume to my straight, somewhat fine hair.  I went straight home and watched a bunch of youtube videos to make sure I knew how to roll without looking like I was from the 50s.  Then, I went at it.  Yes, I achieved some nice bounce and curls with this set.  But what I really wanted, I got none of; volume.  Instead, I got some atrocious kinks and bends at the roots that I had to recurl with a curling iron to fix.  That&#x27;s what I was trying to avoid!  So I&#x27;m heading back to the store to return this crappy set and get the kind with more of a claw clip....I hate the kind with the little metal pins.</li>
            <li> The Remington Heated clip hair set is wonderful! It&#x27;s convenient, simple to use, and my daughter loves the results! What a great way to get a curly hairdo with no fuss and no expensive fees to pay a hairstylist!!!</li>
            <li> The Remington T/Studio H2050 hot rollers are the best hair product I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time, if ever.  I have very striaght hair that is fine but dense.  The rollers are easy to use, and do not pull when you&#x27;re taking them out. It is amazing how the curl last without scorching your hair.  The curls are bouncy with a lot of shine.</li>
            <li> I bought these about a week ago and have tried to use them several times on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Our hair types are COMPLETELY different, but the product has reacted them same to both.  HORRIBLY!!  Her hair is fine and straight, and mine is thick and curly, but the rollers couldn&#x27;t figure it out.  They are way too hot to handle, so trying to put a lot of hair on them resulted in frequent burning, but not putting enough resulted in scorched ends.  The worst part for me (as with many other reviewers) is that the clip doesn&#x27;t hold the roller.  The heating element is too slippery, so the roller dangles.  I didn&#x27;t see any creases, however my curls were too loose to last through the day.  If you have a need for loose curls for a short amount of time, this is it!  But, if you want nice waves that last a long time, skip this one.</li>
            <li> I gave this only four stars only because the clips get hot and if you don&#x27;t have them firmly fastened in hair, you can feel some intense heat on your ears. I have fine hair and it was a bit of a challenge to curl the hair around my ears and forehead without feeling the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, these rollers are really easy to work with. The thing I liked best was taking them out. Once I got the hang of it, I could just grab the clip and unroll my hair without actually touching the roller. Very fast and no tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like not dealing with metal clips that heat up, are hard to hook on and unhook and store. These clips store right on the the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does heat up fast. I found they actually heat up as fast as my curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice case. Heavy unit! Seems pretty solidly constructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of three sets of electric rollers I have owned, these are by far the ones I like the most. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> What can you say? This is a great product. It heats up quickly and evenly, the rollers hold the heat, they don&#x27;t burn your hair, and the curl lasts a good while. I like the ceramic inserts in the clips. I thought they would be on the rollers themselves, which would probably be too much intense heat for the hair. Instead, there are 2 small inserts on the clips themselves. The rollers are soft felt-like material that doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair. There is a nice distribution of sizes, including large rollers, which some brands skimp on. The large covered case with clear lid is appealing and sturdy. There is a slot in the rollers where they sit firmly on the heating element lengthwise. They do fall off and get all mixed up if you turn the case sideways or upside down - so just don&#x27;t do that!</li>
            <li> The product is great but DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM DISCOUNT JUNGLE.  They charge restocking fees and try every way to keep you from getting your money back.  Buy it through someone else.</li>
            <li> I recenlty bought these rollers at WalMart.      When I unpacked them and plugged them in for the first time, there were a few rollers on the lower \\&quot;rack\\&quot;that got a melted plastic like substance on them (may be 3 of them).  This puzzled me as I had taken all the packing off.    Regardless, I used them at least three times since.  I found these things to be true in my opinion:    1. the clips did not get hot enough to burn me nor did they slide off the roller    2. the rollers stayed in place until I removed them from my hair    3. I had no creases from the clip or the roller    4. my hair did not frizz although I have coarse, thick, naturally curly hair    5. My hair was smoother than usual and the bounce from the curl stayed in    6. they did heat up fast, but not extremely hot to touch    I feel that they are a good tool.  However, because of the \\&quot;melting\\&quot; that I experienced initially, I will take back the set.  Probably just to exchange them, unless I research and find a product that I want to try even more.    Hope the next one does not melt and that this one is just a lemon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before, but these are really easy to use!  And they make gorgeous curls!  There weren&#x27;t quite enough rollers for my whole head, but I have thick hair.  There was only a small section left and I curled that with a curling iron, so it was no big deal.  And the price is very reasonable.  I definitely recommend these to anyone!</li>
            <li> I like the set up and quick heating and velvet covered rollers. However, the clips are not very snug and on top of that they leave indentations in your hair. I will try another kind, this is my first experience with hot rollers, and for now I&#x27;m back to my trusty revlon ceramic heat curling iron I&#x27;ve used for 12 yrs!!</li>
            <li> The Remington H-2050 T-Studio Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers with Tourmaline provide beautiful curls that have staying power - used with the right hair products for your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roller heat up quickly, a must for those of us who always seem to be rushed in the mornings.  When I have time, I like to let the curlers cool in my hair, but even when I&#x27;ve had to take them out while still warm, I&#x27;ve found that the curler and heated clip has produced great curls very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curlers are set lengthwise on a heated bar in the base unit.  Because of this, the base is a bit larger than other models, but I really don&#x27;t see a better way to design this since the clips are attached to the curlers to be heated simultaneously with the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with the Remington H-2050 is that it crimps my style in the worst place.  While the heated clips provide the advantage of a quick set, I can&#x27;t seem to keep the one in the front area above my bangs from putting a crimp just above the root of that section of hair.  Just where I want height the most, the clip ruins it.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of things to prevent this, but simply haven&#x27;t found a good way to keep this from happening yet.  And to be honest, if I have to work so hard to rig a way to prevent this from happening, I can&#x27;t in good conscience rate these rollers more than a 3.  It is a shame, because if that one problem didn&#x27;t exist, these would be a 5-star roller set for me.</li>
            <li> I had decided to stop using hot curlers as it was damaging my hair. I also perm my hair with no-lye relaxers. My hair went from being fairly long to broken off, really difficult to manage and quite frizzy. I could no longer style it and looked like an old grannie.  I did quite a bit of research and decided to start wet setting my hair but the only problem was I looked like I was wearing a curly afro. I bought the remington set about a month ago but was content to wear my curly afro. Last week,  after wet setting my hair, I decided to put in the Remington rollers to see what would happen. Well lo and behold, I had nice bouncy, full curls! I could not believe it! They lasted all day and there was no crimp in my hair. I am so pleased! My hair looks so healthy and everyone notices. I don&#x27;t have a problem with them burning my fingers, although I must say, they do burn my ears if they touch them. I just place a piece of tissue on my ear and that does the trick. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a great deal when I paid $45 for these at a retail store. I&#x27;ve been looking at Remington and Conair rollers for a while, and this model, as well as a similar model, seemed perfect for me. I have long hair, to my waist, and finding rollers to curl it, and have the curls stay in place, is a daunting task. So I was looking for a variety of rollers just like these.    The heat up time was quick. I grabbed the first roller-which you pick up by the clasp which holds it in place-and my fingers began to burn...A LOT! There is absolutely no way to hold the clasp, or the roller, without seriously burning your hands and fingers. With other hot rollers, you can hold them by the ends or middle, but that isn&#x27;t an option with this model. I believe I lost my fingerprints today. I&#x27;ve never had a problem enduring painful or uncomfortable procedures in the name of beauty, but this was ridiculous. I managed to use all of the rollers, however, they failed to stay in place, so they dangled, burning my ears and the side of my face as well.    The cooling time was fast, and I had very little trouble removing them without tangles. The curls were a nice size, but even using the smaller rollers, in small pieces, they didn&#x27;t curl the bottom of my hair. In spite of using a strong hairspray, the curls didn&#x27;t hold up. These might work for someone who is trying to tame unruly curls, but for someone with straight hair, find an alternative. Also, if you don&#x27;t enjoy 2nd degree burns, find another brand. My hands, fingers, ears and face are raw, especially the palms of my hands and the tips of my fingers. Rather than investing their money in an attractive presentation, Remington should concentrate more on the practical application.</li>
            <li> I have this set of rollers, but I did not purchase them from Amazon.  The model and style is the exactly same, but this metal \\&quot;plate\\&quot; people are complaing about does not exist on my clips- odd? So I don&#x27;t know if mine are an older manufacture, or newer? Anyway, the one thing that I did have an issue with was the rollers slipping because the clip has a smooth surface. So I purchased clips from AMAZON, both for the slipping issue and any potential creasing I kept reading about (but I personally had not experienced yet).    The clips I purchased were: [[ASIN:B000R87B1Q Conair SPC10R Super Clips]]  from Amazon and they work fantastic with the existing Remington clips, or as a replacement. They can withstand hot roller heat, but you can&#x27;t heat them up in the unit as you would the Remington Clips.  No creases!     The unit itself does have a large footprint on your vanity/counter but I like the fact that two-thirds of the rollers are large. I have really long hair, and it&#x27;s naturally curly, but hot rollers still help me with managibilty. Some people are complaining that they are too hot, but I find that picking them up by the clip, or handling the velour part of the roll is not a problem. If you can handle the whole roller straight out of the unit after it&#x27;s been heated up then it&#x27;s not a good hot roller in my book!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these rollers. I have large and medium size rollers for my long hair. It takes about 10-15 minutes to get a bouncey and curl head of hair. I&#x27;m the mom of 2 teenagers and 2 toddlers.. these are life savers. You wont regret this purchase. I love the way they are stacked and the clips help keep everything neat and in place. It&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> I love this item, very fast warm up, super easy to use, specially love the clip lock. Take me 5 min,to get whole head rolled up, with in 10 min. my hair curs and can last for 3 days.  At least 10 of my friends bought it</li>
            <li> It works well and is easy to use. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it. My son thinks it&#x27;s the funniest hat he&#x27;s ever seen me wear, but as I don&#x27;t plan on wearing it outside the house... I think I&#x27;m OK with that. The curlers do get a little hotter than other rollers do, so you have to work quickly and carefully so you don&#x27;t burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> Pros:  operate with lid closed, on/off switch    Cons:  Takes up way too much space, hard to use without burning your fingers because the heating contact point is across the length of the roller &amp; I burnt my fingers trying to get my hair onto the roller.  But the main reason I&#x27;m taking these back is because the crease/dent it left in my hair.  HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever trying such a product, I&#x27;ve always used hot curlers and flat irons.  I can believe how easy these are to use and how long the curls lasts.      I generally wear weaves and I&#x27;ve never had curls like this in it before!</li>
            <li> These are going back to the manufacturer!  They haven&#x27;t produced a good photo of the clips for those of you interested in them, so I will describe one of the many flaws with this set of rollers.  The clips have a metal plate on the inside of them that \\&quot;sandwiches\\&quot; the hair between the roller and the metal plate.  The pressure of this is the ONLY thing that keeps these rollers in you hair.  There are no teeth at all, only a smooth surface, that keeps these things in place.  This means that when you put a roller in your hair, it hangs from your head.  You can forget about a tight roll.  What happens is that when you remove the rollers from your head, you have a large crease where the roller was hanging from your head.  In my attempt for a tighter roll, I tried using less hair and the clips just sprung from my head across the room, and almost landed in the toilet where they belong!!!  I hope this allows me to not give any stars to these but I may have to give 1 in order to leave this - if it has one, it&#x27;s only because I had to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several similar products in the past and this curler set is easily the best.  The set includes the storage/heating case with storage for the cord, twenty rollers/clips (twelve 1 1/4\\&quot; and eight 1\\&quot;) and instruction manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curlers begin to warm via a metal rack in the case within a minute or so of turning it on.  Within five minutes, they reach optimum temperature and achieve maximum effectiveness within ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curlers are easy to handle because the parts that heat up are not on the outside, but are on the interior of the clip and on the slots along the side of the curlers.  The clips themselves are simple to use, easy to remove and put back in place once you roll up your hair in the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that the rollers heat so well (quickly and evenly) rhat a curl will take to the hair in just a little while.  If you leave the rollers in for maybe a half hour at most, you get a nice curl that holds for the entire day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, a lot depends on your hair type, so if you have long, fine hair you probably want to heat up the curlers for 10 minutes or so and leave them in for a good half hour or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you don&#x27;t need to sleep with them in or anything like that.  You will see a curl in as little as five or ten minutes after wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product appears to be well designed and the case is not too big, about a foot wide and a little less deep than that, so storage is not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for heated curlers, this product works great and is a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> I needed a quick solution for a gift for my sister-in-law and wanted it to arrive before Christmas. She lives in a different state, so I got a gift card from Amazon.com, which was the perfect solution. She received notice of the gift on line within a few minutes,  and was able to order something immediately.  She got a fabric cutting system and was thrilled with it. It was the easiest shopping I ever did!  Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Use these quite often and LOVE it!  Saves a LOT of time and gives the perfect flowy curl</li>
            <li> These curlers were great.  They were ready to use in under 2 minutes and after 10 minutes in my hair they left great curls.  The clips did not leave lines in my hair like some other curlers and they did not get stuck in my hair.  Everything packs up nicely.  My hair was curly and shiny.  I have never had curlers work this fast before.  I love them.  So far I have not been able to overheat them enough to burn myself.  All you have to do is avoid the small metal strip.  These curlers have been the best I have used so far.  Since I started using them I have gotten a lot of comments on my hair.</li>
            <li> First you burn the heck out of your fingers, second the curl does last at all. Then if you don&#x27;t have the clips sitting just right they will melt. I had two melt this way. If I could leave less stars than one I would.</li>
