            <li>I like the most</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients in this eye balm.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and the packaging is extremely cute.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s easy to tuck away in my beauty organization drawers.</li>
            <li>I love this eye moisturizer and am glad I received a free sample to review on my blog.</li>
            <li>Wonderful on dry eyelids!</li>
            <li>a try if you have sensitive skin or even if you don&#x27;t it still works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the balm nightly since early autumn and it&#x27;s doing a great job of keeping my redness at bay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy feeling, it soaks right in &amp; most importantly, my under eyes are looking and feeling healthy and fabulous!</li>
            <li>moisturizes without being greasy, easy to remove.</li>
            <li>but the shine goes away very quickly.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s almost the consistency of chapstick or lipbalm but easily melts for spreading.  </li>
            <li>size, easy to read and follow instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has reduced the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or fine lines</li>
            <li>The appearance of fine lines and pores were reduced while I had it on</li>
            <li>and I do find it helping to reduce fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and look forward to trying many more Bee Natural products!  </li>
            <li>The product glides on smoothly when applying.  </li>
            <li>Good for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Those all sound like soothing, recognizable products I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting on my skin, unlike the chemistry-set of ingredients that many creams contain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural, potent, inexpensive, and very good not only for under eyes area but for the lips as well.  </li>
            <li>so I love to see when companies are supporting the bee keeping industry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am again very glad it is all natural</li>
            <li>The Shea oil is full of nutrients that moisturize and are also anti inflammatory.  </li>
            <li>This is a superb product for the delicate skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li>No fragrance, and all natural, it is good for the whole family.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older I have noticed more crows feet showing up.</li>
            <li>More so than your normal eye moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to be fully absorbed to the point that if I touch it, I do not feel it on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>love that it contains all natural ingredients, including Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil, Unbleached Beeswax, Sunflower Oil, Avocado Oil, Sesame Oil, Carrot Seed Oil, Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Shea Oil, (Vitamin E), Coconut 0il and 0at 0il.</li>
            <li>eye areas like crows feet and smile</li>
            <li>is it is all natural, healthy, revitalizing and rejuvenates skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My top praise about this item is it is made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Sunflower oil and avocado oil are both easily and deeply absorbed by the skin increasing the soft feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Among the ingredients are jojoba oil  which is full of vitamins and mineral for gently hydrating the skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I liked the product a lot and would most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li>I absolute love that this Eye balm has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>You do not need to use very much either.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I apply it around my mouth area because I have some smile lines I really don&#x27;t like and also around my eyes it brightens my eye area and reduces puffiness.</li>
            <li>It is an eye balm after all, so it is heavier and more moisturizing than regular eye lotions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to switch over to completely cruelty free products soon</li>
            <li>I love this brand&#x27;s products but the only issue I have with this one is that it is way too oily.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve tried so many different eye products.</li>
            <li>The product has a very nice and subtle scent...</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li>I had patch of dry skin on my right eye lid which prevented me from wearing eyeshadow because honestly dry skin does not look good with makeup on it.</li>
            <li>I like that it is natural very much!  </li>
            <li>Often times, my eye makeup really bothers my contacts,  so eye cream is off limits.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much differenceâ€‹ in wrinkles</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really cautious of what of what I put on my face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Living in the desert really dries out</li>
            <li>Immediately after application, it definitely gives your skin a velvety smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>This eye balm is very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s really good for your skin and the delicate area around your eyes.</li>
            <li>Of course being the rebel I amâ€¦I use it for so many other things than what it is being promoted to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to get rid of the dark circles most of all.  </li>
            <li>This peeper keeper (ok I LOVE the fun name as well) is a thick, balm almost chapstick consistency with really no smell that I could detect.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is a good eye moisturizer to use and it works on other dry areas of your face.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to everyone to add to your beauty supplies .</li>
            <li>Yes, I may be a sucker for cuteness but this eye cream is also more than a pretty face-</li>
            <li>it is smooth and not greasy at all unlike other products like this .It</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this eye balm doesn&#x27;t bother them at all.</li>
            <li>and I prefer this natural product to others I have tried at the grocery store that were full of chemicals and did not help the very dark under eye circles much at all.  </li>
            <li>my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this clear and young in years!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard and you just need to warm it up with your fingers to get the product off.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants something natural that actually works and doesn&#x27;t cost and arm &amp; a leg.</li>
            <li>This balm works and I would recommend it to anyone who loves all natural products.</li>
            <li>I also use this overnight on my lips to leave them soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I really like this balm overall.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and works wonders.</li>
            <li>my skin and Peeper Keeper keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a eye balm that keep wrinkles away with all natural ingredients,peeper keeper eye balm works wonders.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>It is so natural,</li>
            <li>I can say so far I have noticed my skin around the eye area softer.</li>
            <li>This has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>If it is natural ingredients then why not try it out.</li>
            <li>* Keep Wrinkles Away with All Natural Ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li>All Natural Ingredients with Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil, Unbleached Beeswax,&lt;br /&gt;Sunflower Oil, Avocado Oil, Sesame Oil, Carrot Seed Oil, Meadowfoam Seed Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Shea</li>
            <li>balm states that it will keep wrinkles away with their all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The natural oils help to hydrate and rejuvenate damaged skin from years of sun and aging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than promised in professional packaging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this product is easy, just apply a small amount to the area around your eyes after removing your makeup.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it was a touch smaller than I expected for the price, but it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Overall decent product.</li>
            <li>this stuff is the first thing I&#x27;ve tried that instantly soothed the stinging skin &amp; seemed to instantly improve the roughness created by the dermatitis.</li>
            <li>What I got was small and with a light finger of applying this</li>
            <li>If I apply it twice a day the fine lines under and at the corners of my eyes are less noticeable as long as I am not wearing make up which then fills in the lines</li>
            <li>My major concern with my under eye area is dryness</li>
            <li>Thus far I have been using it for about 2 weeks and my under eye area actually FEELS moisturized, even after I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li>It has all natural ingredients such as olive oil, jojoba oil, unbleached beeswax, sunflower oil, avocado oil, sesame oil, Carrot Seed Oil, meadowfoam seed oil, shea oil, tocopheryl acetate also known as vitamin e, coconut oil and oat oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way too, heck Ive been using it on the fine lines around my upper lip as well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to really see a lot of change in using this under my eyes, but I do like that this has multiple uses for lips, cuticles etc.</li>
            <li>is easy to apply I use mine in with my nightly cleansing regime , you only need a very small amount to do the job.</li>
            <li>I really hope they can improve it for people like me with very dark under eye circles so they will be completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I want a product that actually works, doesn&#x27;t sting, is natural and doesn&#x27;t just sit on my skin, I want it to actually absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li>It does look shiny and a little greasy at first when applied</li>
            <li>The balm is dense, so a quick swipe across with your finger is enough to cover a small area of skin or your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has the consistency and feel of a lip balm and it absorbed quickly enough that it didn&#x27;t look or feel heavy on my skin yet still left a dewy finish on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how well it works with make-up since I rarely wear it.  </li>

            <li> and I do find it helping to reduce fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and look forward to trying many more Bee Natural products!  </li>
            <li> The product glides on smoothly when applying.  </li>
            <li> Good for sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Those all sound like soothing, recognizable products I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting on my skin, unlike the chemistry-set of ingredients that many creams contain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural, potent, inexpensive, and very good not only for under eyes area but for the lips as well.  </li>
            <li> so I love to see when companies are supporting the bee keeping industry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am again very glad it is all natural</li>
            <li> The Shea oil is full of nutrients that moisturize and are also anti inflammatory.  </li>
            <li> This is a superb product for the delicate skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li> No fragrance, and all natural, it is good for the whole family.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older I have noticed more crows feet showing up.</li>
            <li> More so than your normal eye moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to be fully absorbed to the point that if I touch it, I do not feel it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> love that it contains all natural ingredients, including Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil, Unbleached Beeswax, Sunflower Oil, Avocado Oil, Sesame Oil, Carrot Seed Oil, Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Shea Oil, (Vitamin E), Coconut 0il and 0at 0il.</li>
            <li> eye areas like crows feet and smile</li>
            <li> is it is all natural, healthy, revitalizing and rejuvenates skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My top praise about this item is it is made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Sunflower oil and avocado oil are both easily and deeply absorbed by the skin increasing the soft feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Among the ingredients are jojoba oil  which is full of vitamins and mineral for gently hydrating the skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I liked the product a lot and would most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I absolute love that this Eye balm has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> You do not need to use very much either.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I apply it around my mouth area because I have some smile lines I really don&#x27;t like and also around my eyes it brightens my eye area and reduces puffiness.</li>
            <li> It is an eye balm after all, so it is heavier and more moisturizing than regular eye lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to switch over to completely cruelty free products soon</li>
            <li> I love this brand&#x27;s products but the only issue I have with this one is that it is way too oily.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve tried so many different eye products.</li>
            <li> The product has a very nice and subtle scent...</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li> I had patch of dry skin on my right eye lid which prevented me from wearing eyeshadow because honestly dry skin does not look good with makeup on it.</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural very much!  </li>
            <li> Often times, my eye makeup really bothers my contacts,  so eye cream is off limits.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much differenceâ€‹ in wrinkles</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m really cautious of what of what I put on my face.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Living in the desert really dries out</li>
            <li> Immediately after application, it definitely gives your skin a velvety smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> This eye balm is very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s really good for your skin and the delicate area around your eyes.</li>
            <li> Of course being the rebel I amâ€¦I use it for so many other things than what it is being promoted to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get rid of the dark circles most of all.  </li>
            <li> This peeper keeper (ok I LOVE the fun name as well) is a thick, balm almost chapstick consistency with really no smell that I could detect.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is a good eye moisturizer to use and it works on other dry areas of your face.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to everyone to add to your beauty supplies .</li>
            <li> Yes, I may be a sucker for cuteness but this eye cream is also more than a pretty face-</li>
            <li> it is smooth and not greasy at all unlike other products like this .It</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this eye balm doesn&#x27;t bother them at all.</li>
            <li> and I prefer this natural product to others I have tried at the grocery store that were full of chemicals and did not help the very dark under eye circles much at all.  </li>
            <li> my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this clear and young in years!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard and you just need to warm it up with your fingers to get the product off.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants something natural that actually works and doesn&#x27;t cost and arm &amp; a leg.</li>
            <li> This balm works and I would recommend it to anyone who loves all natural products.</li>
            <li> I also use this overnight on my lips to leave them soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I really like this balm overall.</li>
            <li> It is all natural and works wonders.</li>
            <li> my skin and Peeper Keeper keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day.</li>

            <li> No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is so natural,</li>
            <li> I can say so far I have noticed my skin around the eye area softer.</li>
            <li> This has all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> If it is natural ingredients then why not try it out.</li>
            <li> * Keep Wrinkles Away with All Natural Ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li> All Natural Ingredients with Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil, Unbleached Beeswax,&lt;br /&gt;Sunflower Oil, Avocado Oil, Sesame Oil, Carrot Seed Oil, Meadowfoam Seed Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Shea</li>
            <li> balm states that it will keep wrinkles away with their all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The natural oils help to hydrate and rejuvenate damaged skin from years of sun and aging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised in professional packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this product is easy, just apply a small amount to the area around your eyes after removing your makeup.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it was a touch smaller than I expected for the price, but it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Overall decent product.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the first thing I&#x27;ve tried that instantly soothed the stinging skin &amp; seemed to instantly improve the roughness created by the dermatitis.</li>
            <li> What I got was small and with a light finger of applying this</li>
            <li> If I apply it twice a day the fine lines under and at the corners of my eyes are less noticeable as long as I am not wearing make up which then fills in the lines</li>
            <li> My major concern with my under eye area is dryness</li>
            <li> Thus far I have been using it for about 2 weeks and my under eye area actually FEELS moisturized, even after I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li> It has all natural ingredients such as olive oil, jojoba oil, unbleached beeswax, sunflower oil, avocado oil, sesame oil, Carrot Seed Oil, meadowfoam seed oil, shea oil, tocopheryl acetate also known as vitamin e, coconut oil and oat oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too, heck Ive been using it on the fine lines around my upper lip as well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to really see a lot of change in using this under my eyes, but I do like that this has multiple uses for lips, cuticles etc.</li>
            <li> is easy to apply I use mine in with my nightly cleansing regime , you only need a very small amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> I really hope they can improve it for people like me with very dark under eye circles so they will be completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I want a product that actually works, doesn&#x27;t sting, is natural and doesn&#x27;t just sit on my skin, I want it to actually absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li> It does look shiny and a little greasy at first when applied</li>
            <li> The balm is dense, so a quick swipe across with your finger is enough to cover a small area of skin or your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has the consistency and feel of a lip balm and it absorbed quickly enough that it didn&#x27;t look or feel heavy on my skin yet still left a dewy finish on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it works with make-up since I rarely wear it.  </li>
            <li> I really liked that it didn&#x27;t have any harsh or irritating fragrances.</li>
            <li> The product comes in a small container but will last a long time since a little bit of this balm goes a long way, it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky and once you apply the balm it dries up pretty fast</li>
            <li> The tiny tub of balm seems like it may actually last me quite a long time, but when I&#x27;m out, I will repurchase this.</li>
            <li> Over all so far I am noticing my skin softening up and lines are starting to be less.</li>
            <li> For me (due to dry, sensitive skin), I had to reapply 2-3 times daily.  </li>
            <li> I expect that it will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> The product will  last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a product to wear when you&#x27;re out and about because the shine of the beeswax is quite obvious, so I recommend wearing it at night and washing it off when you wash your face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product has natural oils to hydrate and rejuvenate damaged skin, this product is made specifically for trouble</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars only because my very dark circles under my eyes are about half as dark as before, but still very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my dry cheeks.</li>
            <li> Dry patches of skin are a memory too.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s helping with my dark circles definitely.</li>
            <li> Within two days of using this that dry rough patch was gone.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see if this is heavy duty enough for winter.  </li>
            <li> so they are expected, yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for my other uses: Rough elbows and heels are gone.</li>
            <li> My usual methods of treatment were simply not working that well.</li>
            <li> A little of this stuff goes a very long way!  </li>
            <li> The small 0.8 oz jar still goes a long way,because you really only need a small amount for each use.</li>
            <li> it also has no smell to it and helps dark spots fade away.</li>
            <li> I use it after applying my vitamin C dark circle serum to moisturize my lid area and undereye area.</li>
            <li> The dark under eyedness has seem to have faded some.</li>
            <li> but I find myself having to wipe it off later because it doesn&#x27;t absorb, it just sits there because it is too thick and oily.</li>
            <li> As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost.</li>
            <li> When applied to the area around your eyes, you will notice softer skin and less wrinkles as the area will be hydrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My little ones will let me apply it to bug bites to make them stop itching.</li>
            <li> The product comes in a little tin that can be slipped in your backup, diaper bag or travel bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a under eye product for a few months now.</li>
            <li> My under eye skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out or anything, it feels softer.</li>
            <li> I also apply some to my brows to tame them.</li>
            <li> A very little bit is used each time.</li>
            <li> It comes in a small container</li>
            <li> I noticed a subtle firming feeling but not an overly tight sensation like a lot of firming products.</li>
            <li> Thick in consistency so need to emulsify a bit before application.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to turn to unnatural ways of nourishing my skin or use weird fillers or anything.</li>
            <li> I have bad seasonal allergies that cause a lot of eye watering, &amp; leads to dryness and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful on dry eyelids! I have very sensitive skin and this eye balm doesn&#x27;t bother them at all. I can use it before putting in contacts. Often times, my eye makeup really bothers my contacts,  so eye cream is off limits. However, this balm doesn&#x27;t irritate at all. I also use it on my dry cheeks. It is great for all around moisture so I use it on my kids eczema.  No fragrance, and all natural, it is good for the whole family. I also put a dab on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolute love that this Eye balm has all natural ingredients It&#x27;s always good to know what you are applying to your skin. I apply it around my mouth area because I have some smile lines I really don&#x27;t like and also around my eyes it brightens my eye area and reduces puffiness. The product comes in a small container but will last a long time since a little bit of this balm goes a long way, it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky and once you apply the balm it dries up pretty fast it also has no smell to it and helps dark spots fade away. This balm works and I would recommend it to anyone who loves all natural products.</li>
            <li> I love this eye moisturizer and am glad I received a free sample to review on my blog. I use it after applying my vitamin C dark circle serum to moisturize my lid area and undereye area. I also apply some to my brows to tame them. I had patch of dry skin on my right eye lid which prevented me from wearing eyeshadow because honestly dry skin does not look good with makeup on it. Within two days of using this that dry rough patch was gone. This is a good eye moisturizer to use and it works on other dry areas of your face. Though if you are acne prone I&#x27;d suggest only using this around your eyes.</li>
            <li> This is definitely moisturizing. I would recommend using it at night though, before you go to sleep because it can leave a greasy look around your eyes. It is an eye balm after all, so it is heavier and more moisturizing than regular eye lotions. You do not need to use very much either. I just dab my finger into the balm and then dab it around my eyes before bedtime. In the mornings, my eyes look more moist and refreshed. It&#x27;s also the perfect size to carry in your purse if you want to. It contains vitamin E and 10 essential oils. So it&#x27;s really good for your skin and the delicate area around your eyes. Deeply hydrating stuff! I bought this product with a discount and I have been pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s non-greasy, but still an excellent moisturizer.  I use this on my eyes (I use this at night after my face-washing regimen while my skin is still damp). and it absorbs beautifully overnight.  I also use this overnight on my lips to leave them soft and moisturized.  I also use this on my cuticles during my manicure process.  I haven&#x27;t had a hangnail in months!  Can&#x27;t wait to see if this is heavy duty enough for winter.  Will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> love me some bee eye balm cream.  I am a bee keeper so I love to see when companies are supporting the bee keeping industry.&lt;br /&gt;The puffyness under my eyes has definitely disappeared and the smell is wonderful. I love this stuff and look forward to trying many more Bee Natural products!  Bonus - love how it is made in the USA</li>
            <li> This product is a keeper.  When choosing skincare products, ingredients are key for me.  This product is full of great ingredients for my skin that I feel good about putting on.  Among the ingredients are jojoba oil  which is full of vitamins and mineral for gently hydrating the skin.  It also has  anti microbial, anti fungal and anti inflammatory properties.  The beeswax in the eye balm provides a protective barrier for my skin against the elements.  Sunflower oil and avocado oil are both easily and deeply absorbed by the skin increasing the soft feel of my skin.  Avocado oil also is known to increase collagen production.  The Carrot seed oil nourishes, tightens and rejuvenates the skin.  The Shea oil is full of nutrients that moisturize and are also anti inflammatory.  This eye balm also has meadowfoam seed oil, vitamin e, coconut oil and oatmeal.  All in all, these are great ingredients that I feel good about using.  The eye balm is similar to a lip balm in feel.  I use a q tip to put it under my eyes. after washing.  It takes a while to be fully absorbed to the point that if I touch it, I do not feel it on my skin.  This is what I expect from a eye balm and I do like it.  I expect that it will last me a long time.  A very little bit is used each time.</li>
            <li> Our eyes are looking better. The dark under eyedness has seem to have faded some. I do think our eyes lacked moisture and this peeper keeper is doing the trick. Haven&#x27;t noticed much differenceâ€‹ in wrinkles but it&#x27;s only been 12 days.</li>
            <li> ...and the consistency is thicker, more waxy, than most eye products. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> The product has a very nice and subtle scent...which is what you want in an eye balm. I love the fact that the ingredients are natural. The product glides on smoothly when applying.  For me (due to dry, sensitive skin), I had to reapply 2-3 times daily.  Overall, I liked the product a lot and would most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive eyes. Thick in consistency so need to emulsify a bit before application.  Semi hydrating and non greasy. Overall decent product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to really see a lot of change in using this under my eyes, but I do like that this has multiple uses for lips, cuticles etc. If it fails as an eye balm I will still have use for it. :-)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It has reduced the fine lines around my eyes.  I apply each night and have notices a nice improvement.</li>
            <li> The texture of this was surprising to me! It&#x27;s very hard and you just need to warm it up with your fingers to get the product off. My major concern with my under eye area is dryness so I love that this moisturizes it. It comes with quite a bit of product. More so than your normal eye moisturizer. My eyes are look brighter and I think it&#x27;s helping with my dark circles definitely. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or fine lines so I can&#x27;t comment on that. Lastly, I love that this is leaping bunny certified. I&#x27;d like to switch over to completely cruelty free products soon and that means I can keep using this baby! I really like this balm overall. I received a discount on this product for review purposes but that doesn&#x27;t affect my opinion.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive so I&#x27;m really cautious of what of what I put on my face. I had actually given up but a friend told me about but&lt;br /&gt;Bee Naturals Queen Bee Peeper Keeper not only doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin but it actually works on my wrinkles. So give this&lt;br /&gt;Bee Naturals a try if you have sensitive skin or even if you don&#x27;t it still works great. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a under eye product for a few months now. The others I have tried either end up making my eyes water, sting or turn red and itchy. I want a product that actually works, doesn&#x27;t sting, is natural and doesn&#x27;t just sit on my skin, I want it to actually absorb into my skin. I can confidently say this has hit my every want. Thus far I have been using it for about 2 weeks and my under eye area actually FEELS moisturized, even after I wash my face at night. My under eye skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out or anything, it feels softer. I have some very fine lines and puffiness creeping up on me as Im looking at 50 out the windshield of life so they are expected, yet I don&#x27;t want to turn to unnatural ways of nourishing my skin or use weird fillers or anything. This peeper keeper (ok I LOVE the fun name as well) is a thick, balm almost chapstick consistency with really no smell that I could detect. No stinging, redness or sensitivity from it at all. A little goes a long way too, heck Ive been using it on the fine lines around my upper lip as well. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants something natural that actually works and doesn&#x27;t cost and arm &amp; a leg. While I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review...I can honestly say I love this product!</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my skin,  use it on my lips too.</li>
            <li> I love this brand&#x27;s products but the only issue I have with this one is that it is way too oily. I like using it on my eyes but I find myself having to wipe it off later because it doesn&#x27;t absorb, it just sits there because it is too thick and oily. Otherwise I like it because it does keep my eye area moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have bad seasonal allergies that cause a lot of eye watering, &amp; leads to dryness and puffiness under my eyes. In addition to that, when I encounter dust, it creates contact dermatitis under my eyes &amp; produces more swelling. My eyes sting &amp; are rather unsightly. My usual methods of treatment were simply not working that well. I have pretty sensitive skin &amp; I&#x27;ve tried so many different eye products. I was able to receive this @ a discount for my unbiased personal opinion &amp; this stuff is the first thing I&#x27;ve tried that instantly soothed the stinging skin &amp; seemed to instantly improve the roughness created by the dermatitis. The tiny tub of balm seems like it may actually last me quite a long time, but when I&#x27;m out, I will repurchase this. It&#x27;s not greasy feeling, it soaks right in &amp; most importantly, my under eyes are looking and feeling healthy and fabulous!</li>
            <li> This is a superb product for the delicate skin around your eyes. It has the consistency and feel of a lip balm and it absorbed quickly enough that it didn&#x27;t look or feel heavy on my skin yet still left a dewy finish on the surface of my skin. I noticed a subtle firming feeling but not an overly tight sensation like a lot of firming products. I really liked that it didn&#x27;t have any harsh or irritating fragrances. The appearance of fine lines and pores were reduced while I had it on and it made my skin feel smoother as soon as I put it on. It comes in a small container but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot and it makes it convenient to take with you if you travel. I purchased this product with a 100% off coupon in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Natural, potent, inexpensive, and very good not only for under eyes area but for the lips as well.  The product will  last for a long time.  Found my product!</li>
            <li> moisturizes without being greasy, easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural very much!  I am about 48 and have been using this for many months, twice a day under my eyes, before writing this review.  I give it 4 stars only because my very dark circles under my eyes are about half as dark as before, but still very noticeable.  I really wanted to get rid of the dark circles most of all.  If I apply it twice a day the fine lines under and at the corners of my eyes are less noticeable as long as I am not wearing make up which then fills in the lines and then you can see them more.  If I use any extra on my fingers to the rest of my face I sometimes have a blemish but not often.  It does look shiny and a little greasy at first when applied but the shine goes away very quickly.  I am not sure how well it works with make-up since I rarely wear it.  I really hope they can improve it for people like me with very dark under eye circles so they will be completely gone.  I am again very glad it is all natural and I prefer this natural product to others I have tried at the grocery store that were full of chemicals and did not help the very dark under eye circles much at all.  Please continue to improve this very nice product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product. It is all natural and works wonders. I use under my eyes and around my nose. Living in the desert really dries out my skin and Peeper Keeper keeps my skin soft and hydrated all day. Great product and not expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a year since I grabbed this eye balm and I had to come by and update. This is way more than just an eye balmâ€”as a matter of fact, I find it more effective for lips and skin. The balm is dense, so a quick swipe across with your finger is enough to cover a small area of skin or your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the balm nightly since early autumn and it&#x27;s doing a great job of keeping my redness at bay. It&#x27;s not really a product to wear when you&#x27;re out and about because the shine of the beeswax is quite obvious, so I recommend wearing it at night and washing it off when you wash your face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The adorable name and packaging of Bee Naturals Queen Bee Peeper Keeper Eye Balm immediately caught my attention.  Yes, I may be a sucker for cuteness but this eye cream is also more than a pretty face- it will help keep YOUR face pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it contains all natural ingredients, including Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil, Unbleached Beeswax, Sunflower Oil, Avocado Oil, Sesame Oil, Carrot Seed Oil, Meadowfoam Seed Oil, Shea Oil, (Vitamin E), Coconut 0il and 0at 0il. Those all sound like soothing, recognizable products I wouldn&#x27;t mind putting on my skin, unlike the chemistry-set of ingredients that many creams contain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pepper Keeper is formulated to help common eye area issues like crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines. The small 0.8 oz jar still goes a long way,because you really only need a small amount for each use. The cream is non-greasy and pleasant-smelling. Immediately after application, it definitely gives your skin a velvety smooth feeling. After a few weeks of testing, it gave my delicate eye area more hydrated, smoother appearance. I&#x27;m not sure if it will actually prevent wrinkles with long-term use, but I have no doubt that using it consistently will improve the overall health and appearance of my skin.</li>

            <li> At night when I take off my make up I&#x27;ve been applying Bee Naturals, Queen Bee, Peeper Keeper Eye Balm.  What I like about this that it&#x27;s almost the consistency of chapstick or lipbalm but easily melts for spreading.  I apply it before bed after washing my face and in the morning it helps wash away any of the eye make up residue that may have been left over.  I LOVE the moisture it provides and it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It&#x27;s not oily like most under eye products. No smell. No harsh chemicals. Very soothing.</li>
            <li> This is a really lovely product.  Honestly, it was a touch smaller than I expected for the price, but it will last a long time.  A little of this stuff goes a very long way!  It absorbs so nicely into the skin around the eyes and mouth.  I use this in multiple places - around my eyes, the lines on my forehead, and around my lips.  It is so natural, it works well for a lip balm too!  There is no scent at all.  I am happy with this purchase!  I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with the company&#x27;s oil-free moisturizer, and I must say, my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this clear and young in years!</li>
            <li> I have been using this a short while. I can say so far I have noticed my skin around the eye area softer. As I have gotten older I have noticed more crows feet showing up. I have been using this a couple of weeks and from what I am seeing it is lessening up those. If I can keep at a minimum what I have now I am super happy. This has all natural ingredients and I love that. I am getting to be more like watching what I am putting in my body and on my body. If it is natural ingredients then why not try it out. It also has some great oils and vitamins to help the skin look and feel healthier. I can not wait to see what my skin looks like in another couple of weeks. What I got was small and with a light finger of applying this it will last you longer than you think. Over all so far I am noticing my skin softening up and lines are starting to be less. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Bee Naturals Peeper Keeper&lt;br /&gt;3/14/2015 0 Comments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee Naturals Peeper Keeper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression&lt;br /&gt;Nice size, easy to read and follow instructions.&lt;br /&gt;It says &amp;#34;for eyes&amp;#34; but I tried it on my eyes, lips, hands and face and it feels so silky!&lt;br /&gt;There is no smell or oil feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features&lt;br /&gt;* Keep Wrinkles Away with All Natural Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;* All Natural Ingredients with Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil, Unbleached Beeswax,&lt;br /&gt;Sunflower Oil, Avocado Oil, Sesame Oil, Carrot Seed Oil, Meadowfoam Seed Oil,&lt;br /&gt;Shea Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Coconut 0il and 0at 0il.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like the most is it is all natural, healthy, revitalizing and rejuvenates skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; #PeeperKeeper</li>
            <li> I am a fan of natural balms and this one from Bee Naturals is one of the best I have tried. Of course being the rebel I amâ€¦I use it for so many other things than what it is being promoted to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This balm states that it will keep wrinkles away with their all natural ingredients. Agreed. When applied to the area around your eyes, you will notice softer skin and less wrinkles as the area will be hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The natural oils help to hydrate and rejuvenate damaged skin from years of sun and aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is nice because you can pronounce them! They include olive oil, jojoba oil, unbleached beeswax, sunflower oil, avocado oil, carrot seed oil, meadow foam seed oil, shea oil, tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E), coconut oil and oat oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product is easy, just apply a small amount to the area around your eyes after removing your makeup. A word of caution about avoiding getting it in your eyes. It will sting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my other uses: Rough elbows and heels are gone. Dry patches of skin are a memory too. My little ones will let me apply it to bug bites to make them stop itching. Again, this stuff is amazing! The product comes in a little tin that can be slipped in your backup, diaper bag or travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> This is so lovely and amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this eye balm.  Nothing that I wouldn&#x27;t trust on my skin.</li>
            <li> This eye balm is very moisturizing without being greasy. Easy to apply and the packaging is extremely cute. I love that it&#x27;s easy to tuck away in my beauty organization drawers. My top praise about this item is it is made of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Nice to use a product that you can pronounce and understand all the ingredients of. Arrived sooner than promised in professional packaging. Will but another one for my daughter.</li>
