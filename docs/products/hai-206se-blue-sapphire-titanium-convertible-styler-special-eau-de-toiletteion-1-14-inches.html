            <li>A Guaranteed worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li>I am also pleased with the price that I obtained through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I would have paid $20 to $30 more</li>

            <li>Just love this flatiron</li>
            <li>she seems to love it.</li>
            <li>iron is sexy idk how it can but its prettier in person</li>
            <li>at the roots and is really frizzy, I can&#x27;t decide if I want to be relaxed or happy nappy ...</li>
            <li>always make sure...</li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron straightens beautifully!</li>
            <li>Tried it out pretty much immediately, and I was freshly impressed.</li>
            <li>This was a great flat iron, I was very pleased with the job it did of straightening and smoothing.  </li>
            <li>And the best thing is, as long as I am not washing my hair each day, the effect of the straightening lasts a couple of days!</li>
            <li>:) I am in love with my new HAI!!!!</li>
            <li>This is great for storage/travel rather than under the sink or in a drawer - encouraging you to take care of this great flat iron (haha).</li>
            <li>Results were, at best, okay - to get better results, I had to spend longer, sectioning the hair into small sections (who has the patience for that?)  </li>
            <li>It also is easy to to use to shape the hair and add curl where I want it.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, does not damage my hair and gets the job done in record time.  </li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job, doesn&#x27;t require very high heat for someone like me with fine hair, and heats up super fast.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair super shiny!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and gets nice and hot!</li>
            <li>For me that is huge.</li>
            <li>More than worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li>I dislike that the light blinks rapidly when its reached its temperature....</li>
            <li>This iron had some great reviews and was in the mid price range.</li>
            <li>THE GLIDE IS OH SO SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>MY HAIR IS STILL STR8 smooth...  </li>
            <li>there is an LED light and the light flashes until it the iron has reached maximum temperature ( but u can still use it )</li>
            <li>how adjust the temperature and the light keeps on blinking even tho</li>
            <li>( 390 degrees is what i used ) when I adjust it the LED light stops blinking</li>
            <li>The ONLY complaints I have about it aren&#x27;t really complaints... just annoyances because after all it does work perfectly.</li>
            <li>i guess its good no problems so far.</li>
            <li>It really is a great flat iron!</li>
            <li>This is a really great flat iron!</li>
            <li>Be sure to try a lower temperature are first</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>In under 10 minutes, my hair was shiny and smooth - heck, I&#x27;d say it looked good enough for hair modelling!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used this to flat-iron to flatten already straight hair more.</li>
            <li>I figured it would last me a good 1year or 2.  </li>
            <li>the clips are sturdy to hold my hair and the rat tail come is cool as well ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off this is a good flat iron ..</li>
            <li>Used it a few more times borrowed from my niece, and then went on the hunt to find it at a good price.</li>
            <li>Who really knows how much heat your own hair can take if you&#x27;re not a stylist?)</li>
            <li>I had super curly hair</li>
            <li>It worked so good and my hair was so straight and soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>It was lightweight and heated up quickly.</li>
            <li>After trying another brand and did not like it, this one is super for lift and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>The plates are a nice blue color and that gives it a unique look, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried the flat iron out and AWESOME (point blank period</li>
            <li>Have only had it for about 4 months and hope it lasts for a very long time because it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>get to straighten my hair fast and have fabulous hair in minutes!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of the higher-end straight irons over the years and this is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love HAI and purchased this to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>For the price this kit is worth it.</li>
            <li>Looks much more natural.</li>
            <li>all the $75 was worth</li>
            <li>This really is a great flat iron,even for someone with a lot of hair and natural wave.</li>
            <li>so I needed a straightener that would get hot and straighten quickly.  </li>
            <li>She told me that it&#x27;s less damaging to use a good iron at high heat with fewer passes than using a not so hot iron with more passes.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and FAST!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to purchase a new straightener</li>
            <li>- I highly suggest Redken Smooth</li>
            <li>This is currently my favorite flat iron I have right now!</li>
            <li>Plus it is pretty and definitely is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I own anything else that has lasted that long!</li>
            <li>I started reading reviews at many websites and there is definitely a wide range of prices out there for something that they basically all try to do, which is smooth and straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and really does the job.</li>
            <li>Such a great flat iron!</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous hair straighteners and for this price, there is nothing else better that you can get.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and is comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of my friend&#x27;s CHIs and they are just NOT the same!</li>
            <li>but I actually really like it!</li>
            <li>Glides through hair like silk and stays protected and even curls very well!</li>
            <li>First there is absoultely no pulling when passing the iron through my hair with the Sapphire iron, it glides through my hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>it is HOT AS HELL</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron; it makes my hair shine and heats up very fast.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the HAI flat iron so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a 1&amp;#34; flat iron that was just ok</li>
            <li>I love my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>Works better than the CHI, heats up super fast, doesn&#x27;t burn my hair, makes my hair shinier, silkier &amp; smoother than other straighteners do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this thing just a couple of days, but from my previous experience using my niece&#x27;s one (the exact same model), I feel confident I&#x27;ve made a good investment that not only saved me money, but will also save me a lot of time on always-busy mornings.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough, therefore taking more time to complete hair.</li>
            <li>she loves the fact that it warms up really fast</li>
            <li>and when she puts it on her hair she doesn&#x27;t have to leave it on there some much .</li>
            <li>Those don&#x27;t work very well -</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say this straightener costs twice as much in Canada as in the US.</li>
            <li>(Since I can&#x27;t so much with it, I can&#x27;t really style it or use products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The carrying case was big and could fit the section clips,case,and comb.</li>
            <li>It also took forever to get it really straight, even with it&#x27;s so called \\&quot;One Pass\\&quot; technology.</li>
            <li>But if I blow it out semi straight to begin with I can use a lower setting and it takes under 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>and I must say it has really improved the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>Third it makes my hair so soft and light, like a fresh from the salon texture.</li>
            <li>heats up way fast.</li>
            <li>I got it in two days thanks to amazon prime but still stalked the UPS man...</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll be having straight-hair days a lot more frequently, now that it is no longer such a hassle.</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a great flat iron set - especially those with thick/coarse hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a huge upgrade from Walmart flat irons</li>
            <li>This flat iron runs so smoothly over your hair.</li>
            <li>HAI 206SE Blue Sapphire Titanium Convertible Styler Special Eau De Toiletteion, 1 1/4 Inches]]</li>
            <li>I had been using a couple of older drugstore straighteners.</li>
            <li>Seriously not only does it not damage my hair but actually keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li>The HAI also leaves my hair looking super shiny after I use it which is a new experience for me, I didn&#x27;t really believe flat irons would do that, but this one does.</li>
            <li>I highly  recommend this hair tool.</li>
            <li>So I finally grabbed it off Amazon USA at a great price including international shipping, and waited greedily the 3 or 4 days it took for DHL and Canada Post to get it into my grubby little hands.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a few reasons why I&#x27;m so glad I upgraded.</li>
            <li>Down Heat Glide (great product and will have your hair SOFT and not greasy/weighed down).</li>
            <li>but you can set the temperature setting, right next to it</li>
            <li>You can get your hair super straight quickly enough to where I actually don&#x27;t mind doing my hair now.</li>
            <li>Still own it today, however I&#x27;ve been forced to share it&#x27;s use with my 20 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Once again, WOW!</li>
            <li>This iron gets hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>The tutorial stated that it was imperative that one uses an iron hot enough.</li>
            <li>No more frizz even in this lovely Florida humidity</li>
            <li>:) My kids are mixed and my oldest daughter has the most difficult hair I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>My old one the plates had started peeling off, AFTER SIX YEARS OF USE!</li>
            <li>and I needed something hot enough to maintain my hair weave.</li>
            <li>Usually it takes a long time to straighten my hair but this time it was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience using a flat iron; the HAI was recommended by my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>(HAI 206SE BLUE Sapphire Titanium Convertible Flat IRON - SPECIAL EDITION)</li>
            <li>This one is light weight, gets hot enough to straighten even my thick long, super wavy hair in its \\&quot;natural state\\&quot; (i.e. air dryed, with tons of wave) in about 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Note: I have a LOT of brown, naturally straight, healthy, chest length, very thick hair.</li>
            <li>Then I up graded to this one at the recommendation of a coworker and noticed a considerable difference in the look of my hair.</li>
            <li>Thank god for Amazon that took action and refund my money.</li>
            <li>I do have to put in on the highest heat setting if my hair is in it&#x27;s natural state</li>
            <li>She loves it so far.</li>
            <li>With this flat Iron I can have glossy straight hair</li>
            <li>I really like this flat iron</li>
            <li>I use it to hold the iron while it is hot and then zip the iron in the case (minus the cord) and then wrap the cord around the case.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and manageable and it only takes about 10 minutes to get the frizz out.</li>
            <li>kind of silly</li>
            <li>Took less than a minute to get to full heat, and again, less than ten minutes to get my unruly hair bone straight.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad product, just does not work well with thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it to curl yet, but I like that you can get straight hair that is slightly curled under on the bottom.</li>
            <li>normally its the other way around.</li>
            <li>She loves it so much she did away with her previous flat iron investment.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> always make sure...</li>
            <li> I love this iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron straightens beautifully!</li>
            <li> Tried it out pretty much immediately, and I was freshly impressed.</li>
            <li> This was a great flat iron, I was very pleased with the job it did of straightening and smoothing.  </li>
            <li> And the best thing is, as long as I am not washing my hair each day, the effect of the straightening lasts a couple of days!</li>
            <li> :) I am in love with my new HAI!!!!</li>
            <li> This is great for storage/travel rather than under the sink or in a drawer - encouraging you to take care of this great flat iron (haha).</li>
            <li> Results were, at best, okay - to get better results, I had to spend longer, sectioning the hair into small sections (who has the patience for that?)  </li>
            <li> It also is easy to to use to shape the hair and add curl where I want it.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, does not damage my hair and gets the job done in record time.  </li>
            <li> It does a wonderful job, doesn&#x27;t require very high heat for someone like me with fine hair, and heats up super fast.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair super shiny!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and gets nice and hot!</li>
            <li> For me that is huge.</li>
            <li> More than worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> I dislike that the light blinks rapidly when its reached its temperature....</li>
            <li> This iron had some great reviews and was in the mid price range.</li>
            <li> THE GLIDE IS OH SO SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS STILL STR8 smooth...  </li>
            <li> there is an LED light and the light flashes until it the iron has reached maximum temperature ( but u can still use it )</li>
            <li> how adjust the temperature and the light keeps on blinking even tho</li>
            <li> ( 390 degrees is what i used ) when I adjust it the LED light stops blinking</li>
            <li> The ONLY complaints I have about it aren&#x27;t really complaints... just annoyances because after all it does work perfectly.</li>
            <li> i guess its good no problems so far.</li>
            <li> It really is a great flat iron!</li>
            <li> This is a really great flat iron!</li>
            <li> Be sure to try a lower temperature are first</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> In under 10 minutes, my hair was shiny and smooth - heck, I&#x27;d say it looked good enough for hair modelling!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used this to flat-iron to flatten already straight hair more.</li>
            <li> I figured it would last me a good 1year or 2.  </li>
            <li> the clips are sturdy to hold my hair and the rat tail come is cool as well ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off this is a good flat iron ..</li>
            <li> Used it a few more times borrowed from my niece, and then went on the hunt to find it at a good price.</li>
            <li> Who really knows how much heat your own hair can take if you&#x27;re not a stylist?)</li>
            <li> I had super curly hair</li>
            <li> It worked so good and my hair was so straight and soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> It was lightweight and heated up quickly.</li>
            <li> After trying another brand and did not like it, this one is super for lift and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> The plates are a nice blue color and that gives it a unique look, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the flat iron out and AWESOME (point blank period</li>
            <li> Have only had it for about 4 months and hope it lasts for a very long time because it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> get to straighten my hair fast and have fabulous hair in minutes!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of the higher-end straight irons over the years and this is my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love HAI and purchased this to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> For the price this kit is worth it.</li>
            <li> Looks much more natural.</li>
            <li> all the $75 was worth</li>
            <li> This really is a great flat iron,even for someone with a lot of hair and natural wave.</li>
            <li> so I needed a straightener that would get hot and straighten quickly.  </li>
            <li> She told me that it&#x27;s less damaging to use a good iron at high heat with fewer passes than using a not so hot iron with more passes.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and FAST!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to purchase a new straightener</li>
            <li> - I highly suggest Redken Smooth</li>
            <li> This is currently my favorite flat iron I have right now!</li>
            <li> Plus it is pretty and definitely is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I own anything else that has lasted that long!</li>
            <li> I started reading reviews at many websites and there is definitely a wide range of prices out there for something that they basically all try to do, which is smooth and straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and really does the job.</li>
            <li> Such a great flat iron!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous hair straighteners and for this price, there is nothing else better that you can get.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and is comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of my friend&#x27;s CHIs and they are just NOT the same!</li>
            <li> but I actually really like it!</li>
            <li> Glides through hair like silk and stays protected and even curls very well!</li>
            <li> First there is absoultely no pulling when passing the iron through my hair with the Sapphire iron, it glides through my hair like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> it is HOT AS HELL</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron; it makes my hair shine and heats up very fast.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the HAI flat iron so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a 1&amp;#34; flat iron that was just ok</li>
            <li> I love my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Works better than the CHI, heats up super fast, doesn&#x27;t burn my hair, makes my hair shinier, silkier &amp; smoother than other straighteners do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing just a couple of days, but from my previous experience using my niece&#x27;s one (the exact same model), I feel confident I&#x27;ve made a good investment that not only saved me money, but will also save me a lot of time on always-busy mornings.</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough, therefore taking more time to complete hair.</li>
            <li> she loves the fact that it warms up really fast</li>
            <li> and when she puts it on her hair she doesn&#x27;t have to leave it on there some much .</li>
            <li> Those don&#x27;t work very well -</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say this straightener costs twice as much in Canada as in the US.</li>
            <li> (Since I can&#x27;t so much with it, I can&#x27;t really style it or use products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The carrying case was big and could fit the section clips,case,and comb.</li>
            <li> It also took forever to get it really straight, even with it&#x27;s so called \\&quot;One Pass\\&quot; technology.</li>
            <li> But if I blow it out semi straight to begin with I can use a lower setting and it takes under 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I must say it has really improved the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> Third it makes my hair so soft and light, like a fresh from the salon texture.</li>
            <li> heats up way fast.</li>
            <li> I got it in two days thanks to amazon prime but still stalked the UPS man...</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll be having straight-hair days a lot more frequently, now that it is no longer such a hassle.</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a great flat iron set - especially those with thick/coarse hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a huge upgrade from Walmart flat irons</li>
            <li> This flat iron runs so smoothly over your hair.</li>
            <li> HAI 206SE Blue Sapphire Titanium Convertible Styler Special Eau De Toiletteion, 1 1/4 Inches]]</li>
            <li> I had been using a couple of older drugstore straighteners.</li>
            <li> Seriously not only does it not damage my hair but actually keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li> The HAI also leaves my hair looking super shiny after I use it which is a new experience for me, I didn&#x27;t really believe flat irons would do that, but this one does.</li>
            <li> I highly  recommend this hair tool.</li>
            <li> So I finally grabbed it off Amazon USA at a great price including international shipping, and waited greedily the 3 or 4 days it took for DHL and Canada Post to get it into my grubby little hands.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a few reasons why I&#x27;m so glad I upgraded.</li>
            <li> Down Heat Glide (great product and will have your hair SOFT and not greasy/weighed down).</li>
            <li> but you can set the temperature setting, right next to it</li>
            <li> You can get your hair super straight quickly enough to where I actually don&#x27;t mind doing my hair now.</li>
            <li> Still own it today, however I&#x27;ve been forced to share it&#x27;s use with my 20 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Once again, WOW!</li>
            <li> This iron gets hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> The tutorial stated that it was imperative that one uses an iron hot enough.</li>
            <li> No more frizz even in this lovely Florida humidity</li>
            <li> :) My kids are mixed and my oldest daughter has the most difficult hair I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> My old one the plates had started peeling off, AFTER SIX YEARS OF USE!</li>
            <li> and I needed something hot enough to maintain my hair weave.</li>
            <li> Usually it takes a long time to straighten my hair but this time it was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience using a flat iron; the HAI was recommended by my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> (HAI 206SE BLUE Sapphire Titanium Convertible Flat IRON - SPECIAL EDITION)</li>
            <li> This one is light weight, gets hot enough to straighten even my thick long, super wavy hair in its \\&quot;natural state\\&quot; (i.e. air dryed, with tons of wave) in about 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Note: I have a LOT of brown, naturally straight, healthy, chest length, very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Then I up graded to this one at the recommendation of a coworker and noticed a considerable difference in the look of my hair.</li>
            <li> Thank god for Amazon that took action and refund my money.</li>
            <li> I do have to put in on the highest heat setting if my hair is in it&#x27;s natural state</li>
            <li> She loves it so far.</li>
            <li> With this flat Iron I can have glossy straight hair</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron</li>
            <li> I use it to hold the iron while it is hot and then zip the iron in the case (minus the cord) and then wrap the cord around the case.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and manageable and it only takes about 10 minutes to get the frizz out.</li>
            <li> kind of silly</li>
            <li> Took less than a minute to get to full heat, and again, less than ten minutes to get my unruly hair bone straight.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product, just does not work well with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it to curl yet, but I like that you can get straight hair that is slightly curled under on the bottom.</li>
            <li> normally its the other way around.</li>
            <li> She loves it so much she did away with her previous flat iron investment.  </li>
            <li> I have another way more expensive flat iron</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a solid flat iron and has become a staple in my routine.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I finally needed a new one because the cord was wearing thing, but that was after a decade of heavy use.  </li>
            <li> I had a flat iron I purchased from a discount beauty supply.  </li>
            <li> flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for a quality flat iron that I could also use for curling and that would straighen my long, thick, wavy hair in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> If anything does happen to my hair, it takes too long</li>
            <li> A 1 1/2&amp;#34; would be too big and the 1 1/4&amp;#34; are way harder to find.</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t do much with it because it&#x27;s so shiny and thick.</li>
            <li> the only issue I have is that it only lasted a little over two years.  </li>
            <li> I Purchased the HAI Convertible Flat Iron Limited Edition (PINK) with Brush and Thermal Travel Case over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Let me state up front that I cannot compare this flat iron to the CHIs and other high-end brands - don&#x27;t have a clue how well those work or how they compare to this one, because I&#x27;ve never used one of those.  </li>
            <li> : It curls like any other flat iron</li>
            <li> But outside of that I found out if when i turn it upside down I don&#x27;t adjust the temperature...</li>
            <li> With my other flat iron it would take about 45 minutes or sometimes longer!</li>
            <li> Really, I&#x27;ve never thought of it like that.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, but very solid.</li>
            <li> Let me explain my hair of a sec</li>
            <li> I will have to check out their other products.</li>
            <li> To my dismay, I was a bit disappointed as it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my old one had.  </li>
            <li> ha ha ha ha its not dry just really thick  </li>
            <li> Then I even put in a few of those glorious loose curls by twisting the iron through the strands like I&#x27;ve watched hair dressers do.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, naturally wavy, and often frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 4 months later and the plates are getting dull and it pulls and breaks my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was late last night when I got home.</li>
            <li> ALL-HANDS DOWN.  </li>
            <li> it just glide down her hair WEAVE</li>
            <li> For the past few years I had been using an Andis flat iron I bought from Walmart.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, coarse hair, and I would typically spend almost 20 minutes sectioning my hair, making at least two passes over each hank as I applied the not-very-hot irons to the hair.</li>
            <li> What a difference this little miracle has made for my hair.</li>
            <li> or I can curl the ends for a little body and bounce.</li>
            <li> I bought several years ago that I wasn&#x27;t that crazy about because it left my hair looking dry and dull after I used it-and you couldn&#x27;t curl with it as it&#x27;s squared on the edges.</li>
            <li> Be careful to anyone who buys as the buyer does not even correspond or gives refund!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not as heavy as some of the others I&#x27;ve had before.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, slightly wavy hair and can straighten with the HAI in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and usually I just need one pass to get straight/curl.</li>
            <li> I am black and my hair is very thick and on the frizzy side so that says alot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Contents: The carrying case is a hard shell with a zipper and felt-like inside.</li>
            <li> I have to put it on the highest setting because my hair is so thick and curly.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair (I use 2 thick rubber bands to put my hair up in a pony tail) and</li>
            <li> I usually try to go with the less expensive stuff but as they say, you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy frizzy hair which I hate..</li>
            <li> Also I was so tired of my so-so iron that didn&#x27;t seem to straighten my hair well or took forever to do so.</li>
            <li> I usually hate having to do my hair because it takes do dang long!</li>
            <li> One thing I did notice while using it, is that the temperature dial might increase or decrease - watch out and be wary of it staying at the correct temperature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to do curls with it, but that could just be me.  </li>
            <li> OH WHEN U PASS UR HAIR THROUGH THIS BAD BOY</li>
            <li> lol)&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed make the investment and your hair will thank you...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this as an anniversary gift for my girl friend and she never leaves home without it. she loves the fact that it warms up really fast and when she puts it on her hair she doesn&#x27;t have to leave it on there some much . the case it came with keeps everything protected so she can carry it in her car and use it when ever she needs it. one of the best gifts I have given her. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous hair straighteners and for this price, there is nothing else better that you can get.  I use mine every day and I have no complaints about it.  I have had it for over two years now and it is just as good as the day I got it in the mail.</li>
            <li> I Purchased the HAI Convertible Flat Iron Limited Edition (PINK) with Brush and Thermal Travel Case over a year ago.  I LOVE this product. It&#x27;s durability and longetivity has won me over. . ALL-HANDS DOWN.  Still own it today, however I&#x27;ve been forced to share it&#x27;s use with my 20 year old daughter.  She loves it so much she did away with her previous flat iron investment.  With that said, I purchased another like kind. (HAI 206SE BLUE Sapphire Titanium Convertible Flat IRON - SPECIAL EDITION) A Guaranteed worthwhile investment.</li>
            <li> Let me state up front that I cannot compare this flat iron to the CHIs and other high-end brands - don&#x27;t have a clue how well those work or how they compare to this one, because I&#x27;ve never used one of those.  I had been using a couple of older drugstore straighteners. Well, guess what? Those don&#x27;t work very well - I have long, thick, coarse hair, and I would typically spend almost 20 minutes sectioning my hair, making at least two passes over each hank as I applied the not-very-hot irons to the hair. Results were, at best, okay - to get better results, I had to spend longer, sectioning the hair into small sections (who has the patience for that?)  Well, obviously, this didn&#x27;t inspire me to straighten my hair too often.  Then my niece got this HAI Blue Sapphire Titanium Convertable  (WHY \\&quot;-able\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;-ible\\&quot;, I wonder?) from a local hair supplies store in Toronto. And her hair looked gorgeous. So I asked to try it.  WOW! What a difference! In under 10 minutes, my hair was shiny and smooth - heck, I&#x27;d say it looked good enough for hair modelling! I was hooked. Used it a few more times borrowed from my niece, and then went on the hunt to find it at a good price. Let&#x27;s just say this straightener costs twice as much in Canada as in the US. So I finally grabbed it off Amazon USA at a great price including international shipping, and waited greedily the 3 or 4 days it took for DHL and Canada Post to get it into my grubby little hands.  I received it on a \\&quot;curly\\&quot; day. Tried it out pretty much immediately, and I was freshly impressed. Took less than a minute to get to full heat, and again, less than ten minutes to get my unruly hair bone straight. Then I even put in a few of those glorious loose curls by twisting the iron through the strands like I&#x27;ve watched hair dressers do.  Once again, WOW! What a difference a good straightener makes!  I know I&#x27;ll be having straight-hair days a lot more frequently, now that it is no longer such a hassle. And the best thing is, as long as I am not washing my hair each day, the effect of the straightening lasts a couple of days! Yay!  I&#x27;ve had this thing just a couple of days, but from my previous experience using my niece&#x27;s one (the exact same model), I feel confident I&#x27;ve made a good investment that not only saved me money, but will also save me a lot of time on always-busy mornings.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B003WYB1BI HAI 206SE Blue Sapphire Titanium Convertible Styler Special Eau De Toiletteion, 1 1/4 Inches]] This was my first experience using a flat iron; the HAI was recommended by my hair stylist.  I have short wavy hair mixed with curl and it is medium thickness.  This flat iron is very easy to use and straightens my hair perfectly.  It also is easy to to use to shape the hair and add curl where I want it.  My hair looks almost as good as when my stylist does it, and I am a novice.  I am very pleased with the HAI flat iron so far.  I am also pleased with the price that I obtained through Amazon.  I would have paid $20 to $30 more if I&#x27;d bought it at my hair salon.</li>
            <li> Note: I have a LOT of brown, naturally straight, healthy, chest length, very thick hair. I usually can&#x27;t do much with it because it&#x27;s so shiny and thick. (Since I can&#x27;t so much with it, I can&#x27;t really style it or use products. They just don&#x27;t work because it doesn&#x27;t stay.) If anything does happen to my hair, it takes too long and I just give up. This iron just changed the way I do my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This iron gets hot enough to curl my hair. (I don&#x27;t even use the hottest setting either but I DO use heat-protection product in my hair.) It&#x27;s not heavy and is comfortable in my hand. It comes with two clips, a soft-shelled carrying case, and a comb. (See my pics.) The plates are a nice blue color and that gives it a unique look, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve also used this to flat-iron to flatten already straight hair more. It gives it more shine and gives my hair a more uniform look. This was (my saved-up) $$ well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(P.S. I saw a tutorial on Pinterest on how to curl your hair, and one of the irons mentioned was this one. The tutorial stated that it was imperative that one uses an iron hot enough. Really, I&#x27;ve never thought of it like that. Who really knows how much heat your own hair can take if you&#x27;re not a stylist?)</li>
            <li> What a difference this little miracle has made for my hair. I have naturally wavy frizzy hair which I hate.. With this flat Iron I can have glossy straight hair or I can curl the ends for a little body and bounce. Without pulling or breaking my hair. No more frizz even in this lovely Florida humidity :) I am in love with my new HAI!!!!</li>
            <li> I had a chi that I really loved but it stopped working after 3 months. My hairdresser suggested this iron and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!! More than worth the money I paid.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron; it makes my hair shine and heats up very fast.  I had a flat iron I purchased from a discount beauty supply.  Then I up graded to this one at the recommendation of a coworker and noticed a considerable difference in the look of my hair.</li>
            <li> I am loving it! The rounded shape of the clips is making twist a lot easier. Also, I had ceramic before, but the titanium does make my hair shinier and silky. Titanium is lighter in the weight, too. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This flat iron runs so smoothly over your hair. It heats up quickly and gets nice and hot! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, naturally wavy, and often frizzy hair. This flat iron straightens beautifully! The ONLY complaints I have about it aren&#x27;t really complaints... just annoyances because after all it does work perfectly. I dislike that the light blinks rapidly when its reached its temperature....normally its the other way around. I also wish it was digital as i need a lower setting for my bangs and the dial is a bit hit and miss. That&#x27;s it for negatives. Also! Great seller/distributor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of the higher-end straight irons over the years and this is my absolute favorite.  It heats up very quickly, does not damage my hair and gets the job done in record time.  I have extremely thick, slightly wavy hair and can straighten with the HAI in less than 10 minutes.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this iron! :) My kids are mixed and my oldest daughter has the most difficult hair I have ever seen. This iron went through it like nobody&#x27;s business! It does great on mine as well. Plus it is pretty and definitely is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! I usually try to go with the less expensive stuff but as they say, you get what you pay for...I&#x27;ve been using a 1&amp;#34; flat iron that was just ok but I&#x27;ve been letting my hair grow longer and wanted a 1 1/4&amp;#34; flat iron. A 1 1/2&amp;#34; would be too big and the 1 1/4&amp;#34; are way harder to find. Also I was so tired of my so-so iron that didn&#x27;t seem to straighten my hair well or took forever to do so. I started reading reviews at many websites and there is definitely a wide range of prices out there for something that they basically all try to do, which is smooth and straighten your hair. This iron had some great reviews and was in the mid price range. It really is a great flat iron! It heats up quickly and really does the job. It looks great and I love the fact that the controls are on the inside of the handle so when you use it, you&#x27;re not accidently turning it off or adjusting the heat. Great feature. Have only had it for about 4 months and hope it lasts for a very long time because it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> i bought the product and after only one use it stopped working. It was defective and i contacted the buyer through amazon twice but did not even respond back so i could return the item!! Thank god for Amazon that took action and refund my money. Be careful to anyone who buys as the buyer does not even correspond or gives refund!!!</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product, just does not work well with thick hair.  It does not get hot enough, therefore taking more time to complete hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand in college and it lasted me for 10 years.  I dropped it countless times and it survived.  I finally needed a new one because the cord was wearing thing, but that was after a decade of heavy use.  I really like this flat iron, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of my friend&#x27;s CHIs and they are just NOT the same! I love HAI and purchased this to replace my old one. My old one the plates had started peeling off, AFTER SIX YEARS OF USE! I don&#x27;t know if I own anything else that has lasted that long! Ha! I&#x27;ve never had any issues with the cord. The carrying case this one comes with is a bit bulky but I actually really like it! I use it to hold the iron while it is hot and then zip the iron in the case (minus the cord) and then wrap the cord around the case. It helps keep the cord from breaking. The clips and comb this comes with are nice too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was very nice! Would make a good gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, buy this. HAI is the best. I had super curly hair and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I got this straightener yesterday and tried it out the second i got it. I have to put it on the highest setting because my hair is so thick and curly. It worked so good and my hair was so straight and soft and shinny. Usually it takes a long time to straighten my hair but this time it was quick and easy. It was lightweight and heated up quickly. The carrying case,comb,and 2 section clips were a nice gift too. The clips did not slip from my hair. The carrying case was big and could fit the section clips,case,and comb. Amazing buy and i&#x27;ll straighten my hair more often :)</li>
            <li> I have to say working in the salon industry for 13 years,this is by far one of the best flatirons I have ever used! Glides through hair like silk and stays protected and even curls very well! Leaves hair super shiny! Just love this flatiron so glad I purchased it!! You will be very happy with this flatiron!!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to purchase a new straightener and when I saw this was a HAI, I thought I had scored a gem.  To my dismay, I was a bit disappointed as it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as my old one had.  I have a lot of hair (I use 2 thick rubber bands to put my hair up in a pony tail) and my hair is somewhat wavy so I needed a straightener that would get hot and straighten quickly.  If you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair then this straightener will be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li> This is currently my favorite flat iron I have right now! It gets very hot and FAST! For the price this kit is worth it. Not only is it sleek looking but it produces great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contents: The carrying case is a hard shell with a zipper and felt-like inside. This is great for storage/travel rather than under the sink or in a drawer - encouraging you to take care of this great flat iron (haha). It also comes with two pterodactyl looking hair clips and a rat tail comb. The accessories in tandem with regular use enhance your straightening experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: It curls like any other flat iron but I haven&#x27;t had any press lines - the edges of the plates are curved. This thing heats up very quickly! Be sure to try a lower temperature are first so you don&#x27;t fry you hair or walk around smelling like burnt hair! Also always use a thermal serum/protestant when applying heat to the hair - I highly suggest Redken Smooth Down Heat Glide (great product and will have your hair SOFT and not greasy/weighed down). One thing I did notice while using it, is that the temperature dial might increase or decrease - watch out and be wary of it staying at the correct temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a solid flat iron and has become a staple in my routine. I will have to check out their other products. I definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a great flat iron set - especially those with thick/coarse hair (I am African American with 4b/c hair). Also, check out the Redken Serum I mentioned as well; grape seed or coconut oil are great to use with this as well!</li>
            <li> Works better than the CHI, heats up super fast, doesn&#x27;t burn my hair, makes my hair shinier, silkier &amp; smoother than other straighteners do., (I have frizzy/wavy coarse hair).</li>
            <li> This was a great flat iron, I was very pleased with the job it did of straightening and smoothing.  the only issue I have is that it only lasted a little over two years.  It still works but it is shorting out.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on when you turn it from side to side.&lt;br /&gt;also, when I bought this, I paid around $50 dollars and now it is selling here on Amazon for $190!</li>
            <li> I highly  recommend this hair tool. After trying another brand and did not like it, this one is super for lift and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a really great flat iron! I have been on the hunt for a quality flat iron that I could also use for curling and that would straighen my long, thick, wavy hair in a reasonable amount of time. I usually hate having to do my hair because it takes do dang long! I have another way more expensive flat iron I bought several years ago that I wasn&#x27;t that crazy about because it left my hair looking dry and dull after I used it-and you couldn&#x27;t curl with it as it&#x27;s squared on the edges. It also took forever to get it really straight, even with it&#x27;s so called \\&quot;One Pass\\&quot; technology. This one is light weight, gets hot enough to straighten even my thick long, super wavy hair in its \\&quot;natural state\\&quot; (i.e. air dryed, with tons of wave) in about 25-30 minutes. For me that is huge. With my other flat iron it would take about 45 minutes or sometimes longer! The HAI also leaves my hair looking super shiny after I use it which is a new experience for me, I didn&#x27;t really believe flat irons would do that, but this one does. I do have to put in on the highest heat setting if my hair is in it&#x27;s natural state (i.e. not blow dried out with lots of wave), to get it really straight. But if I blow it out semi straight to begin with I can use a lower setting and it takes under 20 minutes. I haven&#x27;t used it to curl yet, but I like that you can get straight hair that is slightly curled under on the bottom. Looks much more natural. This really is a great flat iron,even for someone with a lot of hair and natural wave. You can get your hair super straight quickly enough to where I actually don&#x27;t mind doing my hair now. And the price can&#x27;t be beat. I would definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my girl. she seems to love it. i guess its good no problems so far. thanx</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this straightener. Not too heavy, but very solid. Does s a great job.</li>
            <li> I bought the HAI based on the reviews I had read.  I&#x27;m very glad that I did!  It does a wonderful job, doesn&#x27;t require very high heat for someone like me with fine hair, and heats up super fast.  I find it difficult to do curls with it, but that could just be me.  I wish it had an auto-off, just in case I forget to turn it off one morning.  It looks great, and I love the clips that comes with it!  It&#x27;s also not as heavy as some of the others I&#x27;ve had before.  I think I prefer this over the Chi!</li>
            <li> This product did everything I wanted it to do. It arrived promptly and it takes all the frizz out of my hair. My hair feels soft and manageable and it only takes about 10 minutes to get the frizz out. Yes, I would definitely recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this iron for about a month and I must say it has really improved the texture of my hair. For the past few years I had been using an Andis flat iron I bought from Walmart. Here&#x27;s a few reasons why I&#x27;m so glad I upgraded. First there is absoultely no pulling when passing the iron through my hair with the Sapphire iron, it glides through my hair like a hot knife through butter. Second it heats quick, less than half a minute and usually I just need one pass to get straight/curl. I am black and my hair is very thick and on the frizzy side so that says alot. Third it makes my hair so soft and light, like a fresh from the salon texture. My stylist told me since I&#x27;ve used it she&#x27;s so impressed with how healthy looking my hair is. She told me that it&#x27;s less damaging to use a good iron at high heat with fewer passes than using a not so hot iron with more passes. Seriously not only does it not damage my hair but actually keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking it was going to be like the last Hai I purchased.  Even though it was not the same style and color of plates.  I figured it would last me a good 1year or 2.  It&#x27;s been 4 months later and the plates are getting dull and it pulls and breaks my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d think twice before buying this model.</li>
            <li> best straightner i have ever used. you will love it! heats up way fast. comes with a awesome caring case</li>
            <li> PROS&lt;br /&gt;Heat up quickly&lt;br /&gt;The iron is sexy idk how it can but its prettier in person the box that it come In I don&#x27;t even want to throw it away the clips are sturdy to hold my hair and the rat tail come is cool as well ... You get the entire package ...&lt;br /&gt;First off this is a good flat iron ..I got it in two days thanks to amazon prime but still stalked the UPS man... I think he jumped when the bushes moved ... Anyway couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair to give it a try but it was late last night when I got home. so i found my sister and asked can i do her hair to test it out it worked wonderfully it just glide down her hair WEAVE THAT IS ..Let me explain my hair of a sec my mother said it feels like a Brillo pad ha ha ha ha its not dry just really thick  at the roots and is really frizzy, I can&#x27;t decide if I want to be relaxed or happy nappy ... I tried the flat iron out and AWESOME (point blank period dot dot dot ) oh yes sir it gave my hair body and shine I have shoulder length hair... OH WHEN U PASS UR HAIR THROUGH THIS BAD BOY OH YES YES THE GLIDE IS OH SO SMOOTH. IF MY HAIR HAD A G SPOT THIS IRON FOUND IT, ITS THAT GOOD... I FINISHED MY HAIR TIED IT UP FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS to see if the frizz would be gone ans it was AND MY HAIR IS STILL STR8 smooth...  I can feel my scalp ( forgot i even had one )so I knw this will work for my leave out when I get a sew in..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS only one&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s kind of silly but you can set the temperature setting, right next to it there is an LED light and the light flashes until it the iron has reached maximum temperature ( but u can still use it ) my only pet peeve is when i curl my hair I some how adjust the temperature and the light keeps on blinking even tho it is HOT AS HELL ( 390 degrees is what i used ) when I adjust it the LED light stops blinking but I some how manage to touch it again ... But I worked around it even though I touch the temperature dial I&#x27;ve never accidentally move it to 410 degrees which is the maxI always make sure... But outside of that I found out if when i turn it upside down I don&#x27;t adjust the temperature...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all the $75 was worth it&#x27;s a huge upgrade from Walmart flat irons (forgive me walmart lol)&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed make the investment and your hair will thank you... Going out side to get the Pantene pro effect .. You knw beautiful hair blowing thru the wind ... Oh yes ...</li>
            <li> It was a gift to my daughter. She found it on the internet and we ordered it because of its ratings.She loves it so far.</li>
            <li> I had a ceramic iron and I wanted to try a titanium.I have very curly hair. I love this iron. It straightens great and makes my hair feel smooth!</li>

            <li> Such a great flat iron!
