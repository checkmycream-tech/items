            <li>One of my good friends is a hair stylist and recommended I try the Croc.</li>
            <li>if the majority are good</li>
            <li>While it did do a good job when it was functioning</li>
            <li>I really loved the way it straightened/styled my hair</li>

            <li>I bought this straightener a 3 years ago and loved it.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through my fair share of straighteners and</li>
            <li>I was delighted with the way this iron worked....</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s still in good condition.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this one thinking it would be just as good.</li>
            <li>I received it in good time.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!!!</li>

            <li>and I do love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>the power cord is cheap and the iron turns on and off every time the cord moves which is ALL THE TIME!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>LOVE this Croc!</li>
            <li>My stylist recommend it for me and it has been amazing on my hair.  </li>
            <li>This amazing iron was well taken care of, but now it stops working on its own.</li>
            <li>Yes, the iron is amazing when it works.</li>
            <li>Amazing Price for salon results.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing tool.</li>
            <li>This iron had done amazing things to my hair throughout the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The best price &amp; free shipping is on Amazon, which is why I love Amazon :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the kind of person that does a lot of research and depend on the reviews given by others who have purchased the product.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I was kind of conflicted after reading through some of the reviews.</li>
            <li>Works awesome on all hair types and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>but I do not like it as much as I liked the Croc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair is gorgeous because of it and receives many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I really liked it...until it quit working</li>
            <li>Unlike the Chi, it comes with instructions, which are definitely handy when it comes to temperature control for example.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a reliable, effective straightener that doesn&#x27;t break the bank, stop your search here.</li>
            <li>It did straighten my hair leaving a nice shine.</li>
            <li>When you spend that kind of money, you expect to have them for a lifetime.</li>
            <li>this iron makes my hair really straight, love it!!!</li>
            <li>It is so worth it!!!</li>
            <li>The price is so worth it!!!</li>
            <li>The Croc Classic started out to be a wonderful product comparable to the Rusk</li>
            <li>It came quickly and worked great for 2 months, then died.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you stock up on some good gloss  :)</li>
            <li>Works great and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I am very impressed so far with the Croc!</li>
            <li>Very happy so far!</li>
            <li>Its is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Think this is by far the best hair tool I have.</li>
            <li>It looks nice in my bathroom, :)</li>
            <li>This is by far the best straightener that I have ever had.</li>
            <li>After buying and using the CROC Nano Titanium iron, I have to say this is by far the BEST iron I have used on my multi-racial curly, color-treated hair!</li>
            <li>So far, a great purchase!</li>
            <li>I have had Great Success by being able to Style my own hair and having the Style hold.</li>
            <li>By far, the best straightener I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>it work perfect and professional</li>
            <li>the Croc is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is by far the best straightener out there.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy and shiny and it&#x27;s just AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It has an easy grip, no tangle cord, and effortlessly straightens my hair!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and seems to leave my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>It is very good quality, and I high recommend it.</li>
            <li>The digital temperature control is great because not everyone needs to use 450 degrees for great results.</li>
            <li>Great product heats up very fast and keeps the temperature.  </li>
            <li>Good price for a very good flat iron.</li>
            <li>The grip is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of pressure to operate.</li>
            <li>Overall, great deal and amazing results!</li>
            <li>It has a great ergonomic design, it gets plenty hot, and it does the job in one pass, even on the most kinky curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Safe to use and received product quickly!!</li>
            <li>and it really works great.  </li>
            <li>It fits my hand nicely and is light.  </li>
            <li>However, at about the 6 month mark (like so many others), it started to turn itself off even when I wasn&#x27;t holding it or when I hadn&#x27;t inadvertently shut it off.</li>
            <li>Now, when it shut off on its own there was no beeping sound.</li>
            <li>Just get one for your self, you will \\&quot;LOVE IT\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My friends and family would consider me a \\&quot;hair snob\\&quot; as I only use the best products on the mane!  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Okay,</li>
            <li>Great iron heats up fast and gives you salon hair, I also like the safety turn off option.</li>
            <li>cousin recommended this item and I have to say we love it</li>
            <li>and we feel it works better than the Chi...</li>
            <li>I was OK with this.</li>
            <li>Unless you have $80 to take a chance, I would go with something that is a bit more reliable.</li>
            <li>Just want to make sure everyone pays attention to the statement by Amazon that says this&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li>and it wouldn&#x27;t heat more than 69 degrees.  </li>
            <li>Love, love love.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have one as well and love</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this iron.</li>
            <li>Also love the auto-off feature.  </li>
            <li>am i pleased.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never been able to.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>i LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I am as well contacting the Better Business Bureau to report them.</li>
            <li>I have no problems with the Chi straighteners, but the Croc is absolutely better.  </li>
            <li>It retails for more than a Chi, so be sure to get it on sale, but you will be satisfied.  </li>

            <li>Best flat iron I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Best Flat Iron I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li>Ordered this one because of the high temp (450)&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;She told me it was perfect; gets hot fast and does a great job.</li>
            <li>This was a great flatiron and came highly recommended by my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and very light.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li>It came in so fast and it works amazing!</li>
            <li>first time I used it I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, leaves my hair so silky smooth, it is definitely the best straightening iron I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enough with the good, now for the REAL!</li>
            <li>That said, the reviews seemed pretty good for this brand, and it is a brand</li>
            <li>and I love it, so easy, you can select your degrees</li>
            <li>My hair becomes very frizzy in humid weather, and my Croc has done a great job keeping my hair smooth throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a good buy if you simply just want to straighten your hair, i do not think its good for styling (aka curling with the straightener)</li>
            <li>This was a great deal, cheaper than the store I buy my professional products from!</li>
            <li>This iron is totally worth every penny and more for all that it does!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time on my own last night and my hair turned out just as perfect as if I had just walked out of the salon!</li>
            <li>I was worried that I might not be able to curl my hair with it, but it curls just fine.</li>
            <li>Has very high heat and good size.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the design of the Croc; slim and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>It was a bit tricky for me to feel comfortable to use but the hand grips made it better.</li>
            <li>The straightening plates glide smoothly, and I like being able to adjust temperature depending on which sections of hair I&#x27;m straightening.</li>
            <li>It also adds a great natural shine to your hair.</li>
            <li>Great price for a professional quality item.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I had to give it another chance.</li>
            <li>not even a week after I ordered it, it was in great condition and it leaves my hair super smooth and very straight</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and I feel confident that it will safely turn off if for some reason I forget to unplug it.  </li>
            <li>By the way, my true rating on this item and seller is a 0!</li>
            <li>and it still works good as new!</li>
            <li>My clients are leaving with a big smile, it makes my day great!!!</li>
            <li>It was a shockingly easy process and I attribute that to this iron.  </li>
            <li>and I can straighten it very quickly and easily with this iron.  </li>
            <li>I have had to purchase three of these irons in one year because they easily break.</li>
            <li>It lets you easily turn the ends of your hair in or out depending on the look you&#x27;re going for</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and use.</li>
            <li>Temperature is easily adjustable.</li>
            <li>it heats up very quickly, which is digitially read out.  </li>
            <li>It feels well made and the cord feels strong.</li>
            <li>I have had this straightener for over 5 years and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old grand daughter, tried her Aunt&#x27;s, when on vacation and loved this iron for her hair.  </li>
            <li>Heck, I still have a Hot Tools that I had 20 years ago, still works, but no, it doesn&#x27;t work as good as the CROC DID, but it certainly works better than the CROC now, since the CROC stays on at most 5 seconds at a time.</li>
            <li>I can see where the higher temps would work good to quickly pass over the hair to straighten</li>
            <li>Apparently it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also super light, and easy to maneuver!</li>
            <li>Friends of mine have used it and asked about it because they liked it so much!</li>
            <li>I love this styling tool and highly recommend to achieve that salon style in your own home.</li>
            <li>easy to use and accurate temperature.</li>
            <li>I plugged it into my converter (everything else worked fine)</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and gets tangled easily and the plates are extremely smooth and do not pull my hair.</li>
            <li>hair takes half the time it use to and stays perfect.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t pull out tons of hair, and creates beautiful straight hair without the need for heat-protecting spray.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I love the iron and is actually my favorite but unfortunately not reliable.&lt;br /&gt;Moving</li>
            <li>My hair has never straightened so quickly!  </li>
            <li>If you like to make your hair very straight this is an excellent flat iron.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly and so far has worked great.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome flat iron, heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;tug\\&quot; on hair, leaves hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>I really liked the swivel feature, but I had to hold the cord a certain way to get it to stay on.</li>
            <li>My first croc classic was great.  </li>
            <li>It glides through my hair and leaves a smooth silky finish.  </li>
            <li>It prevents damage and runs smoothly over your hair.</li>
            <li>T was really hoping that this would be an amazing straightner.</li>
            <li>it makes a beeping sound.</li>
            <li>have no notice when it shuts itself off (no beeping sound) and</li>
            <li>Your hair is smooth and shiney after using.  </li>
            <li>So I had three weeks of awesome blow dried crappy hair.  </li>
            <li>Was great but only lasted 3 months before it just died!!</li>
            <li>replaced the cheap flatiron with another Croc.</li>
            <li>Got the iron it worked great for about 4 weeks after that the iron heated only to 150 degrees, which did nothing to my hair!  </li>
            <li>and it was the cheapest I had ever seen so even though I was nervous about it being so cheap</li>
            <li>I had a cheap one from Walmart to start with.  </li>
            <li>The product worked great for one hair straightening treatment and about 10 regular uses before it just stopped working altogether.</li>
            <li>It claimed to have 100% ceramic plates that would create smooth, glossy and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>This product did great until recently.</li>
            <li>It worked great and was in same price range</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for several years and it has done me proud.</li>
            <li>It worked great until last week, December 2012.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the heat settings to what you are comfortable with.  </li>
            <li>I have shown this straightener to a few of my friends with wavy hair and it can both straighten AND add a beautiful curl in minutes!</li>
            <li>Because the item was still under warranty, Turboion replaced it for me free of charge (aside from the gas I used to drive an hour to get there).</li>
            <li>However, the iron doesn&#x27;t light up where the infrared light is supposed to come out.  </li>
            <li>It would have been great, but it only worked one time.</li>
            <li>I luv how smooth my hair gets from it.  </li>
            <li>Then I used it only two more times and the results each time were not as good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Good professional quality product</li>
            <li>The only reason why I am giving this item 2 stars is because it is honestly THE BEST flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is a very good, hot and easy to use flat iron.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and perfect flat iron.</li>
            <li>Very smart decision choosing this brand, and m glad I did</li>
            <li>They sent a heat resistant pouch/mat to protect your table surfaces (a great accesory for flat iron users).  </li>
            <li>Great flat iron.</li>
            <li>Great flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Great flat iron, recommended to me by the salon I go to</li>
            <li>It would be a great flat iron if it lasted longer..</li>
            <li>Great flat iron, heats up in seconds!</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT flat iron!  </li>
            <li>I liked the ease and style the Croc Classic produced and ordered one through Amazon.</li>
            <li>This iron gets very hot very quickly.</li>
            <li>I could hear my hair snapping as I tried to pull it through my hair--and no, my hair is pretty healthy</li>
            <li>BUT Im pretty sure it wont.  </li>
            <li>I love how hot it gets.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this in order to do a keratin treatment to my hair.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron that ever used to get very hot straight and see her with one swipe</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>So far, I have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This makes me wonder if it was a refurbished item, since I owned another one of these in the past and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>It never was misused, I always kept it in the original box in a drawer in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I love how it shows the temp, (350 is plenty) because it can get so hot that you produce a burnt smell.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair super smooth super quick!</li>
            <li>The digitial temp reading is precise and it gets to desired temp quickly.  </li>
            <li>Runs super smooth over hair, does not snag hairs.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly with precise heat.</li>
            <li>The plate surfaces are super smooth and glide on my hair.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>This is the most amazing flat iron I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron on the market.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Works good and get hot fast its the best but only last 4months.</li>
            <li>Probably the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST flat iron I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>Works amazing for my naturally curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Worked great for about a year, used usually 4 times a week at most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always owned fairly \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; straighteners--just ones I picked up at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li>I would pay full price for this Iron...</li>
            <li>I purchased the 1 inch plate which is good for short to medium hair length.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two of these and loved them when they work, but they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>favorite part: It &#x27;remembers&#x27; your heat setting and beeps when ready.  </li>
            <li>I love how fast it straightens my hair and my hair</li>
            <li>I have only good things to say.</li>
            <li>I love how fast it heats up and how shiny it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>and I wake up with it looking just as good the next day.</li>
            <li>I love how straight it makes my hair look.</li>
            <li>it worked well, did a good job, lasted only 3 months.</li>
            <li>This is the best straightener I have ever owned for thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I purchased them from beauty supply stores at FULL PRICE ($150 and $160).</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this iron is that it heats up SUPER fast.</li>
            <li>-grip handle - does a beautiful job.&lt;br /&gt;The first croc classic remembered my preferred heat setting which is 300 degrees for my naturally wavyfine hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So easy and fast!</li>
            <li>I got this one for a super deal on Amazon but after using it I would have paid full price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially comfortable to hold; ergonomic, unlike any other I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>tried my own today for the first time, and same results - Shiny, silky, smooth hair!.  </li>
            <li>I loved my Croc flat iron as soon as I got it</li>
            <li>I LOVED this flat iron until I traveled to India.  </li>
            <li>I just finished hair school &amp; wanted to reward myself w/ a really good flat iron</li>
            <li>This flat iron is really good.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this flat iron to straighten my hair; I loved the results.</li>
            <li>I loved the results of the flat iron</li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses this flat iron and I loved how it worked with my hair.</li>
            <li>The flat iron did a good job.</li>
            <li>and I received the flat iron within a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>good flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I obviously haven&#x27;t experienced that yet, but I really think it has a lot to do with how you handle and care for the straightener.</li>
            <li>I obviously haven&#x27;t experienced that yet, but I really think it has a lot to do with how you handle and care for the straightener.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair</li>
            <li>SUPER PISSED, turned off while I was using it</li>
            <li>The iron heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>It heats up incredibly quickly and lets you decide the temperature to which it goes.</li>

            <li>Is what was described and delivered quickly</li>
            <li>just great if you want straight hair in a short amount of time!</li>
            <li>Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever purchased,  even compared to a chi which is significantly more expensive.  </li>
            <li>It saves a lot of time in the morning when I can just quickly press those wavy strands and have a polished look and out of the door in no time.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick saving you valuable time when in a rush.</li>
            <li>Heats up so quick.</li>
            <li>Heats up very fast and is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this product gets so hot and is so smooth that it flattens my curls quickly</li>
            <li>When I went to replace it, I saw a much cheaper flat iron with great reviews and purchased that</li>
            <li>The Croc is definitely the best flat iron I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Wasnt as nice as my cheap flat irons.</li>
            <li>Heats up in 10-15 seconds and is very hot.</li>
            <li>great flat iron fast shipper</li>
            <li>The croc gets very hot (over 140 degrees) in under five seconds.</li>
            <li>So far, the absolute best flat iron I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Worked great for the LESS THAN 1 YEAR that I owned it.</li>
            <li>heats well, easy &amp; fast straightener</li>
            <li>Fast and easy both times that I purchased this item.</li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron in June 2012 for $77 after reading the excellent reviews and borrowing a Croc flat iron from a friend.  </li>
            <li>This is the first straightener that work!  </li>
            <li>I thought I burnt my hair off at first!</li>
            <li>I thought I burnt my hair off at first!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly on my damn near untameable hair, which stays straight for long time after.</li>
            <li>I will not be purchasing any big ticket items off of amazon any more!</li>
            <li>so sizzled my bangs first try!</li>
            <li>They need to work out the kinks first before I ever buy another!</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend using a heat glove, considering your hair gets pretty hot</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>hair is VERY curly and fine.</li>
            <li>When I first received this flat iron I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>My croc flat iron arrived quickly and the price was amazing.  </li>
            <li>With Amika I always end up with silky smooth straight hair.</li>
            <li>Hair stays straight and frizz free for days.  </li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Seeing that someone else does the same kind of put me in their shoes.</li>
            <li>I would recommend staring out with the lower heat settings 350-380 because even on the craziest hair I rarely need to use any hotter then that.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a nice change from the t3</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this product, and so far I really love it.</li>
            <li>The price at Amazon is better than even the professional supply houses.  </li>
            <li>This iron leaves my hair smooth, soft, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>We already own a Rusk brand iron that we had purchased over a year ago at our local salon.  </li>
            <li>So far, I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>Worth the expense.</li>
            <li>I paid about $100 and thought it was worth my money</li>
            <li>Worth the money, and I can attest to</li>
            <li>I would wear my hair back/up about 80% of my life because the hassle just wasn&#x27;t worth it....</li>
            <li>Great straightener, as if I had bought it from the store, but at half the price!</li>
            <li>It could not tame my frizzy hair where the Croc has always worked quick, easy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The heat is consistent, heats up quickly, and is non-damaging to color treated hair.</li>
            <li>, it heats up pretty quick...</li>
            <li>It does a quick job of things, which I did see first hand over the holidays in the guest room at some relatives house.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I LOVED my Croc iron, until it died.</li>
            <li>She had me try it first to see if I would love as much as she does, and I was absolutely astonished with the results...</li>
            <li>She recently started doing brazilian blowouts and loves the straighter look, which holds pretty good, but tends to not stay as straight as it should after treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li>right)</li>
            <li>My wife knew what she wanted and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Well for the first 6 months it worked amazing but all of a sudden one day as I was doing my hair</li>
            <li>This iron has adjustable heat settings, a super long cord and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This iron does get extremely hot (exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!)</li>
            <li>You can dial the temperature you want that works best with your hair type and it works on your wet (damp) hair as well as dry hair.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, like in an instant and have an auto shut off button which was ok for me.</li>
            <li>I am Cuban and have really kinky curly and full hair...</li>
            <li>I have to say, the flat iron is easy to use, and glides smoothly through her hair.  </li>
            <li>It glides through my hair so easily and makes it so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and works very well.</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>It so happens that my last one was a Croc and lasted 5+yrs, but I still thoroughly researched and found a few that seemed the best.  </li>
            <li>The best flatiron I&#x27;ve ever had for my thick natural hair</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast, straightens and smoothes my wavy hair with ease.</li>
            <li>and it still works like new!!!</li>
            <li>like this iron very much.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast as well.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>I use these flat irons everyday, they do awesome on my hair.</li>
            <li>Loved the flat iron but not having a warranty sucked since these break so frequently.</li>
            <li>I have medium-length, fine hair that&#x27;s naturally wavy and surprisingly pretty stubborn to straighten, but the Croc makes it a breeze.</li>
            <li>I am actually able to straighten my hair quickly, as it heats up very fast, and it also cools down quickly too.</li>
            <li>After the first week the heating element stopped working.</li>
            <li>I cant believe that I paid that much money for it!</li>
            <li>I am a hairdresser and this is exactly what I needed, love the digital temp read out.</li>
            <li>The morning I first used it, I thought \\&quot;this is it???\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>First things first, my croc did arrive on time as promised.</li>
            <li>; I love that the croc has an adjustable digital temperature.</li>
            <li>The first pass through my hair scared me, because it literally just glided through my hair.</li>
            <li>The first pass through my hair scared me, because it literally just glided through my hair.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied with the return policy also!</li>
            <li>The first one I had lasted about 18 months and then just died.  </li>
            <li>two months is NOT enough time for me to say I am satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>and I love that its display is digital.</li>
            <li>Not only was it fabulous for my own coarse, frizzy hair, but also, since I am a hairstylist I have been using it for all the keratin treatments on my clients.</li>
            <li>Her hair is so straight and shiny after using this that she feels like the salon did it!</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I use it on 420- 430 because sometimes 450 is too hot.</li>
            <li>The first one had a thinner power cord and the piece of plastic covering the end of the cord broke, then it shorted out after about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Ive tried many over the years and finally gave in a bought the one</li>
            <li>But it gets to the point where I have to wait 5 minutes before being able to turn it back on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to return it and look for another iron that would do exactly what I thought the Hana Elite would do.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t stick straight against my head at all!</li>
            <li>it heats up EXTREMELY fast!</li>
            <li>Gets hot faaaaast and my hair feels softer.</li>
            <li>I am sure I would have gotten the same response.</li>
            <li>exactly (probably) how hot it is.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this iron!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The temperature is great but please be mindful that the higher temps will burn your hair if used often and left on the hair too long.</li>
            <li>but this straightener works so well and fast!</li>
            <li>I was exactly as the description said.  </li>
            <li>I guess my expectations of it were higher, so I was not blown away after using it.</li>
            <li>This Croc gets really hot</li>
            <li>I only use it a couple times a week, but I love that I can adjust the heat setting so that it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li>The fact of the matter is, they simply last longer and hold up better than the cheaper ones</li>
            <li>My first daughter has one</li>
            <li>I thought I would give the company a pass after writing them when my first iron went out within 7 months.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I checked into one for Christmas, and even though it was a bit expensive from my retirement income, it was so worth it for her, as she just loves it, and uses every day, so I am sure in the &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; run it is the best to pay a better price for the quality that you get for a product that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it is.....</li>
            <li>It broke within the first month of me using it.</li>
            <li>and it gets hot and then shuts off.</li>
            <li>When I try to turn it on again it won&#x27;t get hot anymore.</li>
            <li>The first time I thought it was a fluke.</li>
            <li>but luckily I still had my classic.</li>
            <li>This is not my first one.</li>
            <li>The plates get hot and works well.  </li>
            <li>it gets hot in seconds and make my hair</li>
            <li>I dropped my first one from about 5 feet onto a hardwood floor.  </li>
            <li>Just ordered another one after 3 years of use from my first order.  </li>
            <li>Got here in two days exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact one she had used on my hair.</li>
            <li>The item is sleek and has a pretty ergonomic grip.</li>
            <li>I loved the product until it stopped working a few days ago.</li>
            <li>So easy and quick flat ironing.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid environment and after I use my Croc in the morning my hair stays frizz free all day, with NO anti-frizz product.</li>
            <li>up super fast which is a real plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really gets your hair straight and does it quickly.  </li>
            <li>but my old flat irons really pulled my hair even though they worked good.</li>
            <li>My first flat iron was a Solia, which was ok</li>
            <li>and i would most deftly recommend it, I would trade it for any other flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron</li>
            <li>I have used many flat irons.</li>
            <li>Being a hairstylist I have used many flat irons over the years.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>LOVE MY FLAT IRON.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite flat Iron!</li>
            <li>Love Croc Flat Irons!</li>
            <li>I actually have one and love it so much</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this to quickly get ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Digital heat temp makes it really easy to know how hot it is.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s mostly dry is fine!</li>
            <li>THIS FLAT IRON IS AMAZINGGGGG!!! :-)</li>
            <li>and I tried so many Irons but Crock flat Iron rocks!!!</li>
            <li>Love the long cord.</li>
            <li>I have long, curly hair and love that I can adjust the heat level.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, when my first croc bit the dust, I researched for hours and didn&#x27;t like anything else on the market as much.</li>
            <li>(but prone to flyaways), looks and feels better, and stays straight far longer than with my old straightener.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My wife has this flat iron and absolutely loved it until it stopped heating and would only reach around 200 degrees.</li>
            <li>The hair stylist recommended a few brands, some of which, such as GHD, do not have good reviews on Amazon, as they are cheap knock offs.  </li>
            <li>It usually takes a good hour to straighten my hair</li>
            <li>I have mixed hair and previous straighteners would work, but not that great, and my hair would go frizzy at the first hint of humidity.</li>
            <li>have to say, I have been nothing but pleased with the performance and overall high quality of this product.  </li>
            <li>It came in a nice black box.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving this review 2 stars is because I&#x27;m sure the straightener is fine as long as you don&#x27;t take it over 430...</li>
            <li>I loved my Croc flat iron for the first 5 months because that&#x27;s how long it lasted before it broke!</li>
            <li>I love the digital display, and the whole product just seems high quality.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had a single problem. :)</li>
            <li>I ended up trying to tape it a certain way</li>
            <li>The old iron I used was an inexpensive model and did not get very hot or have a large surface area.</li>
            <li>My choices were either to send it to them for a free analysis and they would repair it for $15-60 or I can purchase a brand new one directly from them for $80 and</li>
            <li>My husband is an electrician, and he took it apart and the wires are coming loose from the iron, which explains why so many reviews complain that they just quit working.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t need to be set very high</li>
            <li>That was the main criteria for me: to have a good iron which would take very little time to use.</li>
            <li>It has a nice digital temperature display, makes hair shine and smooth like no other, excelente for brazilian keratin treatments, no static eletricity or frizz, the black titanium really makes a big diference, and the price is the best you can find.</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve had moderate success, but this flat iron is the greatest one I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>My hair, which I will admit is straight anyway</li>
            <li>My 17-year-old daughter even noticed and said my hair looked much prettier.</li>
            <li>It feels very sturdy!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I really like the look and feel of it.</li>
            <li>I am left with smooth sleek hair every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>I decided to take the plunge and after much research I decided on this croc.  </li>
            <li>My hair now stays straight through the summer humidity</li>
            <li>I had to play with the temperature, because I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I would really like a response from the company selling this product.</li>
            <li>Really bummed.</li>
            <li>and I would really recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade.</li>
            <li>There really haven&#x27;t been any negatives about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li>I purchased the item for much cheaper than I could find in any store.</li>
            <li>when I used the straightener I curled it in a bit and it created so much volume.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend really likes it</li>
            <li>Do we really think that they would have even replaced it at the two month point when it quit working???</li>
            <li>cannot recommend this to anyone for that very reason.</li>
            <li>Heat up very quick.&lt;br /&gt;One problem.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and in no time it flattens it as if I was in the salon.</li>
            <li>Heats fast, heats to the 400 degree&#x27;s, has auto turn off.</li>
            <li>Makes getting ready a breeze.  </li>
            <li>Con - maybe gets my hair too straight</li>
            <li>It straightens my hair so fast</li>
            <li>and it does come out thinner and really straight.</li>
            <li>I am very upset.</li>
            <li>Hair is silky straight and looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy &amp; unmanageable hair &amp;</li>
            <li>Gets my hair pin straight.</li>
            <li>The S-Curl of course makes her hair wavy, but she prefers her hair straight.</li>
            <li>Very durable.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hair was really shining after I used.</li>
            <li>I normally buy these at distributer stores and this was the first one I bought from amazon.</li>
            <li>Hair done in 20-25 mins and it STAYS straight.</li>
            <li>have not used it much.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have read more reviews before I spent my money.</li>
            <li>My wife has very wavy hair with lots of volume.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks much</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, this product flattens and smoothes, my hairdresser is jealous.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use it that much</li>
            <li>(very curly)</li>
            <li>Very close to the croc.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thought it was ready to use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and it is always straight when I am done.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>She really likes the way it functions,</li>
            <li>Comparing the croc to my old straightener, this one definitely makes my hair look and feel a lot better.</li>
            <li>Comparing the croc to my old straightener, this one definitely makes my hair look and feel a lot better.</li>
            <li>I liked this product, but it stopped working after a few months.  </li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s supposed to be for &#x27;professional use only&#x27;. :)</li>
            <li>I love my new flat iron!!</li>
            <li>However, I am not very happy with it as it does not perform as good as Amika.</li>
            <li>This is the only flat iron that gets hot enough to straighten and make my frizzy hag hair and make it feel soft and look beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Save your money or buy the iron directly from Croc!!!</li>
            <li>LAME!&lt;br /&gt;Although the flat irons are AMAZING, they do NOT last</li>
            <li>MY HAIR GETS SO FLAT AND SOFT AND LOOKS HEALTHY.</li>
            <li>It cuts back my hair straightening time significantly.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic flat iron...</li>
            <li>The two lessons for all of you out there are: 1)Croc makes cheap flat irons, and 2)you should check to see if the product you are thinking of buying on Amazon has a warranty that covers the product if it is purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The plates glide smoothly over my hair, and leaves my hair shiny and flat.  </li>
            <li>I hope you have the same success I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li>THAN I PAID 10$ MORE FOR THE OTHER ONE OVER THIS ONE..</li>
            <li>DONT PAY MORE FOR THE OTHER IRON</li>
            <li>Unlike many other products, you don&#x27;t have to repeatedly go over and over your hair.</li>
            <li>It does get hotter than most straighteners I&#x27;ve used, so be careful not to set the heat too high.</li>
            <li>I purchased many different flat irons in the past, none have done as good a job as this has.</li>
            <li>It was great while it worked, but then suddenly stopped working after a couple of months and it was past the Amazon refund date, they won&#x27;t replace it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working great, but last week it got \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; at 280 degrees and will not heat up past 280</li>
            <li>Granted my hair is kind of, but not completely, on the thinner side and coarse.</li>
            <li>a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item because it came highly recommended by my therapist, also known as my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, the digital temperature display is very helpful.</li>
            <li>, that I know I will enjoy for a long time.</li>
            <li>My first thoughts were, &amp;#34;Wow, this one&#x27;s heavier than my old one.</li>
            <li>I use mine at about 350, which is near the median, and it is gentler on my hair than some of the higher settings.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair straightener, its so awesome, it really really decreased the time that I actually spent on with my other straightner</li>
            <li>and it literally melted down to the point that the (famous) titanium plates fell out.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many other flat irons for my wife over the last 10 years but this one has proven to be the most reliable.  </li>
            <li>Does good job straightening the hair, but it did not cut the ironing by a lot of time for me, when compared to my previous flat iron.</li>
            <li>I always look to see how many good reviews there are for a product in comparison to bad ones -</li>
            <li>One pass is mostly all I need to flatten my wavy hair (from a previous perm).</li>
            <li>Better than my previously owned Chi.</li>
            <li>review in particular won me over about the croc - the one that said it straightens &amp;#34;lumpy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I always read customer reviews to get a realistic description of a product.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks 100% better since I started using the Croc (had previously used an older model Helen of Troy staightener).  </li>
            <li>My Hair Stylist utilizes the Croc Classic for her Salon.</li>
            <li>I will spend my money elsewhere and be treated better and get a different straighner that wont short out in 13 months.</li>
            <li>I BROUGHT\\&quot;TurboIon Croc Classic TITANIUM \\&quot;  </li>
            <li>THIS IRON HAS CROC CLASSIC NANO</li>
            <li>In fact, the salon he works at sells this same model for more than double what I paid for it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I called back Amazon a 3rd time, and at this point they told me since it was more than 6 months from the date of purchase, there was nothing they can do.</li>
            <li>I owned the classic nano and within about 9 months, it stopped working.</li>
            <li>As of yesterday, my classic iron stopped working -_______-.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, and results last longer.</li>
            <li>This amazing flat iron has a digital temperature guide that tells you when it is hot enough.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I tried the highly rated Sedu, but I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li>Received on time and it is so high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone that has curly or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>High quality tool.</li>
            <li>I bought my flat iron exactly a year ago, and it worked for exactly a year.</li>
            <li>wow!!</li>
            <li>I used it on my friend&#x27;s little sister&#x27;s hair who has THICK CURLY hair (think Traci Ellis Ross kind of hair) and it worked like magic.</li>
            <li>For my recent New Orleans trip, my hair did go a bit frizzy, but I&#x27;m sure that could be prevented with some sort of hairspray that I wasn&#x27;t willing to use (and I think we can agree that that is an extreme hair environment).  </li>
            <li>- The new croc classic I got 3 weeks ago defaults to over 400 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference from my old one.  </li>
            <li>really like it so far.</li>
            <li>it made my hair soft, shiny and straight....</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly normal, color treated bob hair cut.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly normal, color treated bob hair cut.</li>
            <li>I also like being able to adjust the temp, which was something that was missing with the Chi irons.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair, and this straightener just works magic on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>well worth the price (especially on Amazon)!</li>
            <li>but the digital read tells you how hot its getting and how fast.</li>
            <li>Love doing my hair everyday now</li>
            <li>so they are will worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Best flat iron out there especially if you have ethnic, curly and thick hair!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and evenly straight, and it has cut my hair straightening time down from 20-25 min to 10-12 min.</li>
            <li>So after my last CHI self destructed, I ordered this flat iron and so far I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Heats up to the right temperature and remains constant through each use.</li>
            <li>Gald to see i was able to purchase it new online for almost half the price too!</li>
            <li>I also like that the plates easily glide down my hair and don&#x27;t snag.</li>
            <li>I bought this poor quality flat iron not even a month ago,and on main event that i wanted my hair to look gorgeous straight!</li>
            <li>/&gt;About a week ago, I decided I needed a new straightener.</li>
            <li>All I could do is send it in and trade for a new one at $95, then it would have a 1 yr.</li>
            <li>My new one (supernova) has to be reset every time its turned off and it pulls my hair a bit - the Croc didn&#x27;t.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I was looking for a new iron.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item on November 5, 2011 and by New Years it had stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I need to return it for a new one.</li>
            <li>New , in the box, sealed.</li>
            <li>give this a 5 if it weren&#x27;t for the new development of the superhot default temp setting --&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, I have had to purchase a new one for her a couple of times</li>
            <li>I know companies release new models on the market from time to time</li>
            <li>so I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>I live in SoCal so the manufacturing company is within driving distance.</li>
            <li>for a new quality wet/dry iron.</li>
            <li>and I new</li>
            <li>and my hair actually stays straight all day even though I live in a very humid climate.</li>
            <li>This iron was a much needed change but the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t close quite as much as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
            <li>However, now it will only stay on for a few seconds then turns off on its own.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and cools down quick.</li>
            <li>B) didn&#x27;t get hot enough; or C)</li>
            <li>The Croc does get REALLY hot, so I never go above 360 degrees!  </li>
            <li>First, let me say that I am a multi-racial 20-something female with waist-length hair.  </li>
            <li>it quit working completely just 30 days after purchase, which means I can NOT return it and am out over $80!</li>
            <li>actually stays straight!</li>
            <li>The hair had fallen where the plate was suppose to be and burnt her hair completely off at the root!</li>
            <li>I originally didn&#x27;t mind the fact that I had to keep my eye on the digital display to turn it back on 10 times during the straightening process.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>so I ordered the exact same model.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE SAME EXACT IRON</li>
            <li>I heat it to 290 and that is DEFINITELY hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>It only takes one pass to make it perfectly straight!</li>
            <li>My first one stopped heating up after a year or so, which I figured simply be the life expectancy</li>
            <li>but this beats this by far!</li>
            <li>I had the exact same one for 5 years and it broke</li>
            <li>have long, smooth, thick, wavy hair that tends to frizz easily.</li>
            <li>Yeah, if I send in my old one they will give me a \\&quot;discounted\\&quot; price on a new one for \\&quot;only\\&quot; 80.00 + s&amp;h.</li>
            <li>I have had Hot Tools flat iron forever and resently decided to treat myself to the Croc.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy the black titanium plates only.</li>
            <li>Even better than my last one and less money.</li>
            <li>even after being dropped several times and super glued back together!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Glides smoothe, temp settings switch is easy to see and get to but not easily bumped by accident.&lt;br /&gt;Wide</li>
            <li>Id rather pay more and have it be working years from now that pay less and have it break down on me in the morning while Im getting ready for work!  </li>
            <li>I can flat iron my hair in under 10 minutes and it stays silky smooth all day long!  </li>
            <li>I wanted to upgrade to a \\&quot;nicer\\&quot; flat iron, and bought this one after reading the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone needing a high quality flat iron for a decent price.</li>
            <li>The Croc iron left my hair straight, soft, and shinny.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t heat up fast enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and strait.</li>
            <li>No damage so far.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast enough that you are not waiting and waiting.</li>
            <li>One pass for  me is enough to get my hair straight.</li>
            <li>so if something does happen then I can get it fixed</li>
            <li>It states on their site that all products are warrantied through the manufacturer but when I called CROC directly, they said they don&#x27;t warranty items purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li>My old iron seemed to be burning my bangs, but so far, no issues with this one.</li>
            <li>it heats up fast and shows you a digital read out of the temperature.</li>
            <li>My hair is SO soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>I had it for 2 years and then had to replace it from natural wear and tear</li>
            <li>I had this straight iron for about six months and the cord starting shorting out.</li>
            <li>and I had to pay money to have it fixed.  </li>
            <li>The plastic strain relief where the cord attaches to the iron is sensitive and while carrying it in my suitcase it broke which exposed where the wires connect.  </li>
            <li>(hers is over a year old and works wonders)  </li>
            <li>The chord is long without being a pain, the straightener heats up in practically no time, and it gets amazingly hot but doesn&#x27;t scorch my hair.  </li>
            <li>IT IS NO HEAVY</li>
            <li>All I wanted was to know where to get it fixed.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturer said my warranty was void because I purchased it through Amazon and because this is a professional use product, Amazon was not an authorized seller.</li>
            <li>At first it took a long time to reach 400 degrees.  </li>
            <li>but I do have to go over twice to actually get a straight section.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>so far I like it.  </li>
            <li>One pass of the Croc (completely factory sealed) through my hair</li>
            <li>were we going to fast, low temp, etc, etc.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it really damages my ends.</li>
            <li>On the downside: it is huge, and the handles are not exactly easy on the hands.  </li>
            <li>My hair is natural (which means I have no chemicals in my hair) and this flat iron gets my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>I AM VERY PLEASE WITH MY FLAT IRON, SO FAR IS THE BUY I HAVE DONE.</li>
            <li>Apparently the power cord (where it connects inside the cord-end of the iron is very sensitive)</li>
            <li>It heats up and cools down quickly, it does not snag or rip my hair.</li>
            <li>heats and cools down quickly.</li>
            <li>Not buying this flat iron for that much ever again!!&lt;br /&gt;BY</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes her flat iron.</li>
            <li>My hair is very easy to straighten but one of my girls hair is very thick and wavy.  </li>
            <li>I bought this straightener back in 2011 and it still works (2015) as if it was new!</li>
            <li>So, I took both the infrared and classic replacements in to be repaired last year in December.</li>
            <li>This is my second Croc Classic I&#x27;ve purchased in those 4 years.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I spent more money on other products that couldnt deliver and this one was under $100!</li>
            <li>It is the First Flat Iron that I have ever purchased that has maintained the straightness that I have tried for years to control, especially since I have Naturally Curly Hair.</li>
            <li>really, really hope in a few months, I can write another positive review.</li>
            <li>really, really hope in a few months, I can write another positive review.</li>
            <li>This is a great straightener, but in my opinion it&#x27;s too expensive to only last for six months.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same flat iron my hair stylist uses.</li>
            <li>Going back to my old Chi that is over 5 years old!</li>
            <li>We had slept over at a friends house and she had her croc classic nano-titanium flat iron for over a year and loves it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this iron and cannot believe that I wasted my time with my former drugstore bought flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have actually already dropped it and it&#x27;s still like new.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li>This morning my hair was totally crimped in 10 different directions from my hair-tie, and after a couple minutes with this thing it was totally straight.  </li>
            <li>but not until it allowed me to complete straightening my entire head of hair completely one</li>
            <li>I love that it heats up to 450 degrees since I have such thick hair.</li>
            <li>The Croc wasn&#x27;t my first choice by any means; in fact, I only decided I wanted it when there was 4 minutes left to qualify for next day shipping.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t have to keep going over and over it to get rid of frizz that my other straighteners didn&#x27;t get the first time.</li>
            <li>She offered no other solutions and told me the tech would determine if I had to pay for the repair or not, depending on what the issue was.</li>
            <li>-down, the croc has better features than any others remotely in the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;Heats</li>
            <li>Works great but only lasted 6 months, this product is too expensive for such a short life span.  </li>
            <li>It does take a few minutes to cool down, by wife unplugs and does a few more touchups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine thick hair</li>
            <li>Wow, even though this straightener is a little more expensive, it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I had always used a chi flat iron, lasted me a few years actually, went online to find something just as good but maybe a little cheaper and found the Croc,</li>
            <li>And now I need a new flat</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s really cool is the little digital screen shows it heating up to whatever temperature you&#x27;ve chosen.</li>
            <li>The iron is super lightweight, but the plates are large enough to let me get through my superthick, waist-length curls in half the time other irons take.  </li>
            <li>Not only did this iron reduce my styling time, but it left my hair shiny and straight after passing over each section only two times.  </li>
            <li>Now I am out alot of money and apparently the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty does not apply for purchases on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and apparently you can curl your hair with it</li>
            <li>later I am more than annoyed sitting here at work looking like \\&quot;Wild thing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Dont waste your money on a company or product that isnt worth it.</li>
            <li>It heats right up and just glides through the hair,but if you want to add a little curl to your hair..</li>
            <li>My hairdresser only uses this flat iron and highly recommended that I purchase.</li>
            <li>straight so when I do purchase my next flat iron, I will be going back to teeth.</li>
            <li>I was interested in two other straighteners, but I won&#x27;t name them and possibly steer you from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Once again, I am an avid flat iron user and I have spent lots of $$$ trying to find an iron that would give me the results that this Croc delivered.</li>
            <li>18 months is a decent enough time for a product to last that is used daily.  </li>
            <li>My hair is smoother than with any other straightener, and it holds up well under a reasonable amount of humidity without any product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this flat iron 9 months ago and it has completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>I was using a quality, professional flat iron.</li>
            <li>Other than that it came fast.</li>
            <li>I want a new flat iron that works or my money back!</li>
            <li>It heats up insanely fast, has several heat options, and I have had minimal heat damage</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty solid, not like something you&#x27;d get from the Walgreens down the street.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a professional, high-grade flat iron, this is definitely the one for you!</li>
            <li>so no long wait.</li>
            <li>The cord is a pretty heavy duty one and it swivels when you turn the straightener.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional cosmetologist and it&#x27;s the only flat iron that I will use!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t have to worry about burning the house down, haha.</li>
            <li>The temp heats up within seconds and cools down almost as fast.  </li>
            <li>Heats up salon style and cools down almost as fast.  </li>
            <li>THE OTHER SAYS TURBOION CROC CLASSIC..</li>
            <li>While I absolutely LOVE the croc flat iron, I was not happy with this \\&quot;classic\\&quot; version after it stopped working after only 4 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li>I guess I expected angels to start singing when I used this new straightener.  </li>
            <li>then I just threw it across the room on the tile and broke it straight in half.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous to order this flat iron due to some of the reviews saying that theirs broke, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It heats evenly and straightens my thick hair so much faster than a normal flat iron.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly to straighten my hair, but it will also curl my hair just as well (once I got the technique down).</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Excellent!</li>
            <li> this croc is the BEST!</li>
            <li> I am especially happy with the shape of the handle and the weight of the device.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know my hair could look so wonderful!</li>
            <li> Straightener works absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> Awesome straightener!  </li>
            <li> says it&#x27;s the best one she ever used.</li>
            <li> Both give you excellent results.</li>
            <li> So i have had this straightner about 6 months and until today it was perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a great item!</li>
            <li> Its working great!</li>
            <li> The best part about it is it heats up to 450 in seconds</li>
            <li> so I got the Croc bc in my opinion it is the best.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a great buy!!!!</li>
            <li> The best in the market for the money.</li>

            <li> This iron is great!!!</li>
            <li> and this product does a wonderful job straightening my hair and leaving it silky!</li>
            <li> Despite the supposedly excellent reviews, after 8 months, my straightener broke.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife, and she says it&#x27;s the best one she&#x27;s ever had.</li>

            <li> :) I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Many people said the product was awesome, while others didn&#x27;t have anything good to say about it.</li>
            <li> One of my good friends is a hair stylist and recommended I try the Croc.</li>
            <li> if the majority are good</li>
            <li> While it did do a good job when it was functioning</li>
            <li> I really loved the way it straightened/styled my hair</li>
            <li> Good quality and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I loved it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> good hair iron for the price</li>

            <li> works good.</li>
            <li> SHE LOVED MINE.</li>
            <li> and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener a 3 years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m thinking that can&#x27;t be good for your hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through my fair share of straighteners and</li>
            <li> I was delighted with the way this iron worked....</li>
            <li> Good luck Dont drop iT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVED this iron too.</li>
            <li> Well, I loved it up until it CAUGHT ON FIRE</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still in good condition.</li>
            <li> so I ordered this one thinking it would be just as good.</li>
            <li> I received it in good time.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> Plus, while researching, I came across something that said titanium plates flat irons worked the best and were about the best quality</li>
            <li> Love it &amp; very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I had heard so many great things about this Croc.</li>

            <li> Heats wonderfully, doesn&#x27;t burn and absolutely a value for the price!</li>
            <li> I was pretty convinced that the Croc would be the best buy in this price range.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> and I do love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toy!</li>
            <li> I went against my better judgement &amp; bought it anyway!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> I love this straightener!  </li>

            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> the power cord is cheap and the iron turns on and off every time the cord moves which is ALL THE TIME!!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> LOVE this Croc!</li>
            <li> My stylist recommend it for me and it has been amazing on my hair.  </li>
            <li> This amazing iron was well taken care of, but now it stops working on its own.</li>
            <li> Yes, the iron is amazing when it works.</li>
            <li> Amazing Price for salon results.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool.</li>
            <li> This iron had done amazing things to my hair throughout the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The best price &amp; free shipping is on Amazon, which is why I love Amazon :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the kind of person that does a lot of research and depend on the reviews given by others who have purchased the product.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I was kind of conflicted after reading through some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> Works awesome on all hair types and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> but I do not like it as much as I liked the Croc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair is gorgeous because of it and receives many compliments.  </li>
            <li> I really liked it...until it quit working</li>
            <li> Unlike the Chi, it comes with instructions, which are definitely handy when it comes to temperature control for example.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a reliable, effective straightener that doesn&#x27;t break the bank, stop your search here.</li>
            <li> It did straighten my hair leaving a nice shine.</li>
            <li> When you spend that kind of money, you expect to have them for a lifetime.</li>
            <li> this iron makes my hair really straight, love it!!!</li>
            <li> It is so worth it!!!</li>
            <li> The price is so worth it!!!</li>
            <li> The Croc Classic started out to be a wonderful product comparable to the Rusk</li>
            <li> It came quickly and worked great for 2 months, then died.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you stock up on some good gloss  :)</li>
            <li> Works great and quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I am very impressed so far with the Croc!</li>
            <li> Very happy so far!</li>
            <li> Its is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Think this is by far the best hair tool I have.</li>
            <li> It looks nice in my bathroom, :)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best straightener that I have ever had.</li>
            <li> After buying and using the CROC Nano Titanium iron, I have to say this is by far the BEST iron I have used on my multi-racial curly, color-treated hair!</li>
            <li> So far, a great purchase!</li>
            <li> I have had Great Success by being able to Style my own hair and having the Style hold.</li>
            <li> By far, the best straightener I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> it work perfect and professional</li>
            <li> the Croc is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is by far the best straightener out there.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy and shiny and it&#x27;s just AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It has an easy grip, no tangle cord, and effortlessly straightens my hair!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and seems to leave my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li> It is very good quality, and I high recommend it.</li>
            <li> The digital temperature control is great because not everyone needs to use 450 degrees for great results.</li>
            <li> Great product heats up very fast and keeps the temperature.  </li>
            <li> Good price for a very good flat iron.</li>
            <li> The grip is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of pressure to operate.</li>
            <li> Overall, great deal and amazing results!</li>
            <li> It has a great ergonomic design, it gets plenty hot, and it does the job in one pass, even on the most kinky curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Safe to use and received product quickly!!</li>
            <li> and it really works great.  </li>
            <li> It fits my hand nicely and is light.  </li>
            <li> However, at about the 6 month mark (like so many others), it started to turn itself off even when I wasn&#x27;t holding it or when I hadn&#x27;t inadvertently shut it off.</li>
            <li> Now, when it shut off on its own there was no beeping sound.</li>
            <li> Just get one for your self, you will \\&quot;LOVE IT\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My friends and family would consider me a \\&quot;hair snob\\&quot; as I only use the best products on the mane!  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Okay,</li>
            <li> Great iron heats up fast and gives you salon hair, I also like the safety turn off option.</li>
            <li> cousin recommended this item and I have to say we love it</li>
            <li> and we feel it works better than the Chi...</li>
            <li> I was OK with this.</li>
            <li> Unless you have $80 to take a chance, I would go with something that is a bit more reliable.</li>
            <li> Just want to make sure everyone pays attention to the statement by Amazon that says this&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t heat more than 69 degrees.  </li>
            <li> Love, love love.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have one as well and love</li>

            <li> i LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I am as well contacting the Better Business Bureau to report them.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with the Chi straighteners, but the Croc is absolutely better.  </li>
            <li> It retails for more than a Chi, so be sure to get it on sale, but you will be satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Croc for about a month now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Would have paid way more if I purchased at the store.</li>
            <li> Hope I have better luck.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> I really love it, and it has lasted me for almost 2 years</li>
            <li> I LOVE the iron.</li>
            <li> It works much better than the CHI and HAI anf FHI ones that I owned before.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t say enough how much I love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> the heat adjustment I am able to straighten the front of my hair and not burn the ends by turning the temp way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO glad I went with this one.  </li>
            <li> I have dropped this more times than I can count and traveled thousands of miles with it shoved in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Everything I could have asked for and more.</li>
            <li> I bought this b/c I used my mother&#x27;s a couple times and fell in love with it.</li>

            <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Best Flat Iron I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> Ordered this one because of the high temp (450)&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;She told me it was perfect; gets hot fast and does a great job.</li>
            <li> This was a great flatiron and came highly recommended by my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and very light.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li> It came in so fast and it works amazing!</li>
            <li> first time I used it I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, leaves my hair so silky smooth, it is definitely the best straightening iron I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enough with the good, now for the REAL!</li>
            <li> That said, the reviews seemed pretty good for this brand, and it is a brand</li>
            <li> and I love it, so easy, you can select your degrees</li>
            <li> My hair becomes very frizzy in humid weather, and my Croc has done a great job keeping my hair smooth throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a good buy if you simply just want to straighten your hair, i do not think its good for styling (aka curling with the straightener)</li>
            <li> This was a great deal, cheaper than the store I buy my professional products from!</li>
            <li> This iron is totally worth every penny and more for all that it does!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time on my own last night and my hair turned out just as perfect as if I had just walked out of the salon!</li>
            <li> I was worried that I might not be able to curl my hair with it, but it curls just fine.</li>
            <li> Has very high heat and good size.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the design of the Croc; slim and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> It was a bit tricky for me to feel comfortable to use but the hand grips made it better.</li>
            <li> The straightening plates glide smoothly, and I like being able to adjust temperature depending on which sections of hair I&#x27;m straightening.</li>
            <li> It also adds a great natural shine to your hair.</li>
            <li> Great price for a professional quality item.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I had to give it another chance.</li>
            <li> not even a week after I ordered it, it was in great condition and it leaves my hair super smooth and very straight</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and I feel confident that it will safely turn off if for some reason I forget to unplug it.  </li>
            <li> By the way, my true rating on this item and seller is a 0!</li>
            <li> and it still works good as new!</li>
            <li> My clients are leaving with a big smile, it makes my day great!!!</li>
            <li> It was a shockingly easy process and I attribute that to this iron.  </li>
            <li> and I can straighten it very quickly and easily with this iron.  </li>
            <li> I have had to purchase three of these irons in one year because they easily break.</li>
            <li> It lets you easily turn the ends of your hair in or out depending on the look you&#x27;re going for</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and use.</li>
            <li> Temperature is easily adjustable.</li>
            <li> it heats up very quickly, which is digitially read out.  </li>
            <li> It feels well made and the cord feels strong.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for over 5 years and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old grand daughter, tried her Aunt&#x27;s, when on vacation and loved this iron for her hair.  </li>
            <li> Heck, I still have a Hot Tools that I had 20 years ago, still works, but no, it doesn&#x27;t work as good as the CROC DID, but it certainly works better than the CROC now, since the CROC stays on at most 5 seconds at a time.</li>
            <li> I can see where the higher temps would work good to quickly pass over the hair to straighten</li>
            <li> Apparently it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also super light, and easy to maneuver!</li>
            <li> Friends of mine have used it and asked about it because they liked it so much!</li>
            <li> I love this styling tool and highly recommend to achieve that salon style in your own home.</li>
            <li> easy to use and accurate temperature.</li>
            <li> I plugged it into my converter (everything else worked fine)</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and gets tangled easily and the plates are extremely smooth and do not pull my hair.</li>
            <li> hair takes half the time it use to and stays perfect.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t pull out tons of hair, and creates beautiful straight hair without the need for heat-protecting spray.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I love the iron and is actually my favorite but unfortunately not reliable.&lt;br /&gt;Moving</li>
            <li> My hair has never straightened so quickly!  </li>
            <li> If you like to make your hair very straight this is an excellent flat iron.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and so far has worked great.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome flat iron, heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;tug\\&quot; on hair, leaves hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> I really liked the swivel feature, but I had to hold the cord a certain way to get it to stay on.</li>
            <li> My first croc classic was great.  </li>
            <li> It glides through my hair and leaves a smooth silky finish.  </li>
            <li> It prevents damage and runs smoothly over your hair.</li>
            <li> T was really hoping that this would be an amazing straightner.</li>
            <li> it makes a beeping sound.</li>
            <li> have no notice when it shuts itself off (no beeping sound) and</li>
            <li> Your hair is smooth and shiney after using.  </li>
            <li> So I had three weeks of awesome blow dried crappy hair.  </li>
            <li> Was great but only lasted 3 months before it just died!!</li>
            <li> replaced the cheap flatiron with another Croc.</li>
            <li> Got the iron it worked great for about 4 weeks after that the iron heated only to 150 degrees, which did nothing to my hair!  </li>
            <li> and it was the cheapest I had ever seen so even though I was nervous about it being so cheap</li>
            <li> I had a cheap one from Walmart to start with.  </li>
            <li> The product worked great for one hair straightening treatment and about 10 regular uses before it just stopped working altogether.</li>
            <li> It claimed to have 100% ceramic plates that would create smooth, glossy and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> This product did great until recently.</li>
            <li> It worked great and was in same price range</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several years and it has done me proud.</li>
            <li> It worked great until last week, December 2012.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the heat settings to what you are comfortable with.  </li>
            <li> I have shown this straightener to a few of my friends with wavy hair and it can both straighten AND add a beautiful curl in minutes!</li>
            <li> Because the item was still under warranty, Turboion replaced it for me free of charge (aside from the gas I used to drive an hour to get there).</li>
            <li> However, the iron doesn&#x27;t light up where the infrared light is supposed to come out.  </li>
            <li> It would have been great, but it only worked one time.</li>
            <li> I luv how smooth my hair gets from it.  </li>
            <li> Then I used it only two more times and the results each time were not as good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good professional quality product</li>
            <li> The only reason why I am giving this item 2 stars is because it is honestly THE BEST flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is a very good, hot and easy to use flat iron.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and perfect flat iron.</li>
            <li> Very smart decision choosing this brand, and m glad I did</li>
            <li> They sent a heat resistant pouch/mat to protect your table surfaces (a great accesory for flat iron users).  </li>
            <li> Great flat iron.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Great flat iron, recommended to me by the salon I go to</li>
            <li> It would be a great flat iron if it lasted longer..</li>
            <li> Great flat iron, heats up in seconds!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT flat iron!  </li>
            <li> I liked the ease and style the Croc Classic produced and ordered one through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This iron gets very hot very quickly.</li>
            <li> I could hear my hair snapping as I tried to pull it through my hair--and no, my hair is pretty healthy</li>
            <li> BUT Im pretty sure it wont.  </li>
            <li> I love how hot it gets.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this in order to do a keratin treatment to my hair.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron that ever used to get very hot straight and see her with one swipe</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> So far, I have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This makes me wonder if it was a refurbished item, since I owned another one of these in the past and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> It never was misused, I always kept it in the original box in a drawer in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love how it shows the temp, (350 is plenty) because it can get so hot that you produce a burnt smell.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair super smooth super quick!</li>
            <li> The digitial temp reading is precise and it gets to desired temp quickly.  </li>
            <li> Runs super smooth over hair, does not snag hairs.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly with precise heat.</li>
            <li> The plate surfaces are super smooth and glide on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> This is the most amazing flat iron I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron on the market.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Works good and get hot fast its the best but only last 4months.</li>
            <li> Probably the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST flat iron I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> Works amazing for my naturally curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about a year, used usually 4 times a week at most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always owned fairly \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; straighteners--just ones I picked up at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I would pay full price for this Iron...</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1 inch plate which is good for short to medium hair length.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these and loved them when they work, but they don&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> favorite part: It &#x27;remembers&#x27; your heat setting and beeps when ready.  </li>
            <li> I love how fast it straightens my hair and my hair</li>
            <li> I have only good things to say.</li>
            <li> I love how fast it heats up and how shiny it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> and I wake up with it looking just as good the next day.</li>
            <li> I love how straight it makes my hair look.</li>
            <li> it worked well, did a good job, lasted only 3 months.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I have ever owned for thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I purchased them from beauty supply stores at FULL PRICE ($150 and $160).</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this iron is that it heats up SUPER fast.</li>
            <li> -grip handle - does a beautiful job.&lt;br /&gt;The first croc classic remembered my preferred heat setting which is 300 degrees for my naturally wavyfine hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So easy and fast!</li>
            <li> I got this one for a super deal on Amazon but after using it I would have paid full price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially comfortable to hold; ergonomic, unlike any other I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> tried my own today for the first time, and same results - Shiny, silky, smooth hair!.  </li>
            <li> I loved my Croc flat iron as soon as I got it</li>

            <li> I just finished hair school &amp; wanted to reward myself w/ a really good flat iron</li>

            <li> The flat iron did a good job.</li>
            <li> and I received the flat iron within a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> good flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I obviously haven&#x27;t experienced that yet, but I really think it has a lot to do with how you handle and care for the straightener.</li>
            <li> I obviously haven&#x27;t experienced that yet, but I really think it has a lot to do with how you handle and care for the straightener.</li>

            <li> just great if you want straight hair in a short amount of time!</li>
            <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever purchased,  even compared to a chi which is significantly more expensive.  </li>
            <li> It saves a lot of time in the morning when I can just quickly press those wavy strands and have a polished look and out of the door in no time.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick saving you valuable time when in a rush.</li>
            <li> Heats up so quick.</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast and is comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this product gets so hot and is so smooth that it flattens my curls quickly</li>
            <li> When I went to replace it, I saw a much cheaper flat iron with great reviews and purchased that</li>
            <li> The Croc is definitely the best flat iron I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Wasnt as nice as my cheap flat irons.</li>
            <li> Heats up in 10-15 seconds and is very hot.</li>

            <li> heats well, easy &amp; fast straightener</li>
            <li> Fast and easy both times that I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron in June 2012 for $77 after reading the excellent reviews and borrowing a Croc flat iron from a friend.  </li>
            <li> This is the first straightener that work!  </li>
            <li> I thought I burnt my hair off at first!</li>
            <li> I thought I burnt my hair off at first!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly on my damn near untameable hair, which stays straight for long time after.</li>
            <li> I will not be purchasing any big ticket items off of amazon any more!</li>
            <li> so sizzled my bangs first try!</li>
            <li> They need to work out the kinks first before I ever buy another!</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend using a heat glove, considering your hair gets pretty hot</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> hair is VERY curly and fine.</li>
            <li> When I first received this flat iron I absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> My croc flat iron arrived quickly and the price was amazing.  </li>
            <li> With Amika I always end up with silky smooth straight hair.</li>
            <li> Hair stays straight and frizz free for days.  </li>
            <li> Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Seeing that someone else does the same kind of put me in their shoes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend staring out with the lower heat settings 350-380 because even on the craziest hair I rarely need to use any hotter then that.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a nice change from the t3</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product, and so far I really love it.</li>
            <li> The price at Amazon is better than even the professional supply houses.  </li>
            <li> This iron leaves my hair smooth, soft, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> We already own a Rusk brand iron that we had purchased over a year ago at our local salon.  </li>
            <li> So far, I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> Worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I paid about $100 and thought it was worth my money</li>
            <li> Worth the money, and I can attest to</li>
            <li> I would wear my hair back/up about 80% of my life because the hassle just wasn&#x27;t worth it....</li>
            <li> Great straightener, as if I had bought it from the store, but at half the price!</li>
            <li> It could not tame my frizzy hair where the Croc has always worked quick, easy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The heat is consistent, heats up quickly, and is non-damaging to color treated hair.</li>
            <li> , it heats up pretty quick...</li>
            <li> It does a quick job of things, which I did see first hand over the holidays in the guest room at some relatives house.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I LOVED my Croc iron, until it died.</li>
            <li> She had me try it first to see if I would love as much as she does, and I was absolutely astonished with the results...</li>
            <li> She recently started doing brazilian blowouts and loves the straighter look, which holds pretty good, but tends to not stay as straight as it should after treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, right?</li>
            <li> right)</li>
            <li> My wife knew what she wanted and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Well for the first 6 months it worked amazing but all of a sudden one day as I was doing my hair</li>
            <li> This iron has adjustable heat settings, a super long cord and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This iron does get extremely hot (exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!)</li>
            <li> You can dial the temperature you want that works best with your hair type and it works on your wet (damp) hair as well as dry hair.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, like in an instant and have an auto shut off button which was ok for me.</li>
            <li> I am Cuban and have really kinky curly and full hair...</li>
            <li> I have to say, the flat iron is easy to use, and glides smoothly through her hair.  </li>
            <li> It glides through my hair so easily and makes it so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and works very well.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> It so happens that my last one was a Croc and lasted 5+yrs, but I still thoroughly researched and found a few that seemed the best.  </li>
            <li> The best flatiron I&#x27;ve ever had for my thick natural hair</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast, straightens and smoothes my wavy hair with ease.</li>
            <li> and it still works like new!!!</li>
            <li> like this iron very much.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast as well.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I use these flat irons everyday, they do awesome on my hair.</li>
            <li> Loved the flat iron but not having a warranty sucked since these break so frequently.</li>
            <li> I have medium-length, fine hair that&#x27;s naturally wavy and surprisingly pretty stubborn to straighten, but the Croc makes it a breeze.</li>
            <li> I am actually able to straighten my hair quickly, as it heats up very fast, and it also cools down quickly too.</li>
            <li> After the first week the heating element stopped working.</li>
            <li> I cant believe that I paid that much money for it!</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and this is exactly what I needed, love the digital temp read out.</li>
            <li> The morning I first used it, I thought \\&quot;this is it???\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> First things first, my croc did arrive on time as promised.</li>
            <li> ; I love that the croc has an adjustable digital temperature.</li>
            <li> The first pass through my hair scared me, because it literally just glided through my hair.</li>
            <li> The first pass through my hair scared me, because it literally just glided through my hair.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied with the return policy also!</li>
            <li> The first one I had lasted about 18 months and then just died.  </li>
            <li> two months is NOT enough time for me to say I am satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> and I love that its display is digital.</li>
            <li> Not only was it fabulous for my own coarse, frizzy hair, but also, since I am a hairstylist I have been using it for all the keratin treatments on my clients.</li>
            <li> Her hair is so straight and shiny after using this that she feels like the salon did it!</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I use it on 420- 430 because sometimes 450 is too hot.</li>
            <li> The first one had a thinner power cord and the piece of plastic covering the end of the cord broke, then it shorted out after about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried many over the years and finally gave in a bought the one</li>
            <li> But it gets to the point where I have to wait 5 minutes before being able to turn it back on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to return it and look for another iron that would do exactly what I thought the Hana Elite would do.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t stick straight against my head at all!</li>
            <li> it heats up EXTREMELY fast!</li>
            <li> Gets hot faaaaast and my hair feels softer.</li>
            <li> I am sure I would have gotten the same response.</li>
            <li> exactly (probably) how hot it is.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this iron!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The temperature is great but please be mindful that the higher temps will burn your hair if used often and left on the hair too long.</li>
            <li> but this straightener works so well and fast!</li>
            <li> I was exactly as the description said.  </li>
            <li> I guess my expectations of it were higher, so I was not blown away after using it.</li>
            <li> This Croc gets really hot</li>
            <li> I only use it a couple times a week, but I love that I can adjust the heat setting so that it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li> The fact of the matter is, they simply last longer and hold up better than the cheaper ones</li>
            <li> My first daughter has one</li>
            <li> I thought I would give the company a pass after writing them when my first iron went out within 7 months.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I checked into one for Christmas, and even though it was a bit expensive from my retirement income, it was so worth it for her, as she just loves it, and uses every day, so I am sure in the &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; run it is the best to pay a better price for the quality that you get for a product that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it is.....</li>
            <li> It broke within the first month of me using it.</li>
            <li> and it gets hot and then shuts off.</li>
            <li> When I try to turn it on again it won&#x27;t get hot anymore.</li>
            <li> The first time I thought it was a fluke.</li>
            <li> but luckily I still had my classic.</li>
            <li> This is not my first one.</li>
            <li> The plates get hot and works well.  </li>
            <li> it gets hot in seconds and make my hair</li>
            <li> I dropped my first one from about 5 feet onto a hardwood floor.  </li>
            <li> Just ordered another one after 3 years of use from my first order.  </li>
            <li> Got here in two days exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact one she had used on my hair.</li>
            <li> The item is sleek and has a pretty ergonomic grip.</li>
            <li> I loved the product until it stopped working a few days ago.</li>
            <li> So easy and quick flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid environment and after I use my Croc in the morning my hair stays frizz free all day, with NO anti-frizz product.</li>
            <li> up super fast which is a real plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really gets your hair straight and does it quickly.  </li>
            <li> but my old flat irons really pulled my hair even though they worked good.</li>
            <li> My first flat iron was a Solia, which was ok</li>
            <li> and i would most deftly recommend it, I would trade it for any other flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron</li>
            <li> I have used many flat irons.</li>
            <li> Being a hairstylist I have used many flat irons over the years.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> LOVE MY FLAT IRON.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite flat Iron!</li>
            <li> Love Croc Flat Irons!</li>
            <li> I actually have one and love it so much</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this to quickly get ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Digital heat temp makes it really easy to know how hot it is.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s mostly dry is fine!</li>
            <li> THIS FLAT IRON IS AMAZINGGGGG!!! :-)</li>
            <li> and I tried so many Irons but Crock flat Iron rocks!!!</li>
            <li> Love the long cord.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair and love that I can adjust the heat level.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, when my first croc bit the dust, I researched for hours and didn&#x27;t like anything else on the market as much.</li>
            <li> (but prone to flyaways), looks and feels better, and stays straight far longer than with my old straightener.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My wife has this flat iron and absolutely loved it until it stopped heating and would only reach around 200 degrees.</li>
            <li> The hair stylist recommended a few brands, some of which, such as GHD, do not have good reviews on Amazon, as they are cheap knock offs.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes a good hour to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> I have mixed hair and previous straighteners would work, but not that great, and my hair would go frizzy at the first hint of humidity.</li>
            <li> have to say, I have been nothing but pleased with the performance and overall high quality of this product.  </li>
            <li> It came in a nice black box.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this review 2 stars is because I&#x27;m sure the straightener is fine as long as you don&#x27;t take it over 430...</li>
            <li> I loved my Croc flat iron for the first 5 months because that&#x27;s how long it lasted before it broke!</li>
            <li> I love the digital display, and the whole product just seems high quality.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a single problem. :)</li>
            <li> I ended up trying to tape it a certain way</li>
            <li> The old iron I used was an inexpensive model and did not get very hot or have a large surface area.</li>
            <li> My choices were either to send it to them for a free analysis and they would repair it for $15-60 or I can purchase a brand new one directly from them for $80 and</li>
            <li> My husband is an electrician, and he took it apart and the wires are coming loose from the iron, which explains why so many reviews complain that they just quit working.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t need to be set very high</li>
            <li> That was the main criteria for me: to have a good iron which would take very little time to use.</li>
            <li> It has a nice digital temperature display, makes hair shine and smooth like no other, excelente for brazilian keratin treatments, no static eletricity or frizz, the black titanium really makes a big diference, and the price is the best you can find.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve had moderate success, but this flat iron is the greatest one I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> My hair, which I will admit is straight anyway</li>
            <li> My 17-year-old daughter even noticed and said my hair looked much prettier.</li>
            <li> It feels very sturdy!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I really like the look and feel of it.</li>
            <li> I am left with smooth sleek hair every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I decided to take the plunge and after much research I decided on this croc.  </li>
            <li> My hair now stays straight through the summer humidity</li>
            <li> I had to play with the temperature, because I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I would really like a response from the company selling this product.</li>
            <li> Really bummed.</li>
            <li> and I would really recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade.</li>
            <li> There really haven&#x27;t been any negatives about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> I purchased the item for much cheaper than I could find in any store.</li>
            <li> when I used the straightener I curled it in a bit and it created so much volume.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this product!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes it</li>
            <li> Do we really think that they would have even replaced it at the two month point when it quit working???</li>
            <li> cannot recommend this to anyone for that very reason.</li>
            <li> Heat up very quick.&lt;br /&gt;One problem.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and in no time it flattens it as if I was in the salon.</li>
            <li> Heats fast, heats to the 400 degree&#x27;s, has auto turn off.</li>
            <li> Makes getting ready a breeze.  </li>
            <li> Con - maybe gets my hair too straight</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair so fast</li>
            <li> and it does come out thinner and really straight.</li>
            <li> I am very upset.</li>
            <li> Hair is silky straight and looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy &amp; unmanageable hair &amp;</li>
            <li> Gets my hair pin straight.</li>
            <li> The S-Curl of course makes her hair wavy, but she prefers her hair straight.</li>
            <li> Very durable.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My hair was really shining after I used.</li>
            <li> I normally buy these at distributer stores and this was the first one I bought from amazon.</li>
            <li> Hair done in 20-25 mins and it STAYS straight.</li>
            <li> have not used it much.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have read more reviews before I spent my money.</li>
            <li> My wife has very wavy hair with lots of volume.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks much</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, this product flattens and smoothes, my hairdresser is jealous.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use it that much</li>
            <li> (very curly)</li>
            <li> Very close to the croc.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thought it was ready to use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and it is always straight when I am done.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> She really likes the way it functions,</li>
            <li> Comparing the croc to my old straightener, this one definitely makes my hair look and feel a lot better.</li>
            <li> Comparing the croc to my old straightener, this one definitely makes my hair look and feel a lot better.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, but it stopped working after a few months.  </li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s supposed to be for &#x27;professional use only&#x27;. :)</li>
            <li> I love my new flat iron!!</li>
            <li> However, I am not very happy with it as it does not perform as good as Amika.</li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron that gets hot enough to straighten and make my frizzy hag hair and make it feel soft and look beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Save your money or buy the iron directly from Croc!!!</li>
            <li> LAME!&lt;br /&gt;Although the flat irons are AMAZING, they do NOT last</li>
            <li> MY HAIR GETS SO FLAT AND SOFT AND LOOKS HEALTHY.</li>
            <li> It cuts back my hair straightening time significantly.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic flat iron...</li>
            <li> The two lessons for all of you out there are: 1)Croc makes cheap flat irons, and 2)you should check to see if the product you are thinking of buying on Amazon has a warranty that covers the product if it is purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The plates glide smoothly over my hair, and leaves my hair shiny and flat.  </li>
            <li> I hope you have the same success I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> THAN I PAID 10$ MORE FOR THE OTHER ONE OVER THIS ONE..</li>
            <li> DONT PAY MORE FOR THE OTHER IRON</li>
            <li> Unlike many other products, you don&#x27;t have to repeatedly go over and over your hair.</li>
            <li> It does get hotter than most straighteners I&#x27;ve used, so be careful not to set the heat too high.</li>
            <li> I purchased many different flat irons in the past, none have done as good a job as this has.</li>
            <li> It was great while it worked, but then suddenly stopped working after a couple of months and it was past the Amazon refund date, they won&#x27;t replace it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working great, but last week it got \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; at 280 degrees and will not heat up past 280</li>
            <li> Granted my hair is kind of, but not completely, on the thinner side and coarse.</li>
            <li> a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item because it came highly recommended by my therapist, also known as my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, the digital temperature display is very helpful.</li>
            <li> , that I know I will enjoy for a long time.</li>
            <li> My first thoughts were, &amp;#34;Wow, this one&#x27;s heavier than my old one.</li>
            <li> I use mine at about 350, which is near the median, and it is gentler on my hair than some of the higher settings.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener, its so awesome, it really really decreased the time that I actually spent on with my other straightner</li>
            <li> and it literally melted down to the point that the (famous) titanium plates fell out.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many other flat irons for my wife over the last 10 years but this one has proven to be the most reliable.  </li>
            <li> Does good job straightening the hair, but it did not cut the ironing by a lot of time for me, when compared to my previous flat iron.</li>
            <li> I always look to see how many good reviews there are for a product in comparison to bad ones -</li>
            <li> One pass is mostly all I need to flatten my wavy hair (from a previous perm).</li>
            <li> Better than my previously owned Chi.</li>
            <li> review in particular won me over about the croc - the one that said it straightens &amp;#34;lumpy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I always read customer reviews to get a realistic description of a product.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks 100% better since I started using the Croc (had previously used an older model Helen of Troy staightener).  </li>
            <li> My Hair Stylist utilizes the Croc Classic for her Salon.</li>
            <li> I will spend my money elsewhere and be treated better and get a different straighner that wont short out in 13 months.</li>
            <li> I BROUGHT\\&quot;TurboIon Croc Classic TITANIUM \\&quot;  </li>
            <li> THIS IRON HAS CROC CLASSIC NANO</li>
            <li> In fact, the salon he works at sells this same model for more than double what I paid for it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I called back Amazon a 3rd time, and at this point they told me since it was more than 6 months from the date of purchase, there was nothing they can do.</li>
            <li> I owned the classic nano and within about 9 months, it stopped working.</li>
            <li> As of yesterday, my classic iron stopped working -_______-.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, and results last longer.</li>
            <li> This amazing flat iron has a digital temperature guide that tells you when it is hot enough.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li> Received on time and it is so high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone that has curly or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> High quality tool.</li>
            <li> I bought my flat iron exactly a year ago, and it worked for exactly a year.</li>
            <li> wow!!</li>
            <li> I used it on my friend&#x27;s little sister&#x27;s hair who has THICK CURLY hair (think Traci Ellis Ross kind of hair) and it worked like magic.</li>
            <li> For my recent New Orleans trip, my hair did go a bit frizzy, but I&#x27;m sure that could be prevented with some sort of hairspray that I wasn&#x27;t willing to use (and I think we can agree that that is an extreme hair environment).  </li>
            <li> - The new croc classic I got 3 weeks ago defaults to over 400 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference from my old one.  </li>
            <li> really like it so far.</li>
            <li> it made my hair soft, shiny and straight....</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly normal, color treated bob hair cut.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly normal, color treated bob hair cut.</li>
            <li> I also like being able to adjust the temp, which was something that was missing with the Chi irons.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair, and this straightener just works magic on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> well worth the price (especially on Amazon)!</li>
            <li> but the digital read tells you how hot its getting and how fast.</li>
            <li> Love doing my hair everyday now</li>
            <li> so they are will worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron out there especially if you have ethnic, curly and thick hair!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and evenly straight, and it has cut my hair straightening time down from 20-25 min to 10-12 min.</li>
            <li> So after my last CHI self destructed, I ordered this flat iron and so far I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Heats up to the right temperature and remains constant through each use.</li>
            <li> Gald to see i was able to purchase it new online for almost half the price too!</li>
            <li> I also like that the plates easily glide down my hair and don&#x27;t snag.</li>
            <li> I bought this poor quality flat iron not even a month ago,and on main event that i wanted my hair to look gorgeous straight!</li>
            <li> /&gt;About a week ago, I decided I needed a new straightener.</li>
            <li> All I could do is send it in and trade for a new one at $95, then it would have a 1 yr.</li>
            <li> My new one (supernova) has to be reset every time its turned off and it pulls my hair a bit - the Croc didn&#x27;t.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I was looking for a new iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on November 5, 2011 and by New Years it had stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I need to return it for a new one.</li>
            <li> New , in the box, sealed.</li>
            <li> give this a 5 if it weren&#x27;t for the new development of the superhot default temp setting --&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, I have had to purchase a new one for her a couple of times</li>
            <li> I know companies release new models on the market from time to time</li>
            <li> so I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> I live in SoCal so the manufacturing company is within driving distance.</li>
            <li> for a new quality wet/dry iron.</li>
            <li> and I new</li>
            <li> and my hair actually stays straight all day even though I live in a very humid climate.</li>
            <li> This iron was a much needed change but the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t close quite as much as I&#x27;d like it to.</li>
            <li> However, now it will only stay on for a few seconds then turns off on its own.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and cools down quick.</li>
            <li> B) didn&#x27;t get hot enough; or C)</li>
            <li> The Croc does get REALLY hot, so I never go above 360 degrees!  </li>
            <li> First, let me say that I am a multi-racial 20-something female with waist-length hair.  </li>
            <li> it quit working completely just 30 days after purchase, which means I can NOT return it and am out over $80!</li>
            <li> actually stays straight!</li>
            <li> The hair had fallen where the plate was suppose to be and burnt her hair completely off at the root!</li>
            <li> I originally didn&#x27;t mind the fact that I had to keep my eye on the digital display to turn it back on 10 times during the straightening process.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> so I ordered the exact same model.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE SAME EXACT IRON</li>
            <li> I heat it to 290 and that is DEFINITELY hot enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> It only takes one pass to make it perfectly straight!</li>
            <li> My first one stopped heating up after a year or so, which I figured simply be the life expectancy</li>
            <li> but this beats this by far!</li>
            <li> I had the exact same one for 5 years and it broke</li>
            <li> have long, smooth, thick, wavy hair that tends to frizz easily.</li>
            <li> Yeah, if I send in my old one they will give me a \\&quot;discounted\\&quot; price on a new one for \\&quot;only\\&quot; 80.00 + s&amp;h.</li>
            <li> I have had Hot Tools flat iron forever and resently decided to treat myself to the Croc.</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy the black titanium plates only.</li>
            <li> Even better than my last one and less money.</li>
            <li> even after being dropped several times and super glued back together!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Glides smoothe, temp settings switch is easy to see and get to but not easily bumped by accident.&lt;br /&gt;Wide</li>
            <li> Id rather pay more and have it be working years from now that pay less and have it break down on me in the morning while Im getting ready for work!  </li>
            <li> I can flat iron my hair in under 10 minutes and it stays silky smooth all day long!  </li>
            <li> I wanted to upgrade to a \\&quot;nicer\\&quot; flat iron, and bought this one after reading the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone needing a high quality flat iron for a decent price.</li>
            <li> The Croc iron left my hair straight, soft, and shinny.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t heat up fast enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and strait.</li>
            <li> No damage so far.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast enough that you are not waiting and waiting.</li>
            <li> One pass for  me is enough to get my hair straight.</li>
            <li> so if something does happen then I can get it fixed</li>
            <li> It states on their site that all products are warrantied through the manufacturer but when I called CROC directly, they said they don&#x27;t warranty items purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li> My old iron seemed to be burning my bangs, but so far, no issues with this one.</li>
            <li> it heats up fast and shows you a digital read out of the temperature.</li>
            <li> My hair is SO soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> I had it for 2 years and then had to replace it from natural wear and tear</li>
            <li> I had this straight iron for about six months and the cord starting shorting out.</li>
            <li> and I had to pay money to have it fixed.  </li>
            <li> The plastic strain relief where the cord attaches to the iron is sensitive and while carrying it in my suitcase it broke which exposed where the wires connect.  </li>
            <li> (hers is over a year old and works wonders)  </li>
            <li> The chord is long without being a pain, the straightener heats up in practically no time, and it gets amazingly hot but doesn&#x27;t scorch my hair.  </li>
            <li> IT IS NO HEAVY</li>
            <li> All I wanted was to know where to get it fixed.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer said my warranty was void because I purchased it through Amazon and because this is a professional use product, Amazon was not an authorized seller.</li>
            <li> At first it took a long time to reach 400 degrees.  </li>
            <li> but I do have to go over twice to actually get a straight section.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> so far I like it.  </li>
            <li> One pass of the Croc (completely factory sealed) through my hair</li>
            <li> were we going to fast, low temp, etc, etc.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it really damages my ends.</li>
            <li> On the downside: it is huge, and the handles are not exactly easy on the hands.  </li>
            <li> My hair is natural (which means I have no chemicals in my hair) and this flat iron gets my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> I AM VERY PLEASE WITH MY FLAT IRON, SO FAR IS THE BUY I HAVE DONE.</li>
            <li> Apparently the power cord (where it connects inside the cord-end of the iron is very sensitive)</li>
            <li> It heats up and cools down quickly, it does not snag or rip my hair.</li>
            <li> heats and cools down quickly.</li>
            <li> Not buying this flat iron for that much ever again!!&lt;br /&gt;BY</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes her flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is very easy to straighten but one of my girls hair is very thick and wavy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this straightener back in 2011 and it still works (2015) as if it was new!</li>
            <li> So, I took both the infrared and classic replacements in to be repaired last year in December.</li>
            <li> This is my second Croc Classic I&#x27;ve purchased in those 4 years.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent more money on other products that couldnt deliver and this one was under $100!</li>
            <li> It is the First Flat Iron that I have ever purchased that has maintained the straightness that I have tried for years to control, especially since I have Naturally Curly Hair.</li>
            <li> really, really hope in a few months, I can write another positive review.</li>
            <li> really, really hope in a few months, I can write another positive review.</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener, but in my opinion it&#x27;s too expensive to only last for six months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same flat iron my hair stylist uses.</li>
            <li> Going back to my old Chi that is over 5 years old!</li>
            <li> We had slept over at a friends house and she had her croc classic nano-titanium flat iron for over a year and loves it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron and cannot believe that I wasted my time with my former drugstore bought flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have actually already dropped it and it&#x27;s still like new.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This morning my hair was totally crimped in 10 different directions from my hair-tie, and after a couple minutes with this thing it was totally straight.  </li>
            <li> but not until it allowed me to complete straightening my entire head of hair completely one</li>
            <li> I love that it heats up to 450 degrees since I have such thick hair.</li>
            <li> The Croc wasn&#x27;t my first choice by any means; in fact, I only decided I wanted it when there was 4 minutes left to qualify for next day shipping.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t have to keep going over and over it to get rid of frizz that my other straighteners didn&#x27;t get the first time.</li>
            <li> She offered no other solutions and told me the tech would determine if I had to pay for the repair or not, depending on what the issue was.</li>
            <li> -down, the croc has better features than any others remotely in the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;Heats</li>
            <li> Works great but only lasted 6 months, this product is too expensive for such a short life span.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few minutes to cool down, by wife unplugs and does a few more touchups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine thick hair</li>
            <li> Wow, even though this straightener is a little more expensive, it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I had always used a chi flat iron, lasted me a few years actually, went online to find something just as good but maybe a little cheaper and found the Croc,</li>
            <li> And now I need a new flat</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really cool is the little digital screen shows it heating up to whatever temperature you&#x27;ve chosen.</li>
            <li> The iron is super lightweight, but the plates are large enough to let me get through my superthick, waist-length curls in half the time other irons take.  </li>
            <li> Not only did this iron reduce my styling time, but it left my hair shiny and straight after passing over each section only two times.  </li>
            <li> Now I am out alot of money and apparently the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty does not apply for purchases on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and apparently you can curl your hair with it</li>
            <li> later I am more than annoyed sitting here at work looking like \\&quot;Wild thing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on a company or product that isnt worth it.</li>
            <li> It heats right up and just glides through the hair,but if you want to add a little curl to your hair..</li>
            <li> My hairdresser only uses this flat iron and highly recommended that I purchase.</li>
            <li> straight so when I do purchase my next flat iron, I will be going back to teeth.</li>
            <li> I was interested in two other straighteners, but I won&#x27;t name them and possibly steer you from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Once again, I am an avid flat iron user and I have spent lots of $$$ trying to find an iron that would give me the results that this Croc delivered.</li>
            <li> 18 months is a decent enough time for a product to last that is used daily.  </li>
            <li> My hair is smoother than with any other straightener, and it holds up well under a reasonable amount of humidity without any product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron 9 months ago and it has completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> I was using a quality, professional flat iron.</li>
            <li> Other than that it came fast.</li>
            <li> I want a new flat iron that works or my money back!</li>
            <li> It heats up insanely fast, has several heat options, and I have had minimal heat damage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty solid, not like something you&#x27;d get from the Walgreens down the street.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a professional, high-grade flat iron, this is definitely the one for you!</li>
            <li> so no long wait.</li>
            <li> The cord is a pretty heavy duty one and it swivels when you turn the straightener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional cosmetologist and it&#x27;s the only flat iron that I will use!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to worry about burning the house down, haha.</li>
            <li> The temp heats up within seconds and cools down almost as fast.  </li>
            <li> Heats up salon style and cools down almost as fast.  </li>
            <li> THE OTHER SAYS TURBOION CROC CLASSIC..</li>
            <li> While I absolutely LOVE the croc flat iron, I was not happy with this \\&quot;classic\\&quot; version after it stopped working after only 4 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li> I guess I expected angels to start singing when I used this new straightener.  </li>
            <li> then I just threw it across the room on the tile and broke it straight in half.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous to order this flat iron due to some of the reviews saying that theirs broke, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It heats evenly and straightens my thick hair so much faster than a normal flat iron.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly to straighten my hair, but it will also curl my hair just as well (once I got the technique down).</li>
            <li> I have near waist length thick, curly hair and after I use it I have straight shiny hair.</li>
            <li> After calling them back the following day and being told the same thing, we had them tear up the return check and just keep the flat iron as it would be a $75 total cost between shipping and repairs when all was said and</li>
            <li> I  noticed my hair becoming broken off and dry.  </li>
            <li> at least twice to get their hair just right.</li>
            <li> Croc Classic Nano-Titanium Flat Iron Straightener (Black Titanium Plate) 450 degrees]]</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002I4Z6TG Croc Classic Nano-Titanium Flat Iron Straightener (Black Titanium Plate) 450 degrees]]</li>
            <li> I have not even had this product a year and the plate completely came off of one side and is starting to come off of the other.</li>
            <li> Croc&#x27;s timing was the same as other professional irons I have used.</li>
            <li> My salon only uses and recommends this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for the sole pupose of using it when I put my keratin product in my hair.  </li>
            <li> We retail various flat irons at my salon</li>
            <li> I would only use this flat iron for straightening systems.</li>
            <li> This is the only downfall I see for this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this flat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only flat iron my wife will use.  </li>
            <li> My second flat iron just died.  </li>
            <li> After only using it couple of times, the flat iron stopped working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a regular flat iron for the longest time and was considering replacing it for a chi...</li>
            <li> It used to take me close to 40 minutes to do my hair (about 20 mins blow drying, 20 mins with the flat iron) and even then, it would often end up frizzy as soon as I went outside.</li>
            <li> I think my next flat iron will have be ceramic :-\</li>
            <li> None of those irons straightened as well as the Croc Nano Black Titanium and unfortunately, they costed more!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this flat iron to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> Then it only takes me about another 10-15mins with the flat iron, and voila!</li>
            <li> Im convinced that it is the exact same flat iron as the Coppola keratin complex flat iron which wholesales for double the price.</li>
            <li> I was very wary of spending this much money on something for my hair, but if you&#x27;re replacing your straighteners as much as I was, it&#x27;s actually financially smart in the long run to invest in something durable.</li>
            <li> My previous straightener was less than $20 and pretty basic.  </li>
            <li> The swivel cord is extra long.  </li>
            <li> and we needed a another flat iron with 2 teenagers in the house.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wiring inside the power cord, where it connects to the flat iron, was faulty.</li>
            <li> When this Flat Iron works, my wife loves this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Croc flat iron 2 weeks ago and it&#x27;s already broken!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for this product to stop heating up properly.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron FOUR YEARS AGO.</li>
            <li> The ends of the flat iron are virtually untouchable</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about flat irons and went with this one.</li>
            <li> The cord is extra long which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I have long somewhat wavy hair, almost to my middle, and I am done within 15 min.</li>
            <li> So I have purchased a cheaper flat iron for traveling and will probably by another Croc strickly for home use.</li>
            <li> Used to be long time CHI only buyer until the father died and sons took over company.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended I purchase this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have bought this Croc Flat Iron for myself about 2 years ago</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron to give to my cousin which she loves mine</li>
            <li> I brought this flat iron for my wife over a 1 1/2 years ago.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a flat iron</li>
            <li> so I went to a store in my city and bought another Croc Classis Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> If you have to flat iron your hair, this is the one.  </li>
            <li> I did not like this flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> so we finaly had to look into a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> and my wife loves the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I would go with a Keratin flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron for over 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned CHI flat irons for as long as I can remember but after trying out my friend&#x27;s Croc, I knew my next flat iron would have to be a Croc!</li>
            <li> Loved it, but it didn&#x27;t last very long :(</li>
            <li> previously to ordering this item I had a 5 year old t3 that i&#x27;d bought from sephora.</li>
            <li> Turbo Ion to see what I could do since less than 1 year old.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to splurge on an expensive hair straightener, and this was a fantastic purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily heavy, but it&#x27;s sort of oddly shaped with the finger grips.</li>
            <li> It stays soft (and straight) with no fly a ways.</li>
            <li> Literally half way done with my hair and it just completely shuts off on me and stopped working ever since.</li>
            <li> I have owned at least 5 of them and keep buying them every time because they are the only ones that really do the job.</li>
            <li> This is certainly not the most expensive iron that I&#x27;ve bought, but my hair stylist recommended it</li>
            <li> , I blow dry it well, then use the flat iron to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is VERY curly and hard to control.</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t think of a negative thing to say about it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth $80 if I know it&#x27;s only going to last 11 months...</li>
            <li> The Croc also gets the job done faster than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve used, and I like the digital display that lets you know</li>
            <li> I told the rep that the SAME problems that were fixed in the past were happening AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I also like the long swivel cord.</li>
            <li> So now its not such a drag to do my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this iron and I&#x27;ve been putting off on buying it for a long time.</li>
            <li> He could have fixed it, but after taking it apart, it was just too much trouble.</li>
            <li> Wish the automatic turn off wasn&#x27;t so long.</li>
            <li> The settings allow all of us to use it at different temps, and it cuts down on the time we spend actually straightening it.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry and it even takes hairdressers at the salon a long time to straighten the hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read other reviews, you may have seen talk of the croc not turning on, not heating up properly, or messing up at the cord.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve read other reviews, you may have seen talk of the croc not turning on, not heating up properly, or messing up at the cord.</li>
            <li> Please be careful ordering this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> obviously junk, tried everything I could think of to get it to turn on (using other outlets...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take nearly as long to straighten my hair, and it feels so silky!</li>
            <li> My other one finally died out after 4 years.</li>
            <li> I used to get a hair cut only every other time</li>
            <li> I like that the plates are a little larger than the standard irons.</li>
            <li> I have extremely wavy, coarse hair that is almost impossible to not only get straight, but stay straight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I don&#x27;t even have to dry my hair all the way.</li>
            <li> A few days later, the company called us and said the repair would cost $50 because they only deal with hair professionals and they would not honor purchases made on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair that is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and have tried several brands, by far, the Croc has beat them all.  </li>
            <li> I could not live without this Iron.</li>
            <li> Croc Classic Nano-Titanium Flat Iron (Black Titanium Plate) 450 degrees]] broken off the iron and was barely hanging on!</li>
            <li> hair is wavy and very thick and at 430 I can get even a bump that was created by my wet hair being put into a ponytail straight in about ten seconds.</li>
            <li> But it is not worth the money to have to constantly replace it.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> My hair also has volume and doesn&#x27;t lay flat on my head (as it did with the other irons).</li>
            <li> I still wouldnt buy a flat iron that only works for a few months.</li>
            <li> Does not pull my hair like other flat irons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional stylist and I&#x27;ve used this iron for the past 4 years.  </li>
            <li> Very sad, but make sure you buy it with a warranty.</li>
            <li> I am suddenly wearing my hair down every single day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only down side is my hair seems to loose shine after I straighten.  </li>
            <li> It has cut down on having to do my hair multiple times to straighten it.</li>
            <li> I only used this iron a total of 9 times and on the 10th use, I was straightening a small section at the nape of my client when I see smoke and a piece of her hair fall.</li>
            <li> Same product my stylist uses n was e half the price she quoted me.</li>
            <li> I Only used it 3 times with in a month and half.</li>
            <li> For a product that  is expensive, this should not have happened, it burning out that quickly and not once but twice.  </li>
            <li> When you spend this much you expect at least a year out of it!</li>
            <li> My other straighteners only lasted 2 years about on average</li>
            <li> If unsupervised, I have little doubt that a fire would have been next.</li>
            <li> I would be done with my hair in less than 20 mins and that was not the case before this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I just wish these lasted as long as they used to, this is my 4th one and they seem to last less and less.</li>
            <li> My previous flat iron had teeth and it helped pull my curls</li>
            <li> but it just suddenly shut down on me after just ONE MONTH!  </li>
            <li> Disappointing for sure, and wish seller would have at least emailed me back to let me know.</li>
            <li> I contacted customer service only to get a RUDE REPLY back!</li>
            <li> hair from sleeping on it wet.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> and I spent a lot of money on it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it a few weeks ago, but have used it multiple times already.</li>
            <li> but it proves me wrong every time.</li>
            <li> But be careful because it will fry your hair if you use it every</li>
            <li> you do have to be careful</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did seem to take a few passes, but maybe the temp is too low, but my wife is also over-due for the blowout.  </li>
            <li> The return window closed 3 days ago.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> (they both have naturally curly, thick hair).  </li>
            <li> The only iron that will work on my daughter&#x27;s extremely thick, coarse and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating that this is made so good, but really it is made like crap.</li>
            <li> I also really like the fact it has an automatic shut off, because being that I&#x27;m not a morning person, I&#x27;m usually running late.</li>
            <li> The only negative I would say so far (owned for a month) is the flat iron is a bit small and having curly hair you have to straighten small sections at a time.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick wavy hair, and it only takes me about 30 minutes to straighten.</li>
            <li> After only 8 months it has quit working, will not heat up past 100 degrees.  </li>
            <li> and made curling a bit difficult at first</li>
            <li> I usually can not turn it on, and when I can, it stays on for only a couple seconds before turning off.</li>
            <li> It worked really well straightening my hair but for something that expensive, it should last a few years.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like some other flatirons i have used.</li>
            <li> No thanks croc!</li>
            <li> it was what I expected!</li>
            <li> Extremely durable.  </li>
            <li> THE OTHER IRON I BROUGHT AT LIKE 85.00..</li>
            <li> THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE OTHER</li>
            <li> /&gt;Which is over-the-top, energy-wasting, &amp; dangerously hot for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I dropped my other one and broke it.</li>
            <li> I had my other Croc for 7 years before I had any problem with it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to other people that use straighteners.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and I use prob every other day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous, I barely used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mentioned, I&#x27;ve used this flat iron once a week for seven long years and it hasn&#x27;t failed me until yesterday, where it went to that big, curly hairball in the sky....</li>
            <li> it works but its definately NOT worth the price.</li>
            <li> 2) to have to turn it back on at least 5 times all while I&#x27;m trying to flat-iron my hair and get out the door in the morning.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Since I bought on Amazon the warranty is not valid, I was forced to buy another one (I went with a different brand)</li>
            <li> Would hear all the way up and then immediately shut down.</li>
            <li> so we just turn it down to a lower setting.</li>
            <li> it starts cooling down.  </li>
            <li> I look at the handle, as some times my hand will hit the on/off button and it is shut down.  </li>
            <li> I have had the replacement for 2 months and just YESTERDAY I was at my salon and went to use it only to find that not only had the same 3 things broken on it once again, but now the spring was broken so it wouldn&#x27;t even close.</li>
            <li> However, some other reviewers said it broke after a few months...</li>
            <li> Did not measure up to my  previouse flat iron, the Salon Tech and was not effective with my hair type.</li>
            <li> The box was empty when I received my flat iron - all excited to use and imagine the surprise when I opened the box to the iron and it was empty - very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a 1 and one half inch iron for longer hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased mine on Amazon less than a year ago, and it came with a 1-year warranty card from manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with relaxed hair</li>
            <li> I use it on 350, it heats up quickly, no hair snagging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy here again, though, because their price is half what it would be anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up in a matter of seconds and cuts your hair time in half........</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I had used one that belonged to someone else previously.</li>
            <li> The power cord connection broke less than a year.</li>
            <li> Month and a half it died on me.</li>
            <li> and there were slight differences.  </li>
            <li> it was half the price of the one in the store.</li>
            <li> It also stopped working less than a year.</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for about a year &amp; half.</li>
            <li> When it burned out, I decided to go with a less expensve one.  </li>
            <li> (I did say it was long and thick) and this iron cut it down to about 45 minutes, which, for those of us that are blessed with a lot of hair, know 15 minutes means</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m outside the return window to Amazon which is hardly their fault but the fault of the manufacturer for making such a poorly made product.  </li>
            <li> Was hesitant because of negative reviews about how long it lasted.  </li>
            <li> you have to mess w the cord.</li>
            <li> I have really really thick long curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry</li>
            <li> Let me say this: THIS LITTLE BITCH WILL STRAIGHTEN THE HELL OUT OF YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE BITCH WILL STRAIGHTEN THE HELL OUT OF YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> Bought this a little over a year</li>
            <li> Please please please read the other reviews!!</li>
            <li> I googled the problem and apparently this is a normal problem for this product which is terrible since it only lasted 6 months.</li>
            <li> I do not use this everyday either.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks I gave up on it.</li>
            <li> it is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a stylist and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Keeps the heat and unlike a lot of irons the plates and arm stayed firm</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this premium flatiron.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this - buy another brand.</li>
            <li> Even after a few drops onto tile floor</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was kinda nervous to purchase this, but I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now</li>
            <li> I was using it to straighten my hair and went to fix a few pieces</li>
            <li> THEN not 2 months into using it (and not even everyday) 3 things broke on the iron  simultaneously, forcing me to send it in for repair.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy it because a few days after my haircut, my straightener broke.</li>
            <li> It ended up going dead on me</li>
            <li> What a waste of my $75 dollars</li>
            <li> They offered me $30 Amazon credit for the trouble.</li>
            <li> I refuse to waste my money.</li>
            <li> Because the mirror in the room did not allow her to see behind her, I assisted with the back portion.  </li>
            <li> My wife has used this sporadically for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and the flat iron</li>
            <li> One less thing to worry about!</li>
            <li> It has cut my styling time in half!</li>
            <li> and it lasted less than a year!</li>
            <li> It has reduced the amount of time it took me to straighten my hair in half!</li>
            <li> THE WAY this happened in less than a YEAR!</li>
            <li> It takes a lot less time to straighten my hair than it used to!</li>
            <li> I hope this review will help other people who have hard to straighten hair.  </li>
            <li> SO YOU CAN FLAT YOUR HAIR AND DON&#x27;T GET TIRED.</li>
            <li> I would get another one but to afraid it want last long.</li>
            <li> One of them separated and so I found myself with a broken flat iron!!!  </li>
            <li> so I have a blend of very tight curls.</li>
            <li> Have thin hair in the front and thick in the back and like the fact that the temperature can be adjusted for both types.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money!!</li>
            <li> One swipe usually does the trick.</li>
            <li> no more thinking to myself \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li> I knew something was up because in the past whenever it is shut off by pressing the off switch</li>
            <li> I usually always take my showers at night, because I am not a morning person.</li>
            <li> I cannot return it to amazon because it is past the 30 days that amazon garuantees and the manufacturer will not  honor the one year product warrenty if it is purchased from amazon.  </li>
            <li> I am anxious to use it.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even bother registering the warranty because who expects an expensive item such as this to stop working within a year</li>
            <li> I have [just past] shoulder length hair, so</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll never buy another one because it&#x27;s expensive to last six months.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and usually pay $100 for a Croc.</li>
            <li> so I usually program my straightener to about 420.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad my iron broke after only 1 year</li>
            <li> She was very curt and talked down to me as though i was an idiot for buying it.  </li>
            <li> recommend this iron for individuals you have hard to tame hair</li>
            <li> It has been an uphill battle and I have tried every process(relaxer:(, japanese straightening,etc) and flat iron (CHI,T3,InStyler,Hot Tools,FHI).  </li>
            <li> Wish it were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped and broke this model on a very hard floor after a few years of use.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing though to have something that cost this much break.</li>
            <li> and I still had the same results the following day despite the bad weather conditions (humid and rainy!)</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with straightened my hair because it&#x27;s soo curly</li>
            <li> They have all lasted at least two years before something happening...</li>
            <li> I have owned at least 5</li>
            <li> My plan was to purchase a Keratin Complex</li>
            <li> Im always running late</li>
            <li> It should have at least a one year warranty.  </li>
            <li> I want something that I can get 3 years out of.... at least.</li>
            <li> (duh..</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day, I&#x27;ve got shoulder length thick hair, and it takes no time to straighten it in the morning.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel silky (and I have thick, frizzy straw hair) and in record time.</li>
            <li> I have THICK, CURLY/WAVY hair and</li>
            <li> I looked down to see the plastic around the plates melting!!!</li>
            <li> but as usual I thought \\&quot;na, this wont happen to me\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I mean if it was a junk one you buy at walmart, I could see</li>
            <li> no more Croc!</li>
            <li> I have tried them all - CHI, T3, ProStyler, Sedu and the highly rated Hana Elite (which for $229, was CRAP).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bend the cord tightly at the base when wrapping it and you won&#x27;t have a short in the cord you&#x27;ll have to pay for to fix.</li>
            <li> and it is also less expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is the third unit after the others failed.  </li>
            <li> If the Croc was less expensive I would buy another</li>
            <li> It is so ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I contacted Croc customer service and was told that because I bought it for less than $125, this item is probably refurbished and/or fake.  </li>
            <li> People, heed these bad reviews that all say the same thing: the thing breaks after 6 months and the one year warranty offered by Croc is not applicable to their products purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that it fell once</li>
            <li> Clearly a bad internal connection.  </li>
            <li> Sellers on Amazon do not tell you the warranty is no good with the manufacter if purchased thru Amazon, Ebay, etc.  </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s hard to do!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so mad, disappointed, and out all the money I spent so that I could have a \\&quot;high-quality\\&quot; flat iron.</li>
            <li> I accidently stumbled upon this iron after I had ordered the Hana Elite from Misikko and was disappointed with how frizzy it left my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because this had such rave</li>
            <li> THE NAMES CAN BE VERY CONFUSING..</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter who has very thick, curly hair...</li>
            <li> My sister has very thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I just assume there will always be a few people unhappy for one reason on another.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for out-of-box failure.</li>
            <li> I seriously could&#x27;ve injured myself or lost my home!</li>
            <li> I was continually disappointed when they either A) broke after a few months use;</li>
            <li> Well, this flat iron hasn&#x27;t disappointed her yet, it does the job!</li>
            <li> WTF?</li>
            <li> I used it three times and it&#x27;s broken what a piece of junk!  </li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;that&#x27;s really sad as I purchased 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Bought two as gifts and both failed to heat up after about a year.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these since they came out and have tried others in between (expensive ones too)</li>
            <li> Not Happy!!!!</li>
            <li> After posting on Instagram about how awful their product and customer service is I got feedback from tons of people with the same problem!</li>
            <li> so sad never buying this s</li>
            <li> I have found nothing wrong with this item</li>
            <li> unfortunately this weekend it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> This product was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the bad reviews of this product before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> it disconnected somehow and now I have a bad iron</li>
            <li> I must have one with a bad cord.</li>
            <li> Now they are asking why should we help you when you are talking bad about our company????  </li>
            <li> I would get a root touch-up, but now I have to get it every time since my split ends are so bad; it&#x27;s taking my hair forever to grow out because of all the damage.</li>
            <li> This poor worst purchase ever did NOT work at ALL&#x27; wont turn on it just died!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, we are extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Basically, this thing was a piece of crap</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate to read the reviews where the straightener just stopped working for some people, fingers crossed that mine will not do that!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> BAD PRODUCT !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This item lasted about two months, Very Disappointing!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This seller is pathetic, and I would not recommend anyone buy from them.</li>
            <li> Heat temp level button is in the worst location!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent! Highly recommended. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years and works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a chi and a Paul Mitchell. But neither compare to my Croc. Its is by far the best.</li>
            <li> After the first week the heating element stopped working. Would hear all the way up and then immediately shut down. Second Croc that&#x27;s happened to.</li>
            <li> Love it! Heats wonderfully, doesn&#x27;t burn and absolutely a value for the price! No longer a chi fan this croc is the BEST!</li>
            <li> This is the first straightener that work!  I have fine thick hair and it really works great.  Heats up in seconds!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron I have ever owned.  The digitial temp reading is precise and it gets to desired temp quickly.  It glides through my hair and leaves a smooth silky finish.  I am especially happy with the shape of the handle and the weight of the device.  It fits my hand nicely and is light.  I also like the long swivel cord.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know my hair could look so wonderful! Would recommend this to anyone without a doubt.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron, heats up in seconds!</li>
            <li> THIS FLAT IRON IS AMAZINGGGGG!!! :-) The best price &amp; free shipping is on Amazon, which is why I love Amazon :-) My hair is dyed blonde every 6-8 weeks &amp; I also have the Keratin/ Brazilian Blowout Treatment. My salon only uses and recommends this flat iron. Make sure you buy the black titanium plates only. It prevents damage and runs smoothly over your hair. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. Really happy with the shipping and the packaging it came in. Think this is by far the best hair tool I have. Would recommend this product to all my friends. Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have an Amika Hair Straightener and by mistake I left it in Kolkata when I went to visit last Dec. I needed one and based on all the Internet research I was pretty convinced that the Croc would be the best buy in this price range. However, I am not very happy with it as it does not perform as good as Amika. It dries out my hair and still leaves my hair frizzy while straightening. With Amika I always end up with silky smooth straight hair.</li>
            <li> T was really hoping that this would be an amazing straightner. But.....its about the same as a redular 20 dollar walmart straightner. I cant believe that I paid that much money for it! it works but its definately NOT worth the price. Save yourself some money and dont buy it!</li>
            <li> This product was used at home once a day by two people.  After only 8 months it has quit working, will not heat up past 100 degrees.  I am going to attempt to get it replaced from manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Straightener works absolutely wonderful. Heats up fast and cools down quick. Runs super smooth over hair, does not snag hairs. Love the long cord. It cuts back my hair straightening time significantly. One swipe usually does the trick. Completely satisfied!! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always owned fairly \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; straighteners--just ones I picked up at the local drugstore. I was continually disappointed when they either A) broke after a few months use; B) didn&#x27;t get hot enough; or C) didn&#x27;t heat up fast enough. One of my good friends is a hair stylist and recommended I try the Croc. She uses it on her clients and they also sell them at her salon (Amazon is cheaper, of course). I was very wary of spending this much money on something for my hair, but if you&#x27;re replacing your straighteners as much as I was, it&#x27;s actually financially smart in the long run to invest in something durable. You get what you pay for, right? My favorite thing about this iron is that it heats up SUPER fast. Like, within a minute. I have medium-length, fine hair that&#x27;s naturally wavy and surprisingly pretty stubborn to straighten, but the Croc makes it a breeze. The automatic shut-off is a great feature... no more thinking to myself \\&quot;Oh no, did I unplug the straightener?!?\\&quot;, which I used to do all the time. Also, I love the design of the Croc; slim and comfortable to hold. I hate to read the reviews where the straightener just stopped working for some people, fingers crossed that mine will not do that! With all of that said, I give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the bad reviews of this product before I purchased it. I always look to see how many good reviews there are for a product in comparison to bad ones - if the majority are good I just assume there will always be a few people unhappy for one reason on another. But in this case EVERYONE has had the same problem that I&#x27;m experiencing now so BEWARE!!! I loved my Croc flat iron as soon as I got it and it worked great for about 6 months. The only issue I had was that, because of where the on/off switch is on the handle, you could sometimes turn it off inadvertently depending on how you held it. However, at about the 6 month mark (like so many others), it started to turn itself off even when I wasn&#x27;t holding it or when I hadn&#x27;t inadvertently shut it off. I knew something was up because in the past whenever it is shut off by pressing the off switch it makes a beeping sound. Now, when it shut off on its own there was no beeping sound. The iron works but I can&#x27;t tell you how aggravating it is to have to 1) have no notice when it shuts itself off (no beeping sound) and 2) to have to turn it back on at least 5 times all while I&#x27;m trying to flat-iron my hair and get out the door in the morning. People, heed these bad reviews that all say the same thing: the thing breaks after 6 months and the one year warranty offered by Croc is not applicable to their products purchased on Amazon. Save your money or buy the iron directly from Croc!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional and I love it! This flat iron looks great! It has a nice digital temperature display, makes hair shine and smooth like no other, excelente for brazilian keratin treatments, no static eletricity or frizz, the black titanium really makes a big diference, and the price is the best you can find. Just get one for your self, you will \\&quot;LOVE IT\\&quot;. My clients are leaving with a big smile, it makes my day great!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome straightener!  Bought it for my daughter who has very thick, curly hair...she loves it! says it&#x27;s the best one she ever used.</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser and this is exactly what I needed, love the digital temp read out.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT flat iron!  My friends and family would consider me a \\&quot;hair snob\\&quot; as I only use the best products on the mane!  This is a fantastic flat iron...I can flat iron my hair in under 10 minutes and it stays silky smooth all day long!  There&#x27;s no tugging, snagging or pulling like the CHI, FHI and GHD irons give!  I would pay full price for this Iron...it&#x27;s a steal!  The Croc does get REALLY hot, so I never go above 360 degrees!  I have no  complaints!  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> My previous straightener was less than $20 and pretty basic.  I guess I expected angels to start singing when I used this new straightener.  The morning I first used it, I thought \\&quot;this is it???\\&quot;  I didn&#x27;t see much difference from my old one.  Then when I came home that night, I realized my hair looked basically the same as when I left that morning.  And the angels sang......  My hair, which I will admit is straight anyway (but prone to flyaways), looks and feels better, and stays straight far longer than with my old straightener.  My 17-year-old daughter even noticed and said my hair looked much prettier.</li>
            <li> WARNING: This may be one of the longest reviews you&#x27;ve ever seen. First things first, my croc did arrive on time as promised. That&#x27;s always a plus, since the mail man is always &amp;#34;losing your package&amp;#34; or something. 😑&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week ago, I decided I needed a new straightener. I&#x27;m the kind of person that does a lot of research and depend on the reviews given by others who have purchased the product. With that being said, I was kind of conflicted after reading through some of the reviews. Many people said the product was awesome, while others didn&#x27;t have anything good to say about it. The Croc wasn&#x27;t my first choice by any means; in fact, I only decided I wanted it when there was 4 minutes left to qualify for next day shipping. I was interested in two other straighteners, but I won&#x27;t name them and possibly steer you from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One review in particular won me over about the croc - the one that said it straightens &amp;#34;lumpy&amp;#34; hair from sleeping on it wet. I usually always take my showers at night, because I am not a morning person. Seeing that someone else does the same kind of put me in their shoes. I figured, if it works for her, it&#x27;ll work for me. Plus, while researching, I came across something that said titanium plates flat irons worked the best and were about the best quality you can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So of course I opened the package as soon as I got home and tried it out. My first thoughts were, &amp;#34;Wow, this one&#x27;s heavier than my old one. It feels very sturdy!&amp;#34; I love that the croc has an adjustable digital temperature. It took about a minute or so for it to reach it&#x27;s maximum heat. What&#x27;s really cool is the little digital screen shows it heating up to whatever temperature you&#x27;ve chosen. I also really like the fact it has an automatic shut off, because being that I&#x27;m not a morning person, I&#x27;m usually running late. I won&#x27;t have to worry about burning the house down, haha. Okay, so now on to the actual quality. Let me say this: THIS LITTLE BITCH WILL STRAIGHTEN THE HELL OUT OF YOUR HAIR. The first pass through my hair scared me, because it literally just glided through my hair. I thought I burnt my hair off at first! Speaking of which, this straightener did not fry my hair or cause a smelly burnt odor. It worked beautifully. I&#x27;m so happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all of that being said, I have only used this straightener once. If you&#x27;ve read other reviews, you may have seen talk of the croc not turning on, not heating up properly, or messing up at the cord. I obviously haven&#x27;t experienced that yet, but I really think it has a lot to do with how you handle and care for the straightener. It comes with a one year warranty through the company, but the titanium plates are basically guaranteed for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, really hope in a few months, I can write another positive review. I have a fairly normal, color treated bob hair cut. Comparing the croc to my old straightener, this one definitely makes my hair look and feel a lot better. Hopefully this review helped! 😊: THIS LITTLE BITCH WILL STRAIGHTEN THE HELL OUT OF YOUR HAIR. The first pass through my hair scared me, because it literally just glided through my hair.

            <li> This Croc was just what I hoped it would be and worked just like I wanted. My hair is soft and strait. No damage so far. I set it on 350 but it goes hotter then that. It does not pull my hair and I have not burned myself. It heats up fast enough that you are not waiting and waiting. I have had it only about 1 month but really like it so far. It feels well made and the cord feels strong. I really like the look and feel of it. It looks nice in my bathroom, :)</li>
            <li> This flat iron is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  Hair stays straight and frizz free for days.  Heats up quickly so be careful. Your hair is smooth and shiney after using.  The digital temperature control is great because not everyone needs to use 450 degrees for great results. I only need to use 420 or 430 degrees on my hair type.  I purchased the 1 inch plate which is good for short to medium hair length.  My daughter has a 1 and one half inch iron for longer hair.  Both give you excellent results.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned.  It glides through my hair so easily and makes it so soft and shiny.  I would definitely recommend this flat iron to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> Great iron heats up fast and gives you salon hair, I also like the safety turn off option. It saves me from that \\&quot;did I unplug it?\\&quot; worry</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for the sole pupose of using it when I put my keratin product in my hair.  The reason being is that the keratin needs to be locked into the hair by heat of 450 degrees.  This amazing flat iron has a digital temperature guide that tells you when it is hot enough.  Also the plates do not burn your hair. I am left with smooth sleek hair every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I am a multi-racial 20-something female with waist-length hair.  I have spent the majority of my life trying to fight the natural texture of my hair.  It has been an uphill battle and I have tried every process(relaxer:(, japanese straightening,etc) and flat iron (CHI,T3,InStyler,Hot Tools,FHI).  In the past I&#x27;ve had moderate success, but this flat iron is the greatest one I&#x27;ve ever used.  The digital temp control makes it foolproof.  The swivel cord is extra long.  The iron is super lightweight, but the plates are large enough to let me get through my superthick, waist-length curls in half the time other irons take.  The temp heats up within seconds and cools down almost as fast.  They sent a heat resistant pouch/mat to protect your table surfaces (a great accesory for flat iron users).  Not only did this iron reduce my styling time, but it left my hair shiny and straight after passing over each section only two times.  I used the iron once on my hair last week and this week I actually used it to do a Brazilian Keratin Treatment at home.  It was a shockingly easy process and I attribute that to this iron.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this flat iron.  Once again, I am an avid flat iron user and I have spent lots of $$$ trying to find an iron that would give me the results that this Croc delivered. I always read customer reviews to get a realistic description of a product.  I hope this review will help other people who have hard to straighten hair.  This iron delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome flat iron, heats up quickly, doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;tug\\&quot; on hair, leaves hair super shiny. Takes no time at all to straighten my hair.  Love, love, love it!!! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Please be careful ordering this flat iron.  It was great while it worked, but then suddenly stopped working after a couple of months and it was past the Amazon refund date, they won&#x27;t replace it.  Apparently the power cord (where it connects inside the cord-end of the iron is very sensitive) it disconnected somehow and now I have a bad iron and I spent a lot of money on it.  Very sad, but make sure you buy it with a warranty.</li>
            <li> So i have had this straightner about 6 months and until today it was perfect. I have super curly hair and it got the job done, but now the strightner wont heat up and reads error. I googled the problem and apparently this is a normal problem for this product which is terrible since it only lasted 6 months.</li>
            <li> This is a great item! We had a Chi for over a year and we needed a another flat iron with 2 teenagers in the house.&lt;br /&gt;My cousin recommended this item and I have to say we love it and we feel it works better than the Chi...and it is also less expensive which is an added plus.</li>
            <li> I loved my Croc flat iron for the first 5 months because that&#x27;s how long it lasted before it broke! It started turning off while I was using it.  The wiring inside the power cord, where it connects to the flat iron, was faulty. I wasn&#x27;t worried because I knew that my Croc had a one-year warranty for manufactured defects.  So, I returned my Croc to the manufacturer with $15 shipping/service fee to get a replacement. Shortly after that, I got a call from someone at Croc who informed me that CROC&#x27;S WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS SOLD ON AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so mad, disappointed, and out all the money I spent so that I could have a \\&quot;high-quality\\&quot; flat iron. The two lessons for all of you out there are: 1)Croc makes cheap flat irons, and 2)you should check to see if the product you are thinking of buying on Amazon has a warranty that covers the product if it is purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this Flat Iron based on the excellent reviews it received.  While it did do a good job when it was functioning it quit working completely just 30 days after purchase, which means I can NOT return it and am out over $80! Whatever you do, do not buy this item!! Very unsatisfied with the return policy also! Will buy local from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a hair stylist for 8 years and I have to say this is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.. Great value. Works awesome on all hair types and heats up fast. I would recommend staring out with the lower heat settings 350-380 because even on the craziest hair I rarely need to use any hotter then that. Im convinced that it is the exact same flat iron as the Coppola keratin complex flat iron which wholesales for double the price. We retail various flat irons at my salon but I recommend my clients buy this one instead. Definately use a&lt;br /&gt;Heat protecting spray before every use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these and loved them when they work, but they don&#x27;t last.  The first one I had lasted about 18 months and then just died.  It was something with the power cord.  I was OK with this. 18 months is a decent enough time for a product to last that is used daily.  So, I gave it another chance and purchased another one from amazon. It came quickly and worked great for 2 months, then died.  Same power cord issue.  I cannot return it to amazon because it is past the 30 days that amazon garuantees and the manufacturer will not  honor the one year product warrenty if it is purchased from amazon.  So, basically I am out $80 this time and two months is NOT enough time for me to say I am satisfied with my purchase.  Unless you have $80 to take a chance, I would go with something that is a bit more reliable.</li>
            <li> previously to ordering this item I had a 5 year old t3 that i&#x27;d bought from sephora. This iron was a much needed change but the only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t close quite as much as I&#x27;d like it to. Granted my hair is kind of, but not completely, on the thinner side and coarse. It heats up great and I love that its display is digital. I was worried that I might not be able to curl my hair with it, but it curls just fine. Overall it was a nice change from the t3 and I do love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great straightener, but in my opinion it&#x27;s too expensive to only last for six months.  I won&#x27;t buy another croc.</li>
            <li> Just want to make sure everyone pays attention to the statement by Amazon that says this&lt;br /&gt;product has no warranty when purchased on Amazon.  I purchased mine on Amazon less than a year ago, and it came with a 1-year warranty card from manufacturer.  The auto shut-off stopped working so I&lt;br /&gt;called Turbo Ion to see what I could do since less than 1 year old.  She told me that Amazon is not one of their distributors, so the warranty is void.  All I could do is send it in and trade for a new one at $95, then it would have a 1 yr. warranty.&lt;br /&gt;I will double-think my Amazon purchases from now on.</li>
            <li> When this Flat Iron works, my wife loves this product.  Unfortunately, this is the third unit after the others failed.  It arrived 18 days ago, used daily. and it literally melted down to the point that the (famous) titanium plates fell out.  If unsupervised, I have little doubt that a fire would have been next.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this flat iron until I traveled to India.  I plugged it into my converter (everything else worked fine) and it wouldn&#x27;t heat more than 69 degrees.  So I had three weeks of awesome blow dried crappy hair.  I thought it was just the conversion but once I got it home it still would only heat to 69.  Since I bought on Amazon the warranty is not valid, I was forced to buy another one (I went with a different brand) but I do not like it as much as I liked the Croc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part: It &#x27;remembers&#x27; your heat setting and beeps when ready.  My new one (supernova) has to be reset every time its turned off and it pulls my hair a bit - the Croc didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend if you are not an international traveler!  However, some other reviewers said it broke after a few months... so maybe don&#x27;t buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas after the hair salon we go to used it on her hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I ever owned, and I have used them all... Chi, T3, Babyliss Nano Titanium, you name it. Not only was it fabulous for my own coarse, frizzy hair, but also, since I am a hairstylist I have been using it for all the keratin treatments on my clients. Was great but only lasted 3 months before it just died!! Does not heat up at all! Granted, it did get alot of use in 3 months, but for $75 I expect it to last longer that that! Now I am out alot of money and apparently the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty does not apply for purchases on Amazon. WTF? I want a new flat iron that works or my money back! Should of freakin bought from the local beauty supply! *sigh*[[ASIN:B002I4Z6TG Croc Classic Nano-Titanium Flat Iron Straightener (Black Titanium Plate) 450 degrees]]</li>
            <li> I bought the Croc flat iron 2 weeks ago and it&#x27;s already broken!&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I loved it.  Then I used it only two more times and the results each time were not as good.  Then I tried  using it yesterday and it doesn&#x27;t even turn on anymore!  I used it three times and it&#x27;s broken what a piece of junk!  I&#x27;m returning for a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with relaxed hair but it&#x27;s been 10 weeks since my relaxer. My first flat iron was a Solia, which was ok but I gave it to my sister. So, I was looking for a new iron. I tried the highly rated Sedu, but I didn&#x27;t like it. It pulled my hair and did not glide well. I could hear my hair snapping as I tried to pull it through my hair--and no, my hair is pretty healthy so it&#x27;s not that. So, I tried the Croc.Love, love love. I use it on 350, it heats up quickly, no hair snagging. One pass for  me is enough to get my hair straight. I highly recommend  it</li>
            <li> This was a great flatiron and came highly recommended by my hair stylist.  Then one day it just stopped working for no reason.  I do not use this everyday either.  Probably only 2 times a week.  For the price of this flatiron it should have lasted longer than 3 months.  VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toy! I have extremely thick and frizzy hair. It takes forever to dry and it even takes hairdressers at the salon a long time to straighten the hair. It used to take me about 1 hour to 1 1/2 to simply straighten my hair. Now...it only takes me 20-25 min. So now its not such a drag to do my hair. I can finally let it grow again. lol.</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped and broke this model on a very hard floor after a few years of use. When I went to replace it, I saw a much cheaper flat iron with great reviews and purchased that instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That model does not hold a candle to this one. After a few weeks I gave up on it. It could not tame my frizzy hair where the Croc has always worked quick, easy and effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the cheap flatiron with another Croc. Its working great! Even with an accidental drop.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product.  I am so disappointed. I purchased product six months ago and just suddenly quit working.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and so far has worked great. I have long, curly hair and love that I can adjust the heat level. Love it.</li>
            <li> My wife asked for this iron for Christmas.  It is the same as the one her hairdresser uses.  Apparently it works great.</li>
            <li> Got the iron it worked great for about 4 weeks after that the iron heated only to 150 degrees, which did nothing to my hair!  Don&#x27;t buy this iron it is a waste of money.  Wish I read the reviews before I purchase the iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone who has medium wave to frizzy hair. Her hair is so straight and shiny after using this that she feels like the salon did it! The best part about it is it heats up to 450 in seconds so no waiting and it&#x27;s digital so you know when it&#x27;s fully heated. I have one as well and love it will never buy another brand again!</li>
            <li> I just finished hair school &amp; wanted to reward myself w/ a really good flat iron so I got the Croc bc in my opinion it is the best.  Well I found this one and it was the cheapest I had ever seen so even though I was nervous about it being so cheap I went against my better judgement &amp; bought it anyway! Well for the first 6 months it worked amazing but all of a sudden one day as I was doing my hair it turned off and it hasn&#x27;t come back on since.  I learned my lesson.. You get what you pay for! So I just bought my Croc from an authorized dealer &amp; it has a warranty so if something does happen then I can get it fixed BUT Im pretty sure it wont.  One of my best friends who has been a hairdresser for 6 years uses a Croc and she has had it for 2 years and its still going strong! Id rather pay more and have it be working years from now that pay less and have it break down on me in the morning while Im getting ready for work!  There is a reason they don&#x27;t offer a warranty... just think about that!</li>
            <li> The Croc is definitely the best flat iron I have tried.  I have thick naturally curly hair and I can straighten it very quickly and easily with this iron.  I also like being able to adjust the temp, which was something that was missing with the Chi irons. All around I like this iron very much.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to splurge on an expensive hair straightener, and this was a fantastic purchase.  It heats up quickly and I feel confident that it will safely turn off if for some reason I forget to unplug it.  I have thick wavy hair, and this straightener just works magic on the first pass.  My hair has never straightened so quickly!  I even reduced the temperature to 400 degrees (from 450) to ensure no split ends, and is leaves my hair silky.  It doesn&#x27;t snag on hair at all.  LOVE IT!  I debated buying ceramic vs. titanium and do not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought my flat iron exactly a year ago, and it worked for exactly a year. When it was working, it was great. I love how hot it gets. However, now it will only stay on for a few seconds then turns off on its own. It has actually been doing that for about a month. If the Croc was less expensive I would buy another but it&#x27;s not worth $80 if I know it&#x27;s only going to last 11 months...</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I love the digital display, and the whole product just seems high quality.  I am definitely happy that I chose to spend the money on it.  This morning my hair was totally crimped in 10 different directions from my hair-tie, and after a couple minutes with this thing it was totally straight.  It&#x27;s also super light, and easy to maneuver!</li>
            <li> This was a great deal, cheaper than the store I buy my professional products from! And that&#x27;s hard to do! A great deal for a great iron!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron. I have actually already dropped it and it&#x27;s still like new. No problems at all (knock on wood) ;)  I love how fast it straightens my hair and my hair actually stays straight! I used to have an iron just like it but, it broke so I bought the Croc. I have only good things to say. I use it on 420- 430 because sometimes 450 is too hot. I am Cuban and have really kinky curly and full hair...it works wonders! Definitely a great buy!!!! My sister has very thick wavy hair and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> I have actually owned 2 of these.  The first one had a thinner power cord and the piece of plastic covering the end of the cord broke, then it shorted out after about 6 months.  This one has a heavier cord but there still seems to be an issue with the cord (as another reviewer mentioned).  I never used it beyond 320 degrees and I don&#x27;t know if it overheated but it just suddenly shut down on me after just ONE MONTH!  I really loved the way it straightened/styled my hair but I will never buy another one. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener!  I wanted to upgrade to a \\&quot;nicer\\&quot; flat iron, and bought this one after reading the positive reviews.  My hair becomes very frizzy in humid weather, and my Croc has done a great job keeping my hair smooth throughout the day.  Also love the auto-off feature.  One less thing to worry about!</li>
            <li> I bought this poor quality flat iron not even a month ago,and on main event that i wanted my hair to look gorgeous straight! This poor worst purchase ever did NOT work at ALL&#x27; wont turn on it just died!</li>
            <li> The heat automatically goes up to 410 when you turn it on, and sometimes fluctuates even when you adjust it.</li>
            <li> I chose this because it was recommended by my hairstylist. I am anxious to use it.  The grip is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I would only use this flat iron for straightening systems. I only used this iron a total of 9 times and on the 10th use, I was straightening a small section at the nape of my client when I see smoke and a piece of her hair fall. The plate had[[ASIN:B002I4Z6TG Croc Classic Nano-Titanium Flat Iron (Black Titanium Plate) 450 degrees]] broken off the iron and was barely hanging on! The hair had fallen where the plate was suppose to be and burnt her hair completely off at the root! I will NEVER buy another Croc iron.</li>
            <li> I love the flat iron, its the best I&#x27;ve used. The problem is, it stopped working about two weeks ago (I&#x27;ve had it just six months) and I&#x27;ve contacted the seller several times with no response. It states on their site that all products are warrantied through the manufacturer but when I called CROC directly, they said they don&#x27;t warranty items purchased through Amazon. So, though the price through this seller is great, you cannot get a warrantied CROC no matter which was you swing it. Disappointing for sure, and wish seller would have at least emailed me back to let me know. I&#x27;ll probably buy here again, though, because their price is half what it would be anywhere else. I guess that&#x27;s the price you pay...[[ASIN:B002I4Z6TG Croc Classic Nano-Titanium Flat Iron Straightener (Black Titanium Plate) 450 degrees]]</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  My stylist recommend it for me and it has been amazing on my hair.  The best in the market for the money.</li>
            <li> Worked great for the LESS THAN 1 YEAR that I owned it. SUPER PISSED, turned off while I was using it then I just threw it across the room on the tile and broke it straight in half. Screw this Iron, find something else that lasts !!!!!!!!!!!!! BAD PRODUCT !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have used on my colored treated hair.  The heat is consistent, heats up quickly, and is non-damaging to color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Picked this iron out because of the reviews and it is great! The old iron I used was an inexpensive model and did not get very hot or have a large surface area. This iron gets very hot very quickly. My hair is fine and gets tangled easily and the plates are extremely smooth and do not pull my hair. Wonderful product, well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener back in 2011 and it still works (2015) as if it was new! I have dropped it probably twice and it is sturdy. I love how fast it heats up and how shiny it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> Wow, even though this straightener is a little more expensive, it is worth it! It has cut my styling time in half!</li>
            <li> I never dreamed a straightener mattered. I had a cheap one from Walmart to start with.  I  noticed my hair becoming broken off and dry.  I decided to take the plunge and after much research I decided on this croc.  wow!! am i pleased.  You will not be sorry.  This thing is beyond words awesome. I LOVE IT.  It is my baby. hair is gorgeous because of it and receives many compliments.  Thanks!! you must get one!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing flat iron I have tried. Ive tried many over the years and finally gave in a bought the one my hairdresser uses.&lt;br /&gt;My hair takes half the time it use to and stays perfect. Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Croc lives up to its claims. I have mixed hair and previous straighteners would work, but not that great, and my hair would go frizzy at the first hint of humidity. My hair now stays straight through the summer humidity and I wake up with it looking just as good the next day. I&#x27;ve only had it a couple months so I can&#x27;t speak to its longevity, but it is an awesome straightener and well worth the price (especially on Amazon)!</li>
            <li> I have had Hot Tools flat iron forever and resently decided to treat myself to the Croc. I love how straight it makes my hair look. Hope it&#x27;s keep up a good work!</li>
            <li> This amazing iron was well taken care of, but now it stops working on its own. I originally didn&#x27;t mind the fact that I had to keep my eye on the digital display to turn it back on 10 times during the straightening process. But it gets to the point where I have to wait 5 minutes before being able to turn it back on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s really sad as I purchased 3 weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THREE.WEEKS.AGO</li>
            <li> I have had to purchase three of these irons in one year because they easily break. There is a manufacturing defect because Turbo Ion decided to take their manufacturing and outsource it to another country. Yes, the iron is amazing when it works. But it is not worth the money to have to constantly replace it.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Order this hair straightener for my daughter and she&lt;br /&gt;Loves it.  Ordered this one because of the high temp (450)&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;She told me it was perfect; gets hot fast and does a great job.</li>
            <li> This is my 3 rd one I orederes ! This is the only brand I buy</li>
            <li> It works well.  I had to play with the temperature, because I have very curly hair, I blow dry it well, then use the flat iron to straighten my hair.  It does the work though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this flat iron.  My hair looks 100% better since I started using the Croc (had previously used an older model Helen of Troy staightener).  My hair is not at all frizzy and doesn&#x27;t look damaged.  The iron heats up quickly.  I like that I can set the temperature to an actual degree setting (not 1 - 12 or high/med/low).</li>
            <li> This iron is great!!! I&#x27;m a stylist and use it everyday. You can not beat the price or ask for a better iron!</li>
            <li> I liked this product, but it stopped working after a few months.  It will not turn on at all.  I would really like a response from the company selling this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this a little over a year and it still works like new!!! Keeps the heat and unlike a lot of irons the plates and arm stayed firm</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ever used.  I have very thick hair and the flat iron does it&#x27;s job with ease.  Was hesitant because of negative reviews about how long it lasted.  Not having any problems with mine and have already recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product, and so far I really love it. My old iron seemed to be burning my bangs, but so far, no issues with this one.</li>
            <li> The product worked great for one hair straightening treatment and about 10 regular uses before it just stopped working altogether. I had to return it for a credit. Really bummed.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best straightener that I have ever had. After years of using the CHI,  my stylist got one and I immediately noticed the difference in my hair and my daughters&#x27; hair (they both have naturally curly, thick hair).  The settings allow all of us to use it at different temps, and it cuts down on the time we spend actually straightening it.  The price at Amazon is better than even the professional supply houses.  I would totally recommend it to anyone.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is really good.  Definitly straightens! Heats up very fast and is comfortable to hold.  The only down side is my hair seems to loose shine after I straighten.  Just make sure you stock up on some good gloss  :)</li>
            <li> I accidently stumbled upon this iron after I had ordered the Hana Elite from Misikko and was disappointed with how frizzy it left my hair. It claimed to have 100% ceramic plates that would create smooth, glossy and shiny hair. I didnt get any of that with it. I decided to return it and look for another iron that would do exactly what I thought the Hana Elite would do. After buying and using the CROC Nano Titanium iron, I have to say this is by far the BEST iron I have used on my multi-racial curly, color-treated hair! I have tried them all - CHI, T3, ProStyler, Sedu and the highly rated Hana Elite (which for $229, was CRAP). None of those irons straightened as well as the Croc Nano Black Titanium and unfortunately, they costed more! This iron leaves my hair smooth, soft, shiny and frizz free. There is definitely a big difference with the nano titanium plates. They glide effortlessly through my hair and make styling a breeze! This iron does get extremely hot (exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!) and made curling a bit difficult at first but once I got the hang of it, I notice how any style I create lasts ALL day. My hair also has volume and doesn&#x27;t lay flat on my head (as it did with the other irons). I can&#x27;t believe I spent more money on other products that couldnt deliver and this one was under $100! This iron is totally worth every penny and more for all that it does!</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars BUT, it stopped working 5 months after I bought it.  I had also bought my sister the same iron from the same seller a month after i purchased mine and hers also stopped working  2 months after mine. Beware.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair that is naturally wavy and this product does a wonderful job straightening my hair and leaving it silky!</li>
            <li> Nonprofessional product.</li>
            <li> I bought this three months ago and it just stopped working. Before that, it worked very nicely. I still wouldnt buy a flat iron that only works for a few months.</li>
            <li> The box was empty when I received my flat iron - all excited to use and imagine the surprise when I opened the box to the iron and it was empty - very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This straightener heats up in a matter of seconds and cuts your hair time in half........it heats to 450 almost immediately.....i highly recommend this to quickly get ready in the morning.  love it.</li>
            <li> Despite the supposedly excellent reviews, after 8 months, my straightener broke. I usually can not turn it on, and when I can, it stays on for only a couple seconds before turning off. I have had several chi straighteners, and one cortex one. They have all lasted at least two years before something happening...</li>
            <li> I love this straightner! I have thick wavy hair and have tried several brands, by far, the Croc has beat them all.  It has an easy grip, no tangle cord, and effortlessly straightens my hair!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this premium flatiron.  This was meant to be a backup flatiron for my two daughters.  We already own a Rusk brand iron that we had purchased over a year ago at our local salon.  The Croc Classic started out to be a wonderful product comparable to the Rusk and I didn&#x27;t even bother registering the warranty because who expects an expensive item such as this to stop working within a year never mind within 6 weeks!  I purchased this item on November 5, 2011 and by New Years it had stopped working.  So, I&#x27;m outside the return window to Amazon which is hardly their fault but the fault of the manufacturer for making such a poorly made product.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this - buy another brand.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this in order to do a keratin treatment to my hair. It does have the ability to go up to the 450 degrees necessary for that. Although I didn&#x27;t end up doing that (I was worried about damaging my hair, because frying it at 450 won&#x27;t ... right) I have used it almost every day since. It heats up incredibly quickly and lets you decide the temperature to which it goes. I would say within about two to three minutes it can get up to 450.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is wavy and very thick and at 430 I can get even a bump that was created by my wet hair being put into a ponytail straight in about ten seconds. It lets you easily turn the ends of your hair in or out depending on the look you&#x27;re going for and apparently you can curl your hair with it but I&#x27;ve never been able to. I love this flat iron and I would really recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade. There really haven&#x27;t been any negatives about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: December 2013- Still working just as well as when I bought it. Even after a few drops onto tile floor it&#x27;s perfect! I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife, and she says it&#x27;s the best one she&#x27;s ever had. So far so good. It&#x27;s been a month.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had this straightener for a year and already its not working. It seems the cord connecting to the hardware doesn&#x27;t keep a connection so it wont stay on. This was happening before but now it wont even turn on. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this product. I&#x27;m so disappointed because this had such rave reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, DO NOT buy from this seller! There is no warranty, and they will not replace the crappy product they sold you. It hasn&#x27;t even been a year! It is so ridiculous. I emailed the company and they said that over after this time period...usually there is a warranty for a year, which it hasn&#x27;t been. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for this product to stop heating up properly. The cord is where the problem started. I ended up trying to tape it a certain way so it would allow the device to stay on. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this December 2013 and it lasted less than a year! It worked really well straightening my hair but for something that expensive, it should last a few years. I messaged the sellers and go no response whatsoever. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Good quality and sturdy. This is my second one in 6 years. I use it almost every day. Don&#x27;t bend the cord tightly at the base when wrapping it and you won&#x27;t have a short in the cord you&#x27;ll have to pay for to fix. The titanium plates can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> i bought this product with the recommendation from my hairstylist. i love it! it heats up fast and shows you a digital read out of the temperature. it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like some other flatirons i have used. i LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the item for much cheaper than I could find in any store. It works much better than my Croc!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this hair straightener!! My hair stylist uses this iron and I&#x27;ve been putting off on buying it for a long time. Now, I don&#x27;t know why I ever waited! My parents actually bought it for my 24th birthday. I used it for the first time on my own last night and my hair turned out just as perfect as if I had just walked out of the salon! I have [just past] shoulder length hair, so when I used the straightener I curled it in a bit and it created so much volume. It wasn&#x27;t stick straight against my head at all! It doesn&#x27;t create fly-a-ways either. I will recommend this straightener to every girl [and some guys] I know!!&lt;br /&gt;**CAREFUL** it heats up EXTREMELY fast! Which is nothing to complain about...but the digital read tells you how hot its getting and how fast. And the automatic shut off is a plus when you&#x27;re in a hurry and forget to turn it off. It does get hotter than most straighteners I&#x27;ve used, so be careful not to set the heat too high. I use it on 380 [recommended by my stylist] and it&#x27;s perfect. The only thing I have to get used to is the weight. It&#x27;s not necessarily heavy, but it&#x27;s sort of oddly shaped with the finger grips. I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s supposed to be for &#x27;professional use only&#x27;. :)</li>
            <li> Wasnt as nice as my cheap flat irons. And it did not give me the shine and flatness I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST flat iron I have ever owned! It has reduced the amount of time it took me to straighten my hair in half! I knew I had to have one after seeing that my hair dresser used it. And the price I paid was a lot cheaper than the amount that they had to cough up! I highly reccommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works good and get hot fast its the best but only last 4months. I would get another one but to afraid it want last long.</li>
            <li> Great straightener, as if I had bought it from the store, but at half the price! Gets hot faaaaast and my hair feels softer. Love doing my hair everyday now</li>
            <li> I have used many flat irons. This is certainly not the most expensive iron that I&#x27;ve bought, but my hair stylist recommended it so I bought it. I really liked it...until it quit working 6 months after I bought it. The cord has a short in it. If I wiggle the cord, it comes on for a second, but turns off again. I&#x27;m going back to the GHD iron. More expensive, but the last one I had lasted for almost 3 years, and I used it almost every day. Basically, this thing was a piece of crap and I would never buy another one.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes it</li>
            <li> I had heard so many great things about this Croc. As a matter of fact, I had used one that belonged to someone else previously. This item lasted about two months, Very Disappointing!!!!!!! When I tried to contact the manufacturer since it was advertised with a two year warranty, they tell me that they will not warranty it since it was bought online and not at a salon. I then at a later date (within four months of purchase) decided to contact the seller of the item and they, of course, tell me that they cannot replace it after five months, which it had not even been five months at that point. This seller is pathetic, and I would not recommend anyone buy from them. I am as well contacting the Better Business Bureau to report them. Do we really think that they would have even replaced it at the two month point when it quit working??? I THINK NOT!!!! I am sure I would have gotten the same response. By the way, my true rating on this item and seller is a 0!</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron FOUR YEARS AGO. I have used it almost daily and it still works good as new! Friends of mine have used it and asked about it because they liked it so much! It is so worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product 18 month ago. I loved it!&lt;br /&gt;It started to lose heat after about 12 months, but still enough heat the do the job. However, Just yesterday, the plastic broke and one of the &amp;#34;arms&amp;#34; is hanging. It&#x27;s unusable. And now I need a new flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;6 months ago, I would have said I&#x27;d buy a Croc again in a heartbeat. Now I am on Amazon looking for a different brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It heats right up and just glides through the hair,but if you want to add a little curl to your hair..you just can&#x27;t. The ends of the flat iron are virtually untouchable I have burned myself on it. This is the only downfall I see for this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful flat iron. I have thick, dry hair(from coloring so often). I purchased many different flat irons in the past, none have done as good a job as this has. My hair is SO soft after I use it. It stays soft (and straight) with no fly a ways. Great Buy, will NOT disappoint.</li>
            <li> I got this flat iron not even a week after I ordered it, it was in great condition and it leaves my hair super smooth and very straight :) I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this iron to replace my Chi.  I have no problems with the Chi straighteners, but the Croc is absolutely better.  It retails for more than a Chi, so be sure to get it on sale, but you will be satisfied.  I&#x27;ve been using the Croc for about a month now, and I love it.  Unlike the Chi, it comes with instructions, which are definitely handy when it comes to temperature control for example.  I use mine at about 350, which is near the median, and it is gentler on my hair than some of the higher settings.  My hair is smoother than with any other straightener, and it holds up well under a reasonable amount of humidity without any product.  For my recent New Orleans trip, my hair did go a bit frizzy, but I&#x27;m sure that could be prevented with some sort of hairspray that I wasn&#x27;t willing to use (and I think we can agree that that is an extreme hair environment).  The Croc also gets the job done faster than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve used, and I like the digital display that lets you know exactly (probably) how hot it is.  On the downside: it is huge, and the handles are not exactly easy on the hands.  I&#x27;ve not been burned, but I definitely have a callous on my thumb from the unpadded grip (indeed there are ridges, which means that the iron won&#x27;t slip but it doesn&#x27;t do your hands any favors).  All in all, I would totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I must have one with a bad cord. it keeps going off every time the cord is moved. I need to return it for a new one.</li>
            <li> Wonderful flat iron! Heats up quickly with precise heat. Safe to use and received product quickly!! Love it!!!  :)</li>
            <li> Being a hairstylist I have used many flat irons over the years.  The croc is the best that I have used yet! I highly recommend this iron!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, leaves my hair so silky smooth, it is definitely the best straightening iron I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Would have paid way more if I purchased at the store. Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This is my favorite flat Iron! I had it for 2 years and then had to replace it from natural wear and tear so I ordered the exact same model. It heats up and cools down quickly, it does not snag or rip my hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about flat irons and went with this one. The temperature is great but please be mindful that the higher temps will burn your hair if used often and left on the hair too long. I can see where the higher temps would work good to quickly pass over the hair to straighten but I use mine to curl my hair and never go over the 400 degree temperature setting. It was a bit tricky for me to feel comfortable to use but the hand grips made it better. I was use to a slimmer model so it took a bit of time to adjust. The cord is extra long which is a plus. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far, I absolutely love this. I purchased it a few weeks ago, but have used it multiple times already. I am actually able to straighten my hair quickly, as it heats up very fast, and it also cools down quickly too. It has cut down on having to do my hair multiple times to straighten it. So far, a great purchase!</li>
            <li> My wife has this flat iron and absolutely loved it until it stopped heating and would only reach around 200 degrees. It was still within the manufacturer warranty, so we shipped it to the them (Turboion) with a $15 check to cover the return shipping AS DIRECTED BY THE MANUFACTURER. A few days later, the company called us and said the repair would cost $50 because they only deal with hair professionals and they would not honor purchases made on Amazon. After calling them back the following day and being told the same thing, we had them tear up the return check and just keep the flat iron as it would be a $75 total cost between shipping and repairs when all was said and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, we are extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser use the Croc and recommended this one, after he heard me complaining about mine. I told him that I didn&#x27;t want to spend over $100 and he said check Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;OMG under $100 and I love it, so easy, you can select your degrees, it heats up pretty quick... so no long wait. I have long somewhat wavy hair, almost to my middle, and I am done within 15 min. and the iron literally slides through my hair.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was kinda nervous to purchase this, but I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and it still works great. I use it almost every day, I&#x27;ve got shoulder length thick hair, and it takes no time to straighten it in the morning. It heats up super fast..happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My Hair Stylist utilizes the Croc Classic for her Salon. I liked the ease and style the Croc Classic produced and ordered one through Amazon. I have had Great Success by being able to Style my own hair and having the Style hold. It is the First Flat Iron that I have ever purchased that has maintained the straightness that I have tried for years to control, especially since I have Naturally Curly Hair.</li>
            <li> I had always used a chi flat iron, lasted me a few years actually, went online to find something just as good but maybe a little cheaper and found the Croc, it worked well, did a good job, lasted only 3 months. I was using it to straighten my hair and went to fix a few pieces and it was off and will not turn back on... obviously junk, tried everything I could think of to get it to turn on (using other outlets... etc). Don&#x27;t buy! Bought on Amazon and can&#x27;t used the manufactures warrantly because of that! Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Please please please read the other reviews!! I bought this like 13 months ago. I dont even use it daily! It really is a great straighter but it shorted out where the swivel cord is and the minute I turn it on, it s***s back off. And to even get it to turn on you have to mess w the cord. When I bought this, I looked at all the reviews and it said this happens but as usual I thought \\&quot;na, this wont happen to me\\&quot;! I mean if it was a junk one you buy at walmart, I could see but I paid 140 bucks for this and that is A LOT to only have it last a year! I called the company and forget it!! Yeah, if I send in my old one they will give me a \\&quot;discounted\\&quot; price on a new one for \\&quot;only\\&quot; 80.00 + s&amp;h. No thanks croc! I will spend my money elsewhere and be treated better and get a different straighner that wont short out in 13 months. Just bought the babyliss today. Hope I have better luck. And THEY jave a 4 yr warrenty! Go to the crock website if you dont believe me. They have a q&amp;a section DEVOTED to questions on their broke straighners!!! That should tell you something! Please beware folks. Dont waste your money on a company or product that isnt worth it.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this flat iron to straighten my hair; I loved the results. The Croc iron left my hair straight, soft, and shinny. Worth the expense.</li>
            <li> When I first received this flat iron I absolutely loved it. I would be done with my hair in less than 20 mins and that was not the case before this flat iron. The reason why it doe not receive 4 or 5 stars is because while I was using it, it just DIED. Literally half way done with my hair and it just completely shuts off on me and stopped working ever since. I paid about $100 and thought it was worth my money but then that happens out of the blue. Not buying this flat iron for that much ever again!!&lt;br /&gt;BY THE WAY this happened in less than a YEAR!</li>
            <li> it was what I expected!</li>
            <li> It took doing my natural chemical free hair from 1 hour to 30 min to straighten I love it!!! My beautician recommend this item as he uses it I&#x27;m like whoa I may never go back to him again!! Jk!&#x27; I will. Great item!!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  My hair is natural (which means I have no chemicals in my hair) and this flat iron gets my hair straight.  This is my second time ordering this flat and I have recommended it to others who have ordered it. I love it!</li>
            <li> The best flat iron that ever used to get very hot straight and see her with one swipe</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I have ever owned for thick curly hair. I would highly recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> I had this straight iron for about six months and the cord starting shorting out. I really liked the swivel feature, but I had to hold the cord a certain way to get it to stay on. So, I&#x27;ll never buy another one because it&#x27;s expensive to last six months. Everything now days only lasts a short time-no wonder people are broke.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this to anyone for that very reason.</li>
            <li> After having my hair flat-ironed in a salon with this iron, I knew I had to have one.  The plates glide smoothly over my hair, and leaves my hair shiny and flat.  I&#x27;ve recommended this iron to my family and friends, and even bought them as gifts.  Best iron ever.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron. Heats up quickly and works very well. I am glad I purchased this one.  it was recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> The only iron that will work on my daughter&#x27;s extremely thick, coarse and curly hair.  Extremely durable.  Highly recommend. Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was great quality! I really love it, and it has lasted me for almost 2 years and I haven&#x27;t had a single problem. :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product 4 yrs ago.  Yes it works real nice on the hair.  Within 1 yrs, it burned out.  I called the company and I had to pay money to have it fixed.  Now that I have been using it again for 2 yrs, it went again.  For a product that  is expensive, this should not have happened, it burning out that quickly and not once but twice.  I recommend NOT to purchase it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Heats up to the right temperature and remains constant through each use. It&#x27;s the same one my hair stylist uses</li>
            <li> Bought two as gifts and both failed to heat up after about a year. Worked well when they did.</li>
            <li> good hair iron for the price</li>
            <li> I LOVE the iron. It works much better than the CHI and HAI anf FHI ones that I owned before. Heat up very quick.&lt;br /&gt;One problem. The power cord connection broke less than a year. Because I bought it via Amazon, it&#x27;s not Croc&#x27;s authorized dealer, they do not accept it for warranty repair.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement because I dropped my last one..It works great.. love it! It works on my hair and my daughters who is biracial</li>
            <li> I use these flat irons everyday, they do awesome on my hair. Very smart decision choosing this brand, and m glad I did</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightening iron!!! I have owned at least 5 of them and keep buying them every time because they are the only ones that really do the job. Only downside is these Croc Nano ALWAYS break or just stop working within a year. I have owned at least 5 and all of them broke. So keep that in mind when buying these. They do come with a one year warranty which will not work if you buy them from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product did great until recently. I have not even had this product a year and the plate completely came off of one side and is starting to come off of the other.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have tried them all. You name it- Chi, T3, Remington, Conair, etc. Then I discovered Croc. I have had this straightener for over 5 years and it is still going strong. My other straighteners only lasted 2 years about on average and I was back at the store shelling out another $150. I keep waiting for it to not turn on one day but it proves me wrong every time. It makes my hair feel silky (and I have thick, frizzy straw hair) and in record time. If you are looking for a reliable, effective straightener that doesn&#x27;t break the bank, stop your search here. I hope you have the same success I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> Same product my stylist uses n was e half the price she quoted me. Works great with tension comb. I finally get my hair to look like she did it</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE SAME EXACT IRON AS THE ONE I BROUGHT\\&quot;TurboIon Croc Classic TITANIUM \\&quot;  THE OTHER IRON I BROUGHT AT LIKE 85.00..I DIDNT KNOW UNTIL AFTER THE FACT..THE NAMES CAN BE VERY CONFUSING..THIS IRON HAS CROC CLASSIC NANO THE OTHER SAYS TURBOION CROC CLASSIC..THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE OTHER THAN I PAID 10$ MORE FOR THE OTHER ONE OVER THIS ONE..FYI ..THIS IS A GREAT IRON..THERE ARE TWO LISTINGS THAT COME UP ON THIS SITE.KNOW THEY ARE ONE IN THE SAME. DONT PAY MORE FOR THE OTHER IRON LIKE I DID..IT&#x27;S THE SAME ONE</li>
            <li> It came in so fast and it works amazing! I have a hard time with straightened my hair because it&#x27;s soo curly but this straightener works so well and fast!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flatting iron!!! I have very curly hair and in no time it flattens it as if I was in the salon. This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t say enough how much I love it!!!!!! Delivery was very fast as well.&lt;br /&gt;With the heat adjustment I am able to straighten the front of my hair and not burn the ends by turning the temp way down.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t GIVE me a different one.  It so happens that my last one was a Croc and lasted 5+yrs, but I still thoroughly researched and found a few that seemed the best.  I&#x27;m SO glad I went with this one.  It&#x27;s especially comfortable to hold; ergonomic, unlike any other I&#x27;ve seen.  Heats fast, heats to the 400 degree&#x27;s, has auto turn off.</li>
            <li> Works amazing for my naturally curly, frizzy hair. But be careful because it will fry your hair if you use it every day!&lt;br /&gt;Use hair Heat-protection products while using this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this same (or very similar) model for almost 7 years. I had to order another one because it finally broke. I have dropped this more times than I can count and traveled thousands of miles with it shoved in a suitcase. I have near waist length thick, curly hair and after I use it I have straight shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. Love it. Highly recommend. Worth every penny! Wish I would have bought sooner. Best purchase</li>
            <li> I was very nervous to order this flat iron due to some of the reviews saying that theirs broke, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I have been nothing but pleased with the performance and overall high quality of this product.  I was exactly as the description said.  New , in the box, sealed. No complaints. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a high quality flat iron for a decent price.</li>
            <li> My first croc classic was great.  Lasted 3 yrs then the swivel cord wore out and shorted.&lt;br /&gt;Hands-down, the croc has better features than any others remotely in the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up super fast which is a real plus.&lt;br /&gt;Glides smoothe, temp settings switch is easy to see and get to but not easily bumped by accident.&lt;br /&gt;Wide choice of temp settings.&lt;br /&gt;Easy-grip handle - does a beautiful job.&lt;br /&gt;The first croc classic remembered my preferred heat setting which is 300 degrees for my naturally wavyfine hair.&lt;br /&gt;BEWARE - The new croc classic I got 3 weeks ago defaults to over 400 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give this a 5 if it weren&#x27;t for the new development of the superhot default temp setting --&lt;br /&gt;Which is over-the-top, energy-wasting, &amp; dangerously hot for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I miss the temperature memory.&lt;br /&gt;Still, when my first croc bit the dust, I researched for hours and didn&#x27;t like anything else on the market as much.</li>
            <li> Will only last about 6mths !!! The best flatiron I&#x27;ve ever had for my thick natural hair but for the cost I wish that they would fix the temperature malfunction</li>
            <li> Everything I could have asked for and more. Works perfectly on my damn near untameable hair, which stays straight for long time after.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I have ever used!!! I love it - it makes getting ready so easy and fast.</li>
            <li> This is a very good, hot and easy to use flat iron. I guess my expectations of it were higher, so I was not blown away after using it. Does good job straightening the hair, but it did not cut the ironing by a lot of time for me, when compared to my previous flat iron. That was the main criteria for me: to have a good iron which would take very little time to use. Croc&#x27;s timing was the same as other professional irons I have used.</li>
            <li> Actually bought another Croc on Amazon but this is the one that was sent to me. It worked great and was in same price range so I decided to keep it.  I loved the results of the flat iron but it does not travel well!  The plastic strain relief where the cord attaches to the iron is sensitive and while carrying it in my suitcase it broke which exposed where the wires connect.  One of them separated and so I found myself with a broken flat iron!!!  So I have purchased a cheaper flat iron for traveling and will probably by another Croc strickly for home use.</li>
            <li> I bought this b/c I used my mother&#x27;s a couple times and fell in love with it. It heats up insanely fast, has several heat options, and I have had minimal heat damage (none I&#x27;ve noticed) to my hair. My sister also used our mother&#x27;s and is going to purchase one of these. The best either of us has used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note though that I do NOT use this thing at the highest heat setting. I heat it to 290 and that is DEFINITELY hot enough to do the job. This Croc gets really hot and I wouldn&#x27;t ever use it on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this flat iron and I loved how it worked with my hair. You can dial the temperature you want that works best with your hair type and it works on your wet (damp) hair as well as dry hair.  So far, I have been very pleased with it. If you like to make your hair very straight this is an excellent flat iron. You can get some curl as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this iron because I am a hairstylist who is certified in the Brazilian Keratin Treatment system and needed an iron that reaches 450 degrees. I was pretty pleased with the iron when I first purchased it 5 months ago..THEN not 2 months into using it (and not even everyday) 3 things broke on the iron  simultaneously, forcing me to send it in for repair. Elephant Deals was wonderful in helping me, however they did sell me a faulty flat iron to begin with. I have had the replacement for 2 months and just YESTERDAY I was at my salon and went to use it only to find that not only had the same 3 things broken on it once again, but now the spring was broken so it wouldn&#x27;t even close. I have had it and will never purchase this iron from Elephant Deals or Anywhere ever again.</li>
            <li> Loved it, but it didn&#x27;t last very long :(</li>
            <li> Love the Croc. Makes getting ready a breeze.  I have one and my daughter has one too so now we won&#x27;t fight over it.</li>
            <li> By far, the best straightener I have ever used.  Just got mine after using my sister in-laws (hers is over a year old and works wonders)  tried my own today for the first time, and same results - Shiny, silky, smooth hair!.  Con - maybe gets my hair too straight lol &#x3D;)  I will be playing with the heat levels.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product to me, and I&#x27;m glad she did. Very easy to use with excellent results. The straightening plates glide smoothly, and I like being able to adjust temperature depending on which sections of hair I&#x27;m straightening.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned!  So easy and fast!</li>
            <li> GOOD!!!!!!!  it is very good. I hope people can use it. It can protect our hair. you can try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this!  My plan was to purchase a Keratin Complex but they&#x27;re so expensive.  I read a lot of reviews from several different straighteners.  I opted to give this one a try and I&#x27;m pleasantly pleased.  My hair is very easy to straighten but one of my girls hair is very thick and wavy.  It works great for us all.  Love it &amp; very satisfied!</li>
            <li> My stylist used this straightener on me and I knew I had to have one! Used to be long time CHI only buyer until the father died and sons took over company. They started making cheaper quality products and you could definitely tell. I have THICK, CURLY/WAVY hair and this works wonders for me!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair super smooth super quick! It only takes one pass to make it perfectly straight! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several years and it has done me proud. I only use it a couple times a week, but I love that I can adjust the heat setting so that it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair. I use this mainly to straighten my hair, but it will also curl my hair just as well (once I got the technique down). I also like that the plates easily glide down my hair and don&#x27;t snag. Worth the money, and I can attest to it&#x27;s long-life.</li>
            <li> The flat iron did a good job. It did straighten my hair leaving a nice shine. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of pressure to operate. It came in a nice black box.  I would have loved to have had a mat with it. The packaging was very good and I received the flat iron within a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I will never buy a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; flat-iron before. I got this one for a super deal on Amazon but after using it I would have paid full price. It heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t pull out tons of hair, and creates beautiful straight hair without the need for heat-protecting spray. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I just got this straightener today! It works so much better than my Chi......and the one I bought in the mall. It didn&#x27;t take nearly as long to straighten my hair, and it feels so silky! My hair is VERY curly and hard to control. I also didn&#x27;t have to keep going over and over it to get rid of frizz that my other straighteners didn&#x27;t get the first time. It also has an automatic shut off after 30 minutes, which is wonderful if you ever forget to turn it off. The cord is a pretty heavy duty one and it swivels when you turn the straightener. I have to say that I am very impressed so far with the Croc!</li>
            <li> This straightener is practically a miracle.  The chord is long without being a pain, the straightener heats up in practically no time, and it gets amazingly hot but doesn&#x27;t scorch my hair.  It leaves my hair smooth and evenly straight, and it has cut my hair straightening time down from 20-25 min to 10-12 min. I highly recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended I purchase this flat iron. In fact, the salon he works at sells this same model for more than double what I paid for it here on Amazon. It&#x27;s the exact same flat iron my hair stylist uses. Love the adjustable heat settings. Easy to use and comfortable to hold. My best flat iron yet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned CHI flat irons for as long as I can remember but after trying out my friend&#x27;s Croc, I knew my next flat iron would have to be a Croc! So after my last CHI self destructed, I ordered this flat iron and so far I absolutely love it. It straightens my hair so fast and my hair actually stays straight all day even though I live in a very humid climate.</li>
            <li> I love my new flat iron!! Came the day after I ordered it which I&#x27;m so thankful for!!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my GF and she loves it. Says it&#x27;s the best flat iron she&#x27;s ever owned. If she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only flat iron my wife will use.  I have purchased many other flat irons for my wife over the last 10 years but this one has proven to be the most reliable.  Yes, I have had to purchase a new one for her a couple of times and yes, they are quite pricey if you compare them to ones you can buy at Target or Walmart.  The fact of the matter is, they simply last longer and hold up better than the cheaper ones so they are will worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This iron is one of the best you can buy! I&#x27;m a professional cosmetologist and it&#x27;s the only flat iron that I will use!</li>
            <li> Love this straightener! It lasted me almost three years before the swivel cord shorted out. I&#x27;ll get another croc though.</li>
            <li> Is what was described and delivered quickly</li>
            <li> works good. Let&#x27;s hope it lasts longer than my Chi did</li>
            <li> Received on time and it is so high quality. Heats up in 10-15 seconds and is very hot. Just takes a second to straighten each section. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I GAVE THIS AS A GIFT TO MY MOTHER CAUSE SHE LOVED MINE. SO BE PRPARED TO GIVE AS A GIFT IF YOU LET ANYONE USE YOURS.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this straightener when I got my last haircut and I thought it was pretty good. I decided to buy it because a few days after my haircut, my straightener broke. I have really really thick long curly hair. I had never used a titanium straightener before so I decided to try it. It&#x27;s a GREAT price..for what it is. I love that it shortens the time to straighten my hair and it does come out thinner and really straight. I love that it warms up within seconds and shows you the temperature as it gets hotter, and i also love the automatic shut off. Im always running late so I tend to forget to shut it off! It is definitely a good buy if you simply just want to straighten your hair, i do not think its good for styling (aka curling with the straightener) just great if you want straight hair in a short amount of time!</li>
            <li> Amazing Price for salon results. Does not pull my hair like other flat irons. Overall, great deal and amazing results! Thank you!</li>
            <li> My croc is amazing.i love it work perfect and professional, My hair is beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Save time and products&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> Awesome they make natural so much more manageable!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this Croc Flat Iron for myself about 2 years ago and I love it, straightens my hair very nicely and i would most deftly recommend it, I would trade it for any other flat iron. I purchased this flat iron to give to my cousin which she loves mine and now she will love hers now.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY PLEASE WITH MY FLAT IRON, SO FAR IS THE BUY I HAVE DONE. IT IS NO HEAVY SO YOU CAN FLAT YOUR HAIR AND DON&#x27;T GET TIRED. MY HAIR GETS SO FLAT AND SOFT AND LOOKS HEALTHY. I JUST LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> i recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love it! Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever purchased,  even compared to a chi which is significantly more expensive.  Must purchase!</li>
            <li> I dropped my other one and broke it. I had to get another one because it works the best for my hair.</li>
            <li> great flat iron fast shipper</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my second daughter,  My first daughter has one and she loved it.</li>
            <li> this is my second one in about 8 years. Very satisfied,</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 of these crocs and they both quit working after 1 to 2 months. Sellers on Amazon do not tell you the warranty is no good with the manufacter if purchased thru Amazon, Ebay, etc.  Works very good but will quit working.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron out there especially if you have ethnic, curly and thick hair! Nothing else works like this. I just wish these lasted as long as they used to, this is my 4th one and they seem to last less and less. I have been using these since they came out and have tried others in between (expensive ones too) when these break and I just keep going back to his one. Enough said!</li>
            <li> love it , best iron yet</li>
            <li> It was great till it stopped working  after 4 mo!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hair straightener, its so awesome, it really really decreased the time that I actually spent on with my other straightner</li>
            <li> Love the shine!  My second flat iron just died.  I thought I would give the company a pass after writing them when my first iron went out within 7 months.  I got no response! All I wanted was to know where to get it fixed.  Now they are asking why should we help you when you are talking bad about our company????  Please!  How about $300  later I am more than annoyed sitting here at work looking like \\&quot;Wild thing\\&quot;. Just say send us the 2 irons that don&#x27;t work and we will send you another.  How about that customer service??</li>
            <li> Works great but only lasted 6 months, this product is too expensive for such a short life span.  It should have at least a one year warranty.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener a 3 years ago and loved it. It ended up going dead on me and I went and bought this one the with in 1. Month and a half it died on me. I Only used it 3 times with in a month and half. What a waste of my $75 dollars</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great price!!</li>
            <li> fast shipping and perfect flat iron. Easy to handle and use. Much better price than in the store. Thanks!</li>
            <li> After reading all reviews, I decided to purchase this straightener in April 2012. It worked great until last week, December 2012. I plugged it in and it wouldn&#x27;t come on. I contacted Amazon who referred me to the manufacturer, Croc. The manufacturer said my warranty was void because I purchased it through Amazon and because this is a professional use product, Amazon was not an authorized seller. Amazon then referred me to the seller, Quick-E who did not respond to either me nor Amazon. I called back Amazon a 3rd time, and at this point they told me since it was more than 6 months from the date of purchase, there was nothing they can do. They offered me $30 Amazon credit for the trouble. I am very upset. I paid $80 for a product that didn&#x27;t even last a year with no one wanting to take responsibility for the defect. I lost $50 in this deal plus about 2 hours of time on the phone and emails that I won&#x27;t get back. BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> this is the best flat iron i have purchased.  Hair is silky straight and looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this iron for individuals you have hard to tame hair</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron and cannot believe that I wasted my time with my former drugstore bought flat iron. It heats up quickly, the digital temperature display is very helpful. Temperature is easily adjustable. The plate surfaces are super smooth and glide on my hair. One pass is mostly all I need to flatten my wavy hair (from a previous perm). It saves a lot of time in the morning when I can just quickly press those wavy strands and have a polished look and out of the door in no time. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this iron by the recommendation of my daughter. We have been chi iron users for years but my husband dropped mine while we were on vacation and broke the plates, so I thought I would try this one, all I can say is it&#x27;s AWESOME!!! you do have to be careful cause it does heat up to 450 degrees &amp; I&#x27;m thinking that can&#x27;t be good for your hair so we just turn it down to a lower setting. I have very frizzy &amp; unmanageable hair &amp; this iron makes my hair really straight, love it!!! You won&#x27;t be dissappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through my fair share of straighteners and the Croc is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever purchased! I live in a very humid environment and after I use my Croc in the morning my hair stays frizz free all day, with NO anti-frizz product. It also adds a great natural shine to your hair. In my opinion, this is by far the best straightener out there.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. Gald to see i was able to purchase it new online for almost half the price too! Gets my hair pin straight. Love that the temp can be controlled and it is all electronic.</li>
            <li> I brought this flat iron for my wife over a 1 1/2 years ago. She is happy that it still works  because others posted that theirs stopped working. My wife uses it at every 6-7 weeks when she S-Curl (a texturizer) her African-American hair. The S-Curl of course makes her hair wavy, but she prefers her hair straight. Well, this flat iron hasn&#x27;t disappointed her yet, it does the job!</li>
            <li> My 16 year old grand daughter, tried her Aunt&#x27;s, when on vacation and loved this iron for her hair.  I checked into one for Christmas, and even though it was a bit expensive from my retirement income, it was so worth it for her, as she just loves it, and uses every day, so I am sure in the &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; run it is the best to pay a better price for the quality that you get for a product that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair. So why would I even consider a straightener? Finally something gives my hair the lift and body it needs! I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it is..... A CROC! Broke on me after 4 months! Don&#x27;t buy!!!!!</li>
            <li> did the research to get this for her.. it was a win</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> This has been the best flat iron purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.  I still have it and it heats well.  You can adjust the heat settings to what you are comfortable with.  Very durable.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> good flat iron.  also dual voltage which is a big benefit for those who travel.  easy to use and accurate temperature.</li>
            <li> This was the best flat iron I have ever had until it just stopped working within two months of owning it. The time frame to return has already expired.</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast. Digital heat temp makes it really easy to know how hot it is. IT DOESNT PULL YOUR HAIR. I dont know about everyone else but my old flat irons really pulled my hair even though they worked good. The only negative I would say so far (owned for a month) is the flat iron is a bit small and having curly hair you have to straighten small sections at a time.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with my order.  My croc flat iron arrived quickly and the price was amazing.  I will be ordering another one soon.</li>
            <li> I do not believe I received a \\&quot;real\\&quot; croc from this seller!! I had my other Croc for 7 years before I had any problem with it.  It was wonderful.  However this one stopped working within 5 months of purchase.  It stopped heating up. At first it took a long time to reach 400 degrees.  Then later it would say it was at 400 degrees but it did not seem that way when I was straightening my hair.  I was in need of a flat iron ASAP so I went to a store in my city and bought another Croc Classis Flat Iron. I loved it so much I had to give it another chance. After I took it out of the box I compared it with the one I purchased from Amazon and there were slight differences.  The noise that it made when I pushed the power button was differenct and the cord was different.  I know companies release new models on the market from time to time but I doubt there was a change in 5 months! I bought it from amazon cause it was half the price of the one in the store. I guess it is just another lesson in \\&quot;You get what you pay for!\\&quot;  I will not be purchasing any big ticket items off of amazon any more!</li>
            <li> The best out there. I could not live without this Iron. I would highly recommend to anyone that has curly or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ever purchase!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love it !!</li>
            <li> This product was a disappointment. After only using it couple of times, the flat iron stopped working. This makes me wonder if it was a refurbished item, since I owned another one of these in the past and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works great and quickly.  If you have to flat iron your hair, this is the one.  Wish it were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser only uses this flat iron and highly recommended that I purchase. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! Heats up salon style and cools down almost as fast.  Absolutley love it.  Best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Heat temp level button is in the worst location!</li>
            <li> Good price for a very good flat iron. You can adjust the temperature until 450 degrees!! Easy to use and very light. My hair was really shining after I used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the croc straighteners for a while now and this was actually the third one I have bought. My first one stopped heating up after a year or so, which I figured simply be the life expectancy so I ordered a new one. That one lasted me another year and it broke because a friend stepped on it. I normally buy these at distributer stores and this was the first one I bought from amazon. It broke within the first month of me using it. One day I go to turn it on and it gets hot and then shuts off. When I try to turn it on again it won&#x27;t get hot anymore. It&#x27;s ridiculous, I barely used it. I returned this product and think I will be looking into different brands of straightening irons.</li>
            <li> I was delighted with the way this iron worked....The only bad thing is that it fell once and it broke.. It can not take any type of mistreatment.. I have my daughters which is chi and that one has lasted for over 2 years.. the ceramics are waisted by now but it still does the job.. Good luck Dont drop iT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way if you buy from amazon you can forget about the warranty... FYI :) just looking out</li>
            <li> I love this product. It heats evenly and straightens my thick hair so much faster than a normal flat iron. A awesome product, will recommend to all.my friends and family.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron. So easy and quick flat ironing. I would highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I did not like this flat iron. Did not measure up to my  previouse flat iron, the Salon Tech and was not effective with my hair type.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at the beginning of December 2011. I loved the product until it stopped working a few days ago. It never was misused, I always kept it in the original box in a drawer in my bathroom. It seems to be having an electrical short with in the cord. It will turn on, but when I pick the product up to use it, once the cord moves it turns off.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended it and it has worked out well (after she told me what temp setting to use, it tends to default to hottest 410 degrees so sizzled my bangs first try!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I LOVED my Croc iron, until it died. The first time I thought it was a fluke. Second time, I&#x27;m not laughing. I will never buy another Croc again. I have very coarse and frizzy hair and flatironing is the only solution. I have been using a CHI that I found on clearance at Target and it is better than my Croc and it&#x27;s lasted longer. My hairstylist recommends GHD, so may get one of those, but no more Croc! I refuse to waste my money.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tool. I have relied on it to change my look every so often now for over a year. I love how it shows the temp, (350 is plenty) because it can get so hot that you produce a burnt smell. I am African-American and European so I have a blend of very tight curls. I&#x27;ve found that this product gets so hot and is so smooth that it flattens my curls quickly but I do have to go over twice to actually get a straight section. It LITERALLY flattens my curls. My previous flat iron had teeth and it helped pull my curls straight so when I do purchase my next flat iron, I will be going back to teeth. I have shown this straightener to a few of my friends with wavy hair and it can both straighten AND add a beautiful curl in minutes!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this flat iron.  I am very happy with the purchase.  I would purchase it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned! I actually have one and love it so much I bought this one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> This product deserves zero stars!! I bought this flat iron 9 months ago and it has completely stopped working. The company will not replace it because I bought it through Amazon and the return policy on Amazon is only a month. For the amount of money that I paid, this product should have lasted a lot longer. I will not be buying this brand again EVER!!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> Great flat iron.  Love that it turns off by itself. Hair doesn&#x27;t catch and pull.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I am giving this item 2 stars is because it is honestly THE BEST flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. HOWEVER, the lifespan of this product is short lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is VERY curly and fine. The croc irons made my hair feel like silk. Even my weaves! I used it on my friend&#x27;s little sister&#x27;s hair who has THICK CURLY hair (think Traci Ellis Ross kind of hair) and it worked like magic. They heat up quickly, like in an instant and have an auto shut off button which was ok for me. These things are like the hair god&#x27;s gift to women!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough with the good, now for the REAL! I owned the classic nano and within about 9 months, it stopped working. I live in SoCal so the manufacturing company is within driving distance. Because the item was still under warranty, Turboion replaced it for me free of charge (aside from the gas I used to drive an hour to get there). About 4 months later, the replacement stopped working! I then purchased the 1.5 inch infrared iron. LOVED this iron too. It also stopped working less than a year. Both irons would read an error sign and wouldn&#x27;t heat up anymore. I took the infrared iron in and they replaced it. The replacement stopped working as well! So, I took both the infrared and classic replacements in to be repaired last year in December. The infrared stopped working 5  months ago but luckily I still had my classic. As of yesterday, my classic iron stopped working -_______-. I called Turboion this morning and was told to either mail the products in or bring them in again for a technician to look at it. I told the rep that the SAME problems that were fixed in the past were happening AGAIN. She offered no other solutions and told me the tech would determine if I had to pay for the repair or not, depending on what the issue was. LAME!&lt;br /&gt;Although the flat irons are AMAZING, they do NOT last and I purchased them from beauty supply stores at FULL PRICE ($150 and $160). When you spend that kind of money, you expect to have them for a lifetime. The Chi and the ceramic iron sold at the mall kiosks last forever but not these guys! Although they&#x27;re great, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing the croc irons if you want something with longevity. Keep searching!them for a lifetime.

            <li> Great flat iron, recommended to me by the salon I go to</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Croc and I love it! My other one finally died out after 4 years.</li>
            <li> My Chi broke after use for 9-10 years. After looking around a bit this one was recommended by the person who does my hair. I love it. Works great. Leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and this is my 4th Croc that has died.  I love the iron and is actually my favorite but unfortunately not reliable.&lt;br /&gt;Moving on to the Bio Ionic &amp;#34;One Pass&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I used a friend&#x27;s Croc and like it.  I would recommend this product to other people that use straighteners.  The price was the best I had seen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a regular flat iron for the longest time and was considering replacing it for a chi... We had slept over at a friends house and she had her croc classic nano-titanium flat iron for over a year and loves it. She had me try it first to see if I would love as much as she does, and I was absolutely astonished with the results... it made my hair soft, shiny and straight.... and I still had the same results the following day despite the bad weather conditions (humid and rainy!) My friend recommended buying it on amazon. Love amazon and their prices for great products!</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and usually pay $100 for a Croc. I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is thorough this seller! The croc gets very hot (over 140 degrees) in under five seconds. It is either ceramic or titanium plated depending on which one you buy. I love the automatic shut off after 20 min so I don&#x27;t have to worry if I turned it of. Its a great product!</li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron that gets hot enough to straighten and make my frizzy hag hair and make it feel soft and look beautiful.  It also does not pull on hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used! I have extremely wavy, coarse hair that is almost impossible to not only get straight, but stay straight. It used to take me close to 40 minutes to do my hair (about 20 mins blow drying, 20 mins with the flat iron) and even then, it would often end up frizzy as soon as I went outside. I would wear my hair back/up about 80% of my life because the hassle just wasn&#x27;t worth it....enter the Croc, and boom! I am suddenly wearing my hair down every single day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I don&#x27;t even have to dry my hair all the way. I&#x27;d say about 10 mins with the blow dryer so it&#x27;s mostly dry is fine! Then it only takes me about another 10-15mins with the flat iron, and voila! Hair done in 20-25 mins and it STAYS straight. Even with moisture in the air! It&#x27;s literally a miracle worker for me and I&#x27;m obsessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s longevity as I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month, but I would buy one every year regardless. It&#x27;s magic!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and seems to leave my hair very smooth. heats and cools down quickly. Getting one for my daughter</li>
            <li> Well, I loved it up until it CAUGHT ON FIRE three months after I purchased it! Literally, here&#x27;s what happened: I have long, thick hair so I usually program my straightener to about 420. This morning I was in a hurry, so I bumped it up to 440 (it goes up to 450, so I figured it would be safe). About 5 minutes later I smell burning plastic and see smoke. I looked down to see the plastic around the plates melting!!! And the temp only showed around 375!! I seriously could&#x27;ve injured myself or lost my home! The only reason I&#x27;m giving this review 2 stars is because I&#x27;m sure the straightener is fine as long as you don&#x27;t take it over 430...</li>
            <li> Not Happy!!!! I am so disappointed, I received my Iron March 22 and today is July 27 and the Croc already stopped working! This is my last purchase with Amazon. This is my 3rd Croc thew Amazon ......i will NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Best straightener I have ever used! Doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy or fry my hair! Love! Love! Love!</li>
            <li> Has very high heat and good size.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just what I needed.  I can&#x27;t believe that the salon wanted 200.00 for the same iron.</li>
            <li> I have bought several Crocs over the years!&lt;br /&gt;The temperature gauge fluctuates, the plates&lt;br /&gt;stick and my hair is no longer shiney beautiful&lt;br /&gt;As it once was after using the Croc iron. I am&lt;br /&gt;searching for a new quality wet/dry iron.</li>
            <li> My wife knew what she wanted and the price was right. Very happy with product and price and delivery.</li>
            <li> High quality tool. Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> so far I like it.  have not used it much.</li>
            <li> While I absolutely LOVE the croc flat iron, I was not happy with this \\&quot;classic\\&quot; version after it stopped working after only 4 1/2 months.  Using it this morning, as normal...and all of a sudden it starts cooling down.  I look at the handle, as some times my hand will hit the on/off button and it is shut down.  As I went to turn it back on...nothing.  I plugged it into another outlet..nothing.  Very disappointing.  I&#x27;ve had both the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; and the \\&quot;turboion\\&quot; and the turboion (which looks identical) lasted for well over a year...even after being dropped several times and super glued back together!  I just ordered the turboion version again and I hope it goes the distance again!  All in all the flat iron is the best out there...as it incredibly straightens and smooths the hair to perfection!  It&#x27;s a shame if the warranty is not applicable on an Amazon purchase.  That needs to be changed!</li>
            <li> Worked great for 9 months, then it stopped working - won&#x27;t even turn on.  :(  I guess I should have read more reviews before I spent my money.</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for about a year &amp; half. It&#x27;s a great iron but it just stopped working. Going back to my old Chi that is over 5 years old! After reading the reviews I am not going to buy another Croc. I want something that I can get 3 years out of.... at least.</li>
            <li> I know there are some people claiming imposters, and I&#x27;m sure there are..but not from this seller!!! One pass of the Croc (completely factory sealed) through my hair and I new I was using a quality, professional flat iron. I&#x27;ve asked alot of friends and Croc is the one name that always came up...but even at &amp;#34;discount&amp;#34; online beauty sites they run anywhere from $160 and up...this is definitely a deal!!! My hair is healthy and shiny and it&#x27;s just AMAZING. I had been a Chi user..but this beats this by far!</li>
            <li> Loved the flat iron but not having a warranty sucked since these break so frequently. Other than that it came fast.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick saving you valuable time when in a rush. Contains eassy temperature selection buttons. Signals you when iron has reached its desired temperature. Straightens, flares, curls, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for over 2 years and it works great and it&#x27;s still in good condition. I love it.</li>
            <li> I got a CROC for my birthday and I must say it worked wonders.. for about a year!!! Then it suddenly heated up only to about 80 degrees and then started saying ERROR! I contacted customer service only to get a RUDE REPLY back! Their warranty only lasts a YEAR!! No wonder!!! I will NEVER buy another CROC product again! After posting on Instagram about how awful their product and customer service is I got feedback from tons of people with the same problem! Do not buy a CROC!!!</li>
            <li> My wife has very wavy hair with lots of volume.  She recently started doing brazilian blowouts and loves the straighter look, which holds pretty good, but tends to not stay as straight as it should after treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat irons are the trick, and after a trip to the salon, she has great results.....so we finaly had to look into a flat iron.  The hair stylist recommended a few brands, some of which, such as GHD, do not have good reviews on Amazon, as they are cheap knock offs.  That said, the reviews seemed pretty good for this brand, and it is a brand the hair stylist suggested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been one month and my wife loves the flat iron.  It does a quick job of things, which I did see first hand over the holidays in the guest room at some relatives house.  Because the mirror in the room did not allow her to see behind her, I assisted with the back portion.  I have to say, the flat iron is easy to use, and glides smoothly through her hair.  The digital setting allows the user to set a temp.  it heats up very quickly, which is digitially read out.  It does take a few minutes to cool down, by wife unplugs and does a few more touchups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did seem to take a few passes, but maybe the temp is too low, but my wife is also over-due for the blowout.  Will have to take the iron and see what he recommends for temp and use....i.e. were we going to fast, low temp, etc, etc.</li>
            <li> Great item. Fast delivery. Thanks much</li>
            <li> Probably the best flat iron I&#x27;ve tried so far.  I have very curly hair, this product flattens and smoothes, my hairdresser is jealous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad my iron broke after only 1 year I didn&#x27;t even use it that much it just stopped working all of a sudden the power cord is cheap and the iron turns on and off every time the cord moves which is ALL THE TIME!! I ugh so sad never buying this s*** again</li>
            <li> Awesome thanks!!!!!! A+++++++</li>
            <li> I like it, but I wish I had bought the &amp;#34;wet/dry&amp;#34; version</li>
            <li> I love croc. Best flat iron around. Built in shut off is awesome. This is not my first one. Clients are amazed what I  can do with it. Heats up so quick. My boss is all about another brand till he used mine. Now we are a croc salon.</li>
            <li> The plates get hot and works well.  However, the iron doesn&#x27;t light up where the infrared light is supposed to come out.  It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;am a hairdresser for 15 years and I tried so many Irons but Crock flat Iron rocks!!! The price is so worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this iron 3 months and it does not work well at all. I had the exact same one for 5 years and it broke so I ordered this one thinking it would be just as good. It&#x27;s not for some reason. The return window closed 3 days ago.</li>
            <li> It would be a great flat iron if it lasted longer..I had to buy two within six months. I just got fed up with it. They need to work out the kinks first before I ever buy another!</li>
            <li> This is a great iron, when it works. Mine stopped working immediately after I wrapped the cord around the unit. Now it won&#x27;t power on. Be careful.</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes her flat iron. She would recommend it to anyone who is looking to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> it is the best iron ive ever used. it gets hot in seconds and make my hair (very curly) look great.</li>
            <li> great item ! heats well, easy &amp; fast straightener 💇🏽</li>
            <li> It would have been great, but it only worked one time. The next day when I went to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t heat up. Something with it was faulty.  The Croc brand is no longer being made. I would go with a Keratin flat iron. Very close to the croc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional stylist and I&#x27;ve used this iron for the past 4 years.  I use it every day, both to style clients and for Brazilian Blowouts.  It has a great ergonomic design, it gets plenty hot, and it does the job in one pass, even on the most kinky curly hair.  This is my second Croc Classic I&#x27;ve purchased in those 4 years.  I dropped my first one from about 5 feet onto a hardwood floor.  Lol that one broke.  Other than that, I have had no problems with durability and I really can&#x27;t think of a negative thing to say about it.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me and I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;It straightens my hair-salon quality!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s excellent quality with a price you can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> Just ordered another one after 3 years of use from my first order.  Never gave me any problems...  Love it!</li>
            <li> Worked great for about a year, used usually 4 times a week at most. Very disappointing though to have something that cost this much break. Heck, I still have a Hot Tools that I had 20 years ago, still works, but no, it doesn&#x27;t work as good as the CROC DID, but it certainly works better than the CROC now, since the CROC stays on at most 5 seconds at a time. Very frustrating that this is made so good, but really it is made like crap. Don&#x27;t buy it, unless you feel like having to buy another straightener within a year. And a year...well that seems to be the BEST case scenario.</li>
            <li> LOVE! This straightener makes me hair feel silky and smooth every time! It can go up to 450 degrees, but 370-380 is perfect for my hair. I definitely recommend this one for anyone who uses their straightener on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for 5 years and have never had a problem with it. I have very long thick wavy hair, and it only takes me about 30 minutes to straighten. It heats up within seconds. It is very good quality, and I high recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have found nothing wrong with this item and I have had it over a year. So far, the absolute best flat iron I have ever had. Heats quickly, and results last longer.</li>
            <li> Love Croc Flat Irons! Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron UNTIL it stops working. My husband is an electrician, and he took it apart and the wires are coming loose from the iron, which explains why so many reviews complain that they just quit working. Poor quality. He could have fixed it, but after taking it apart, it was just too much trouble. I guess I am going back to the chi;(</li>
            <li> One of the best flat irons I have ever used.  Auto shut off after 30 mins of no use.  If you buy this at Ulta is almost 200 dollars.  This was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Plugged it in. Beeped. Thought it was ready to use. ERR on display. Shut off. Back in box. Too expensive for out-of-box failure.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser got me one from her distributer.  When it burned out, I decided to go with a less expensve one.  It is fabulous!  Even better than my last one and less money. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Best Flat Iron I&#x27;ve ever owned! This iron has adjustable heat settings, a super long cord and very easy to use. I love it because I don&#x27;t feel like I am doing damage to my hair when I use it. Unlike many other products, you don&#x27;t have to repeatedly go over and over your hair. It does the job with one pass! Good professional quality product, that I know I will enjoy for a long time.</li>
            <li> Salon quality tool in my home! I love this styling tool and highly recommend to achieve that salon style in your own home.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy both times that I purchased this item. Got here in two days exactly what I paid for. great service! LOVE MY FLAT IRON.</li>
            <li> Better than my previously owned Chi. Heats up super fast, straightens and smoothes my wavy hair with ease. It takes a lot less time to straighten my hair than it used to! LOVE this Croc! Would buy again in a heartbeat!!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd croc. Works great, no problems. Has temperature control. Lightweight and my hair looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron for over 2 years now. It&#x27;s made my hair look great - I love that it heats up to 450 degrees since I have such thick hair. The only problem is that it really damages my ends. I used to get a hair cut only every other time I would get a root touch-up, but now I have to get it every time since my split ends are so bad; it&#x27;s taking my hair forever to grow out because of all the damage. I think my next flat iron will have be ceramic :-\</li>
            <li> Very happy so far! Great price for a professional quality item. It&#x27;s the same one my hairdresser sells for over $250!</li>
            <li> Great product heats up very fast and keeps the temperature.  Wish the automatic turn off wasn&#x27;t so long.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron on the market. I&#x27;ve had mine for 7 years, though it finally conked out on me last night, hence why I&#x27;m on Amazon searching for another one. This iron had done amazing things to my hair throughout the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, smooth, thick, wavy hair that tends to frizz easily. This iron made straightening my hair a breeze. It usually takes a good hour to straighten my hair (I did say it was long and thick) and this iron cut it down to about 45 minutes, which, for those of us that are blessed with a lot of hair, know 15 minutes means a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item because it came highly recommended by my therapist, also known as my hairdresser. It&#x27;s the exact one she had used on my hair. The item is sleek and has a pretty ergonomic grip. It&#x27;s pretty solid, not like something you&#x27;d get from the Walgreens down the street. The temp gage is simple to navigate and it takes seconds to heat up. I would strongly recommend using a heat glove, considering your hair gets pretty hot (duh.. it&#x27;s an IRON) and someone like myself needs to run it through each chunk at least twice to get their hair just right. The power cord has a swivel on the end of the iron itself to prevent it from twisting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve mentioned, I&#x27;ve used this flat iron once a week for seven long years and it hasn&#x27;t failed me until yesterday, where it went to that big, curly hairball in the sky.... but not until it allowed me to complete straightening my entire head of hair completely one last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a professional, high-grade flat iron, this is definitely the one for you!</li>
            <li> This is the best straightening iron I have ever used. My hair is curly and it is always straight when I am done. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This was the best flatiron ever but it broke after only 8 months. When you spend this much you expect at least a year out of it! It turns off all by itself and you have to keep turning it back on. Not worth the money!!</li>
            <li> works- well- this is my second one in 2 years and I use prob every other day. The last one&#x27;s cord shorted out aftre 2 years, si I decided to try again</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  It really gets your hair straight and does it quickly.  I like that the plates are a little larger than the standard irons.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Croc through Amazon on July 15, 2012. I received it in good time. I used it almost daily for almost 2 months and it quit working. I recommend a different poduct entirely!</li>
            <li> Love it. Have thin hair in the front and thick in the back and like the fact that the temperature can be adjusted for both types.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this sporadically for a few months.  She really likes the way it functions, unfortunately this weekend it stopped working.  Clearly a bad internal connection.  We&#x27;ll see how they handle customer service - she&#x27;s going to attempt to invoke the warranty.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron in June 2012 for $77 after reading the excellent reviews and borrowing a Croc flat iron from a friend.  It&#x27;s been working great, but last week it got \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; at 280 degrees and will not heat up past 280 and you cannot change the temperature.  I contacted Croc customer service and was told that because I bought it for less than $125, this item is probably refurbished and/or fake.  She said they deal with this problem all the time and cannot honor the 1 year product guarantee because I bought it on Amazon.com.  My choices were either to send it to them for a free analysis and they would repair it for $15-60 or I can purchase a brand new one directly from them for $80 and it would have a 1 yr warranty.  She was very curt and talked down to me as though i was an idiot for buying it.  I will not be buying another one.</li>
            <li> I Love it , I had to buy another one. It heats up fast and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Croc straightener was recommended to me by my hairdresser.  I luv how smooth my hair gets from it.  Doesn&#x27;t need to be set very high so experimenting with temperature is a must.</li>
