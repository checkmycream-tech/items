    <ol>
            <li> Comparable to much more expensive cleansers. Great for oily skin without over drying it or causing breakouts.  I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> lathered up like soap. Broke my face out. All of the Avani line is not designed for sensitive skin. I had to send all of their products back. They all are overdrying and acne prone</li>
            <li> Very good. This is a product I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Love it nice product and simple to use</li>
            <li> Still using this. Works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and either they have changed their formula or this has been diluted with hand soap. It shouldn&#x27;t foam as this one did or have a hand soap taste. Threw it away after a couple of uses</li>
            <li> This gel is not supposed to leave a pile of foam in your sink and leave a bitter taste on your lips. I have gone through several bottles of this facial gel and can easily tell the difference. The cap was unscrewed almost half a turn so there was a large mess when it arrived. I am disgusted and will be sending this back.</li>
            <li> This product is really great. It gets the dirt out and it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  You need a moisturizer after which I like because I feel like I have a clean face and I put the good stuff back into my skin.  I have bought the toner, serum, moisturizer day and night and the peel.  Great line.  My husband used the peel when he had really bad dry skin and wanted to remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this so far. It&#x27;s a new product to me, but it has helped balance and soften my skin. So far two thumbs up!</li>

            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and this product really dries out my face. I have had to apply twice as much moisturizer and it has not helped. I stopped using it. I really do think it is because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really good after using this on my face.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin look wonderful.My skin looks the best ever and I am 68.I will always use it and tell my friends about it.</li>
            <li> , Hello i am Filipina  live in United states i love avani dead sea,the seller is so fast shipping ,and i thank them ,hope have more avani more discount , i don&#x27;t trust anymore ebay ,i was buying avani  deep cleansing but i wonder why it&#x27;s differ the smell and more bubbles,i think they change liquid ,actually it was bidding ,i won ,it cost 11 dollar plus free avani soap ...so bad it&#x27;s fake liquid avani not plastic i notice  its differs the smell ,bubbles ,not like before i purchase from amazon,smooth and effective ... more power</li>
            <li> hi all I bought this product couple of weeks ago and just now trying it out. I read the directions and they mention lather on your face etc. 1.I never got the lather at all . 2. smells like dish soap mixed with lotion or something  and 3. I used this mess on my face and it dried my skin out and my skin is normally oily so therefore I&#x27;m going to try give it one more try if not pleased i will be sending this back immediately</li>
            <li> I like all Avani products. They are exceptional.  The mud bar and this cleanser do an excellent job of cleaning my skin without drying it.  A little seems to go a long way so it is reasonable price wise.  I recommend trying it at least.  IF you do not like itm, don&#x27;t buy it again.  I find the Dead Sea Minerals to be very effective.</li>
            <li> I just bought this facial gel. Since I have not used it for long, I cannot comment in its long time effects.&lt;br /&gt;For now, I find it okay. It is a gentle cleanser, my sking feels clean afterwards but I cannot say it is a deep cleaning since it&#x27;s not a scrub. It cleans the surface of your skin but to say is a deep cleanser I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s correct.&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is good but the name is misleading.</li>
            <li> This is really the best facial scrub I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have the weirdest skin and this makes my skin feel real smooth and clean!  Try it for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;MIFF</li>
            <li> Works well and you feel very clean. The only thing is that it has very strong fregrance.  And I had read that any added fregrance is not good for your skin...</li>
