            <li> The shine you get with this oil is on believable!🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟  My hair has gotten thicker and longer. The instructions Say you to use the oil twice a week however, I&#x27;ve only use it once a week and I have seen results. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I can say about this oil is the smell is very strong! I would recommend using this product in the daytime because I used it at night and I had to cover my hair with several Hair Bonnets  and a plastic bag, The smell came through it all. I woke up to my pillow and pillowcase smelling like the oil.🌟&lt;br /&gt;If you can get past the smell, This is a great product to try. I almost forgot the oil is a dark green, You Don&#x27;t Need Much, the two Bottles are huge,Great Price, Amazing results! 👍</li>
            <li> horrible smell  to much work putting in and taking out time consuming  wish I could return unused bottles  also irritate scalp and skin</li>
            <li> I slept with this in my hair once will never do that again but I do leave it on for 2 to 3 hours somtimes more if i can. It works for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for years. Was introduced to it in Asia by   an Indian woman with perfectly beautiful black hair.  This oil was her secret. It will darken your hair,  so beware. But, it will condition, make it stronger and shiny, and prevent  hair loss.</li>
            <li> I just received this item today. It doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as I thought it would. People made it seem like it was strong like tea tree oil. It is kind of strange but it&#x27;s not unbearable. I am going to make video reveiws and tutorials on youtube if anyone needs visual help with this product or any product at all. Videos coming soon!     [..] Follow the channel for video updates</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a African American woman with kinky 4a/4b textured hair and this oil really makes my hair SUPER soft. Yes it does have mineral oil in it but that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me since I use it mostly as a pre-poo. Also, it really makes my hair feel stronger which is why I guess I have retained much more length then usual. I had a serious breakage problem and this oil and henna definitely helped combat that.</li>
            <li> This stuff is loaded with cheap oils ( canola and mineral oil). Won&#x27;t do a thing for your hair over time. I returned it to amazon. I should have known not to trust such a great deal!</li>
            <li> The best oil ever love it😀😀</li>
            <li> Smells like a urinal. Plus it has yellow no 5</li>
            <li> if you need your hair to grow get this product my girlfriend and my daughter is in love with itif your hair is not growing give this a shot you&#x27;ll be amazed</li>
            <li> excellent service,great prices and all deliveries on time.this is the best website to buy everything.congratulations..don&#x27;t exist another website better than this!!!</li>
            <li> Beside the funky smell, it&#x27;s great for my hair, helped it grow and relaxed.</li>
            <li> I found this product wonderful and I saved $$$ by not having to travel to India to purchase it. I will buy this product again and again and again.</li>
            <li> I am a regular buyer of this item. My grandmother and I love this product. It really adds shine and naturally darkens black hair so it looks glossy and beautiful! My grandmother loves the smell too. It has a strong smell, so if you are not into floral scents, you might not like this product. I completely love this product :)</li>
            <li> Its good but has a distinctive smell</li>
            <li> I did not use it because I use Aveda products and thought this would be too oily.  I was told that iit might turn my gray hair green.  You get 3 large bottles!!</li>
            <li> Havent used it long enough to know if it is doing anything !!</li>
            <li> This is a great .  I really loved the way my hair felt.</li>

            <li> The oil arrived timely as promised.  The amount is great but the smell is not as pleasant.</li>
            <li> Easy on the hair... Especially my hair which has thinned out from stress but after washing the not so greasy hair oil out my hair just flows... I bought a 3Pack and I will continue to use it... Very shiney and super soft... Easy to manage hair after using this product :} &lt;3</li>
