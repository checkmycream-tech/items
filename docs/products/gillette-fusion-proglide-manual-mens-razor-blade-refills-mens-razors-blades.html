            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve switched to using these blades because they&#x27;re so much better than the feminine equivalent!</li>

            <li>Best price fast delivery 5 stars</li>
            <li>my husband thanks they are the greatest</li>
            <li>Great blades, clean shaves.</li>
            <li>Combine 4 And another to trim- near perfectly , is Unbeatable.</li>
            <li>is the best by far...</li>
            <li>I love this way of buying these razors, its cheaper then stores &amp; nice to know I don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting to pick them up</li>
            <li>Fusion proglide is my favorite type.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the current models and the Fusion system, for me, is the best.</li>
            <li>Comes every month, I love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I purchased these with the fancy ProGlide razor, which I also have to say is so much better than any women&#x27;s razor I ever used.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My husbands favorite razor, so now we are on auto ship</li>
            <li>I can use these to shave daily or weekly and still get a great smooth result!</li>
            <li>thank you they fit my razer</li>
            <li>cheap knock off&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>May need a fresh razor more often.</li>
            <li>Not only is it cheaper but it is truly a great shave.</li>
            <li>this is the only way to go great close shave</li>
            <li>Fianc&amp;eacute; reports smooth shave with no nicks, cuts, or irritation.</li>
            <li>But a fresh razor is the most smooth, clean, comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever felt.</li>
            <li>clean shave</li>
            <li>I am having great success with DE shaving at fraction of the cost, and the shave is actually better once you get your technique down.</li>
            <li>These professionally glide across my face for sure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much money for only two good cartridges.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great shave, thanks</li>
            <li>While it is sometimes necessary to make more than one pass unlike the original, it also is</li>
            <li>Price was right, work like a charm.</li>
            <li>As far as manual blades go, I&#x27;ve used many different kinds, but there isn&#x27;t one better than Gillette.</li>
            <li>I am hoping to get a nice long use per blade.</li>
            <li>If they were about half the price, they would be a fair price for customers and would most likely skyrocket sales.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for in a razor</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found them to be any better than Mach 3 that are a lot cheaper and which I&#x27;ll go back to.  </li>
            <li>I am on my first blade and am in my fifth week.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the same price as what I was paying for women&#x27;s razorheads, but I&#x27;ve found that these are undoubtedly more reliable.</li>
            <li>They still feel better then a regular razor.</li>
            <li>Razors lose their edge quickly, which is acceptable only for disposable razors that are cheap.</li>
            <li>While I personally prefer my single blade safety razor, these are good for a quick close shave.</li>
            <li>very nice razor both my husband and my son use it, and I have never heard a complaint from either of them.</li>
            <li>I usually get a good 5 uses out of them before I have to toss the blade.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>That being said I am still considering switching to an electric, because I feel that they are charging too much for the blades.</li>
            <li>Very efficient</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to have the Razors delivered to your front door.</li>
            <li>He really likes these blades.</li>
            <li>I still get the same clean shaved as I always do every morning.</li>
            <li>I shave my head and find that I do not have near as much pull while doing it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t last as long as they should, and the shave isn&#x27;t all that much better than the razors that come from those razor club memberships.</li>
            <li>normally I just use disposable razors but when I got this one as a gift and tried it out</li>
            <li>This is an extreme close and smooth razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very surprised it did not come with the razor and the shave cream as advertised.</li>
            <li>used to use the regular Fusion razor and thought it was amazing though it still caused some small bumps on my neck.</li>
            <li>By far the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>No issues so far, I registered for the monthly subscription and they ship out on time.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive face, so I can&#x27;t use just any razor with out spending the rest of the day with rash</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but I haven&#x27;t found a cartridge blade that gives as good a shave as the Fusion ProGlide.</li>
            <li>Good product but way too expensive.</li>
            <li>Good product but  expensive, same product offered from the competition for a lower cost.</li>
            <li>Same as the older Gillette razor, just a different name</li>
            <li>Not outstanding or anything special.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 22 year old female model</li>
            <li>Blades not great but better than the shave club</li>

            <li> Not outstanding or anything special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old female model</li>
            <li> Blades not great but better than the shave club</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong with this razor is the price, and with the periodic coupons available here on amazon that problem can be eliminated as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The razor provides a close shave with minimal to no irritation, and the blades seem to last a lot longer than others.</li>
            <li> One blade was dried out and old</li>
            <li> does not last as long as expected</li>
            <li> They last me longer then any other blade I have used.</li>
            <li> face.&lt;br /&gt;There are other razors that work as well, but these last the longest.</li>
            <li> I always shave in the shower and dry them off with a towel after.</li>
            <li> Not sure for people that have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The only flaw is that the blades are so close together that your wiskers get clogged in them a little.</li>
            <li> Two of the four cartridges in the package were dull, one of them completely unusable.  </li>
            <li> I shave once a week, usually, and have moderate growth.</li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> one less thing to worry about...</li>
            <li> They are probably made in China for less than a $1</li>
            <li> I can get about a week and a half out of mach III&#x27;s, but</li>
            <li> Noticeably less razor bumps and a smoother shave all around.</li>
            <li> so you gotta swipe a little less and rinse.  </li>
            <li> I use them in combination with a blade resurfacer and get a few months life out of them.</li>
            <li> They are somewhat expensive, but if you only shave a couple of days each week, one blade will last at least a month.  </li>
            <li> Even when they get a little dull.</li>
            <li> That seems excessive.</li>

            <li> Gillette 5 Blades are the best!</li>
            <li> Combine 4 And another to trim- near perfectly , is Unbeatable. 5 bladed bliss.</li>
            <li> The thing is, I got an 8 pack, not the 4 pack. Other than that, great shave, thanks</li>
            <li> Great pricing and great service</li>
            <li> good usage and tracking. clean shave</li>
            <li> Great blades and great convenience</li>
            <li> close shave. exactly what I was looking for in a razor</li>
            <li> Very good razors. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> They last me longer then any other blade I have used.</li>
            <li> What a great price! Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found them to be any better than Mach 3 that are a lot cheaper and which I&#x27;ll go back to.  I find the Fusion razor itself to be just a gimmick and the combination of the two to be nothing superior.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend likes these razors and says they  are the best .  were delivered on time .</li>
            <li> without doubt this has been the best shave i have had in over 40 years using their gel and these blades are simply awesome!!!!!</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong with this razor is the price, and with the periodic coupons available here on amazon that problem can be eliminated as well.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use the regular Fusion razor and thought it was amazing though it still caused some small bumps on my neck. Then I tried the Fusion Proglide and won&#x27;t be going back. While it is sometimes necessary to make more than one pass unlike the original, it also is a *lot* smoother. By far the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Just wait for the coupons, combine that with subscribe &amp; save and you can get cartridges for around $2 a piece which last me about 3 months each for a total yearly cost of under $10.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female and have used gillettes mens razors for over 15 years. Won&#x27;t use anything else. Fusion proglide is my favorite type.</li>
            <li> thank you they fit my razer</li>
            <li> does not last as long as expected</li>
            <li> As well as advertised</li>
            <li> very nice razor both my husband and my son use it, and I have never heard a complaint from either of them.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades do a good job. Not outstanding or anything special.</li>
            <li> Price was right, work like a charm.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t bad razors, but for the quality they are extremely overpriced. Razors lose their edge quickly, which is acceptable only for disposable razors that are cheap.</li>
            <li> Good product but  expensive, same product offered from the competition for a lower cost.</li>
            <li> they are expensive but they give the finest shave when it comes to shaving gillette is the best by far...the rest whether a razor or electric can,t even come close</li>
            <li> No issues so far, I registered for the monthly subscription and they ship out on time. Blades are the same as to what I buy at the Store.</li>
            <li> Gillette blades are the best! I have tried all the current models and the Fusion system, for me, is the best. Its the smoothest on my skin and feels like the closest shave. The Proglide version feels a little smoother but nothing to dramatic. I can use these to shave daily or weekly and still get a great smooth result!</li>
            <li> While I personally prefer my single blade safety razor, these are good for a quick close shave. It&#x27;s as close to the feel of my safety razor as I ever felt when shaving with a cartridge. Just wish they didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> Best blades out there.</li>
            <li> cheap knock off&#x27;s... dont buy...</li>
            <li> This is an extreme close and smooth razor.&lt;br /&gt;It does take a couple of uses for your face to adjust to the&lt;br /&gt;Major change.</li>
            <li> Like I said. It&#x27;s expensive, but I haven&#x27;t found a cartridge blade that gives as good a shave as the Fusion ProGlide. I keep trying alternates to save money but I always come back to these.</li>
            <li> It is really nice not to have to run out to get razors, one less thing to worry about...yeah!</li>
            <li> Best blades on the market.</li>
            <li> All I use does good job close shave I recommend it.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades I gave ever used!! So smooth and does not irritate my skin!!!</li>
            <li> very good blade not a slice or nick yet</li>
            <li> I have switched to a DE safety razor because of the outrageous cost of these things.  I am having great success with DE shaving at fraction of the cost, and the shave is actually better once you get your technique down.</li>
            <li> Good product but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Better than shave club razors but still not perfect</li>
            <li> The blades are good, the price is good and I get to avoid buying blades in the store. Blades seem expensive no matter how you get em, but this is not as painful as shelling out cash at the store.</li>
            <li> The blades were quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> These are great blades. I use them in combination with a blade resurfacer and get a few months life out of them. I shave once a week, usually, and have moderate growth. As far as manual blades go, I&#x27;ve used many different kinds, but there isn&#x27;t one better than Gillette. And they&#x27;re made in the USA? Win.</li>
            <li> Overpriced!!! Very surprised it did not come with the razor and the shave cream as advertised.</li>
            <li> Best  razor blade ever use</li>
            <li> blades are good for a month</li>
            <li> The razor provides a close shave with minimal to no irritation, and the blades seem to last a lot longer than others. I am on my first blade and am in my fifth week. It still works well. That being said I am still considering switching to an electric, because I feel that they are charging too much for the blades. They are probably made in China for less than a $1 and they charge you almost $5 a blade. That seems excessive.</li>
            <li> Great cartridges, just a shame they are so expensive. If they were about half the price, they would be a fair price for customers and would most likely skyrocket sales.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years to shave my neck + beard. These are awesome. I usually get a good 5 uses out of them before I have to toss the blade.</li>
            <li> Good price for the best manual shaving system that have found.  I am a woman, great for ladies too. Each blade can last quite a while. Subscribe and save price is good.</li>
            <li> Great! Very efficient</li>
            <li> These professionally glide across my face for sure.  They also don&#x27;t cut the hell out of me, and I appreciate that.  They are somewhat expensive, but if you only shave a couple of days each week, one blade will last at least a month.  I will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> Comes every month, I love it</li>
            <li> Inconsistent blade quality.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I will buy it again for my friends and will look for the upgraded one.</li>
            <li> Great product but it is cheaper in the store&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> These razors are great. I have a sensitive face, so I can&#x27;t use just any razor with out spending the rest of the day with rash face.&lt;br /&gt;There are other razors that work as well, but these last the longest. I can get about a week and a half out of mach III&#x27;s, but these I can get a month out of. One of these packs can last almost a year</li>
            <li> Blades not great but better than the shave club</li>
            <li> Very Good Blades! I was using a 3 Blade system an I love these! I shave my head and find that I do not have near as much pull while doing it. I always shave in the shower and dry them off with a towel after. I am hoping to get a nice long use per blade.</li>
            <li> This razor is the Cadillac of razors. I&#x27;ve never gotten a closer shave. When they said, &amp;#34;The best a man can get&amp;#34; , I never believed it until now. Plus, it left no burn on my face whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Best price fast delivery 5 stars</li>
            <li> One blade was dried out and old</li>
            <li> Same as the older Gillette razor, just a different name</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old female model and I&#x27;ve switched to using these blades because they&#x27;re so much better than the feminine equivalent! They&#x27;re the same price as what I was paying for women&#x27;s razorheads, but I&#x27;ve found that these are undoubtedly more reliable. I purchased these with the fancy ProGlide razor, which I also have to say is so much better than any women&#x27;s razor I ever used. Noticeably less razor bumps and a smoother shave all around.</li>
            <li> Good value buy with coupon, but the quality of the blades has deteriorated over the years</li>
            <li> my husband thanks they are the greatest</li>
            <li> Two of the four cartridges in the package were dull, one of them completely unusable.  It&#x27;s too much money for only two good cartridges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient to have the Razors delivered to your front door. I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> A dollar or two cheaper would suffice, but you can&#x27;t beat the perfect shave these razors give.</li>
            <li> These razors are the bees knees. Even when they get a little dull. They still feel better then a regular razor. The only flaw is that the blades are so close together that your wiskers get clogged in them a little. so you gotta swipe a little less and rinse.  Other than that. Great product. I set myself up for a package every two month since they last me quite a while. Not sure for people that have sensitive skin.  May need a fresh razor more often. But a fresh razor is the most smooth, clean, comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever felt.</li>
            <li> Best blades available!  We tried the shave clubs, but they just don&#x27;t compare to the Gillette&#x27;s.  It is so convenient to have them auto delivered as well--no more running out of blades and forgetting to pick some up!</li>
            <li> Great blades, smooth shave. I shave my head twice a week with no irritation or razor burn.</li>
            <li> More expensive than Dollar Shave and DOESN&#x27;T COME WITH A SHAVING HANDLE SO YOU GOTTA BUY ANOTHER 4 PACK AT THE STORE WITH A HANDLE...Nonsense!</li>
            <li> It does the job as it suppose to. I still get the same clean shaved as I always do every morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... I must say I have started using Harry&#x27;s. Not only is it cheaper but it is truly a great shave.</li>
            <li> Best blades made my Gillette ever. I love it. There is no second option.</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite razor, so now we are on auto ship</li>
            <li> this is the only way to go great close shave</li>
            <li> I love this way of buying these razors, its cheaper then stores &amp; nice to know I don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting to pick them up</li>
            <li> Best shave blade on market. Saved a couple bucks by ordering on line. Still don&#x27;t understand why blades are so expensive</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last as long as they should, and the shave isn&#x27;t all that much better than the razors that come from those razor club memberships.</li>
            <li> Fianc&amp;eacute; reports smooth shave with no nicks, cuts, or irritation. He really likes these blades.</li>
            <li> Best shaves ever. Lasts two days.</li>
            <li> Very good blades. Luv em!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Gillette, they&#x27;re awesome. Just Still Too Damned Expensive</li>
            <li> normally I just use disposable razors but when I got this one as a gift and tried it out im hooked</li>
            <li> Great blades, clean shaves. Sometimes I wonder how I was using just the Mach 3. I wish they were cheaper though.</li>
            <li> Been awhile since I changed diapers,,but when I rinsed my face after my shave I was reminded</li>
