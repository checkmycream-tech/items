            <li>but it is amazing!</li>
            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>all, the ordering experience is pleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this lotion on my shelf for months and kept using my &#x27;fancier&#x27;, good smelling stuff.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not allergic this would be a good one.  </li>
            <li>I keep it by my bedside and apply each night before bed--ah, the relief of a good night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li>Excellent feel and keeps all of us feeling as smooth as silk.</li>

            <li>the best product available in the market.</li>
            <li>I had been given samples, so I knew it was a good product.  </li>
            <li>I began to search for a cheaper product and this one got good</li>
            <li>have had good results with the Cetaphil face wash</li>
            <li>Fragrance free is perfect for allergies.</li>
            <li>I best part is that this lotion is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Hypoalergenic, without scent, promots good hydrating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also non-comedogenic and has been helpful in controlling my acne by maintaining a good oil and moisture balance on my face as well as minimizing irritation.</li>
            <li>Good packaging.  </li>
            <li>Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for my skin, it keeps it moistured, non greasy and feels very light.</li>

            <li>She liked it as a good product.</li>
            <li>Consumer Reports ranked it best body lotion and they are right.  </li>
            <li>She use it to smooth her baby and think it&#x27;s quite good for that!</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE CETAPHIL!</li>
            <li>The accutane would be wreaking havoc on my face but because of my liberal application this stuff is keeping it looking amazing.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil moisturizing lotion, however, is simply AMAZING.</li>
            <li>kind of feeling....</li>
            <li>They found that it was twice as effective as the lowest ranking cream in their study.  </li>
            <li>NOTHING on the shelves has kept my skin in this kind of shape.</li>
            <li>Because of the size of the bottle, I have been using it in my whole body with excellent results.</li>
            <li>I have used a LOT of body lotions and this one is the best so far I love, love it!</li>
            <li>I liked the consistency of this cream and this one is not sticky like most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It is excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best body lotion i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The lotion is absolutely perfect for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it is perfect for sensitive skins.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, and worth buying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice 8 ounce bottle, plastic, that you squeeze to have the product delivered from a hole in the top, and a flip cap so you can&#x27;t lose it.  </li>
            <li>I have to say this has been so far the best choice i&#x27;ve made</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>I guess its better than some lotions of the market, but the best thing is that when I get outbreaks of contact dermatitis, I&#x27;m sure I can use this product without fear of damaging my skin, and it really gets better</li>
            <li>By far my favorite lotion,LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>Great for being hypoallegenic so good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty happy</li>
            <li>the fact this lotion is very light and works.  </li>
            <li>also have allergy problems and most scented products</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I guess you could say that I am sort of a &#x27;lotion junky&#x27; because I have so many.  </li>
            <li>I have some that I love the fragrance and some that I just thought were better for some reason.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product and the way that it was shipped was done in a manner to prevent any spillage of its contents.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t irritate our eczema prone skin</li>
            <li>this lotion is perfect for several reasons.</li>
            <li>what it DOES do is it makes my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li>It more like disappears into my skin.</li>
            <li>Most lotions give me a sinus headache (from the smell).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not greasy at all love</li>
            <li>Never found anything better.  </li>
            <li>My Kaiser dermatologist also has told me that there is nothing better for me.  </li>
            <li>I love all Cetaphil products.</li>
            <li>I love all Cetaphil products.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended CETAPHIL more than 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>(so great if you&#x27;re a dude or otherwise don&#x27;t want to smell like flowers or peaches), very hydrating, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling all oily after you apply.  </li>
            <li>but the cream is much better at moisturizing and also twice the price.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to see that November 2011 issue of Consumer Reports rated Cetaphil at the top of their rankings.</li>
            <li>Love its &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>many, many years ago.</li>
            <li>There have also been times when I have been able to soothe my eczema patches with this instead of applying my corticosteriod</li>
            <li>You are much better off buying Oil of Olay which absorbs way better.</li>
            <li>She has used this for many years.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My son is prone to excema and this lotion helps to control that better than anything else I&#x27;ve used on his skin.</li>
            <li>I especially enjoyed getting the pack of 2 for the one low rate.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>What more can one say about this product?</li>
            <li>I have eczema and this keeps my skin moisturized throughout the winter for the most part.</li>
            <li>Product works OK kept my skin moist</li>
            <li>This lotion is magic for my skin!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>not just do I love cetaphil for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love Cetaphil because it does not make me break out</li>
            <li>my skin looked better without lotion at that point</li>
            <li>then most drugstore remedies</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for moisturizing my whole body.</li>
            <li>I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li>I love all the products &amp; contiue to use them.</li>
            <li>It could just be my skin, I&#x27;m sure there are people out there who love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but there are much better alternatives.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, is quickly absorbed and is a good light-weight lotion</li>
            <li>The quality has stayed consistent and the packaging is good too.</li>
            <li>I use this product for a long timeï¼I&#x27;m feeling very good!</li>
            <li>This cream is excellent for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is the best product I have ever used to prevent flackiness and painfully dry skin.</li>
            <li>While I love vitamin E, it&#x27;s not always the most comfortable thing to have to wear.</li>
            <li>A very good quality product especially when you are living in an area where the humidity is lower than 20%.</li>
            <li>For All Skin Types really is great for all skin types including sensitive and eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li>It is excellent and works without ever needing to change in order to get the full potential.</li>
            <li>it is top notch, it works and it&#x27;s cheap,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice going on, not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a cheap grocery store lotion than a fine moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how great Cetaphil products are-I am just so glad they are</li>
            <li>Product combination, easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use on the skin</li>
            <li>very cheap, it&#x27;s worthy in buying them.</li>
            <li>I thought, my body is probably just not used to the hot and warm weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion feels very good and works well for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Now I only use the Cetaphil and it keeps his skin so perfect and soft, which I&#x27;m sure he appreciates if he were able to talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine under make up, it absorbs and softens, and that&#x27;s all I want from a lotion.  </li>
            <li>This moisturising lotion is very good for dry skin, also is light when applied.</li>
            <li>I have tried a large number of different moisturizing lotions over the years and found that Cetaphil works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We are huge fans of Cetaphil products in our house hold but this lotion doesn&#x27;t have me a huge fan.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that my skin feels silky smooth and my itching problems are vanished.</li>
            <li>But I tried it out of desperation (and convenience when my dermatologist handed me a free sample).    </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and silky, and your skin feels hydrated, supple and plump for hours.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great enough that we have been using this on our baby when the Aveeno ran out.</li>
            <li>I like that the lotion is fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t have mineral oil in it</li>
            <li>If you have eczema, this may be too light for you.</li>
            <li>I ordered the two pack of the fragrance free lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective and really absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li>Such a great lotion.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my face and it keeps it moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>Light but long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Feels really smooth going on and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel.  </li>
            <li>It does not feel oily or feel cheap.</li>
            <li>This is truly a fragrance free lotion.  </li>
            <li>skin is smooth</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is a great, basic moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy this lotion after I got a tattoo because I needed something fragrance free.</li>
            <li>My pores were visible and you could see that they were filled with gunk, even when I would do masks and steam my face to get all of the dirt out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>and I cannot tell you how good my 65 year old, &amp;#34;outdoor&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive but this one is really good.</li>
            <li>its really good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been acne free for years now and my skin is nice and moisturized thanks to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is better than the price in the store (but still not as good as the generic brand).  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 9 months old baby as suggested by the pediatrician and this is really good to be used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are many other good products available</li>
            <li>I apply it mostly to my face before using after shave, but it&#x27;s a great body lotion and quickly healed my dry elbows.</li>
            <li>For a while now I thought Olay Quench was the best, but I finally opened my Cetaphil yesterday and all I can say is WOW!!  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Lotion is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very pleasant to use as it does not have heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>this excited about trying the soap.</li>
            <li>The bottles are pretty big, and the price is good!</li>
            <li>The bottles are pretty big, and the price is good!</li>
            <li>This is a very good moisturizer and is especially good for those who want no sent,it has a slightly creamy small that is not bothersome at all.</li>
            <li>The Aquaanil is also better because it has hydrocortisone in it which is great for me because I apply acne medication that irritates my skin a little and makes it itch</li>
            <li>This stuff does a good job, it&#x27;s light, totally odorless, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t cause pimples</li>
            <li>This lotion is great for dry skin</li>
            <li>gets absorbed easily and keep the skin mosturized all the time.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena makes several lotions and moisturizers that are, for example, fully absorbed and very effective as moisturizers as well.  </li>
            <li>Been using this cream on my daughter for the last four year and will continue this is a good brand.</li>
            <li>I swear by this and Aveeno Babies for eczema, I actually prefer Aveeno but they both are good.</li>
            <li>I no longer need full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t too satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>I figured that if it was good enough for baby</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is not too heave and not too light, it has just the right consistency.</li>
            <li>i always use this product, it works great and its cheaper here than any other site!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy feeling either.</li>
            <li>Relieves mild eczema.</li>
            <li>I love most Cetaphil products but this moisturizer just left my skin waaaay too greasy.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It soaks into your skin quickly without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>It feels a bit greasy at first but dries lightly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have not found a lotion that provides me with the needed moisturizing without the additional fragrances found in many lotions in the marketplace.  </li>
            <li>A great product for the whole family from toddlers to elders in the dry winter time.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m thinking if I keep using this, I&#x27;ll rarely have pimples in the first place!</li>
            <li>The big brands, skin is very good, very moist, with the skin feeling smooth, no longer so dry, 2 to buy a good, next time again to buy</li>
            <li>It helps calm my itchy skin in the Winter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free, and so gentle.</li>
            <li>Since I have allergies and its fragrance free, it has worked very well</li>
            <li>It feels very greasy but despite that fact, it&#x27;s also extremely light.</li>
            <li>I used it on my very chapped hands and they were completely smooth in about 3 days.</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with the results</li>
            <li>My skin soo soft and lovely all day</li>
            <li>but totally worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I find the price is well worth the results its gives.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have severe acne, but I don&#x27;t have clear skin thats for sure</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another great feature of Cetaphil is that it goes on extremely smoothly and covers a large area with just a small amount of lotion.</li>
            <li>I decided to take a gamble and try this due to all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>It delivers the right amount of moisture to my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>and this here is the trick for dry skin I have noticed that since I use it daily it really moisturize me skin work perfectly after bath</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth trying as it still worked better than a lot of standard lotions and wasn&#x27;t oily/greasy.</li>
            <li>far my favorite lotion and highly recommended!</li>
            <li>But this is as good and cost less.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be easy, to be used frequently at any time</li>
            <li>Cetaphil bar soap and the moisturizing lotion have done some really great things for my skin, and though it is more expensive</li>
            <li>Great for mature very dry skin!</li>
            <li>it is fantastic for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I slather my baby in this right before I zip up the PJs and in the morning baby is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil has no scent - very important to me as I don&#x27;t like perfumes especially before going to bed as smells tend to keep me awake&lt;</li>
            <li>It absorbs very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a distracting smell.</li>
            <li>Our family has been using it  for both our faces and bodies for years with great success and our skin types vary (normal, dry, sensitive with allergies, eczema).</li>
            <li>Soft and mellow, without being sticky, odorless, amount many, inexpensive, highly recommend it&lt;</li>
            <li>it works but if you like a moisturizing that smells good ,don&#x27;t buy it because this one has no smell at all and sometimes that fragrance free is not cool!!!</li>
            <li>I will now be using this from now on as my first pick.  </li>
            <li>This lotion make my skin smooth and softly.</li>
            <li>thanks to this lotion!</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for many years and my skin looks terrific for my age.</li>
            <li>I got this from Costco first because I didn&#x27;t see it here</li>
            <li>I love this product I use it for my entire family.</li>
            <li>and I was sold after my first use.</li>
            <li>The current Amazon price is a bit better than the price quoted by Consumer Reports at 0.60 cents per</li>
            <li>had read in a couple of reviews that it was greasy and the first time I put it on, it was.</li>
            <li>I put too much on!</li>
            <li>makes it more oily than I thought possible.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil has been one of my mainstay products over the years, it was one of the first that didn&#x27;t use fragrance, and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>the morning I wash my face with the cetaphil cleanser for oily skin, put on acne free lotion for sensitive skin and add the cetaphil lotion after 10 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used many different lotions for my face over the years, the results have been hell.</li>
            <li>Thanks Cetaphil!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different moisturizers none of them performed as well as this product.  </li>
            <li>Also I recommend using the Clairsonic Mia, I know it is a pretty penny</li>
            <li>have tried numerous moisturizing products and find Cetaphil to be the most satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Good everyday lotion</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is a good value product to meet your everyday moisturizer needs.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it digs deep into the task of healing dry skin, brings immediate relief and the fragrance free keeps my wife&#x27;s sensitive nose happy too.</li>
            <li>This is a very moisturizing productsï¼it can effectively alleviate the dry skin conditions.</li>
            <li>When I need a refill I will most certainly return to Amazon.com in the future.</li>
            <li>the nice cucumber/vanilla/etc smell that the other lotions have but</li>
            <li>In the morning I use Clean and Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser followed by this then apply a skin clearing makeup.</li>
            <li>This lotion is incredibly gentle, and doesn&#x27;t sting like many others do when applied to especially chapped skin.</li>
            <li>Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer:</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is effective in treating my dry skin - both appearance and texture of my skin is better, I don&#x27;t get cracked skin on heals and other spots that crack if I don&#x27;t do anything&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good, I use this every day, is soft and I can use any other perfum I want.</li>
            <li>Not sure how this product got all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Many of the brands I used before left my hands and face in particular feeling</li>
            <li>Not much to say other than Cetaphil is a great moisturizing lotion that is easy on sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>because I figured something soap-free would be better for dry winter</li>
            <li>Then I moved to a city that is a lot more warmer and the air is very very dry.</li>
            <li>skin looks and how much money I have saved.  </li>
            <li>Even though using it on my body does keep it from drying out, I don&#x27;t really like the feel of the product on my skin.  </li>
            <li>so I am temporarily using Cetaphil for my whole body and it does lock in moisture.  </li>
            <li>But, like I said, I really prefer it for my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>, next time you are at your Dr.s&#x27; office, ask them for a free sample.</li>
            <li>Shipping also seemed to take a lot of time and upon arrival packaging seemed to be very unprofessional.</li>
            <li>I like this product but not as much as Aveno or Vanicream.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using both the Cetaphil daily face cleanser and lotion and the results are blemish free and moisturized</li>
            <li>I just bought the lotion to go with the cleanser, not expecting much of it.</li>
            <li>You can use it on the face as it is gentle.</li>
            <li>When you buy these in the store, I&#x27;ve seen them for as much as 16 dollars a piece.</li>
            <li>He is a very allergic kid and cant use any product...</li>
            <li>this one was medical recommended and fit the hole immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>so I really need some gentle moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Fast express.</li>
            <li>but this is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It is very soothing and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and renewed.</li>
            <li>I really, really did not want to spend almost $10 on a lotion</li>
            <li>This is gentle on baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing has cleared them up as fast as Cetaphil lotion.</li>
            <li>it really is the best&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li>It also spreads very well.</li>
            <li>And it really moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>(and I wanted to use as much of it as I could since I bought it).</li>
            <li>My whole family can use this (baby - Adult).&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>reasonably inexpensive and not so greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s white and reminds me of cheap sunblock with that sticky smelly goo feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This meets my needs very well.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT FOR DELICATE SKIN.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different though, that&#x27;s just my own personal experience with this lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion is really simple, but isn&#x27;t greasy, and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The lotion is really simple, but isn&#x27;t greasy, and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;ll run out pretty quick, especially if you use it for your body as well.</li>
            <li>I like it much more than Eucerin, Vaseline, Bath and Body Works, or other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This product is very good to your skin in cold and hot times.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more expensive than most drugstore lotions, but each bottle lasts me a few months, and Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I have to be sure to put in on his ears because they get especially dry, but the lotion seems to be working for him</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal, and it makes my skin feel clean, not sticky.  </li>
            <li>And the price Amazon offers for 2 bottles is good, I usually pay around $8-$11 for one bottle, depending on where I get it.</li>
            <li>Consumer Reports study used a special device that measured the the skin moisture in a temperature-controlled environment in a number of tests spanning multiple hours intervals (2 hours, 5 hours, 24 hours).  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and really helps especially during the winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but I should really buy more of my regular facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on of course your skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] is a winning team hands down!    </li>
            <li>It has a light lotion smell but it is very minor.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for more of a less abrasive route.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of this product it doesn&#x27;t smooth on well and doesn&#x27;t do anything to help with my dry skin</li>
            <li>I mainly use Cetaphil for my hands and feet and it works wonders, particularly on my feet.  </li>
            <li>(Of this particular product of theirs. )  </li>
            <li>The older I get</li>
            <li>I use it mainly at night before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily on my self and my baby girl who has some mild skin issues.</li>
            <li>Many years ago before starting a regimen of Accutane my dermatologist told me to pick up a bottle of this because I would need it due to the drying effect of the medicine, and he was right.</li>
            <li>I ended up making two orders because it took way too long to get a confirmation of my original order.  </li>
            <li>my last point now: it&#x27;s amazing (more really bothering and scary)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t any where near as oily as it was before, my skin looks clean and vibrant and my pores are almost completely invisible, and not a single new breakout.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the feel of the Cetaphil moisturizer isn&#x27;t all that great either.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin and need some gentle lotion to go with my acne medication.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t get watery eyes and sneeze every minute or so - no irritating chemicals, or none that irritate my terribly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin has returned to normal.</li>
            <li>I said earlier, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It helps your skin to be from dry skin to soft comfortable skin.</li>
            <li>I can even apply this right after an occasional exfoliation, and no irritation at all!</li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs fairly quickly and moisturizes well all day long.</li>
            <li>It always leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Me and my son don&#x27;t live without it...</li>
            <li>and I can live without that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to people with mild dry skin.</li>
            <li>After a years worth of dermatologist visits to rid my face of my acne completely, Cetaphil is the ONLY lotion I put on my face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the size and amount you get for such a small price.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin and this lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and even baby lotion can make my face burn.</li>
            <li>and my skin has been staying moisturized and clear ever since!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended lotion for sensitive skin or normal skin.</li>
            <li>WOW!...</li>
            <li>I had a Harvard graduate do facial resurfacing because of skin cancer tell me about it first.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my children since they were two months old and now use it myself!</li>
            <li>you can see exactly where it is pulling the gunk and extra oils out of your pores and your pores are minimized immediately!</li>
            <li>I lived in San Francisco the majority of my life, where it&#x27;s humid, the air is wet and windy, and the climate is cool.</li>
            <li>It was  suggested by a skin specialist to use for my dry skin, and I found it is really useful, relives from itching.</li>
            <li>It is very difficult to find a scent-free colorless facial cream and Cetaphil fills that niche perfectly!!</li>
            <li>But recently I decided to stop using it and bought the Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer</li>
            <li>The acne is more or less gone and my nose isn&#x27;t constantly peeling anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a decent job of softening up my skin with no fragrance, but there is a tiny bit of a funky undertone that smells like chemicals, but nothing I can&#x27;t live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find so much moisturizer for a low price.</li>
            <li>I had my sister recommend me this moisturizer because her friend used the Cetaphil Cleanser and Lotion to clear up her acne.</li>
            <li>If you want to really clear your pores out</li>
            <li>and I get compliments to how soft my skin is!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well, maybe I should say felt this soft and STAYED this soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft that I keep wanting to feel my legs, arms, etc.  </li>
            <li>No shine, no irritation, no redness, just simply soft skin like a child.  </li>
            <li>A friend suggests me to try this lotion for my sensitive face.</li>
            <li>I tried to treat myself with products from the natural &amp; organic lines, but found no relief.</li>
            <li>My skin is as sensitive as they come, and the Cetaphil moisturizer, paired with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>problem is I still have sensitive skin prone to breaking out even as an adult.</li>
            <li>I have have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It completely resolved her problem.  </li>
            <li>(i&#x27;m all about organic and 100% natural) but he assured me that those are all things that our skin needs.</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t care much for the way my face feels with this lotion.</li>
            <li>Totally non-sticky and very hydrating.</li>
            <li>skin is always hydrated and alive.</li>
            <li>I use it regularly and find it really helps my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin anyway, and I&#x27;m on Retin-A</li>
            <li>this lotion is gentle on my skin and does not leave it red and blotchy.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see what the big deal is.</li>
            <li>however I do not prefer to use it on him, he is 2 yrs old</li>
            <li>I use this after I cleanse my face and shower--both with [[ASIN:B005HO0AR2 Dove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Count]].</li>
            <li>I no longer have adult acne since using Dove&#x27;s Unscented and Sensitive skin bar soap with this Cetaphil lotion.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old has eczema and skin that is prone to rashes.  </li>
            <li>I used the combination of the 2 for about a month and it eliminated his eczema completely.  </li>
            <li>If you have allergies to fragrance and sensitive skin and eyes, this moisturizer is the go to product.</li>
            <li>but I really was looking for same product but captioned DailyAdvance Ultra Hydrating Lotion in the 16oz size</li>
            <li>But for everyday light hydration morning and night there&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li>For babys with dermatites, its essential!!&lt;br /&gt;After we starte using it, my children, 3 and 7 years old, could achieve na amelioration of 80% with the apearing of eczemas in their skin.</li>
            <li>baby has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>my skin is baby soft and looks so rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I use it on myself and my sensitive toddler.</li>
            <li>and so does my mom &amp; my 20-month old daughter.</li>
            <li>My skin is as sensitive as it comes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years, and I stray from time to time, naively thinking I have found something that works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li>so I could be sure about whether or not I liked it</li>
            <li>Once I started using it a few months ago starting back in August, I liked it.</li>
            <li>This meets all my criteria, as most lotion is too thick and feels like I have to wash my hands afterward, or too smelly.</li>
            <li>For me, fewer pimples mean fewer to no blemishes and more even skin anyway.</li>
            <li>Since I got pregnant I&#x27;ve even been using it as a facial moisturizer and does the trick, my face doesn&#x27;t dry out or seem greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Not to heavy clean feeling.</li>
            <li>only problem with this comes in the fact that I can feel it sitting on top of my skin, like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend for a daily body lotion.</li>
            <li>We searched high and low for a lotion that moisturized her skin well and did not cause her to break out in a rash.  </li>
            <li>It is really thick and rich for a face lotion, just about right for a body lotion (dry skin).</li>
            <li>The price for two large bottles is ONE THIRD of what I had been paying for a tiny jar of the Clinique brand</li>
            <li>how much money I&#x27;ve spent on skin care in the past just find out now that cetaphil does a much better job for only 8.99 at rite aid!</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel dry and did not  absorb into my skin very well</li>
            <li>Moisturizes dry skin and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil is now the only body lotion I use because it&#x27;s gentle, reliable, and prevents my skin from drying out, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>This lotion is gentle, but its moisturizing capabilities is only a little better than that of plain water.</li>
            <li>It really helped with my very dry skin&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and this lotion works very well.</li>
            <li>I have such sensitive skin, the dermatologist told me to use Cetaphil soap and lotion.  </li>
            <li>I bought this lotion for my 5 month old son; the pediatrician said he has eczema and recommended the cetaphil CREAM; I bought the lotion because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention when she told me what to get, but later looked at the note she wrote and noticed she had even underlined the word cream.</li>
            <li>I have allergic, sensitive skin and this one and the Cream are only skin emollients that don&#x27;t give me a rash.  </li>
            <li>My mother&#x27;s dermatologist recommended Cetaphil after she developed dermatitis on her leg after a total knee replacement.  </li>
            <li>I work in an office, not exactly rough work.</li>
            <li>but so far I can only find it in the tube,this product would rate 10 stars.</li>
            <li>I have noticed on my arms that it keeps my skin so soft and moisturized even until the shower the next morning, 24</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is the ONLY thing that works to keep my skin soft without clogging pores and causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>For the price, I would have expected it to keep my skin hydrated for a much longer period of time.</li>
            <li>While researching in search of a new product I came across a bit of information - constant application of facial moisturizers can cause acne because it clogs pores.</li>
            <li>We use it right after bath everyday.</li>
            <li>I live this lotion this was recommended by a doc bc I have dry skin</li>
            <li>, even with regular facial cleanser, this lotion *really* solves the dry skin problem.</li>
            <li>so figured I would give this product a try and only apply once or twice daily (morning/evening), seeing whether it would make a difference as far as my acne.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated all day, packaged with decent amount and is pump action so you won&#x27;t make a mess and from what I know</li>
            <li>Anyone with sensitive skin knows even if 100 other people with sensitive skin says it works...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my skin has felt this soft in a long time.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very dry State-Utah, and have been using these products for over 15 years.</li>
            <li>I got 2 bottles for the price of one half as large at the corner drug store.  </li>
            <li>I first noticed my infant son having these dry patches of skin all over his face and body and during a routine visit to his pediatrician, he said that he had eczema and just dry skin in general and recommended I get Cetaphil specifically for his dry skin and a OTC cortisone cream for the eczema.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Living in a dry climate I use it frequently during the day.  </li>
            <li>I used this everyday on my dry hands and it really moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> Nice product!</li>
            <li> all, the ordering experience is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this lotion on my shelf for months and kept using my &#x27;fancier&#x27;, good smelling stuff.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not allergic this would be a good one.  </li>
            <li> I keep it by my bedside and apply each night before bed--ah, the relief of a good night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li> Excellent feel and keeps all of us feeling as smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> it is good.</li>
            <li> the best product available in the market.</li>
            <li> I had been given samples, so I knew it was a good product.  </li>
            <li> I began to search for a cheaper product and this one got good</li>

            <li> Fragrance free is perfect for allergies.</li>
            <li> I best part is that this lotion is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Hypoalergenic, without scent, promots good hydrating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also non-comedogenic and has been helpful in controlling my acne by maintaining a good oil and moisture balance on my face as well as minimizing irritation.</li>
            <li> Good packaging.  </li>
            <li> Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for my skin, it keeps it moistured, non greasy and feels very light.</li>
            <li> This makes a great body moisturizer and it&#x27;s just okay for my face.  </li>
            <li> She liked it as a good product.</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports ranked it best body lotion and they are right.  </li>
            <li> She use it to smooth her baby and think it&#x27;s quite good for that!</li>
            <li> The best product with a very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Cannot recommend more!</li>

            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE CETAPHIL!</li>
            <li> The accutane would be wreaking havoc on my face but because of my liberal application this stuff is keeping it looking amazing.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil moisturizing lotion, however, is simply AMAZING.</li>
            <li> kind of feeling....</li>
            <li> They found that it was twice as effective as the lowest ranking cream in their study.  </li>
            <li> NOTHING on the shelves has kept my skin in this kind of shape.</li>
            <li> Because of the size of the bottle, I have been using it in my whole body with excellent results.</li>
            <li> I have used a LOT of body lotions and this one is the best so far I love, love it!</li>
            <li> I liked the consistency of this cream and this one is not sticky like most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It is excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best body lotion i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The lotion is absolutely perfect for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it is perfect for sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, and worth buying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice 8 ounce bottle, plastic, that you squeeze to have the product delivered from a hole in the top, and a flip cap so you can&#x27;t lose it.  </li>
            <li> I have to say this has been so far the best choice i&#x27;ve made</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> I guess its better than some lotions of the market, but the best thing is that when I get outbreaks of contact dermatitis, I&#x27;m sure I can use this product without fear of damaging my skin, and it really gets better</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lotion,LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Great for being hypoallegenic so good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty happy</li>
            <li> the fact this lotion is very light and works.  </li>
            <li> also have allergy problems and most scented products</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I guess you could say that I am sort of a &#x27;lotion junky&#x27; because I have so many.  </li>
            <li> I have some that I love the fragrance and some that I just thought were better for some reason.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and the way that it was shipped was done in a manner to prevent any spillage of its contents.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t irritate our eczema prone skin</li>
            <li> this lotion is perfect for several reasons.</li>
            <li> what it DOES do is it makes my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li> It more like disappears into my skin.</li>
            <li> Most lotions give me a sinus headache (from the smell).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not greasy at all love</li>
            <li> Never found anything better.  </li>
            <li> My Kaiser dermatologist also has told me that there is nothing better for me.  </li>
            <li> I love all Cetaphil products.</li>
            <li> I love all Cetaphil products.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended CETAPHIL more than 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> (so great if you&#x27;re a dude or otherwise don&#x27;t want to smell like flowers or peaches), very hydrating, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling all oily after you apply.  </li>
            <li> but the cream is much better at moisturizing and also twice the price.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to see that November 2011 issue of Consumer Reports rated Cetaphil at the top of their rankings.</li>
            <li> Love its &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> many, many years ago.</li>
            <li> There have also been times when I have been able to soothe my eczema patches with this instead of applying my corticosteriod</li>
            <li> You are much better off buying Oil of Olay which absorbs way better.</li>
            <li> She has used this for many years.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son is prone to excema and this lotion helps to control that better than anything else I&#x27;ve used on his skin.</li>
            <li> I especially enjoyed getting the pack of 2 for the one low rate.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> What more can one say about this product?</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this keeps my skin moisturized throughout the winter for the most part.</li>
            <li> Product works OK kept my skin moist</li>
            <li> This lotion is magic for my skin!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> not just do I love cetaphil for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love Cetaphil because it does not make me break out</li>
            <li> my skin looked better without lotion at that point</li>
            <li> then most drugstore remedies</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for moisturizing my whole body.</li>
            <li> I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> I love all the products &amp; contiue to use them.</li>
            <li> It could just be my skin, I&#x27;m sure there are people out there who love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but there are much better alternatives.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, is quickly absorbed and is a good light-weight lotion</li>
            <li> The quality has stayed consistent and the packaging is good too.</li>
            <li> I use this product for a long timeï¼I&#x27;m feeling very good!</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is the best product I have ever used to prevent flackiness and painfully dry skin.</li>
            <li> While I love vitamin E, it&#x27;s not always the most comfortable thing to have to wear.</li>
            <li> A very good quality product especially when you are living in an area where the humidity is lower than 20%.</li>
            <li> For All Skin Types really is great for all skin types including sensitive and eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li> It is excellent and works without ever needing to change in order to get the full potential.</li>
            <li> it is top notch, it works and it&#x27;s cheap,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice going on, not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a cheap grocery store lotion than a fine moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how great Cetaphil products are-I am just so glad they are</li>
            <li> Product combination, easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use on the skin</li>
            <li> very cheap, it&#x27;s worthy in buying them.</li>
            <li> I thought, my body is probably just not used to the hot and warm weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very good for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels very good and works well for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Now I only use the Cetaphil and it keeps his skin so perfect and soft, which I&#x27;m sure he appreciates if he were able to talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine under make up, it absorbs and softens, and that&#x27;s all I want from a lotion.  </li>
            <li> This moisturising lotion is very good for dry skin, also is light when applied.</li>
            <li> I have tried a large number of different moisturizing lotions over the years and found that Cetaphil works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We are huge fans of Cetaphil products in our house hold but this lotion doesn&#x27;t have me a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that my skin feels silky smooth and my itching problems are vanished.</li>
            <li> But I tried it out of desperation (and convenience when my dermatologist handed me a free sample).    </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and silky, and your skin feels hydrated, supple and plump for hours.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great enough that we have been using this on our baby when the Aveeno ran out.</li>
            <li> I like that the lotion is fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t have mineral oil in it</li>
            <li> If you have eczema, this may be too light for you.</li>
            <li> I ordered the two pack of the fragrance free lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective and really absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li> Such a great lotion.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my face and it keeps it moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> Light but long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Feels really smooth going on and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel oily or feel cheap.</li>
            <li> This is truly a fragrance free lotion.  </li>
            <li> skin is smooth</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is a great, basic moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy this lotion after I got a tattoo because I needed something fragrance free.</li>
            <li> My pores were visible and you could see that they were filled with gunk, even when I would do masks and steam my face to get all of the dirt out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> and I cannot tell you how good my 65 year old, &amp;#34;outdoor&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive but this one is really good.</li>
            <li> its really good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been acne free for years now and my skin is nice and moisturized thanks to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is better than the price in the store (but still not as good as the generic brand).  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 months old baby as suggested by the pediatrician and this is really good to be used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are many other good products available</li>
            <li> I apply it mostly to my face before using after shave, but it&#x27;s a great body lotion and quickly healed my dry elbows.</li>
            <li> For a while now I thought Olay Quench was the best, but I finally opened my Cetaphil yesterday and all I can say is WOW!!  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Lotion is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very pleasant to use as it does not have heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> this excited about trying the soap.</li>
            <li> The bottles are pretty big, and the price is good!</li>
            <li> The bottles are pretty big, and the price is good!</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer and is especially good for those who want no sent,it has a slightly creamy small that is not bothersome at all.</li>
            <li> The Aquaanil is also better because it has hydrocortisone in it which is great for me because I apply acne medication that irritates my skin a little and makes it itch</li>
            <li> This stuff does a good job, it&#x27;s light, totally odorless, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t cause pimples</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for dry skin</li>
            <li> gets absorbed easily and keep the skin mosturized all the time.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena makes several lotions and moisturizers that are, for example, fully absorbed and very effective as moisturizers as well.  </li>
            <li> Been using this cream on my daughter for the last four year and will continue this is a good brand.</li>
            <li> I swear by this and Aveeno Babies for eczema, I actually prefer Aveeno but they both are good.</li>
            <li> I no longer need full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t too satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> I figured that if it was good enough for baby</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is not too heave and not too light, it has just the right consistency.</li>
            <li> i always use this product, it works great and its cheaper here than any other site!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lotion absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy feeling either.</li>
            <li> Relieves mild eczema.</li>
            <li> I love most Cetaphil products but this moisturizer just left my skin waaaay too greasy.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It soaks into your skin quickly without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit greasy at first but dries lightly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have not found a lotion that provides me with the needed moisturizing without the additional fragrances found in many lotions in the marketplace.  </li>
            <li> A great product for the whole family from toddlers to elders in the dry winter time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m thinking if I keep using this, I&#x27;ll rarely have pimples in the first place!</li>
            <li> The big brands, skin is very good, very moist, with the skin feeling smooth, no longer so dry, 2 to buy a good, next time again to buy</li>
            <li> It helps calm my itchy skin in the Winter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free, and so gentle.</li>
            <li> Since I have allergies and its fragrance free, it has worked very well</li>
            <li> It feels very greasy but despite that fact, it&#x27;s also extremely light.</li>
            <li> I used it on my very chapped hands and they were completely smooth in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with the results</li>
            <li> My skin soo soft and lovely all day</li>
            <li> but totally worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I find the price is well worth the results its gives.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have severe acne, but I don&#x27;t have clear skin thats for sure</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another great feature of Cetaphil is that it goes on extremely smoothly and covers a large area with just a small amount of lotion.</li>
            <li> I decided to take a gamble and try this due to all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> It delivers the right amount of moisture to my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> and this here is the trick for dry skin I have noticed that since I use it daily it really moisturize me skin work perfectly after bath</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth trying as it still worked better than a lot of standard lotions and wasn&#x27;t oily/greasy.</li>
            <li> far my favorite lotion and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> But this is as good and cost less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be easy, to be used frequently at any time</li>
            <li> Cetaphil bar soap and the moisturizing lotion have done some really great things for my skin, and though it is more expensive</li>
            <li> Great for mature very dry skin!</li>
            <li> it is fantastic for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I slather my baby in this right before I zip up the PJs and in the morning baby is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil has no scent - very important to me as I don&#x27;t like perfumes especially before going to bed as smells tend to keep me awake&lt;</li>
            <li> It absorbs very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a distracting smell.</li>
            <li> Our family has been using it  for both our faces and bodies for years with great success and our skin types vary (normal, dry, sensitive with allergies, eczema).</li>
            <li> Soft and mellow, without being sticky, odorless, amount many, inexpensive, highly recommend it&lt;</li>
            <li> it works but if you like a moisturizing that smells good ,don&#x27;t buy it because this one has no smell at all and sometimes that fragrance free is not cool!!!</li>
            <li> I will now be using this from now on as my first pick.  </li>
            <li> This lotion make my skin smooth and softly.</li>
            <li> thanks to this lotion!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for many years and my skin looks terrific for my age.</li>
            <li> I got this from Costco first because I didn&#x27;t see it here</li>
            <li> I love this product I use it for my entire family.</li>
            <li> and I was sold after my first use.</li>
            <li> The current Amazon price is a bit better than the price quoted by Consumer Reports at 0.60 cents per</li>
            <li> had read in a couple of reviews that it was greasy and the first time I put it on, it was.</li>
            <li> I put too much on!</li>
            <li> makes it more oily than I thought possible.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil has been one of my mainstay products over the years, it was one of the first that didn&#x27;t use fragrance, and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> the morning I wash my face with the cetaphil cleanser for oily skin, put on acne free lotion for sensitive skin and add the cetaphil lotion after 10 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used many different lotions for my face over the years, the results have been hell.</li>
            <li> Thanks Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different moisturizers none of them performed as well as this product.  </li>
            <li> Also I recommend using the Clairsonic Mia, I know it is a pretty penny</li>
            <li> have tried numerous moisturizing products and find Cetaphil to be the most satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Good everyday lotion</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is a good value product to meet your everyday moisturizer needs.  </li>
            <li> It feels like it digs deep into the task of healing dry skin, brings immediate relief and the fragrance free keeps my wife&#x27;s sensitive nose happy too.</li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing productsï¼it can effectively alleviate the dry skin conditions.</li>
            <li> When I need a refill I will most certainly return to Amazon.com in the future.</li>
            <li> the nice cucumber/vanilla/etc smell that the other lotions have but</li>
            <li> In the morning I use Clean and Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser followed by this then apply a skin clearing makeup.</li>
            <li> This lotion is incredibly gentle, and doesn&#x27;t sting like many others do when applied to especially chapped skin.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer:</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is effective in treating my dry skin - both appearance and texture of my skin is better, I don&#x27;t get cracked skin on heals and other spots that crack if I don&#x27;t do anything&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good, I use this every day, is soft and I can use any other perfum I want.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this product got all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Many of the brands I used before left my hands and face in particular feeling</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than Cetaphil is a great moisturizing lotion that is easy on sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> because I figured something soap-free would be better for dry winter</li>
            <li> Then I moved to a city that is a lot more warmer and the air is very very dry.</li>
            <li> skin looks and how much money I have saved.  </li>
            <li> Even though using it on my body does keep it from drying out, I don&#x27;t really like the feel of the product on my skin.  </li>
            <li> so I am temporarily using Cetaphil for my whole body and it does lock in moisture.  </li>
            <li> But, like I said, I really prefer it for my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> , next time you are at your Dr.s&#x27; office, ask them for a free sample.</li>
            <li> Shipping also seemed to take a lot of time and upon arrival packaging seemed to be very unprofessional.</li>
            <li> I like this product but not as much as Aveno or Vanicream.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using both the Cetaphil daily face cleanser and lotion and the results are blemish free and moisturized</li>
            <li> I just bought the lotion to go with the cleanser, not expecting much of it.</li>
            <li> You can use it on the face as it is gentle.</li>
            <li> When you buy these in the store, I&#x27;ve seen them for as much as 16 dollars a piece.</li>
            <li> He is a very allergic kid and cant use any product...</li>
            <li> this one was medical recommended and fit the hole immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> so I really need some gentle moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Fast express.</li>
            <li> but this is much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It is very soothing and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and renewed.</li>
            <li> I really, really did not want to spend almost $10 on a lotion</li>
            <li> This is gentle on baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing has cleared them up as fast as Cetaphil lotion.</li>
            <li> it really is the best&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li> It also spreads very well.</li>
            <li> And it really moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> (and I wanted to use as much of it as I could since I bought it).</li>
            <li> My whole family can use this (baby - Adult).&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> reasonably inexpensive and not so greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white and reminds me of cheap sunblock with that sticky smelly goo feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This meets my needs very well.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT FOR DELICATE SKIN.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different though, that&#x27;s just my own personal experience with this lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion is really simple, but isn&#x27;t greasy, and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The lotion is really simple, but isn&#x27;t greasy, and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;ll run out pretty quick, especially if you use it for your body as well.</li>
            <li> I like it much more than Eucerin, Vaseline, Bath and Body Works, or other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product is very good to your skin in cold and hot times.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive than most drugstore lotions, but each bottle lasts me a few months, and Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I have to be sure to put in on his ears because they get especially dry, but the lotion seems to be working for him</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal, and it makes my skin feel clean, not sticky.  </li>
            <li> And the price Amazon offers for 2 bottles is good, I usually pay around $8-$11 for one bottle, depending on where I get it.</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports study used a special device that measured the the skin moisture in a temperature-controlled environment in a number of tests spanning multiple hours intervals (2 hours, 5 hours, 24 hours).  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and really helps especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but I should really buy more of my regular facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on of course your skin feels soft.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] is a winning team hands down!    </li>
            <li> It has a light lotion smell but it is very minor.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for more of a less abrasive route.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this product it doesn&#x27;t smooth on well and doesn&#x27;t do anything to help with my dry skin</li>
            <li> I mainly use Cetaphil for my hands and feet and it works wonders, particularly on my feet.  </li>
            <li> (Of this particular product of theirs. )  </li>
            <li> The older I get</li>
            <li> I use it mainly at night before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily on my self and my baby girl who has some mild skin issues.</li>
            <li> Many years ago before starting a regimen of Accutane my dermatologist told me to pick up a bottle of this because I would need it due to the drying effect of the medicine, and he was right.</li>
            <li> I ended up making two orders because it took way too long to get a confirmation of my original order.  </li>
            <li> my last point now: it&#x27;s amazing (more really bothering and scary)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t any where near as oily as it was before, my skin looks clean and vibrant and my pores are almost completely invisible, and not a single new breakout.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the feel of the Cetaphil moisturizer isn&#x27;t all that great either.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin and need some gentle lotion to go with my acne medication.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get watery eyes and sneeze every minute or so - no irritating chemicals, or none that irritate my terribly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin has returned to normal.</li>
            <li> I said earlier, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> It helps your skin to be from dry skin to soft comfortable skin.</li>
            <li> I can even apply this right after an occasional exfoliation, and no irritation at all!</li>
            <li> The lotion absorbs fairly quickly and moisturizes well all day long.</li>
            <li> It always leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Me and my son don&#x27;t live without it...</li>
            <li> and I can live without that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to people with mild dry skin.</li>
            <li> After a years worth of dermatologist visits to rid my face of my acne completely, Cetaphil is the ONLY lotion I put on my face.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with the size and amount you get for such a small price.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin and this lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and even baby lotion can make my face burn.</li>
            <li> and my skin has been staying moisturized and clear ever since!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended lotion for sensitive skin or normal skin.</li>
            <li> WOW!...</li>
            <li> I had a Harvard graduate do facial resurfacing because of skin cancer tell me about it first.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my children since they were two months old and now use it myself!</li>
            <li> you can see exactly where it is pulling the gunk and extra oils out of your pores and your pores are minimized immediately!</li>
            <li> I lived in San Francisco the majority of my life, where it&#x27;s humid, the air is wet and windy, and the climate is cool.</li>
            <li> It was  suggested by a skin specialist to use for my dry skin, and I found it is really useful, relives from itching.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find a scent-free colorless facial cream and Cetaphil fills that niche perfectly!!</li>
            <li> But recently I decided to stop using it and bought the Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer</li>
            <li> The acne is more or less gone and my nose isn&#x27;t constantly peeling anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a decent job of softening up my skin with no fragrance, but there is a tiny bit of a funky undertone that smells like chemicals, but nothing I can&#x27;t live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find so much moisturizer for a low price.</li>
            <li> I had my sister recommend me this moisturizer because her friend used the Cetaphil Cleanser and Lotion to clear up her acne.</li>
            <li> If you want to really clear your pores out</li>
            <li> and I get compliments to how soft my skin is!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well, maybe I should say felt this soft and STAYED this soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft that I keep wanting to feel my legs, arms, etc.  </li>
            <li> No shine, no irritation, no redness, just simply soft skin like a child.  </li>
            <li> A friend suggests me to try this lotion for my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I tried to treat myself with products from the natural &amp; organic lines, but found no relief.</li>
            <li> My skin is as sensitive as they come, and the Cetaphil moisturizer, paired with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> problem is I still have sensitive skin prone to breaking out even as an adult.</li>
            <li> I have have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It completely resolved her problem.  </li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m all about organic and 100% natural) but he assured me that those are all things that our skin needs.</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t care much for the way my face feels with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Totally non-sticky and very hydrating.</li>
            <li> skin is always hydrated and alive.</li>
            <li> I use it regularly and find it really helps my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin anyway, and I&#x27;m on Retin-A</li>
            <li> this lotion is gentle on my skin and does not leave it red and blotchy.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see what the big deal is.</li>
            <li> however I do not prefer to use it on him, he is 2 yrs old</li>
            <li> I use this after I cleanse my face and shower--both with [[ASIN:B005HO0AR2 Dove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Count]].</li>
            <li> I no longer have adult acne since using Dove&#x27;s Unscented and Sensitive skin bar soap with this Cetaphil lotion.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old has eczema and skin that is prone to rashes.  </li>
            <li> I used the combination of the 2 for about a month and it eliminated his eczema completely.  </li>
            <li> If you have allergies to fragrance and sensitive skin and eyes, this moisturizer is the go to product.</li>
            <li> but I really was looking for same product but captioned DailyAdvance Ultra Hydrating Lotion in the 16oz size</li>
            <li> But for everyday light hydration morning and night there&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> For babys with dermatites, its essential!!&lt;br /&gt;After we starte using it, my children, 3 and 7 years old, could achieve na amelioration of 80% with the apearing of eczemas in their skin.</li>
            <li> baby has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my skin is baby soft and looks so rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I use it on myself and my sensitive toddler.</li>
            <li> and so does my mom &amp; my 20-month old daughter.</li>
            <li> My skin is as sensitive as it comes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years, and I stray from time to time, naively thinking I have found something that works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> so I could be sure about whether or not I liked it</li>
            <li> Once I started using it a few months ago starting back in August, I liked it.</li>
            <li> This meets all my criteria, as most lotion is too thick and feels like I have to wash my hands afterward, or too smelly.</li>
            <li> For me, fewer pimples mean fewer to no blemishes and more even skin anyway.</li>
            <li> Since I got pregnant I&#x27;ve even been using it as a facial moisturizer and does the trick, my face doesn&#x27;t dry out or seem greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Not to heavy clean feeling.</li>
            <li> only problem with this comes in the fact that I can feel it sitting on top of my skin, like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend for a daily body lotion.</li>
            <li> We searched high and low for a lotion that moisturized her skin well and did not cause her to break out in a rash.  </li>
            <li> It is really thick and rich for a face lotion, just about right for a body lotion (dry skin).</li>
            <li> The price for two large bottles is ONE THIRD of what I had been paying for a tiny jar of the Clinique brand</li>
            <li> how much money I&#x27;ve spent on skin care in the past just find out now that cetaphil does a much better job for only 8.99 at rite aid!</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel dry and did not  absorb into my skin very well</li>
            <li> Moisturizes dry skin and dries fast.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil is now the only body lotion I use because it&#x27;s gentle, reliable, and prevents my skin from drying out, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> This lotion is gentle, but its moisturizing capabilities is only a little better than that of plain water.</li>
            <li> It really helped with my very dry skin&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this lotion works very well.</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin, the dermatologist told me to use Cetaphil soap and lotion.  </li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my 5 month old son; the pediatrician said he has eczema and recommended the cetaphil CREAM; I bought the lotion because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention when she told me what to get, but later looked at the note she wrote and noticed she had even underlined the word cream.</li>
            <li> I have allergic, sensitive skin and this one and the Cream are only skin emollients that don&#x27;t give me a rash.  </li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s dermatologist recommended Cetaphil after she developed dermatitis on her leg after a total knee replacement.  </li>
            <li> I work in an office, not exactly rough work.</li>
            <li> but so far I can only find it in the tube,this product would rate 10 stars.</li>
            <li> I have noticed on my arms that it keeps my skin so soft and moisturized even until the shower the next morning, 24</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is the ONLY thing that works to keep my skin soft without clogging pores and causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> For the price, I would have expected it to keep my skin hydrated for a much longer period of time.</li>
            <li> While researching in search of a new product I came across a bit of information - constant application of facial moisturizers can cause acne because it clogs pores.</li>
            <li> We use it right after bath everyday.</li>
            <li> I live this lotion this was recommended by a doc bc I have dry skin</li>
            <li> , even with regular facial cleanser, this lotion *really* solves the dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> so figured I would give this product a try and only apply once or twice daily (morning/evening), seeing whether it would make a difference as far as my acne.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> Stay hydrated all day, packaged with decent amount and is pump action so you won&#x27;t make a mess and from what I know</li>
            <li> Anyone with sensitive skin knows even if 100 other people with sensitive skin says it works...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin has felt this soft in a long time.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very dry State-Utah, and have been using these products for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> I got 2 bottles for the price of one half as large at the corner drug store.  </li>
            <li> I first noticed my infant son having these dry patches of skin all over his face and body and during a routine visit to his pediatrician, he said that he had eczema and just dry skin in general and recommended I get Cetaphil specifically for his dry skin and a OTC cortisone cream for the eczema.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Living in a dry climate I use it frequently during the day.  </li>
            <li> I used this everyday on my dry hands and it really moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> No stupid unnecessary additives or parabens, etc.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is it&#x27;s quite watery, you need quite a lot of this stuff to cover an area and moisture doesn&#x27;t last terribly long.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to any of my friends and family who have trouble with normal lotions.</li>
            <li> It is dry, extremely acne prone and  very sensitive.</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy, non-comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), fragrance-free, non-irritating and long lasting.</li>
            <li> First, it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrances which in my experience with other brands are heavily floral.</li>
            <li> that this extra heaviness is needed to cure dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> And its needless to say that with prime, they come very quickly.</li>
            <li> I need this lotion like I need feminine products and toilet tissue.</li>
            <li> and you just know it&#x27;s going to last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding anything that has long term positive effects on my skin.</li>
            <li> it seems my facial skin seems to get getting very dry after I</li>
            <li> Stays there for long time after application.</li>
            <li> Instead it just sits on top of my skin like Crisco oil and even worse, my oily skin added to the greasy slick.  </li>
            <li> My pediatrician told me to use Cetaphil on my 4 month old because of dry skin caused by Eczema, and after a few uses the patches went away.</li>
            <li> I went to my local supermarket and found it super expensive</li>
            <li> Please if you have eczema or other facial sensitivities, don&#x27;t hesitate to try this stuff out!    </li>
            <li> I use this on my entire body and it doesn&#x27;t smell and isn&#x27;t oily and is cheaper than that other brand junk that smells fruity and costs a million $.</li>
            <li> Lotion beats the heck out of Aveeno and Nivea and other commercial brands.</li>
            <li> But as with everything, products will work different on other peoples skin.</li>
            <li> Even a $60 bottle of department store brand moisturizer did not help my flaky dry skin.  </li>
            <li> About a couple years ago my skin started to feel extremely dry in parts throughout my body.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell, it&#x27;s not oily and it works well on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and I uses during the dry Winter months.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t always wear rubber gloves so my hands are dry.  </li>
            <li> I recommend for people who have dry skin to use this.</li>
            <li> For my body, I never have dry spots or ashiness.</li>
            <li> Been using it for my daughter&#x27;s dry skin as prescribed for years.  </li>
            <li> This winter I have been doing a dry exfoliation before showering, no body wash, just water, and then moisturizing with this</li>
            <li> and my skin was still dry and flaking off.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone of any age who has dry or itchy skin.</li>
            <li> have acne prone, oily and dry</li>
            <li> and I do not have to worry about getting too dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> and I would just leave it dry and flaking because I was convinced there was nothing that would help my skin.</li>
            <li> I guess, CA is too dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who gets a dry face after showers/shaving.</li>
            <li> It also relieves itching which often accompanies dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ultimately this means you&#x27;ll need to apply less of the lotion to your face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It last all day and the only time my face will break out is if I get lazy and don&#x27;t wash my face.</li>
            <li> Well, my nose is one of my very dry areas</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> I used it to moisturize other areas and noticed my skin does not stay moisturized for as long as it does when I use other lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t wear off or evaporate like some others that have to be reapplied a few hours later.  </li>
            <li> I started using it after seeing her results and have used it as a body moisturizer for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sort of heavy, sticky (extra glycerine maybe?)</li>
            <li> I am not really a lotion person but a friend introduced me to this product</li>
            <li> waste of ten bucks.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t need the heavy duty relief of Eucerin basic cream, I use this.  </li>
            <li> Maybe because it&#x27;s in such a plain bottle.  </li>
            <li> It works, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I just found that I was putting it on every half hour or so because my hands would start feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil leaves my skin feeling less dry and without a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I even use it on my face / a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any issues with rashes or breakouts due to this product and for me</li>
            <li> After years of bouncing around from one lotion to another - usually whatever was on sale - my wife and I recently switched to Cetaphil after our dermatologist recommended the change.</li>
            <li> This lotion is unscented and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; formula moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> I have always used this product and other Cetaphil products because they restore and enhance my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin that can rival an oil spill and using this on my face</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t have that substance that&#x27;s in almost every other lotion, the chemical (I think it&#x27;s a silicone) that allows the manufacturers to claim:  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years and years since I can no longer use a bar of soap on my skin due to my skin condition.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in dry dry Colorado and my skin is usually a nightmare (before this stuff).</li>
            <li> My skin is especially dry in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how excessive use of this product may effect people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband  because he has such a hard time with exema</li>
            <li> actually it never really absorbed at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moisturizers make me usually break out or don&#x27;t help me with my dry flaky skin at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use less than a pea sized amount for my face though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an expensive Clinique moisturizer for the last several years.</li>
            <li> But I wish its moisture would stay longer than a half day.</li>
            <li> But every morning I would wake up and my skin would be an oily mess.</li>
            <li> Unlike other lotions I have tried in the past, this one doesn&#x27;t smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily.</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s a little cheaper made.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my babies, and little kids, around the eyes,,, everywhere.</li>
            <li> it is Not good, i don&#x27;t use the face is blain blain discontinuation of a decisive away with long .</li>
            <li> But then I started noticing that my face started to get really oily and greasy, and my skin always felt dirty.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Cetaphil lotion for quite a few years now as it was prescribed by my Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t keep the moisture in longer than a few hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually I know though within a few hours if my skin doesn&#x27;t like something.</li>
            <li> I have a friend that told me about Cetaphil Lotion a few years ago and started using it then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy and helps moisturize in the winter and year round.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t destroy clothing from stains.</li>
            <li> not greasy, or too heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of perfumed lotions, and sometimes they give me rashes.  </li>
            <li> I would rather spend my hard earned money on other things since that is the fact.</li>
            <li> all other lotions are too thick.</li>
            <li> I asked my long time dermatologist for a recommendation for a moisturizer - tired of paying $50 for 2 ounces and never sure I was getting value for money.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry and irritating anymore.</li>
            <li> My skin had a glow that I didn&#x27;t have with expensive facial moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchased mine at Sam&#x27;s Warehouse because of the price.  </li>
            <li> In fact, once day is usually sufficient and then again at night if I remember.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not elegant, it&#x27;s gooey.  </li>
            <li> The delivery is speedy as usual.</li>
            <li> The winter has become very harsh to my Retin-A treated face.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil is one of very few brands my family</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this moisturizer along with the cleanser this winter after my face completely dried out due to the excessive cold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not amazing.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for you...</li>
            <li> What I mean is that I feel greasy when I put it on, but my face dries out before the end of my work day.</li>
            <li> When I say breakout, I mean I get a pimple or two.</li>
            <li> These are fake estrogens that penetrate your body and mess up your hormones.</li>
            <li> Why waste money on expensive creams that are not recommended by my dermatologists.  </li>
            <li> This is not a great lotion.</li>
            <li> It refuses to sink into my skin and also leaves a sticky film after it finally sets, which is highly annoying.</li>
            <li> And there is a slight unpleasant scent of rubber to it.</li>
            <li> My little sister even uses it for her eczema and it helps it to not itch as bad.</li>
            <li> Cold weather and forced air heating makes my skin look like alligator skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive for a lotion that always leaves a thick residue coat behind that does not absorb.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still too early for me to give this 5 stars, but if you don&#x27;t want to spend an outrageous amount of money buying a department store brand, try this.</li>
            <li> I usually shy away from products like Cetaphil and others, loaded with chemicals and what not.</li>
            <li> I suffered from terrible acne and simply put this lotion</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer Jergens lotion over this one, but it&#x27;s not the worst lotion I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Then they stopped making it and my search began to find a replacement which was very hard to do!!  </li>
            <li> Moreover, I find that this product protects well in cold weather and lasts all day without having to be replenished.</li>
            <li> I also have a problem with painful cracked skin if I don&#x27;t moisturize.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> So this gets 4 stars for getting the job done, but I still hate the texture.</li>
            <li> I have horrible skin.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great. Would recommend</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive skin, the dermatologist told me to use Cetaphil soap and lotion.  I live in a very dry State-Utah, and have been using these products for over 15 years. They are the best!!!! Does not dry out my skin and I get compliments to how soft my skin is!&lt;br /&gt;I also have allergy problems and most scented products bother my nose ( don&#x27;t need any more scent pollution!!!) and this product has never bothered my sinuses...I can&#x27;t say enough about how great Cetaphil products are-I am just so glad they are made!!!&lt;br /&gt;The pack of 2 is for 2 of the Moisturizing Lotions...Great deal!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use for face and all over my body-never break out or have any problems!</li>
            <li> I asked my long time dermatologist for a recommendation for a moisturizer - tired of paying $50 for 2 ounces and never sure I was getting value for money.  She said Cetaphil moisturizing lotion and cleansing lotion were the best.  That was a year ago and I cannot tell you how good my 65 year old, &amp;#34;outdoor&amp;#34; skin looks and how much money I have saved.  And I use it on my face, neck, legs and arms.  Love it.</li>
            <li> No kidding, this is the best moisturizer IÂ´ve ever used in my life. I liked the consistency of this cream and this one is not sticky like most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this lotion on my shelf for months and kept using my &#x27;fancier&#x27;, good smelling stuff.  I guess you could say that I am sort of a &#x27;lotion junky&#x27; because I have so many.  I even have some in a storage room because I don&#x27;t have enough room on my closet shelves for all of them.  I have some that I love the fragrance and some that I just thought were better for some reason.  I don&#x27;t know why because I hadn&#x27;t even opened my Cetaphil lotion yet.  Maybe because it&#x27;s in such a plain bottle.  But, as they say, \\&quot;don&#x27;t judge a book by it&#x27;s cover\\&quot;.  I now know this applies to my Cetaphil lotion.  For a while now I thought Olay Quench was the best, but I finally opened my Cetaphil yesterday and all I can say is WOW!!  I don&#x27;t think my skin has felt this soft in a long time.  Well, maybe I should say felt this soft and STAYED this soft.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t wear off or evaporate like some others that have to be reapplied a few hours later.  My skin feels so soft that I keep wanting to feel my legs, arms, etc.  I will now be using this from now on as my first pick.  Who knew?</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Cetaphil lotion for quite a few years now as it was prescribed by my Dermatologist.  I have very sensitive skin and have not found a lotion that provides me with the needed moisturizing without the additional fragrances found in many lotions in the marketplace.  The cost of getting it this way saved me money over that of what I would have paid in a retail drugstore chain.  I am pleased with the product and the way that it was shipped was done in a manner to prevent any spillage of its contents.  When I need a refill I will most certainly return to Amazon.com in the future.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find a scent-free colorless facial cream and Cetaphil fills that niche perfectly!!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for my 5 month old son; the pediatrician said he has eczema and recommended the cetaphil CREAM; I bought the lotion because I wasn&#x27;t paying attention when she told me what to get, but later looked at the note she wrote and noticed she had even underlined the word cream. This being said, I put the lotion on him every evening after his bath and he no longer has the rash or scaly skin- I have to be sure to put in on his ears because they get especially dry, but the lotion seems to be working for him and I will continue to use it until I see otherwise. Also, this is the best price I could find!</li>
            <li> Only lotion I ever use. I love it. Not to heavy clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I mainly use Cetaphil for my hands and feet and it works wonders, particularly on my feet.  Even though using it on my body does keep it from drying out, I don&#x27;t really like the feel of the product on my skin.  I think Avon&#x27;s Skin-so-Soft line leaves a smoother feel to the skin while keeping it from moisturized.  However, I&#x27;m between orders so I am temporarily using Cetaphil for my whole body and it does lock in moisture.  But, like I said, I really prefer it for my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> The winter has become very harsh to my Retin-A treated face.  Even a $60 bottle of department store brand moisturizer did not help my flaky dry skin.  Instead it just sits on top of my skin like Crisco oil and even worse, my oily skin added to the greasy slick.  My skin was literally peeling off.  Out of desperation, I used my body lotion Cetaphil and amazingly my skin soaked up this stuff!  No shine, no irritation, no redness, just simply soft skin like a child.  I woke up the next morning and saw that all the flakes were gone.  My skin had a glow that I didn&#x27;t have with expensive facial moisturizers.  Cetaphil.  Who knew?</li>
            <li> It has a light lotion smell but it is very minor. It is excellent for sensitive skin. It helps calm my itchy skin in the Winter.</li>
            <li> A friend suggests me to try this lotion for my sensitive face. It&#x27;s a real good suggestion. This lotion make my skin smooth and softly. It can also be used in everywhere of your body. I like it.</li>
            <li> it works but if you like a moisturizing that smells good ,don&#x27;t buy it because this one has no smell at all and sometimes that fragrance free is not cool!!!</li>
            <li> About a couple years ago my skin started to feel extremely dry in parts throughout my body. I went to an allergist but the allergist could not figure out what the problem was. It could have just been the weather change I was experiencing. I lived in San Francisco the majority of my life, where it&#x27;s humid, the air is wet and windy, and the climate is cool. Then I moved to a city that is a lot more warmer and the air is very very dry. I thought, my body is probably just not used to the hot and warm weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, my pediatrician actually recommended this brand of lotion before I could see a dermatologist (that would have been a pain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with the results and I can tell you that my skin feels silky smooth and my itching problems are vanished. I like Aveeno, Vaseline, and the like, but Cetaphil the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended lotion for sensitive skin or normal skin. Thank you Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> I have allergic, sensitive skin and this one and the Cream are only skin emollients that don&#x27;t give me a rash.  I prefer the Lotion because it&#x27;s easier to use.</li>
            <li> After applying the lotion my skin burned. Then after about a week of use my skin became red and inflamed. Went to the dermatologist and she thinks I&#x27;m allergic to one of the preservatives or something in it. If you&#x27;re not allergic this would be a good one.  But I quit using it have had no problems. I actually switched to a different moisturizer called Aquanil HC. My skin has returned to normal. The Aquaanil is also better because it has hydrocortisone in it which is great for me because I apply acne medication that irritates my skin a little and makes it itch but the Aquanil seems to take care of those side effects.</li>
            <li> This deal came with 2 larger bottle of lotion packaged together - they were properly sealed and packaged for no leaking. My pediatrician told me to use Cetaphil on my 4 month old because of dry skin caused by Eczema, and after a few uses the patches went away.</li>
            <li> Works great and for a real good price.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from eczema since my last pregnancy, and it hasn&#x27;t gone away. I tried to treat myself with products from the natural &amp; organic lines, but found no relief. I usually shy away from products like Cetaphil and others, loaded with chemicals and what not. But I tried it out of desperation (and convenience when my dermatologist handed me a free sample).    This moisturizer is awesome. It&#x27;s fragrance free, and so gentle. No matter how inflamed my face is, it never irritates or burns. I can even apply this right after an occasional exfoliation, and no irritation at all! It goes on smooth and silky, and your skin feels hydrated, supple and plump for hours.    My skin is as sensitive as they come, and the Cetaphil moisturizer, paired with the [[ASIN:B001ET76EY Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] is a winning team hands down!    Please if you have eczema or other facial sensitivities, don&#x27;t hesitate to try this stuff out!    Hint: The Cetaphil line of products is a fave among dermatologists, next time you are at your Dr.s&#x27; office, ask them for a free sample.</li>
            <li> This product is very good to your skin in cold and hot times.  I have recommended it to everyone that I know, and they always comment on the difference it makes. The best on the market for me....</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. No issues</li>
            <li> Unlike other lotions I have tried in the past, this one doesn&#x27;t smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily. It&#x27;s great for people with acne and oily skin. I personally recommend using their cleanser along with it.</li>
            <li> Prompt handling of my order.  I have been using this product for years.  It is still perfectly suited for my needs.</li>
            <li> I went through a stint of crazy-dry skin that caused me to itch to the point of leaving red marks on my legs where I tried to scratch away the itch.  Changing laundry soaps helped, but so did this product, giving me enough relief to sleep through the night.  I keep it by my bedside and apply each night before bed--ah, the relief of a good night&#x27;s rest.</li>
            <li> We are huge fans of Cetaphil products in our house hold but this lotion doesn&#x27;t have me a huge fan. (Of this particular product of theirs. )  I love that it doesn&#x27;t irritate our eczema prone skin but it doesn&#x27;t keep the moisture in longer than a few hours. It feels like it&#x27;s a little cheaper made. Those are my only two complaints.  It&#x27;s great enough that we have been using this on our baby when the Aveeno ran out.</li>
            <li> The older I get it seems my facial skin seems to get getting very dry after I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is I still have sensitive skin prone to breaking out even as an adult. I decided to take a gamble and try this due to all the good reviews. Anyone with sensitive skin knows even if 100 other people with sensitive skin says it works... it doesn&#x27;t mean it will work for you... everyone is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that it works for me. I been using it now for about 3+ weeks and I have not had a break out even with daily facial use. Keep in mind I use less than a pea sized amount for my face though. I am not sure how excessive use of this product may effect people with sensitive skin. I myself am still erring on the side of caution until my skin gets used to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I know though within a few hours if my skin doesn&#x27;t like something. Considering I been using it for weeks now with no problem, I think my skin likes this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps others with a similar situation.</li>
            <li> If u are looking for a cream/lotion DT truly moisturizes then Cetaphil is great.</li>
            <li> This moisturising lotion is very good for dry skin, also is light when applied. It was  suggested by a skin specialist to use for my dry skin, and I found it is really useful, relives from itching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using lotions for years and I can&#x27;t believe I never tried Cetaphil.  I have both the pump version and  the cream.  I use the pump version for everything besides the face while I use the cream for just the face.  It doesn&#x27;t smell, it&#x27;s not oily and it works well on dry skin.  If you haven&#x27;t purchased this lotion before do so now.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is one of very few brands my family and I uses during the dry Winter months.  It does not leave any film after rubbing the lotion on the skin.  Excellent feel and keeps all of us feeling as smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> Very good for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion since I was 14. I&#x27;ve always had pretty sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to dryness. I like that the lotion is fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t have mineral oil in it (it clogs pores) The lotion absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy feeling either. My skin soo soft and lovely all day thanks to this lotion! I&#x27;d recommend to anyone with any skin type.</li>
            <li> I ended up making two orders because it took way too long to get a confirmation of my original order.  Shipping also seemed to take a lot of time and upon arrival packaging seemed to be very unprofessional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to people with mild dry skin. If you have eczema, this may be too light for you. Great for being hypoallegenic so good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Is the best mostuirizing in the world... Me and my son don&#x27;t live without it... The best product with a very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have have sensitive skin and I find this to be a great all over body lotion. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with rashes or breakouts due to this product and for me that&#x27;s saying a lot. It&#x27;s very nice going on, not heavy at all. I highly recommend for a daily body lotion.</li>
            <li> I like this product but not as much as Aveno or Vanicream.  If you have allergies it&#x27;s worth trying as it still worked better than a lot of standard lotions and wasn&#x27;t oily/greasy.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than Cetaphil is a great moisturizing lotion that is easy on sensitive skin as well. I have used it for years and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> it is good. My skin is really sensitive but this one is really good. Also it almost doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li> After years of bouncing around from one lotion to another - usually whatever was on sale - my wife and I recently switched to Cetaphil after our dermatologist recommended the change. We&#x27;ve been using both the Cetaphil daily face cleanser and lotion and the results are blemish free and moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guy this lotion is perfect for several reasons. First, it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrances which in my experience with other brands are heavily floral. Second, the Cetaphil lotion doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. Many of the brands I used before left my hands and face in particular feeling like I&#x27;d just finished handling a vat of Crisco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature of Cetaphil is that it goes on extremely smoothly and covers a large area with just a small amount of lotion. Ultimately this means you&#x27;ll need to apply less of the lotion to your face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far my favorite lotion and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of perfumed lotions, and sometimes they give me rashes.  But this stuff is great!  It has no fragrance and moisturizes just enough.  I would definitely recommend this to any of my friends and family who have trouble with normal lotions.</li>
            <li> Been using this cream on my daughter for the last four year and will continue this is a good brand.</li>
            <li> I use it at night to get some moisture on my skin. Since I have allergies and its fragrance free, it has worked very well</li>
            <li> This product was the cheapest non-comedogenic lotion I could find on Amazon. It is really thick and rich for a face lotion, just about right for a body lotion (dry skin). It feels a bit greasy at first but dries lightly.</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s dermatologist recommended Cetaphil after she developed dermatitis on her leg after a total knee replacement.  It completely resolved her problem.  I started using it after seeing her results and have used it as a body moisturizer for the last few years.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best body lotion i&#x27;ve ever used. i have very sensitive skin and this lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist. i told him that i didn&#x27;t want to use it because i can&#x27;t pronounce any of the ingredients (i&#x27;m all about organic and 100% natural) but he assured me that those are all things that our skin needs. so i decided to give it a try. BEST decision i&#x27;ve ever made for my skin. this doesn&#x27;t give me a glow and it doesn&#x27;t have the nice cucumber/vanilla/etc smell that the other lotions have but what it DOES do is it makes my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li> I used Pacquins for years. (even had it shipped to me in Europe!!)  Then they stopped making it and my search began to find a replacement which was very hard to do!!  I found this several years into my search and now hope they don&#x27;t stop making this one.. It is NOT just like Pacquins hand cream but is definately the closest thing to it..</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is now the only body lotion I use because it&#x27;s gentle, reliable, and prevents my skin from drying out, especially in the winter. I like it much more than Eucerin, Vaseline, Bath and Body Works, or other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s a little more expensive than most drugstore lotions, but each bottle lasts me a few months, and Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It works for all weather conditions and it improves  color complexion and smoothness of skin. none of the products are compare to this awesome lotion</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t care much for the way my face feels with this lotion. I also don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have an SPF. I purchased this moisturizer along with the cleanser this winter after my face completely dried out due to the excessive cold. I just bought the lotion to go with the cleanser, not expecting much of it. The cleanser I wanted because I figured something soap-free would be better for dry winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, even with regular facial cleanser, this lotion *really* solves the dry skin problem. I was to the point of slathering my face with vitamin E every night after applying my night cream. While I love vitamin E, it&#x27;s not always the most comfortable thing to have to wear. Unfortunately, the feel of the Cetaphil moisturizer isn&#x27;t all that great either. It is the lotion to use when you NEED it to deal with skin issues, but not something I&#x27;d reach for otherwise. It&#x27;s a sort of heavy, sticky (extra glycerine maybe?) kind of feeling.... as if it doesn&#x27;t fully absorb into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The catch being, I guess, that this extra heaviness is needed to cure dry skin problems. Nothing else I used helped at all. So this gets 4 stars for getting the job done, but I still hate the texture.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband  because he has such a hard time with exema this seems to be working .</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding it. I usually purchased mine at Sam&#x27;s Warehouse because of the price.  They only seem to stock the cream version.  I was happy to find this at Amazon.  I have used this lotion for many years and my skin looks terrific for my age.</li>
            <li> I ordered the two pack of the fragrance free lotion. But I got a two pack of the facial cleanser Instead. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The lotion is absolutely perfect for my son&#x27;s sensitive skin. It absorbs quickly and really helps especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion cause I do a lot of cleaning and I don&#x27;t always wear rubber gloves so my hands are dry.  I use it mainly at night before I go to bed.  The lotion is very pleasant to use as it does not have heavy perfumes. It delivers the right amount of moisture to my skin.  I like it and have started using during the day.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer and is especially good for those who want no sent,it has a slightly creamy small that is not bothersome at all. its really good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for two months now, and it is AMAZING! I got this from Costco first because I didn&#x27;t see it here and I don&#x27;t know how the prices compare but I&#x27;m getting a prescription for this stuff WOW!...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in dry dry Colorado and my skin is usually a nightmare (before this stuff). I use a TON on my face and ZERO breakouts. This is like night and day. The accutane would be wreaking havoc on my face but because of my liberal application this stuff is keeping it looking amazing. Like Whoah. I use this on my entire body and it doesn&#x27;t smell and isn&#x27;t oily and is cheaper than that other brand junk that smells fruity and costs a million $. Cannot recommend more!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for several years. It was the one my doctor suggested we buy. I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective and really absorbs into your skin. It more like disappears into my skin. You can use it on the face as it is gentle. It&#x27;s good for sensitive skin. There is no greasy feel after use and it works well to remove eye make up too.</li>
            <li> We have been using Lubriderm lotion. But this is as good and cost less. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent for dry skin. It helps your skin to be from dry skin to soft comfortable skin. I recommend for people who have dry skin to use this.</li>
            <li> I have a friend that told me about Cetaphil Lotion a few years ago and started using it then. It really helped with my very dry skin&lt;br /&gt;and it is not greasy.I always used it three or four times a day especially bin the winter.</li>
            <li> When you buy these in the store, I&#x27;ve seen them for as much as 16 dollars a piece. getting 2 for about 20 dollars is an excellent reason to purchase these from amazon. And its needless to say that with prime, they come very quickly.</li>
            <li> The big brands, skin is very good, very moist, with the skin feeling smooth, no longer so dry, 2 to buy a good, next time again to buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been picky about lotions. This meets all my criteria, as most lotion is too thick and feels like I have to wash my hands afterward, or too smelly. This is perfect. Since I got pregnant I&#x27;ve even been using it as a facial moisturizer and does the trick, my face doesn&#x27;t dry out or seem greasy at all. My complexion is great with it.</li>
            <li> Totally non-sticky and very hydrating. The entire family loves it. Relieves mild eczema. We use it right after bath everyday.</li>
            <li> I like Cetaphil a lot myself, I&#x27;ve used it before. It feels like it digs deep into the task of healing dry skin, brings immediate relief and the fragrance free keeps my wife&#x27;s sensitive nose happy too.</li>
            <li> love this! the best product available in the market. You should definitely buy it! No fragrance and it is perfect for sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> My skin is especially dry in the winter months. Cetaphil is the best product I have ever used to prevent flackiness and painfully dry skin.</li>
            <li> We have been using this since our son was born. He is a very allergic kid and cant use any product... this one was medical recommended and fit the hole immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Its an awesome hydrating lotion for all ages. My father wich has dryied skin use that as well with awesome results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way to go! Buy it now!</li>
            <li> Most lotions give me a sinus headache (from the smell).  This one works great, and no headache!  Great price too.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels very good and works well for dry skin. My little sister even uses it for her eczema and it helps it to not itch as bad.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Cetaphil!!! I use it on my face and entire body. For my face, it never clogs my pores and I can use it with any cleansing product. For my body, I never have dry spots or ashiness. Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I suffered from terrible acne and simply put this lotion was the only thing my face could tolerate. After a years worth of dermatologist visits to rid my face of my acne completely, Cetaphil is the ONLY lotion I put on my face. I have been acne free for years now and my skin is nice and moisturized thanks to Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I live this lotion this was recommended by a doc bc I have dry skin and this here is the trick for dry skin I have noticed that since I use it daily it really moisturize me skin work perfectly after bath it&#x27;s not greasy at all love this excited about trying the soap.</li>
            <li> it is Not good, i don&#x27;t use the face is blain blain discontinuation of a decisive away with long .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, and I have gone to &amp;#34;parties&amp;#34; for facials etc.  Never found anything better.  Why waste money on expensive creams that are not recommended by my dermatologists.  I have actually had two tell me to use it.  I had a Harvard graduate do facial resurfacing because of skin cancer tell me about it first.  My Kaiser dermatologist also has told me that there is nothing better for me.  I would rather spend my hard earned money on other things since that is the fact.</li>
            <li> I love this product I use it for my entire family. skin is always hydrated and alive. Regards, nora posada</li>
            <li> I love all Cetaphil products. The lotion is really simple, but isn&#x27;t greasy, and dries pretty quickly. The bottles are pretty big, and the price is good!</li>
            <li> Been using it for my daughter&#x27;s dry skin as prescribed for years.  The quality has stayed consistent and the packaging is good too.</li>
            <li> I love all Cetaphil products. The lotion is really simple, but isn&#x27;t greasy, and dries pretty quickly. The bottles are pretty big, and the price is good!</li>
            <li> This winter I have been doing a dry exfoliation before showering, no body wash, just water, and then moisturizing with this and my skin is so soft! My daughter likes it for her face because it seems to help heal acne.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended CETAPHIL more than 20 years ago. I am a huge fan. I have used it on my babies, and little kids, around the eyes,,, everywhere. Never once have it given me a rash or an allergy. Excellent cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good, I use this every day, is soft and I can use any other perfum I want. Just great.</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there. I have been using it on my children since they were two months old and now use it myself! I also cured my daughter&#x27;s eczema with Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Such a great lotion.  Scentless (so great if you&#x27;re a dude or otherwise don&#x27;t want to smell like flowers or peaches), very hydrating, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling all oily after you apply.  No stupid unnecessary additives or parabens, etc.  I use it regularly and find it really helps my skin.  It&#x27;s not the cheapest lotion but totally worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have used a LOT of body lotions and this one is the best so far I love, love it!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT FOR DELICATE SKIN.</li>
            <li> The only lotion I use.  I wonder why its not in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin anyway, and I&#x27;m on Retin-A so I really need some gentle moisturizing. This stuff was recommended by my dermatologist and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> A very good quality product especially when you are living in an area where the humidity is lower than 20%. Stays there for long time after application.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I had been given samples, so I knew it was a good product.  Best was the cost.  I got 2 bottles for the price of one half as large at the corner drug store.  Yes, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Product combination, easy to use. Fast express.</li>
            <li> I am not really a lotion person but a friend introduced me to this product and I was sold after my first use. The lotion is not too heave and not too light, it has just the right consistency. Moreover, I find that this product protects well in cold weather and lasts all day without having to be replenished.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin and need some gentle lotion to go with my acne medication.  this lotion is gentle on my skin and does not leave it red and blotchy.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love most Cetaphil products but this moisturizer just left my skin waaaay too greasy. I have combination/oily skin and this product just felt like I slathered my face in lard.</li>
            <li> Soft and mellow, without being sticky, odorless, amount many, inexpensive, highly recommend it&lt;br /&gt;It can be easy, to be used frequently at any time</li>
            <li> Good everyday lotion but the cream is much better at moisturizing and also twice the price. Lotion beats the heck out of Aveeno and Nivea and other commercial brands. Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky oily feel either. Big bang for the bucks.</li>
            <li> Cold weather and forced air heating makes my skin look like alligator skin in the winter.  I also have a problem with painful cracked skin if I don&#x27;t moisturize.  I have tried a large number of different moisturizing lotions over the years and found that Cetaphil works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cetaphil is effective in treating my dry skin - both appearance and texture of my skin is better, I don&#x27;t get cracked skin on heals and other spots that crack if I don&#x27;t do anything&lt;br /&gt;2. Cetaphil has no scent - very important to me as I don&#x27;t like perfumes especially before going to bed as smells tend to keep me awake&lt;br /&gt;3. Pump works well and consistently&lt;br /&gt;4. My skin does not feel greasy after the cream is applied&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to see that November 2011 issue of Consumer Reports rated Cetaphil at the top of their rankings. They found that it was twice as effective as the lowest ranking cream in their study.  Consumer Reports study used a special device that measured the the skin moisture in a temperature-controlled environment in a number of tests spanning multiple hours intervals (2 hours, 5 hours, 24 hours).  In terms of cost, Consumer Reports put per ounce of Cetaphil in the middle of the range 0.66 cents with the highest tested being 1.14 per oz and lowest tested 0.14 per oz. The current Amazon price is a bit better than the price quoted by Consumer Reports at 0.60 cents per oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works, I recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is a good value product to meet your everyday moisturizer needs.  That being said I prefer purpose but this is much cheaper.  Great item to buy from amazon.</li>
            <li> Trini Critic - Excellent Product</li>
            <li> This is not a great lotion. It feels very greasy but despite that fact, it&#x27;s also extremely light. What I mean is that I feel greasy when I put it on, but my face dries out before the end of my work day. I work in an office, not exactly rough work. Maybe it&#x27;s not meant for my skin type. I prefer CeRave&#x27;s face cream in the tubs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years.  It goes on easy, is quickly absorbed and is a good light-weight lotion</li>
            <li> This lotion is gentle, but its moisturizing capabilities is only a little better than that of plain water. It refuses to sink into my skin and also leaves a sticky film after it finally sets, which is highly annoying. waste of ten bucks. I really don&#x27;t see what the big deal is. It&#x27;s not amazing. And there is a slight unpleasant scent of rubber to it.</li>
            <li> like to keep this one around for when I have skin irritations, and do not want to apply just any body lotion.  I even use it on my face / a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> My son had steroids prescribed to him for his eczema however I do not prefer to use it on him, he is 2 yrs old and I was looking for more of a less abrasive route. I swear by this and Aveeno Babies for eczema, I actually prefer Aveeno but they both are good. I use Cetaphil in the summer and Aveeno in the winter.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion For All Skin Types really is great for all skin types including sensitive and eczema prone skin. Our family has been using it  for both our faces and bodies for years with great success and our skin types vary (normal, dry, sensitive with allergies, eczema). It was recommended by a family physician as well as a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an all-natural formula that includes glycerin, panthenol, and macadamia nut oil as moisturizing agents and farnesol for anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant properties. It is non-greasy, non-comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), fragrance-free, non-irritating and long lasting. It is very soothing and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and renewed.</li>
            <li> This lotion is way overrated.  Very expensive for a lotion that always leaves a thick residue coat behind that does not absorb.  It&#x27;s more like a cheap grocery store lotion than a fine moisturizer.  Neutrogena makes several lotions and moisturizers that are, for example, fully absorbed and very effective as moisturizers as well.  I&#x27;m sure there are many other good products available but Cetaphil is not one of them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  It was recommended by my dermatologist.  The price on Amazon is better than the price in the store (but still not as good as the generic brand).  I like that they come in a 2 pack because it&#x27;s convenient to have a back up when I run out.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist recommended! There&#x27;s a reason for it!</li>
            <li> I have rashes on my hands. I used this everyday on my dry hands and it really moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Great lotion for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> A great product for the whole family from toddlers to elders in the dry winter time. Not greasy. Love its &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and it keeps it moisturized and smooth. I love that it&#x27;s for sensitive skin too. I never break out with it.</li>
            <li> I really, really did not want to spend almost $10 on a lotion but I remembered how the cleanser worked so well for me many, many years ago. (Eventually, the cleanser didn&#x27;t work well for me anymore back then so I moved onto something else that eventually didn&#x27;t work as well. My skin struggles and I go waaay back.) I wouldn&#x27;t use the cleanser these days because I don&#x27;t like its ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Cetaphil moisturizing lotion, however, is simply AMAZING. It&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read in a couple of reviews that it was greasy and the first time I put it on, it was. My fault though! I put too much on! A little goes a long way. Instead of giving up on it, I learned to put some in my hand and dab a dot on my forehead, one on my nose, my cheeks, neck, and chin. I use this after I cleanse my face and shower--both with [[ASIN:B005HO0AR2 Dove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Count]]. It last all day and the only time my face will break out is if I get lazy and don&#x27;t wash my face. When I say breakout, I mean I get a pimple or two. I no longer have adult acne since using Dove&#x27;s Unscented and Sensitive skin bar soap with this Cetaphil lotion. It is also non-irritating and has helped with my eczema! There have also been times when I have been able to soothe my eczema patches with this instead of applying my corticosteriod cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how well it works with make-up but I&#x27;m thinking if I keep using this, I&#x27;ll rarely have pimples in the first place! For me, fewer pimples mean fewer to no blemishes and more even skin anyway. If I must have some make-up on in the future, I&#x27;d use an oil-free liquid foundation for medium coverage. I no longer need full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said earlier, it&#x27;s worth the money. I&#x27;ll be running low soon and I&#x27;m not hesitant about spending $9-$10 on it anymore because I know it&#x27;s going to last and it&#x27;s going to work. I need this lotion like I need feminine products and toilet tissue. Yes, it&#x27;s that necessary for me. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing productsï¼it can effectively alleviate the dry skin conditions.I use this product for a long timeï¼I&#x27;m feeling very good!</li>
            <li> I have being this product for several years now. It always leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion by accident (I was intending to buy the cleanser which is excellent) and decided to try it on my face. The stuff is greasy and does not absorb well at all actually it never really absorbed at all. I ended up washing it all off and will be returning it. I tried on my arm and it left my arm with a greasy feel as well. You are much better off buying Oil of Olay which absorbs way better. Not sure how this product got all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I slather my baby in this right before I zip up the PJs and in the morning baby is soft and smooth. This lotion is great for dry skin but I use it anytime such as after a bath. This is gentle on baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t too satisfied with this product.  It made my skin feel dry and did not  absorb into my skin very well</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion!  I would recommend it to all of my friends.  Especially for hands that are always washing dishes  and cooking, which&lt;br /&gt;is my forte!</li>
            <li> very cheap, it&#x27;s worthy in buying them. i bought three packs at one time. this is a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Many years ago before starting a regimen of Accutane my dermatologist told me to pick up a bottle of this because I would need it due to the drying effect of the medicine, and he was right. Been using it since then.</li>
            <li> What can I say? It does what it says. It absorbs well in the skin, has 0 fragrance and is hypoallergenic. I use it daily on my self and my baby girl who has some mild skin issues.</li>
            <li> My wife used this cream on her face and hands. She liked it as a good product. This product arrived right on time. She has used this for many years.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Bought for friend. She use it to smooth her baby and think it&#x27;s quite good for that!</li>
            <li> Consumer Reports ranked it best body lotion and they are right.  Works as advertised.  Moisturizes dry skin and dries fast.  Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well worth the price. One of the bottles opened during shipment and leaked in the plastic bag. Not too big of an issue since the product was for me and not a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an expensive Clinique moisturizer for the last several years. The economy being what it is, I simply couldn&#x27;t justify spending $48.50 (plus tax) to repurchase that moisturizer when it ran out. I began to search for a cheaper product and this one got good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne on my nose has been a big problem for me. While researching in search of a new product I came across a bit of information - constant application of facial moisturizers can cause acne because it clogs pores. Well, my nose is one of my very dry areas and I was applying my Clinique moisturizer multiple times per day and my skin was still dry and flaking off. Was this also causing the acne?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had good results with the Cetaphil face wash so figured I would give this product a try and only apply once or twice daily (morning/evening), seeing whether it would make a difference as far as my acne. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is a lot thicker than what I was using but the skin stays moist. That has taken some getting used to. But, I don&#x27;t have to reapply, and reapply and reapply. In fact, once day is usually sufficient and then again at night if I remember. The acne is more or less gone and my nose isn&#x27;t constantly peeling anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still too early for me to give this 5 stars, but if you don&#x27;t want to spend an outrageous amount of money buying a department store brand, try this. You can always use as regular lotion if it doesn&#x27;t work for your face. The price for two large bottles is ONE THIRD of what I had been paying for a tiny jar of the Clinique brand and you just know it&#x27;s going to last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Fragrance Free Moisturizing Lotion is great for dry skin. It is not greasy and helps moisturize in the winter and year round. Fragrance free is perfect for allergies.</li>
            <li> This lotion is unscented and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; formula moisturizers do. I use it on my face and body daily. My son is prone to excema and this lotion helps to control that better than anything else I&#x27;ve used on his skin. The only drawback to using this stuff as a face moisturizer is it does not have sunblock.</li>
            <li> I have always used this product and other Cetaphil products because they restore and enhance my skin.  I especially enjoyed getting the pack of 2 for the one low rate.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old has eczema and skin that is prone to rashes.  We searched high and low for a lotion that moisturized her skin well and did not cause her to break out in a rash.  Cetaphil was the only thing that worked for us.  Not too greasy, unscented and no irritants.</li>
            <li> I first noticed my infant son having these dry patches of skin all over his face and body and during a routine visit to his pediatrician, he said that he had eczema and just dry skin in general and recommended I get Cetaphil specifically for his dry skin and a OTC cortisone cream for the eczema.  I used the combination of the 2 for about a month and it eliminated his eczema completely.  Now I only use the Cetaphil and it keeps his skin so perfect and soft, which I&#x27;m sure he appreciates if he were able to talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just recently I ran out of my regular facial moisturizer and decided to try this out on myself just to see how it would be for me.  I figured that if it was good enough for baby then it&#x27;s good enough for me.  This makes a great body moisturizer and it&#x27;s just okay for my face.  I have extremely oily skin that can rival an oil spill and using this on my face makes it more oily than I thought possible.  It moisturizes great but I should really buy more of my regular facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It works, plain and simple. No fragrance. Not greasy. Light but long-lasting. I would recommend this to anyone of any age who has dry or itchy skin. I used it on my very chapped hands and they were completely smooth in about 3 days. Nothing has cleared them up as fast as Cetaphil lotion.</li>
            <li> I best part is that this lotion is fragrance free. It was recommend by my dermatologist. I have very dry skin and this lotion works very well.</li>
            <li> Truly doesn&#x27;t have a scent at all.  Feels really smooth going on and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel.  Lots of product for the price too</li>
            <li> I like this. It does not feel oily or feel cheap. gets absorbed easily and keep the skin mosturized all the time.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t need the heavy duty relief of Eucerin basic cream, I use this.  Like now, when it&#x27;s getting warmer out.  I use it on my face - no fragrance so I don&#x27;t get watery eyes and sneeze every minute or so - no irritating chemicals, or none that irritate my terribly sensitive skin.  And it doesn&#x27;t have that substance that&#x27;s in almost every other lotion, the chemical (I think it&#x27;s a silicone) that allows the manufacturers to claim:  Lasts For 24 Hours!!!  I don&#x27;t care for a lotion that last for all that time, because they are sticky on the skin and I can live without that.  I like one that absorbs, and if I need to reapply, I do so.  It&#x27;s not a big deal, and it makes my skin feel clean, not sticky.  Cetaphil has been one of my mainstay products over the years, it was one of the first that didn&#x27;t use fragrance, and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I use this all over, even the face.  It&#x27;s fine under make up, it absorbs and softens, and that&#x27;s all I want from a lotion.  It&#x27;s a great product, and worth buying.</li>
            <li> This is truly a fragrance free lotion.  It is excellent and works without ever needing to change in order to get the full potential.</li>
            <li> the product arrived in perfect condition and on time.&lt;br /&gt;we thought it was one but we got 2 units.&lt;br /&gt;which was paid for what we had not realized we had not that detail.&lt;br /&gt;but it was no problem.</li>
            <li> Nice product! My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry and irritating anymore.</li>
            <li> If you have allergies to fragrance and sensitive skin and eyes, this moisturizer is the go to product. Great for mature very dry skin!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer that I have used.</li>
            <li> I have used Cetaphil lotion for years...it is fantastic for my sensitive skin! Great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> What more can one say about this product? it is top notch, it works and it&#x27;s cheap, has it all!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and this keeps my skin moisturized throughout the winter for the most part.</li>
            <li> Product works OK kept my skin moist but I really was looking for same product but captioned DailyAdvance Ultra Hydrating Lotion in the 16oz size but so far I can only find it in the tube,this product would rate 10 stars.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and have for years it&#x27;s the best!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smooth my feet are not ruff it really is the best&lt;br /&gt;out there.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find so much moisturizer for a low price. This stuff does a good job, it&#x27;s light, totally odorless, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t cause pimples but I can&#x27;t be 100% yet. The only thing is it&#x27;s quite watery, you need quite a lot of this stuff to cover an area and moisture doesn&#x27;t last terribly long. It looks like there&#x27;s a lot of lotion but I think it&#x27;ll run out pretty quick, especially if you use it for your body as well. But for everyday light hydration morning and night there&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> Hypoalergenic, without scent, promots good hydrating. For babys with dermatites, its essential!!&lt;br /&gt;After we starte using it, my children, 3 and 7 years old, could achieve na amelioration of 80% with the apearing of eczemas in their skin.</li>
            <li> i always use this product, it works great and its cheaper here than any other site!&lt;br /&gt;my baby has sensitive skin and this does the job</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is a great, basic moisturizer.  It&#x27;s unscented, non-greasy and just works.  I use it year-round and find that it helps with winter dryness but works equally well in the warmer months.  I apply it mostly to my face before using after shave, but it&#x27;s a great body lotion and quickly healed my dry elbows.</li>
            <li> This lotion is magic for my skin!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone, oily and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Worst combination ever!!&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizers make me usually break out or don&#x27;t help me with my dry flaky skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Bc of my acne I use retin-a at night.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning I wash my face with the cetaphil cleanser for oily skin, put on acne free lotion for sensitive skin and add the cetaphil lotion after 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders! I&#x27;m so happy bc my skin is baby soft and looks so rejuvenated.&lt;br /&gt;And not just do I love cetaphil for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my body. I have noticed on my arms that it keeps my skin so soft and moisturized even until the shower the next morning, 24 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;My nivea body lotion broke me out on my arm.....YES, I literally got pimples on my arm after about 3 hrs after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Not with cetaphil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my last point now: it&#x27;s amazing (more really bothering and scary) how much money I&#x27;ve spent on skin care in the past just find out now that cetaphil does a much better job for only 8.99 at rite aid!</li>
            <li> I have horrible skin. It is dry, extremely acne prone and  very sensitive. I have a hard time finding anything that has long term positive effects on my skin. The only thing that has worked is going to the derm and this. I use Cetaphil Antibacterial Cleansing Bar on my face at night followed by this moisturizer then Persa Gel overnight. In the morning I use Clean and Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser followed by this then apply a skin clearing makeup. NOTHING on the shelves has kept my skin in this kind of shape. I love Cetaphil because it does not make me break out and I do not have to worry about getting too dry or greasy. I have used many different lotions for my face over the years, the results have been hell. Red, itchy, too greasy, breakouts...my skin looked better without lotion at that point and I would just leave it dry and flaking because I was convinced there was nothing that would help my skin. Cetaphil bar soap and the moisturizing lotion have done some really great things for my skin, and though it is more expensive then most drugstore remedies, I find the price is well worth the results its gives. And the price Amazon offers for 2 bottles is good, I usually pay around $8-$11 for one bottle, depending on where I get it. LOVE CETAPHIL! And it is dermatologist recommended too.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and years since I can no longer use a bar of soap on my skin due to my skin condition. This IS my daily boar of soap and suggested by the doctor.</li>
            <li> Never ever use a lotion that contains Parabens, such as Methylparaben, Propylparaben, or Ethylparaben!!! These are fake estrogens that penetrate your body and mess up your hormones. THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULD ALWAYS USE CETAPHIL, WHICH IS PARABEN-FREE AND DERMATOLOGIST RECOMMENDED. AMAZING PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> recommended by dermatologist.  Have been using it for over 10 years and will continue to use it.  Great results in skin care</li>
            <li> This is great lotion. I use it on myself and my sensitive toddler. The lotion absorbs fairly quickly and moisturizes well all day long. Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for moisturizing my whole body. Used it after shower and it helps to soften my skin especially on my elbows and legs.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price. It absorbs very fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a distracting smell. It also spreads very well.</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> It soaks into your skin quickly without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this product is the price!! after I bought this in amazon I went to my local supermarket and found it super expensive (2x this Price). This lotion is great for my skin, it keeps it moistured, non greasy and feels very light. Because of the size of the bottle, I have been using it in my whole body with excellent results. I guess its better than some lotions of the market, but the best thing is that when I get outbreaks of contact dermatitis, I&#x27;m sure I can use this product without fear of damaging my skin, and it really gets better</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and so does my mom &amp; my 20-month old daughter. A dermatologist recommended Cetpahil to me - the cream, the body lotion &amp; the body wash. I love all the products &amp; contiue to use them. It does not have any fragrance to irritate the skin. And it really moisturizes well. Thanks Cetaphil!</li>
            <li> O produto foi entregue no prazo informado e atendeu todas as minhas expectativas.  Recomendo a quem precisar de um bom hidratante.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 months old baby as suggested by the pediatrician and this is really good to be used. In fact I myself to apply it on my face and body and seems to be a family buy.</li>
            <li> My skin is as sensitive as it comes. Cetaphil is the ONLY thing that works to keep my skin soft without clogging pores and causing breakouts. It&#x27;s the greatest lotion ever. I&#x27;ve used it for years, and I stray from time to time, naively thinking I have found something that works better and is cheaper. I have yet to find a comparable product that works as well as this. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> I had to buy this lotion after I got a tattoo because I needed something fragrance free. I used it to moisturize other areas and noticed my skin does not stay moisturized for as long as it does when I use other lotion. I used it everyday for a month straight so I could be sure about whether or not I liked it (and I wanted to use as much of it as I could since I bought it). I definitely prefer Jergens lotion over this one, but it&#x27;s not the worst lotion I&#x27;ve purchased. Would I buy it again? Probably not. It could just be my skin, I&#x27;m sure there are people out there who love this stuff. I just don&#x27;t happen to be one of them. When you first put it on of course your skin feels soft. I just found that I was putting it on every half hour or so because my hands would start feeling dry. For the price, I would have expected it to keep my skin hydrated for a much longer period of time. Everyone is different though, that&#x27;s just my own personal experience with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil, the best lotion on earth. Stay hydrated all day, packaged with decent amount and is pump action so you won&#x27;t make a mess and from what I know It doesn&#x27;t destroy clothing from stains. What else could you ask of? I&#x27;d defiantly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different moisturizers none of them performed as well as this product.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is incredibly gentle, and doesn&#x27;t sting like many others do when applied to especially chapped skin. It&#x27;s also non-comedogenic and has been helpful in controlling my acne by maintaining a good oil and moisture balance on my face as well as minimizing irritation. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it if you need a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My whole family can use this (baby - Adult).&lt;br /&gt;Love the fact this lotion is very light and works.  I can put this on my face and body and don&#x27;t have to worry about breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this product it doesn&#x27;t smooth on well and doesn&#x27;t do anything to help with my dry skin it&#x27;s really not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The best body lotion ever!</li>
            <li> reasonably inexpensive and not so greasy. I always like this lotion. But I wish its moisture would stay longer than a half day. I guess, CA is too dry.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. I have very sensitive skin and even baby lotion can make my face burn. This causes no discomfort whatsoever and I&#x27;m very pleased with the size and amount you get for such a small price.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry. all other lotions are too thick. This is easy to use on the skin and I like the soap also.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lotion,LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This is your basic generic skin moisturizer with no bells or whistles.  I like that about it.  It&#x27;s a nice 8 ounce bottle, plastic, that you squeeze to have the product delivered from a hole in the top, and a flip cap so you can&#x27;t lose it.  Good packaging.  It is asexual also so men as well as women can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a decent job of softening up my skin with no fragrance, but there is a tiny bit of a funky undertone that smells like chemicals, but nothing I can&#x27;t live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with this comes in the fact that I can feel it sitting on top of my skin, like an oil slick.  It&#x27;s a gummy feeling and it won&#x27;t rinse off.  It&#x27;s not a lightweight moisturizer.  It&#x27;s a medium weight one.  It&#x27;s not elegant, it&#x27;s gooey.  It&#x27;s white and reminds me of cheap sunblock with that sticky smelly goo feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like the Cetaphil cleanser I won&#x27;t use this moisturizer because of the gooeyness.  It feels like it has wax in the formula.  It might do in a pinch but there are much better alternatives.</li>
            <li> I had my sister recommend me this moisturizer because her friend used the Cetaphil Cleanser and Lotion to clear up her acne. I don&#x27;t have severe acne, but I don&#x27;t have clear skin thats for sure, there&#x27;s not been a day when I didn&#x27;t have one or two pimples on my face. Once I started using it a few months ago starting back in August, I liked it. I didn&#x27;t seem to find any problems with it. But then I started noticing that my face started to get really oily and greasy, and my skin always felt dirty. I don&#x27;t know why I never thought that this was the reason for it..maybe because I was thrown off from all of the great reviews. But every morning I would wake up and my skin would be an oily mess. And also, not even an hour after applying the moisturizer my face was greasy. My pores were visible and you could see that they were filled with gunk, even when I would do masks and steam my face to get all of the dirt out. But recently I decided to stop using it and bought the Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer and I can&#x27;t help but look at the difference in my face just after two days! My skin isn&#x27;t any where near as oily as it was before, my skin looks clean and vibrant and my pores are almost completely invisible, and not a single new breakout. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I&#x27;m pretty happy I got the Cetaphil lotion out of my life..I didn&#x27;t realize what it was actually doing to my skin. Now my makeup stays on longer and oil no longer seeps through! But as with everything, products will work different on other peoples skin. You just have to test them out and see what works and what doesn&#x27;t. I see this works amazingly for some people, and that&#x27;s awesome. I hope this works for you if you decide to try it out, if not then I definitely recommend the Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you want to really clear your pores out I recommend using the Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask...you can see exactly where it is pulling the gunk and extra oils out of your pores and your pores are minimized immediately! Also I recommend using the Clairsonic Mia, I know it is a pretty penny but it is amazing! If you want to splurge on something that will give you a deep cleaning then go for it, but I know my friend uses the Olay Pro-X and she loves it! So you have options. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno Positively Radiant Moisturizer: http://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Positively-Radiant-Daily-Moisturizer/dp/B001IM5VT4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1357171088&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;aveeno+positively+radiant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clairsonic Mia: http://www.amazon.com/Clarisonic-Mia-Skin-Cleansing-System/dp/B002XURD32/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1357171119&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;clarisonic+mia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask: http://www.amazon.com/Queen-Helene-Mint-Julep-Masque/dp/B000EGMCFG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1357171150&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;queen+helene+mint+julep+masque</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling with acne and oily skin since my teens and have tried multiple cleansers and lotions. I have to say this has been so far the best choice i&#x27;ve made and my skin has been staying moisturized and clear ever since!</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that works well for my son&#x27;s eczema. It&#x27;s light and non-greasy. Perfect for baby&#x27;s skin. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the amazon price compared to the store price.</li>
            <li> not greasy, or too heavy. I&#x27;m a guy who gets a dry face after showers/shaving. This meets my needs very well.</li>
            <li> The delivery is speedy as usual. We like the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found a package of two 20 oz bottles that are 20 cheaper after we ordered this product. We decided to keep our ordering, saving the hassle of returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, the ordering experience is pleasant. We have no problem of ordering similar product again in the future.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil leaves my skin feeling less dry and without a greasy feeling.  I find that while my skin is still moist after taking a shower it works best.  Living in a dry climate I use it frequently during the day.  It also relieves itching which often accompanies dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous moisturizing products and find Cetaphil to be the most satisfactory.</li>
