            <li>I love that it comes with a travel set and accessories</li>
            <li>will be able to find room in my suitcase for the travel size.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product that leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Mouth feels very clean after use.</li>
            <li>have used these products for a long time and this one is the best yet!</li>
            <li>My favorite is the orthodontic tip because it helps to clean under the wire and around the braces.</li>
            <li>Easy set up.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik is easy to use and has improved the condition of my gums.  </li>
            <li>This is my first waterpik product and I liked the two waterpik combo.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and clean feeling after use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and compact and doesn&#x27;t take up much room</li>
            <li>I still floss with regular floss as recommended, but the waterpik has been a great compliment to my routine.</li>
            <li>The Nano is great for traveling, but only in North America, not Europe.  </li>
            <li>so I never have to remove my primary from the home.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Overall it does a great job.</li>
            <li>the company gains more knowledge, shouldn&#x27;t the product get better, not worse?</li>
            <li>Finding the right speed and water/hydrogen peroxide mix took a couple of days, but the way it cleans is outstanding.</li>
            <li>Floss my teeth promptly after I got this, as it is easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Love this set, large unit for home and small one perfect for travel!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy to have it as I travel frequently and the full size waterpik was too bulky and fragile to take along.</li>
            <li>but it works as well as my full size waterpik.</li>
            <li>I use one cap full of mouthwash with it.</li>
            <li>This is more than just a water flosser, it&#x27;s a new way of life!</li>
            <li>My waterflosser came used instead of new... be sure you guys check the product despite it being in a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; packaging.</li>
            <li>Easy to work and works very well for its intended purpose.  </li>
            <li>Love it, I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have gone back and forth between using the water flosser first and second and have found that both flossing options are needed to get the best cleaning benefits for your teeth.</li>
            <li>The first couple weeks this was quite sore when I used the water pik in this area!</li>
            <li>This is the single best thing I have purchased in my entire life.</li>
            <li>This is a great little travel waterpik.</li>
            <li>A little noisy but works great</li>
            <li>My dentist says it&#x27;s worth its weight in gold as it has made my teeth</li>
            <li>I think that alone is worth</li>
            <li>I ended up giving the nano to my fiancee since I have no need for a travel unit right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the waterpik for four months now, and it really helps keep my teeth clean and reduce plaque.</li>
            <li>I love being able to add a little mouthwash to the water.  </li>
            <li>The instructions were clear and pictures helped make it easy to use.</li>
            <li>First time user,  </li>
            <li>But once you get acquainted with it, there is no going back.</li>
            <li>Not my first one.</li>
            <li>This product was suggested by my dentist and performs exactly as hoped.</li>
            <li>So much easier</li>
            <li>Otherwise I probably would of chocked on the water coming out to fast.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very closely spaced and floss tends to shred.  </li>
            <li>Really do like this model.  </li>
            <li>It makes flossing so much easier.</li>
            <li>There are different power settings for you own personal preference.</li>
            <li>Im nearly 50!!!</li>
            <li>Im to impatient to use it more often, and the pic never felt right to me, the brush feels like a tooth brush</li>
            <li>The classic jet is like a mini water gun that pushes food pieces out.</li>
            <li>It has variable water pressure for sensitive gums, large water container, lots of choices for tips...</li>
            <li>disappointing to see a good company making good product in the past</li>
            <li>This is my 4th Waterpik I have owned in my lifetime and each new one has shorter lifespan.</li>
            <li>It was time to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>We just moved &amp; my new dental hygienist recommended this-</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>then the old fashion way.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I do not like the travel version of the Waterpik for two reasons: one, it requires an electrical outlet, and so often, hotel rooms do not have an outlet near the sink.</li>
            <li>My two children, 7 and 9, are starting to use the product and their mouths are very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>teeth are cleaner and I had sensitive teeth with this water flosser</li>
            <li>He said he was going to start recommend this to people with sensitive teeth from now on.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted over 10 years, second one 7 years, the third one 3 years</li>
            <li>I am not exactly sure how this clean plaque between teeth.</li>
            <li>I only use it once at night half full and I only use the toothbrush adapter.</li>
            <li>In spite of a sonic toothbrush, flossing, brushing between the teeth with a little brush, alternating mouthwashes, and using a night guard, I was slowly, but surely, loosing the pocket depth war.  </li>

            <li> For travel, I use the battery-powered Toilet Tree brand device, which can be recharged by a 240 volt outlet.</li>
            <li> the reason I say this is: published in one of the Health magazines it talks about every time you flush the toilet, germ are propelled into the air.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> my teeth are not sensitive</li>
            <li> they put an On/Off switch on it as the other one only had a pause button.  </li>
            <li> I was just pissed it was not new..</li>
            <li> When you have spent what I have spent on implants you have to take car of them!</li>
            <li> Like the extra small one for trips.</li>
            <li> and it is so hard to get floss or a tiny brush in because of the gum overlay!</li>
            <li> Try using warm water if you have sensitive gums - cold water can be painful.</li>
            <li> and I can feel less tartar on the lower inside implant front.</li>
            <li> Takes little bit of practice and  watching videos to get used to it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for the past month since I got it.</li>
            <li> Using the Pik has helped me to reduce some sensitivity to make traditional flossing less unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I have tons of dental work (bridge, crown, fillings) and the waterpik gets into those areas that are difficult to reach with floss.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed not to recieve a lid for my travel pick</li>
            <li> I hate flossing</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with the device since it stopped working.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my first waterpik product and I liked the two waterpik combo. I was using the bigger waterpik and my kids used the travel size one.  We have this for about two weeks and the bigger unit of the two stopped working. I am very disappointed with the device since it stopped working. When it was working it was a good product though.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing and I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for the past month since I got it. It&#x27;s a great product that leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love it.Easy to use and very effective.I only wish I would have bought one years ago.If you want to keep your teeth buy a waterpik.</li>
            <li> This is the best product. I only use it once at night half full and I only use the toothbrush adapter. Im to impatient to use it more often, and the pic never felt right to me, the brush feels like a tooth brush so I use it. Sonic care in shower once a day. My dentist says I am in the top 1% for gum health. Im nearly 50!!!</li>
            <li> very good product works very very good Just What The denist Ordered !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> First time user,  So much easier then the old fashion way.</li>
            <li> Does a great job after brushing.</li>
            <li> I am not exactly sure how this clean plaque between teeth. Yeah it cleans food, but plaque?!</li>
            <li> This is the single best thing I have purchased in my entire life. This is more than just a water flosser, it&#x27;s a new way of life! This also has a toothbrush head included. I just tried it and I am impressed beyond words can express. Your teeth get the best cleaning of their life - so powerful and effective - I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great little travel waterpik. It&#x27;s nice and compact and doesn&#x27;t take up much room but it works as well as my full size waterpik. I am very happy to have it as I travel frequently and the full size waterpik was too bulky and fragile to take along.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!! We recommend them in my office!!</li>
            <li> Love it, I have very sensitive teeth and this is helping with my gum disease.</li>
            <li> My dentist tells me to use both this and regular floss, which I do.  Feel like the waterpik does a better job.  Mouth feels very clean after use.</li>
            <li> The item was as described and arrived when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Very effective!  In spite of a sonic toothbrush, flossing, brushing between the teeth with a little brush, alternating mouthwashes, and using a night guard, I was slowly, but surely, loosing the pocket depth war.  On the advice of my dentist, I starting using a water flosser, and the pocket depth issues turned around immediately.  HOWEVER, I do not like the travel version of the Waterpik for two reasons: one, it requires an electrical outlet, and so often, hotel rooms do not have an outlet near the sink. Two, the Waterpiks are 110 voltage only, which I discovered when I burned one up in  a London hotel.  How could anyone market an electrical device for travel when it is not dual-voltage?  For travel, I use the battery-powered Toilet Tree brand device, which can be recharged by a 240 volt outlet.</li>
            <li> My waterflosser came used instead of new... be sure you guys check the product despite it being in a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; packaging. However it did work as described I was just pissed it was not new.. it had brown dirt coming out of the device etc.</li>
            <li> I love Waterpik!  I especially love this set.  I keep the travel case at work.  Both pieces work great!</li>
            <li> Love this set, large unit for home and small one perfect for travel!  Very fresh and clean feeling after use!</li>
            <li> A little noisy but works great</li>
            <li> This product is great for everyone. There are different tips for different purposes. My favorite is the orthodontic tip because it helps to clean under the wire and around the braces. When you have braces often there will be food stuck to your teeth and braces. The classic jet is like a mini water gun that pushes food pieces out. There are different power settings for you own personal preference. This product includes a travel flosser with its own travel case and tips.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Waterpik.  I love how this product keep my oral health in a top shape.  My two children, 7 and 9, are starting to use the product and their mouths are very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I purchased this product in October 2014, after 9 month of usage, the motor stopped. The water no longer shoots out of the machine. This is my 4th Waterpik I have owned in my lifetime and each new one has shorter lifespan. My first one lasted over 10 years, second one 7 years, the third one 3 years and this one made 9 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to love this product but spending $80 every 6 to 9 month will force me to look for their competing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing to see a good company making good product in the past but no longer keep up with their quality.&lt;br /&gt;As the company gains more knowledge, shouldn&#x27;t the product get better, not worse?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the waterpik for four months now, and it really helps keep my teeth clean and reduce plaque. I have tons of dental work (bridge, crown, fillings) and the waterpik gets into those areas that are difficult to reach with floss. I still floss with regular floss as recommended, but the waterpik has been a great compliment to my routine.</li>
            <li> We have only been using this for a week and I like how it makes my gums feel.</li>
            <li> Finding the right speed and water/hydrogen peroxide mix took a couple of days, but the way it cleans is outstanding. I am recommending this product.</li>
            <li> Love the full-sized flosser but the travel one is weird without a lid over the water.</li>
            <li> have used these products for a long time and this one is the best yet!</li>
            <li> great addition to a toothbrush</li>
            <li> This particular combo is the best buy for sure.  The Ultra in this is an upgrade from the WP-100 Ultra...they put an On/Off switch on it as the other one only had a pause button.  The Nano is great for traveling, but only in North America, not Europe.  My dentist says it&#x27;s worth its weight in gold as it has made my teeth the best they&#x27;ve been.</li>
            <li> Never owned a water pik or a water flosser. The instructions were clear and pictures helped make it easy to use. Otherwise I probably would of chocked on the water coming out to fast. Love it...</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now. I use one cap full of mouthwash with it. I ended up giving the nano to my fiancee since I have no need for a travel unit right now. The only addition I would, and did buy, is the tongue adapter.</li>
            <li> Improved my oral hygiene after purchasing this product. Takes little bit of practice and  watching videos to get used to it. But once you get acquainted with it, there is no going back. Floss my teeth promptly after I got this, as it is easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Works great! Easy set up.</li>
            <li> Good deal for home use and travel</li>
            <li> Works great, easy way to floss.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed not to recieve a lid for my travel pick</li>
            <li> Great!!&lt;br /&gt;More than my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this WaterPik. My teeth are very closely spaced and floss tends to shred.  Using the Pik has helped me to reduce some sensitivity to make traditional flossing less unpleasant.  Try using warm water if you have sensitive gums - cold water can be painful.</li>
            <li> Brush your teeth well and rinse your mouth with water well, that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> very good exactly whats pictured!</li>
            <li> Awesome Item! I love that it comes with a travel set and accessories so I never have to remove my primary from the home.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Not my first one. Like the extra small one for trips.</li>
            <li> Have used a Waterpik for years.  It was time to buy a new one.  Really do like this model.  Will be traveling to I will be able to find room in my suitcase for the travel size.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> Love this.  Have gotten great results and feedback from dental hygenist and dentist since using this product.  Travel flosser is a great addition.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Easy to work and works very well for its intended purpose.  Definitely would recommend.  Would like to see 2 sets of brushes with it.  My dentist is very happy.</li>
            <li> This is perhaps the &amp;#34;BEST&amp;#34; on the market in my viewpoint. It has variable water pressure for sensitive gums, large water container, lots of choices for tips...LOTS of tips. Here are the things that I feel fall short in the design aspect, travel pack should have a cover for the water container and water tips should have a universal guard to put on to protect against germs when not using,... the reason I say this is: published in one of the Health magazines it talks about every time you flush the toilet, germ are propelled into the air. I use a piece of tinfoil to cover the tip. Overall I give it an A-</li>
            <li> My parent was happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;So gooooood.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;This has improved my dental visits.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are cleaner and I had sensitive teeth with this water flosser my teeth are not sensitive anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I can eat frozen items like a popsicle and not have my teeth hurt.&lt;br /&gt;The dentist was amazed at my last dental visit. He said he was going to start recommend this to people with sensitive teeth from now on.</li>
            <li> It works great. My daughter loves using it to get thing out of her braces. Overall it does a great job. I like to use it even when using manual flossing. I have gone back and forth between using the water flosser first and second and have found that both flossing options are needed to get the best cleaning benefits for your teeth.</li>
            <li> Had not used a water pik before. Amazing what it does.</li>
            <li> Plugged it in and that was all. It worked for about ten seconds and that was it.</li>
            <li> Great Value and health of your Gum line and Teeth.</li>
            <li> Love it. Received item in a week; works perfectly.</li>
            <li> When you have spent what I have spent on implants you have to take car of them! We just moved &amp; my new dental hygienist recommended this- I also use Sonicare toothbrush.  It is wonderful to get under my implants and I can feel less tartar on the lower inside implant front. I also had a spot bother me on the lower permanent implant where I know food can and  has gotten caught and it is so hard to get floss or a tiny brush in because of the gum overlay! The first couple weeks this was quite sore when I used the water pik in this area! As I kept using it is no longer sore! I think that alone is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is easy to use and has improved the condition of my gums.  I love being able to add a little mouthwash to the water.  My dental hygienist is very happy with the improvement of my gums.  I owe it all to Waterpik!!</li>
            <li> amazing!! what a difference. It makes flossing so much easier.</li>
            <li> Wow! This works great! My dentist will be thrilled with the outcome.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by my dentist and performs exactly as hoped. Very good at cleaning gum line that can&#x27;t be reached by flossing or brushing.</li>
