            <li>Love it and would recommend it all all this company&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>A nice light scent.</li>

            <li>Nice night cream, very creamy but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>But, this is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>Gave as gift, person seemed to excited to try this product</li>
            <li>a real pet peeve with many others).It feels like the $150 cream too.</li>
            <li>I will pay more for natural, petrochemical - free products.</li>
            <li>I am older (OK 57) and am seeing the results both in tone and texture.</li>
            <li>and like I said my skin has not looked better since I was 30 years old and blotches are gone</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>

            <li>First discovered it on the Steve Harvey show.</li>

            <li>my mother told me that my skin hasn&#x27;t looked better since I was 30 but another little tip ladies I also wash and tone my skin with pure organic lemon juice</li>

            <li>Wow…all I can say is wow - this night cream is so thick and rich.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d expect a night cream to be very moisturizing, even a little bit greasy feeling.  </li>

            <li> No complaints, I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> Like the product does what it says</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this cream when I was researching &amp;#34;best anti-aging night creams&amp;#34; and I saw the Oprah had listed it as one of her favorite products.  This night cream has a beautiful, silky texture that feels really lovely on my skin.  Also, I have sensitivity to a lot of anti-aging products that contain Retinol and I have not had any issues with this.</li>
            <li> great stuff can feel the tightning</li>
            <li> Great product.  Well worth the money. Will be lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> for me this works fine and my skin is sensitive and am very happy with it... I would recommend this product to anyone...</li>
            <li> The ingrediients are all petrochemically derived except for a tiny few. I never dreamed it and bought because of all the publicity and great reviews. When i read the ingredients, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t use this witches brew on my worse enemy. Also, it reeks!. Its scent is overwhelming and reminded me of cheap men&#x27;s aftershave. It&#x27;s a shame, but if a deal seems too good to be true, it is!!! I can&#x27;t believe Good Housekeepinv approves some of these products - because they&#x27;re cheap?  I will pay more for natural, petrochemical - free products. This went right in the trash.</li>
            <li> I like all of Boots No. 7 products and this is no exception.  Feels creamy and smells nice.  Not greasy.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Wow…all I can say is wow - this night cream is so thick and rich. It truly does what it says. I am older (OK 57) and am seeing the results both in tone and texture. Yay!</li>
            <li> This absorbs so fast I don&#x27;t waste any cream on my pillow ( a real pet peeve with many others).It feels like the $150 cream too. Excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is simply great for all skins especially aging skin.  Love it and would recommend it all all this company&#x27;s products.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Best cream on the market. Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have dryish skin and need a lot of lifting. I am over 60. I believe this cream is equally as good if not better! than the $125 department store night lifting cream I used prior to purchasing Boots No7. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. First discovered it on the Steve Harvey show. Usually do not buy things endorsed like that. But I gave this a try and won.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months and was about out of it. I found it on Amazon and bought it. It&#x27;s just the same as the one I purchased at Target and saved me a trip to the store to get it. Very good product. Goes on smoothe, soaks in the skin nicely, doesn&#x27;t clog poors. A nice light scent. It is the perfect night cream that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Rich, lovely feel. A great night cream. Affordable and effective.</li>
            <li> Nice night cream, very creamy but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  It seems to be softening my wrinkles also.</li>
            <li> I love Boots NO7 Lift &amp; Luminate but wasn&#x27;t real impressed with the night cream. I use all of the No7 lift and luminate products but I do better with using the day cream, night and day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this would do as promised, but in a week my pores are smaller and my skin is soft, supple and firm.  It might be my imagination but the tone seems to have improved as well.  I&#x27;m going to buy two bottles next tie so I&#x27;ll have them on hand when I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the &amp;#34;No7&amp;#34; products. This has a great feel, not greasy, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was shocked that this product is scented.  Within 48 hours of using it, my face felt like it was on fire.  Yes, I do have sensitive skin.  This is my first experience with a Boots product; so, I did only buy this one item to try before buying more.  Thank goodness I have only this one to add to the collection under my sink.</li>
            <li> They are okay for lesser priced products, smell very nicely and go on smoothly but other products I have used are better.</li>
            <li> This has the old familiar aroma of Ponds, which my mother used for years.  But, this is a fabulous product.  Since i started using it, a couple of friends have actually asked me if I was using botox.  No way!  Just Boots No 7.  I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.  Its the first night cream i have bought repeatedly.  I have an oily complexion and this does not increase the oil, but yet moisturizes beautifuly.  If you have oil skin, you have got to try it.</li>
            <li> I love all the products from this line.  They are affordable and have good ratings.  And I like that you can buy what you need for your age.</li>
            <li> all boots products are wonderful and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I have  been using it for several months.It is terrific!!</li>
