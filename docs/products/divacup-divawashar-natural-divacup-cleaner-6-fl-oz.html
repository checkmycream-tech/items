            <li>Love it :D</li>
            <li>Pleasant citrusy smell while using, with no lingering scent after.</li>
            <li>Does the job, gets sudsy, and is pleasant.</li>
            <li>It cleans the Divacup well and has a pleasant citrusy smell that doesn&#x27;t leave a fragrance on the cup itself.</li>
            <li>I opens the bottle as soon as it arrived and was pleasant</li>
            <li>but I need to give the bottle a good squeeze before anything comes out, and when it does I get a TON.</li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good stuff, it smells good</li>
            <li>so I keep it on the bathroom counter for a good week.  </li>
            <li>This is a good cleanser for my DivaCup.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather well and doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>It works well for that purpose and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, works great.</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>We felt good about buying this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for balancing my ph! and clean my diva cup</li>
            <li>so this is a wonderful product to clean the DivaCup.</li>
            <li>Wonderful and clean smelling, cleans the cup well</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use and gives great results.  </li>
            <li>I got the DivaWash after using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Mild Castile Soap for awhile, and realizing that castile soap IS NOT the best thing to use on a silicone cup.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very light and citrusey!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with my Diva Cup and I am very glad that I did.</li>
            <li>good product, smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nice soap with no added scents, which is good.</li>
            <li>It smells awesome and is very gentle.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s great for traveling, since you can use it to clean your Diva Cup, your body, and your face!</li>
            <li>The diva wash does have a very light and pleasant scent to it.</li>
            <li>so I feel confident using it!</li>
            <li>y love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>First of all the Diva cup is the best invention for feminine products to date!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It smells great, not too strong.</li>
            <li>it has a great light smell to it.</li>
            <li>This product really does smell great!</li>
            <li>Does the job and smells nice.</li>
            <li>the Diva Wash. It smells good, has safe ingredients, cleans the diva cup well, and works well on the body.</li>
            <li>Cleans cup nicely.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice soap, but doesn&#x27;t get the stink out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s effective, and i&#x27;ve found no issues as of yet.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I received my wash from amazon and was able to give my diva cup a good through cleaning.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nice citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I actually own a Lunette menstrual cup rather than the Divacup, but I have been using this cleanser to wash it.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, light citrus scent while washing and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or lingering scent.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent and does a good job of cleaning my menstrual cup without leaving a soapy residue.</li>
            <li>I love how you can use this cleanser for more than one thing!</li>
            <li>So, my Diva Wash arrived a day or two early which was awesome.</li>
            <li>It a light soap and smells really good.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too :)</li>
            <li>In case of sensitive reactions just perfect</li>
            <li>am so glad I did as this product was amazing.</li>
            <li>However, I will be looking for an alternative that is effective, but more cost efficient.</li>
            <li>it keeps my diva cup very clean, and nice scent too.&lt;br /&gt;bit pricy</li>
            <li>Hand soap never seemed good to clean it with.</li>
            <li>This product was advertised as being more effective and more hygienic than pads or tampons</li>
            <li>Pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>and it is gentle and me and my DIVA cup clean and happy!</li>
            <li>Cleans nicely and easily.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and price was good.</li>
            <li>The Diva Wash arrived in perfect condition before the expected arrival date and I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m going to need to buy refills of this soap more because I keep accidentally using more than I need.</li>
            <li>Love the stuff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t suds up like many soaps</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Love this product ...</li>
            <li>I really love the DivaWash.</li>
            <li>When I was deciding how I would wash my Diva Cup, I made sure to buy something that would not deteriorate the product over time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got the Divawash.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product AND seller.</li>
            <li>and I got to say I love it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so soothing :)</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see mini/hotel-sized bottles of this product to stash in my purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>It was a bit more affordable than the others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy again. :)</li>
            <li>so I know it is safe to use.  </li>
            <li>This is much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This cleaner works ok but does not eliminate all odor as described.</li>
            <li>but mine is more of a gel.</li>
            <li>Either way, I keep using it and it does ok but nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li>I waited six months to be sure before I posted this review.</li>
            <li>I began using this because I thought I should be doing more than just boiling the cup for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Nothing more is needed.  </li>
            <li>just now I tried once more and no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i was more than satisfied :)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need more than a drop.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser ever!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I gave this stuff a whirl after my favorite cleanser stopped working for me</li>
            <li>My skin tone is even and I can&#x27;t stop touching my face</li>
            <li>so when I use the Divawash, I&#x27;m sure I will get a lot of use out of it.  </li>
            <li>and I found it works better than Summer&#x27;s Eve.</li>
            <li>When it does come out, I feel like I get more than needed</li>
            <li>I love this wash.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, light, citrus scent to it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather play it safe and use the stuff they recommend.</li>
            <li>Learn from my mistake :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Growing more concerned with my continual loss of blood from my area I decided to consult Web MD.</li>
            <li>I love my diva cup -</li>
            <li>and I am just about to order more.</li>
            <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t appealing to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lemongrass scent which isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>but it does its job for the most part.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it is much better to use for cleaninga your vulva as,regular body soap can cause infections.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower each day when I have my period, just to save time and make it more convenient than washing in the sink.</li>
            <li>This one won&#x27;t do that I tried it on my face out of curiosity and was amazed :)</li>
            <li>And I love how you can use it as hand wash also.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not terrible!!</li>
            <li>love a lot all i need is drop.</li>
            <li>: good investment is worth the quality, quantity and convenience.</li>
            <li>However, I like the scent and glad I bought this bottle with my diva cup.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much (as advertised) and it leaves a pleasant but VERY light citrus odor.</li>
            <li>Keeps the cup nice and clean.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, it gets DivaCups clean, and you can use it to wash your body as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one bottle last me over a year now, and it does an excellent job of cleaning my Diva Cup in a safe, easy way.</li>
            <li>perfect in every way...it even lasts a long time...</li>
            <li>It really does a nice job cleaning the cup!</li>
            <li>worth buying it if you&#x27;re buying a cup!!</li>
            <li>which is great when it comes to your, ahem, more sensitive lady areas.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a great value.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this product to clean my Diva Cup!</li>
            <li>Effectively and quickly cleans, rinses easily, and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>This was a nice smelling, gentle, cleanser that has done a great job keeping my Diva Cup clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap to use with my Diva cup and it works great as far as cleaning goes.</li>
            <li>I am sure that goes doubly true for the NSA,  they just want to serve and protect us better.</li>
            <li>so I was able to place my order and have it shipped free to me in two days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is also great for cleansing adult novelty toys.</li>
            <li>It has natural emollients to keep your Diva Cup in good shape, and for the most part, most people do not have reactions to the ingredients in this product.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t have a good soap to use for my diva cup</li>
            <li>I wish I could say that it is made from genuine unicorn, but not to worry, it is completely free from magical animal by-products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle, too, nice to know it&#x27;s safe to use elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend purchasing this wash with the diva cup.</li>
            <li>recommend it...also STRONGLY STRONGLY recommend the Diva Cup...</li>
            <li>Great scent and you barely need any product to wash your cup.</li>
            <li>It works just fine to wash your Diva Cup</li>
            <li>and I think it is just fine.</li>
            <li>It make the use of the diva cup so easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I think it works fine, although I dislike the smell.</li>
            <li>It has light scent that is easy on the nose.</li>
            <li>Light citrus sent.  </li>
            <li>So now I use a pea size amount and it gets it clean and rinses easy.</li>
            <li>The scent is light.</li>
            <li>Its scent free.</li>
            <li>I get a great lather off of a very tiny amount.</li>
            <li>It also has a citrus smell, not fragrance free as stated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was a great experience.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also great as a personal cleanser.</li>
            <li>After receiving my approval on my TANF application I decided to fly to Guatemala in order to make my final TRANsition into Denise.</li>
            <li>This stuff is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>There is some getting used to this product, figuring the suction out, and you have to be comfortable with yourself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly citrusy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get enough of this works great for shower use or cup/toy use.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and citrusy use this all the time.</li>
            <li>Also, multi purposeful makes it more useful.</li>
            <li>It has a light lemony smell, so it is not scent-free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to know that it&#x27;s natural and safe to use with the DivaCup.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so this all natural cleaner is wonderful.</li>
            <li>It has a very fresh smell as well.  </li>
            <li>It has a really nice, light citrusy scent that is natural and very mild.</li>
            <li>Completely worth it!</li>
            <li>Probably worth it!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to rinse it very well!</li>
            <li>The first couple times it was OK but by the 12th time that day it began to smell a bit funky.</li>
            <li>I like the light scent, which is not overpowering, neutralizes odors, and quickly disappears.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my Diva Cup clean</li>
            <li>It makes my DivaCup clean</li>
            <li>My cup is as clean and odorless as the day I got it.</li>
            <li>if you use the diva cup it may be help you to clean it.</li>
            <li>From now on, I will be using this soap to clean my DivaCup.</li>
            <li>Gets the Diva cup clean and has a fruity smell I like.  </li>
            <li>I use this twice a day during my period (morning and night), when I clean out my diva cup.</li>
            <li>so i could clean it property.</li>
            <li>It keeps my cup clean and citrus-y</li>
            <li>no scent, but everything feels and looks clean.</li>
            <li>( A clean one.)</li>
            <li>It gets my cup clean and smelling nice and fresh (unlike castile soap) and doesn&#x27;t really leave any residue.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it smells, like a very light lemon scent.</li>
            <li>When i started birth control i often got yeast infections but this really helped keep it clean :)</li>
            <li>I like the scent of this, light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The thing about this soap is that you must make sure you rinse it THOROUGHLY, because the soap is very sudsy and you don&#x27;t want to leave any excess soap on the cup.</li>
            <li>I do like it, but I didn&#x27;t realize it didn&#x27;t suds much and therefore used more than I should have.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember much about those two days as I felt woozy for most of that time,  </li>
            <li>Its a good product, but i think soap and water will work just the same.</li>
            <li>and still i have a almost full bottle</li>
            <li>It fit nice and snug up there and not a single drop of blood leaked out.</li>
            <li>nothing super special about this wash.</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t come up with a good way to clean those little vent holes at the top, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>Keeps the diva cup fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It fades away rather quickly, but does restore the freshness of the cup.</li>
            <li>and I can just use a mild soap to wash the cup rather than this.</li>
            <li>Diva International doesn&#x27;t outright say this, but after doing a bit of investigating, this is the most plausible explanation to me.</li>
            <li>The savings will be tremendous.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>it cleans well and has a mild scent, but does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li>It cleanses, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, has a nice light soap smell and is very gel like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new Diva Cup user and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this wash to go with my Cup.</li>
            <li>I am new to the idea of a menstrual cup, so I felt really safe washing it with this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I orderd this to go with my new diva cup.</li>
            <li>Then rinse the cup really well with hot water (when you think it&#x27;s rinsed, rinse it some more).</li>
            <li>I expect this bottle to last a long time, and believe it to be an excellent value.</li>
            <li>Be aware may decrease bladder capacity meaning may lead to lots of bathroom breaks if you drink a lot of water!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I need to clean my diva cup.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent which is totally fine.</li>
            <li>I thought it did a great job cleaning my cup and little</li>
            <li>I like this cleaner because it smells great but is made without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free and works really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this stuff so far.</li>
            <li>I do not use it to wash my own body or face, even though it says you can, because I simply can&#x27;t afford to do that.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came in a larger size, but if this is all they have, then this is what I will continue to order.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh</li>
            <li>I cannot say whether it well help keep politicians out of your uterus, vagina, etc., or help them from making fun of womens&#x27; &amp;#34;wherevers&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>you are going to go Diva, its worth adding to your cart</li>
            <li>fresh</li>
            <li>Fresh scent and all plant based</li>
            <li>DivaWash is a very gentle and mild cleanser for the DivaCup.  </li>
            <li>but really you just have to gauge whether this is the right product for you and how comfortable you are with the idea.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but I love having a good smelling, Ph balanced soap.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time too, which makes the price more justifiable.</li>
            <li>From there, you can determine if it is right for you.</li>
            <li>It does the job of getting the Diva Cup clean without much effort on your part.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had problems with using a regular antibacterial soap on my sex toys, or really any kind of soap for cleansing &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34;  This wash solved both of those problems, and it&#x27;s actually a great face wash as well, since it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li>I have try many, many facial cleansers and they have all made me break out even the sensitive ones.</li>
            <li>Came in good condition and was exactly what I expected!  </li>
            <li>it got cloudy like others say and just wasn&#x27;t coming clean, no matter how hot the water or how much soap.</li>
            <li>The best part is you only need a little of the wash at a time</li>
            <li>The product is great, but I would rather find something a little cheaper at a health food store than pay so much for 6 oz.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel to hot right now</li>
            <li>The gel is quite thick so a pea sized drop or really all you need to clean your cup, which not only makes it easy to use but also makes it a great budget/ eco friendly product.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it to clean my cup and it does the job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen people complain about the price, but it&#x27;s super concentrated, so you don&#x27;t need much at all, either for cleaning the cup or yourself.</li>
            <li>this soap is extremely mild, yet still cleans it very well.</li>
            <li>This is very concentrated stuff, you really only need a drop and it bubbles up nicely.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for my Diva Cup for a couple years now and ignoring that little blurb about being good for the face.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>But I like supporting Diva Cup and what they stand for</li>
            <li>I use hot water and make sure there&#x27;s nothing left on it before I reinsert it or put it away.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily work any better than</li>
            <li>When I first got the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love this wash not only for the diva cup but for literally any part of my body.</li>
            <li>When it first arrived, I wondered if I would need to buy bottles often.</li>
            <li>so I ordered the DivaWash and just used it for the first time</li>
            <li>I got this because it was on sale for 2.50 at my local Sprouts :)</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned that I had made a misinformed decision by choosing to hire a Guatemalan  surgeon on the advice of cocktail waitress/lady of the evening</li>
            <li>As I signed in the first banner ad I saw was hawking a product which called it self a Diva cup.</li>
            <li>Thanks Diva Cup!</li>
            <li>I bought this Divawash because I had just bought my first menstrual cup ( the diva cup size 1)</li>
            <li>So I just decided to go ahead and order this as my first cup wash soap.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to go along with the Diva Cup that I bought which I love, this product does its job but for a alternative it seems to be the same as feminine wash.</li>
            <li>It literally gets the smell off and cleans it more thoroughly than regular soap because of the pH.</li>
            <li>When I first got my Diva Cup, I tried a variety of soaps on it.  </li>
            <li>Love this wash, definitely necessary when using a diva cup.</li>
            <li>Like, at least a year, if not closer to five years (assuming it doesn&#x27;t expire by then lol).</li>
            <li>I would recommend this divawash to anyone who wants to get their menstrual cup clean and keep your pH balance on the healthy side even if you don&#x27;t have the diva cup you can use it for a lot of other silicone menstrual cups.</li>
            <li>(very light scent, despite being unscented), product lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li>This method is clean, safe, durable, less time consuming....</li>
            <li>Very useful if you have Diva Cup, and definitely worth a buy, if only just for the peace of mind that you won&#x27;t get an infection or ruin your cup.</li>
            <li>After that I tried to wash it really well with hot water</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant smell and a little of this wash goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I got this with the Divacup because I wanted to make sure that I had something that was definitely compatible with the material of the cup and safe to use on something that goes in such a sensitive place-</li>
            <li>py suprised that the unsented cleansing gel was indeed free from artificial perfumes but still had and amazing light fresh almost citrusy smell.</li>
            <li>Have not tried using it on my face because the idea of using the same cleaner for a vaginal item on my face just weirds me out, but I&#x27;ll take other&#x27;s people&#x27;s word for it when they say it&#x27;s even safe for the face. :)</li>
            <li>My hands are super soft after using this.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER oily hair and so far I&#x27;ve gone 3 days without washing it...</li>
            <li>free two day shipping was a life saver as I continued to bleed over those days and finally ran out of wash on the afternoon of the first day.</li>
            <li>super epic cleaner.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a light gel, so it&#x27;s easy to get out just a little.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and it is gentle on my hands, doesn&#x27;t leave a film and it doesn&#x27;t discolor or dry out the silicone.</li>
            <li>so I guess it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li>but it wasnt really working.</li>
            <li>It is also a really gentle cleanser for my 5-year-old who doesn&#x27;t always wipe well.</li>
            <li>I also used it in the boiling water to wash my diva cup with and much fresher smell.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, just with</li>
            <li>Gentle soap for the divacup, as described.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like that it is like a gel</li>
            <li>I absolutely agree with others that there is a ton of product for the $.</li>
            <li>I use just a drop because it can become very soapy.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend picking some up!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product however it doesn&#x27;t really remove the stained color of the cup after using it for over a year.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really all you need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated and works well.  </li>
            <li>I use this for the cup, intimate area, as well as the body.</li>
            <li>When I use this I do not feel as if the wash is loaded with perfumes, rather that it is cleans gently and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It really depends on your needs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not irritating and does  the job well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s changed my period so much.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for anyone with a reusable menstrual cup, or someone who needs a gentle feminine wash.</li>
            <li>So glad they came out with a specific and natural wash.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and many products irritate my skin and leave it red.</li>
            <li>and I am glad i got it and its all natural especially because its for my mooncup</li>
            <li>This will be much safer to use to clean my DivaCup than soap; especially antibacterial soap.</li>
            <li>But, make sure you only use a teeny tiny bit, and lather it up on your hands first.</li>
            <li>Long story short, I love the diva cup, and it is probably worth the money to buy the soap because it is so concentrated.</li>
            <li>the cup better than any other soap</li>
            <li>Although any gentle, unscented soap can be used to clean Diva Cups, something about having the wash made by the same company that made my Diva Cup makes me feel a lot more comfortable when I&#x27;m cleaning it, especially knowing that there&#x27;s no way this is going to break down the silicone.</li>
            <li>I think that the diva wash definitely gets the cup clean.</li>
            <li>The castile soap was also not getting my cup as clean as I thought it should, it left a foggy film (from the oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just use a pea sized amount on my finger and use that on my cup with a bit of water and it makes a decent amount of bubbles enough for me to clean the cup thoroughly.</li>
            <li>You can use any soap with the Diva Cup (given my personal experience) but this stuff is much more gentle than regular hand soap, so I like to use it when I can.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t have a wash that I thought was safe for my cup at home and didn&#x27;t want to risk using a soap that might mess with my pH balance.</li>
            <li>Bought new ones (again!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m amused that my menstrual cup cleanser works so well for my face and at pennies on the dollar over my previous favorite.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why people would complain about the scent, unless they are particular people.  </li>
            <li>You can only call them so many times before you feel like an calling in with the same problem over and over.</li>
            <li>I got the item quickly and it was packaged properly.</li>
            <li>The Divawash is a clear gel soap that has a subtle pleasant citrus smell.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to use with the DivaCup or even for your body.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wash to go along with the Diva Cup.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>This wash is highly concentrated, so even with the somewhat-hard water in my area</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap for cleaning your Diva cup.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy for the price; a bottle will last for a very long time if only used to wash the DivaCup.</li>
            <li>I use it for my Diva Cup, but also as a natural intimate gel.</li>
            <li>That really took care of the odor, however by the 30th time I emptied the cupi realized I was nearly out of wash.</li>
            <li>So far I really like it.</li>
            <li>Even though the bottle is expensive, it does work as a great wash.</li>
            <li>I would be sure the product would last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I love the narrow opening on the cap and the consistency of the wash -</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is really any better than just boiling it to sanitize.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a pretty big headache, but it could probably be fixed with more careful shipment.</li>
            <li>I used other soaps on my last diva cup and noticed it degraded very quickly, so when I bought a new one, I also bought the wash which has proven to be well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This wash is amazing, I must have put at least 6 pints of blood through that cup and the wash freshened it up like new.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clean all the stain off but at least I knew it was clean.</li>
            <li>Although I had to use a few more drops to get a good lather going compared to what I expected after reading others&#x27; reviews, I can already tell that this product is going to last me a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how little product is actually necessary to wash my menstrual cup out thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Not much I can say to be excited about it.</li>
            <li>However, the wash is extremely concentrated (you don&#x27;t even have to use the size of your pinky nail), and it leaves my Diva Cup free of odors.</li>
            <li>If you used this wash, throw it out and buy a new cup.</li>
            <li>This soap is great not only to clean the DivaCup, but also to wash your face or even fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li>I like that its gentle enough with no harsh chemicals or soaps but still strokg enough to clean.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, I was relived to discover that bleeding down there is a natural part of becoming a woman.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very gentle cleanser with multiple purposes.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to soaps and have had no problems with this since using a year ago.</li>
            <li>I have only used the diva cup for 1 cycle but having the wash makes my life easier because it&#x27;s less of a headache; I don&#x27;t have to ask myself if the cleanser I intend on using is suitable for my cup.</li>
            <li>It smells a little lemony but it does clean very well.</li>
            <li>No film or residue left on the cup; subtle, pleasant natural scent.  </li>
            <li>No harsh soaps for my DivaCup!  </li>
            <li>it only takes a tiny bit to clean the Diva Cup.  </li>
            <li>This diva wash is somewhat essential to having a clean, fresh diva cup that&#x27;ll last for a long time!</li>
            <li>Due to the fact that the diva cup is a silicone product, you are only supposed to use certain products to clean it so as not to ruin the integrity of the silicone.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a pump top which makes it less convenient.  </li>
            <li>I found it hard to find any soaps like this that are safe to use with a reusable menstrual cup....</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not necessary to use it every time you empty the DivaCup, I try to use a small amount once a day during my period to make sure it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>And it was really gentle, even if you have sensitive skin (which I definitely do).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented and mostly natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 4 years, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I added a dime size amount and washed it and was stuck rinsing for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for something like this in all natural stores in town, but haven&#x27;t had luck.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase this, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft and clear my skin is now.</li>
            <li>it is so soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a wash for my DivaCup and my 14 month old took it</li>
            <li>Obviously cleans the Diva Cup really well</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals,</li>
            <li>It seems like I don&#x27;t need to use much to was my cup so this should last me for a while.</li>
            <li>Their website offers a lot of FAQs and answered any questions I had about it.</li>
            <li>And the ingredients are all natural and pH balanced</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard if others using it as a facial cleanser as well because its supposed to be gentle on your skin</li>
            <li>good buy that does what it says and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird film on the cup which some soaps</li>
            <li>The wash is a little thick and goopy, not like other soaps but it lathers fine and it keeps my diva cup clean and odor free.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I usually only wash the cup with soap once a day when I&#x27;m using it, and just rinse it with hot hot water the other time.   </li>
            <li>I use one drop to clean my cup after each use and depending on your flow, that could go fast or slow.</li>
            <li>I only use 1/2 a pea size drop of soap to clean out the cup, so this stuff will last a long time!</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference in how long your diva cup lasts.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>This is a soap, just like some other products people are using, but it has very gentle ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I read several reviews about this cleaner before purchase and like many others said a little drop goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for other ladies looking to find a gentle wash for their diva cup that wont irritate!</li>
            <li>The other times, hot water is sufficient.</li>
            <li>A little pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li>The concentration is high enough though, that I&#x27;ve found you only need a drop when cleaning your Diva Cup (or even if your using it as body wash).</li>
            <li>Will last a long time - you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have soft water, you&#x27;ll definitely want to stick with this product!  </li>
            <li>Barely any scent.</li>
            <li>My first cup didn&#x27;t last as long as my second one has before become discolored and chalky.</li>
            <li>Turns out, you can use it as a regular soap for any sensitive skin needs.  </li>
            <li>I managed to make one bottle last for nearly 2 years.  </li>
            <li>The soap is gentle enough to be used to clean the cup, but is not recommended for internal use so it may cause some (very slight) irritation if any soap is left on the cup prior to insertion.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a long time too as long as you use the recommended amount (about a pea sized drop with hot water).</li>
            <li>I still wear liners with the cup because (added insurance) sometimes I don&#x27;t get the suction quite right and can leak a little</li>
            <li>I only need a small dollop to clean my cup</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure what the big deal is about using this instead of a gentle hand soap to clean the Diva Cup but other then that</li>
            <li>It also helps that I only use it for washing my cup and not for anything else, since it is a little costly, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It is true that a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li>first, I started not to buy it because I thought $10 was a little steep for 6 oz of soap.</li>
            <li>I just pour a little in, let it foam up and then rinse it out with really hot water.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t specifically used it on my skin yet, but after washing my diva cup and rinsing the soap off of my hands it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hands as much as normal soap can, especially around this time of year.</li>
            <li>In fact I read that it is rather unnatural for a real woman my age not to bleed down there.</li>
            <li>Cleans well, makes sudsy bubbles, smells fresh, a little goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t gunk up the diva cup, product is as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely sensitive in that area, so I was a little nervous about using it for the first time, but I had absolutely no issues.</li>
            <li>They say in the directions you only need a small amount for every use, and boy are they right.</li>

            <li> Love it :D</li>
            <li> Pleasant citrusy smell while using, with no lingering scent after.</li>
            <li> Does the job, gets sudsy, and is pleasant.</li>
            <li> It cleans the Divacup well and has a pleasant citrusy smell that doesn&#x27;t leave a fragrance on the cup itself.</li>
            <li> I opens the bottle as soon as it arrived and was pleasant</li>
            <li> but I need to give the bottle a good squeeze before anything comes out, and when it does I get a TON.</li>
            <li> It smells good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good stuff, it smells good</li>
            <li> so I keep it on the bathroom counter for a good week.  </li>
            <li> This is a good cleanser for my DivaCup.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather well and doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> It works well for that purpose and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, works great.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  </li>
            <li> We felt good about buying this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for balancing my ph! and clean my diva cup</li>
            <li> so this is a wonderful product to clean the DivaCup.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and clean smelling, cleans the cup well</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and gives great results.  </li>
            <li> I got the DivaWash after using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Mild Castile Soap for awhile, and realizing that castile soap IS NOT the best thing to use on a silicone cup.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Very light and citrusey!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with my Diva Cup and I am very glad that I did.</li>
            <li> good product, smells nice.</li>
            <li> Nice soap with no added scents, which is good.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome and is very gentle.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s great for traveling, since you can use it to clean your Diva Cup, your body, and your face!</li>
            <li> The diva wash does have a very light and pleasant scent to it.</li>
            <li> so I feel confident using it!</li>
            <li> y love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> First of all the Diva cup is the best invention for feminine products to date!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It smells great, not too strong.</li>
            <li> it has a great light smell to it.</li>
            <li> This product really does smell great!</li>
            <li> Does the job and smells nice.</li>
            <li> the Diva Wash. It smells good, has safe ingredients, cleans the diva cup well, and works well on the body.</li>
            <li> Cleans cup nicely.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice soap, but doesn&#x27;t get the stink out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s effective, and i&#x27;ve found no issues as of yet.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I received my wash from amazon and was able to give my diva cup a good through cleaning.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Nice citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I actually own a Lunette menstrual cup rather than the Divacup, but I have been using this cleanser to wash it.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, light citrus scent while washing and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or lingering scent.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent and does a good job of cleaning my menstrual cup without leaving a soapy residue.</li>
            <li> I love how you can use this cleanser for more than one thing!</li>
            <li> So, my Diva Wash arrived a day or two early which was awesome.</li>
            <li> It a light soap and smells really good.</li>
            <li> It smells nice too :)</li>
            <li> In case of sensitive reactions just perfect</li>
            <li> am so glad I did as this product was amazing.</li>
            <li> However, I will be looking for an alternative that is effective, but more cost efficient.</li>
            <li> it keeps my diva cup very clean, and nice scent too.&lt;br /&gt;bit pricy</li>
            <li> Hand soap never seemed good to clean it with.</li>
            <li> This product was advertised as being more effective and more hygienic than pads or tampons</li>
            <li> Pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> and it is gentle and me and my DIVA cup clean and happy!</li>
            <li> Cleans nicely and easily.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and price was good.</li>
            <li> The Diva Wash arrived in perfect condition before the expected arrival date and I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m going to need to buy refills of this soap more because I keep accidentally using more than I need.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t suds up like many soaps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Love this product ...</li>
            <li> I really love the DivaWash.</li>
            <li> When I was deciding how I would wash my Diva Cup, I made sure to buy something that would not deteriorate the product over time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got the Divawash.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product AND seller.</li>
            <li> and I got to say I love it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so soothing :)</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see mini/hotel-sized bottles of this product to stash in my purse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it...</li>
            <li> It was a bit more affordable than the others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy again. :)</li>
            <li> so I know it is safe to use.  </li>
            <li> This is much better.  </li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This cleaner works ok but does not eliminate all odor as described.</li>
            <li> but mine is more of a gel.</li>
            <li> Either way, I keep using it and it does ok but nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li> I waited six months to be sure before I posted this review.</li>
            <li> I began using this because I thought I should be doing more than just boiling the cup for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Nothing more is needed.  </li>
            <li> just now I tried once more and no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was more than satisfied :)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need more than a drop.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser ever!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I gave this stuff a whirl after my favorite cleanser stopped working for me</li>
            <li> My skin tone is even and I can&#x27;t stop touching my face</li>
            <li> so when I use the Divawash, I&#x27;m sure I will get a lot of use out of it.  </li>
            <li> and I found it works better than Summer&#x27;s Eve.</li>
            <li> When it does come out, I feel like I get more than needed</li>
            <li> I love this wash.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, light, citrus scent to it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather play it safe and use the stuff they recommend.</li>
            <li> Learn from my mistake :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Growing more concerned with my continual loss of blood from my area I decided to consult Web MD.</li>
            <li> I love my diva cup -</li>
            <li> and I am just about to order more.</li>
            <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t appealing to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lemongrass scent which isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li> but it does its job for the most part.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is much better to use for cleaninga your vulva as,regular body soap can cause infections.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower each day when I have my period, just to save time and make it more convenient than washing in the sink.</li>
            <li> This one won&#x27;t do that I tried it on my face out of curiosity and was amazed :)</li>
            <li> And I love how you can use it as hand wash also.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not terrible!!</li>
            <li> love a lot all i need is drop.</li>
            <li> : good investment is worth the quality, quantity and convenience.</li>
            <li> However, I like the scent and glad I bought this bottle with my diva cup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much (as advertised) and it leaves a pleasant but VERY light citrus odor.</li>
            <li> Keeps the cup nice and clean.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, it gets DivaCups clean, and you can use it to wash your body as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one bottle last me over a year now, and it does an excellent job of cleaning my Diva Cup in a safe, easy way.</li>
            <li> perfect in every way...it even lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> It really does a nice job cleaning the cup!</li>
            <li> worth buying it if you&#x27;re buying a cup!!</li>
            <li> which is great when it comes to your, ahem, more sensitive lady areas.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a great value.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product to clean my Diva Cup!</li>
            <li> Effectively and quickly cleans, rinses easily, and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> This was a nice smelling, gentle, cleanser that has done a great job keeping my Diva Cup clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to use with my Diva cup and it works great as far as cleaning goes.</li>
            <li> I am sure that goes doubly true for the NSA,  they just want to serve and protect us better.</li>
            <li> so I was able to place my order and have it shipped free to me in two days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is also great for cleansing adult novelty toys.</li>
            <li> It has natural emollients to keep your Diva Cup in good shape, and for the most part, most people do not have reactions to the ingredients in this product.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have a good soap to use for my diva cup</li>
            <li> I wish I could say that it is made from genuine unicorn, but not to worry, it is completely free from magical animal by-products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gentle, too, nice to know it&#x27;s safe to use elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend purchasing this wash with the diva cup.</li>
            <li> recommend it...also STRONGLY STRONGLY recommend the Diva Cup...</li>
            <li> Great scent and you barely need any product to wash your cup.</li>
            <li> It works just fine to wash your Diva Cup</li>
            <li> and I think it is just fine.</li>
            <li> It make the use of the diva cup so easy and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I think it works fine, although I dislike the smell.</li>
            <li> It has light scent that is easy on the nose.</li>
            <li> Light citrus sent.  </li>
            <li> So now I use a pea size amount and it gets it clean and rinses easy.</li>
            <li> The scent is light.</li>
            <li> Its scent free.</li>
            <li> I get a great lather off of a very tiny amount.</li>
            <li> It also has a citrus smell, not fragrance free as stated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was a great experience.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also great as a personal cleanser.</li>
            <li> After receiving my approval on my TANF application I decided to fly to Guatemala in order to make my final TRANsition into Denise.</li>
            <li> This stuff is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> There is some getting used to this product, figuring the suction out, and you have to be comfortable with yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightly citrusy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this works great for shower use or cup/toy use.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and citrusy use this all the time.</li>
            <li> Also, multi purposeful makes it more useful.</li>
            <li> It has a light lemony smell, so it is not scent-free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to know that it&#x27;s natural and safe to use with the DivaCup.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so this all natural cleaner is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It has a very fresh smell as well.  </li>
            <li> It has a really nice, light citrusy scent that is natural and very mild.</li>
            <li> Completely worth it!</li>
            <li> Probably worth it!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to rinse it very well!</li>
            <li> The first couple times it was OK but by the 12th time that day it began to smell a bit funky.</li>
            <li> I like the light scent, which is not overpowering, neutralizes odors, and quickly disappears.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my Diva Cup clean</li>
            <li> It makes my DivaCup clean</li>
            <li> My cup is as clean and odorless as the day I got it.</li>
            <li> if you use the diva cup it may be help you to clean it.</li>
            <li> From now on, I will be using this soap to clean my DivaCup.</li>
            <li> Gets the Diva cup clean and has a fruity smell I like.  </li>
            <li> I use this twice a day during my period (morning and night), when I clean out my diva cup.</li>
            <li> so i could clean it property.</li>
            <li> It keeps my cup clean and citrus-y</li>
            <li> no scent, but everything feels and looks clean.</li>
            <li> ( A clean one.)</li>
            <li> It gets my cup clean and smelling nice and fresh (unlike castile soap) and doesn&#x27;t really leave any residue.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it smells, like a very light lemon scent.</li>
            <li> When i started birth control i often got yeast infections but this really helped keep it clean :)</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this, light and fresh.  </li>
            <li> The thing about this soap is that you must make sure you rinse it THOROUGHLY, because the soap is very sudsy and you don&#x27;t want to leave any excess soap on the cup.</li>
            <li> I do like it, but I didn&#x27;t realize it didn&#x27;t suds much and therefore used more than I should have.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember much about those two days as I felt woozy for most of that time,  </li>
            <li> Its a good product, but i think soap and water will work just the same.</li>
            <li> and still i have a almost full bottle</li>
            <li> It fit nice and snug up there and not a single drop of blood leaked out.</li>
            <li> nothing super special about this wash.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t come up with a good way to clean those little vent holes at the top, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> Keeps the diva cup fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It fades away rather quickly, but does restore the freshness of the cup.</li>
            <li> and I can just use a mild soap to wash the cup rather than this.</li>
            <li> Diva International doesn&#x27;t outright say this, but after doing a bit of investigating, this is the most plausible explanation to me.</li>
            <li> The savings will be tremendous.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> it cleans well and has a mild scent, but does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li> It cleanses, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, has a nice light soap smell and is very gel like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new Diva Cup user and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this wash to go with my Cup.</li>
            <li> I am new to the idea of a menstrual cup, so I felt really safe washing it with this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I orderd this to go with my new diva cup.</li>
            <li> Then rinse the cup really well with hot water (when you think it&#x27;s rinsed, rinse it some more).</li>
            <li> I expect this bottle to last a long time, and believe it to be an excellent value.</li>
            <li> Be aware may decrease bladder capacity meaning may lead to lots of bathroom breaks if you drink a lot of water!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I need to clean my diva cup.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent which is totally fine.</li>
            <li> I thought it did a great job cleaning my cup and little</li>
            <li> I like this cleaner because it smells great but is made without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free and works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this stuff so far.</li>
            <li> I do not use it to wash my own body or face, even though it says you can, because I simply can&#x27;t afford to do that.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came in a larger size, but if this is all they have, then this is what I will continue to order.  </li>
            <li> Smells fresh</li>
            <li> I cannot say whether it well help keep politicians out of your uterus, vagina, etc., or help them from making fun of womens&#x27; &amp;#34;wherevers&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> you are going to go Diva, its worth adding to your cart</li>
            <li> fresh</li>
            <li> Fresh scent and all plant based</li>
            <li> DivaWash is a very gentle and mild cleanser for the DivaCup.  </li>
            <li> but really you just have to gauge whether this is the right product for you and how comfortable you are with the idea.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but I love having a good smelling, Ph balanced soap.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time too, which makes the price more justifiable.</li>
            <li> From there, you can determine if it is right for you.</li>
            <li> It does the job of getting the Diva Cup clean without much effort on your part.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had problems with using a regular antibacterial soap on my sex toys, or really any kind of soap for cleansing &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34;  This wash solved both of those problems, and it&#x27;s actually a great face wash as well, since it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have try many, many facial cleansers and they have all made me break out even the sensitive ones.</li>
            <li> Came in good condition and was exactly what I expected!  </li>
            <li> it got cloudy like others say and just wasn&#x27;t coming clean, no matter how hot the water or how much soap.</li>
            <li> The best part is you only need a little of the wash at a time</li>
            <li> The product is great, but I would rather find something a little cheaper at a health food store than pay so much for 6 oz.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel to hot right now</li>
            <li> The gel is quite thick so a pea sized drop or really all you need to clean your cup, which not only makes it easy to use but also makes it a great budget/ eco friendly product.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it to clean my cup and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen people complain about the price, but it&#x27;s super concentrated, so you don&#x27;t need much at all, either for cleaning the cup or yourself.</li>
            <li> this soap is extremely mild, yet still cleans it very well.</li>
            <li> This is very concentrated stuff, you really only need a drop and it bubbles up nicely.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for my Diva Cup for a couple years now and ignoring that little blurb about being good for the face.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> But I like supporting Diva Cup and what they stand for</li>
            <li> I use hot water and make sure there&#x27;s nothing left on it before I reinsert it or put it away.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily work any better than</li>
            <li> When I first got the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love this wash not only for the diva cup but for literally any part of my body.</li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I wondered if I would need to buy bottles often.</li>
            <li> so I ordered the DivaWash and just used it for the first time</li>
            <li> I got this because it was on sale for 2.50 at my local Sprouts :)</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned that I had made a misinformed decision by choosing to hire a Guatemalan  surgeon on the advice of cocktail waitress/lady of the evening</li>
            <li> As I signed in the first banner ad I saw was hawking a product which called it self a Diva cup.</li>
            <li> Thanks Diva Cup!</li>
            <li> I bought this Divawash because I had just bought my first menstrual cup ( the diva cup size 1)</li>
            <li> So I just decided to go ahead and order this as my first cup wash soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to go along with the Diva Cup that I bought which I love, this product does its job but for a alternative it seems to be the same as feminine wash.</li>
            <li> It literally gets the smell off and cleans it more thoroughly than regular soap because of the pH.</li>
            <li> When I first got my Diva Cup, I tried a variety of soaps on it.  </li>
            <li> Love this wash, definitely necessary when using a diva cup.</li>
            <li> Like, at least a year, if not closer to five years (assuming it doesn&#x27;t expire by then lol).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this divawash to anyone who wants to get their menstrual cup clean and keep your pH balance on the healthy side even if you don&#x27;t have the diva cup you can use it for a lot of other silicone menstrual cups.</li>
            <li> (very light scent, despite being unscented), product lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> This method is clean, safe, durable, less time consuming....</li>
            <li> Very useful if you have Diva Cup, and definitely worth a buy, if only just for the peace of mind that you won&#x27;t get an infection or ruin your cup.</li>
            <li> After that I tried to wash it really well with hot water</li>
            <li> It has a light, pleasant smell and a little of this wash goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I got this with the Divacup because I wanted to make sure that I had something that was definitely compatible with the material of the cup and safe to use on something that goes in such a sensitive place-</li>
            <li> py suprised that the unsented cleansing gel was indeed free from artificial perfumes but still had and amazing light fresh almost citrusy smell.</li>
            <li> Have not tried using it on my face because the idea of using the same cleaner for a vaginal item on my face just weirds me out, but I&#x27;ll take other&#x27;s people&#x27;s word for it when they say it&#x27;s even safe for the face. :)</li>
            <li> My hands are super soft after using this.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER oily hair and so far I&#x27;ve gone 3 days without washing it...</li>
            <li> free two day shipping was a life saver as I continued to bleed over those days and finally ran out of wash on the afternoon of the first day.</li>
            <li> super epic cleaner.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a light gel, so it&#x27;s easy to get out just a little.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and it is gentle on my hands, doesn&#x27;t leave a film and it doesn&#x27;t discolor or dry out the silicone.</li>
            <li> so I guess it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li> but it wasnt really working.</li>
            <li> It is also a really gentle cleanser for my 5-year-old who doesn&#x27;t always wipe well.</li>
            <li> I also used it in the boiling water to wash my diva cup with and much fresher smell.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, just with</li>
            <li> Gentle soap for the divacup, as described.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like that it is like a gel</li>
            <li> I absolutely agree with others that there is a ton of product for the $.</li>
            <li> I use just a drop because it can become very soapy.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend picking some up!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product however it doesn&#x27;t really remove the stained color of the cup after using it for over a year.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really all you need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very concentrated and works well.  </li>
            <li> I use this for the cup, intimate area, as well as the body.</li>
            <li> When I use this I do not feel as if the wash is loaded with perfumes, rather that it is cleans gently and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It really depends on your needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not irritating and does  the job well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s changed my period so much.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for anyone with a reusable menstrual cup, or someone who needs a gentle feminine wash.</li>
            <li> So glad they came out with a specific and natural wash.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and many products irritate my skin and leave it red.</li>
            <li> and I am glad i got it and its all natural especially because its for my mooncup</li>
            <li> This will be much safer to use to clean my DivaCup than soap; especially antibacterial soap.</li>
            <li> But, make sure you only use a teeny tiny bit, and lather it up on your hands first.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I love the diva cup, and it is probably worth the money to buy the soap because it is so concentrated.</li>
            <li> the cup better than any other soap</li>
            <li> Although any gentle, unscented soap can be used to clean Diva Cups, something about having the wash made by the same company that made my Diva Cup makes me feel a lot more comfortable when I&#x27;m cleaning it, especially knowing that there&#x27;s no way this is going to break down the silicone.</li>
            <li> I think that the diva wash definitely gets the cup clean.</li>
            <li> The castile soap was also not getting my cup as clean as I thought it should, it left a foggy film (from the oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just use a pea sized amount on my finger and use that on my cup with a bit of water and it makes a decent amount of bubbles enough for me to clean the cup thoroughly.</li>
            <li> You can use any soap with the Diva Cup (given my personal experience) but this stuff is much more gentle than regular hand soap, so I like to use it when I can.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t have a wash that I thought was safe for my cup at home and didn&#x27;t want to risk using a soap that might mess with my pH balance.</li>
            <li> Bought new ones (again!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m amused that my menstrual cup cleanser works so well for my face and at pennies on the dollar over my previous favorite.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people would complain about the scent, unless they are particular people.  </li>
            <li> You can only call them so many times before you feel like an calling in with the same problem over and over.</li>
            <li> I got the item quickly and it was packaged properly.</li>
            <li> The Divawash is a clear gel soap that has a subtle pleasant citrus smell.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to use with the DivaCup or even for your body.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wash to go along with the Diva Cup.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> This wash is highly concentrated, so even with the somewhat-hard water in my area</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap for cleaning your Diva cup.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy for the price; a bottle will last for a very long time if only used to wash the DivaCup.</li>
            <li> I use it for my Diva Cup, but also as a natural intimate gel.</li>
            <li> That really took care of the odor, however by the 30th time I emptied the cupi realized I was nearly out of wash.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> Even though the bottle is expensive, it does work as a great wash.</li>
            <li> I would be sure the product would last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I love the narrow opening on the cap and the consistency of the wash -</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is really any better than just boiling it to sanitize.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a pretty big headache, but it could probably be fixed with more careful shipment.</li>
            <li> I used other soaps on my last diva cup and noticed it degraded very quickly, so when I bought a new one, I also bought the wash which has proven to be well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This wash is amazing, I must have put at least 6 pints of blood through that cup and the wash freshened it up like new.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clean all the stain off but at least I knew it was clean.</li>
            <li> Although I had to use a few more drops to get a good lather going compared to what I expected after reading others&#x27; reviews, I can already tell that this product is going to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how little product is actually necessary to wash my menstrual cup out thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Not much I can say to be excited about it.</li>
            <li> However, the wash is extremely concentrated (you don&#x27;t even have to use the size of your pinky nail), and it leaves my Diva Cup free of odors.</li>
            <li> If you used this wash, throw it out and buy a new cup.</li>
            <li> This soap is great not only to clean the DivaCup, but also to wash your face or even fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I like that its gentle enough with no harsh chemicals or soaps but still strokg enough to clean.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, I was relived to discover that bleeding down there is a natural part of becoming a woman.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very gentle cleanser with multiple purposes.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to soaps and have had no problems with this since using a year ago.</li>
            <li> I have only used the diva cup for 1 cycle but having the wash makes my life easier because it&#x27;s less of a headache; I don&#x27;t have to ask myself if the cleanser I intend on using is suitable for my cup.</li>
            <li> It smells a little lemony but it does clean very well.</li>
            <li> No film or residue left on the cup; subtle, pleasant natural scent.  </li>
            <li> No harsh soaps for my DivaCup!  </li>
            <li> it only takes a tiny bit to clean the Diva Cup.  </li>
            <li> This diva wash is somewhat essential to having a clean, fresh diva cup that&#x27;ll last for a long time!</li>
            <li> Due to the fact that the diva cup is a silicone product, you are only supposed to use certain products to clean it so as not to ruin the integrity of the silicone.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a pump top which makes it less convenient.  </li>
            <li> I found it hard to find any soaps like this that are safe to use with a reusable menstrual cup....</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not necessary to use it every time you empty the DivaCup, I try to use a small amount once a day during my period to make sure it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> And it was really gentle, even if you have sensitive skin (which I definitely do).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented and mostly natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 4 years, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I added a dime size amount and washed it and was stuck rinsing for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this in all natural stores in town, but haven&#x27;t had luck.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft and clear my skin is now.</li>
            <li> it is so soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a wash for my DivaCup and my 14 month old took it</li>
            <li> Obviously cleans the Diva Cup really well</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals,</li>
            <li> It seems like I don&#x27;t need to use much to was my cup so this should last me for a while.</li>
            <li> Their website offers a lot of FAQs and answered any questions I had about it.</li>
            <li> And the ingredients are all natural and pH balanced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard if others using it as a facial cleanser as well because its supposed to be gentle on your skin</li>
            <li> good buy that does what it says and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird film on the cup which some soaps</li>
            <li> The wash is a little thick and goopy, not like other soaps but it lathers fine and it keeps my diva cup clean and odor free.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I usually only wash the cup with soap once a day when I&#x27;m using it, and just rinse it with hot hot water the other time.   </li>
            <li> I use one drop to clean my cup after each use and depending on your flow, that could go fast or slow.</li>
            <li> I only use 1/2 a pea size drop of soap to clean out the cup, so this stuff will last a long time!</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference in how long your diva cup lasts.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This is a soap, just like some other products people are using, but it has very gentle ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I read several reviews about this cleaner before purchase and like many others said a little drop goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for other ladies looking to find a gentle wash for their diva cup that wont irritate!</li>
            <li> The other times, hot water is sufficient.</li>
            <li> A little pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li> The concentration is high enough though, that I&#x27;ve found you only need a drop when cleaning your Diva Cup (or even if your using it as body wash).</li>
            <li> Will last a long time - you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have soft water, you&#x27;ll definitely want to stick with this product!  </li>
            <li> Barely any scent.</li>
            <li> My first cup didn&#x27;t last as long as my second one has before become discolored and chalky.</li>
            <li> Turns out, you can use it as a regular soap for any sensitive skin needs.  </li>
            <li> I managed to make one bottle last for nearly 2 years.  </li>
            <li> The soap is gentle enough to be used to clean the cup, but is not recommended for internal use so it may cause some (very slight) irritation if any soap is left on the cup prior to insertion.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time too as long as you use the recommended amount (about a pea sized drop with hot water).</li>
            <li> I still wear liners with the cup because (added insurance) sometimes I don&#x27;t get the suction quite right and can leak a little</li>
            <li> I only need a small dollop to clean my cup</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure what the big deal is about using this instead of a gentle hand soap to clean the Diva Cup but other then that</li>
            <li> It also helps that I only use it for washing my cup and not for anything else, since it is a little costly, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It is true that a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> first, I started not to buy it because I thought $10 was a little steep for 6 oz of soap.</li>
            <li> I just pour a little in, let it foam up and then rinse it out with really hot water.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t specifically used it on my skin yet, but after washing my diva cup and rinsing the soap off of my hands it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hands as much as normal soap can, especially around this time of year.</li>
            <li> In fact I read that it is rather unnatural for a real woman my age not to bleed down there.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, makes sudsy bubbles, smells fresh, a little goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t gunk up the diva cup, product is as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely sensitive in that area, so I was a little nervous about using it for the first time, but I had absolutely no issues.</li>
            <li> They say in the directions you only need a small amount for every use, and boy are they right.</li>
            <li> Two drops produces enough suds to thoroughly clean the cup, even in very hard water.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s gentle, and it&#x27;s concentrated enough that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is VERY concentrated---a little goes a LONG way  </li>
            <li> At that point I decided that Kotex was not for me.&lt;br /&gt;While pondering my next feminine care product selection I decided to jump onto Facebook for a quick game of Farmville.  </li>
            <li> however did not want to risk the item becoming sticky from the use of a wrong product.</li>
            <li> I bet it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> so I have diluted it and expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s see how long I can last without washing it.  </li>
            <li> I suspect it will last a long time</li>
            <li> One reason some people may have trouble with the other soap alternative mentioned in so many reviews here is because soap does not work well in hard water.  </li>
            <li> It will last a long time!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that sometimes too much comes out of the lid at one time.  </li>
            <li> I think this wash will last me a very long time!</li>
            <li> Lasta long time.</li>
            <li> it the wash would go a long way</li>
            <li> so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The bottle has a lot in it and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> product is super-concentrated and thick, so it does not take much to fully cleanse a cup.  </li>
            <li> I was a little wary of the purchase initially because the price seemed a little steep, but this stuff really is very concentrated and you only need one little drop to clean the entire DivaCup.</li>
            <li> I was using other soaps that left a residue and irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts you a long time!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as expected and came a day earlier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have heard from other users that without washing the Diva cup somehow it will discolor, so I use this a few times during my period and it&#x27;s still clear.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought this.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> As others have said, a little of this product goes a long way, and I expect this bottle to last me for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I knew something was odd after I began noticing my cup starting to look &amp;#34;cloudy,&amp;#34; as if it were being damaged in some way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough that it fits in my medicine cabinet and the packaging is discreet enough that I don&#x27;t have to worry about any of my roommates getting freaked out about &amp;#34;feminine wash&amp;#34; being in our medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the DivaWash wasn&#x27;t going to last very long between my little sister and me using it, but it&#x27;s actually quite concentrated and you only have to use a little bit to effectively clean the DivaCup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next morning I would be an oily stinky mess</li>
            <li> If you are new to the cup game, I would definitely suggest this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s concentrated so you only need a little bit to wash the Diva Cup.</li>
            <li> This works as expected.</li>
            <li> As expected and I didn&#x27;t have any issue or problem.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, it will last me quite a while, because every time I use it I only use a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> , sometimes it is hard to just get a small amount out, since you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent to it that is not heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a little drop goes a long way&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s concentrated so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like that it is concentrated so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I decided initially on Kotex over night with wings; however I would soon discover that this product failed to live up to the claims made on the packaging.</li>
            <li> All other soaps and products gave it an off smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it as a facial wash when my skin is irritated and breaking out, which usually corresponds with my period....</li>
            <li> and it can be used for other things beside the diva cup.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It only take a small amount</li>
            <li> other ladies?  </li>
            <li> I would suggest using this with the diva cup as opposed to other brands.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product to wash my DivaCup.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t really complain except to say that it&#x27;s somewhat expensive.   </li>
            <li> Man I was so relieved that I almost forgot to remove the negative Yelp review I left for Dr.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and needed something that would not be irritating.</li>
            <li> when I returned to the stated I began to bleed uncontrollably down there.</li>
            <li> Must have for keeping the diva cup properly cleaned, no smell and very thick, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and you only need a very small amount to wash your Divacup thoroughly.</li>
            <li> According to WebMD there exist various products which I may use to make this totally natural occurrence less inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much less hassle</li>
            <li> Silicone is similar to a lot of other rubbers (like latex) which can be broken down when it comes in contact with oil.</li>
            <li> and I just need to use a little amount because it is concentrated.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little easier when you have roommates.</li>
            <li> I just use a little at the end of the cycle and just rinse in between as suggested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you can use other soaps for washing the Diva Cup</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the wash or the diva cup, but there is nothing like an allergic reaction down THERE!</li>
            <li> A little expensive, though, so I won&#x27;t be buying it frequently.</li>
            <li> I was never able to do that with conventional shampoos.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was going to be devasted if suddenly the cup became irritating</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps me from rating this a 5/5 is that every time I order the DivaWash, the bottle is broken or leaking in some way.</li>
            <li> Without it we may never realize there are products out there that we never knew we wanted; if we have to give up a little bit of privacy for this type of convenience I say sign me up!</li>
            <li> Despite being touted as absorbent enough for all night wear it failed miserably to soak up all the blood and keep my intimates fresh and white.</li>
            <li> The only thing I find weird about it is the soaps consistency.</li>
            <li> For the past 3 months I don&#x27;t have any complaints with</li>
            <li> no overwhelming scent&lt;</li>
            <li> small bottle</li>
            <li> I love the Diva Cup but the wash is just awful.</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle</li>
            <li> and I think I still have at least half a bottle!</li>
            <li> It was terrible not using the cup at all for a few months and having to go back to the old methods.</li>
            <li> if you have hard water).   </li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, at least I hope it does.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little of the product to do the work!</li>
            <li> but there was only one helpful video the other videos had really stupid people talking about it.</li>
            <li> I have heard bad things about vagisil and,i honestly only want to stick with this.</li>
            <li> This bottle is small and it is difficult to manage the amount you use because it comes out in globs.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is very thick</li>
            <li> Broken  cap</li>
            <li> This product is irritating.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any issues using this cleaner with my DivaCup.</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to get it out of the bottle because it is so thick.  </li>
            <li> and I have never had a problem with it irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> So irritating.</li>
            <li> However, it is really expensive</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> i was wrong!</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lasta long time. Cleans.</li>
            <li> Smells great. It is exactly what I need to clean my diva cup. It&#x27;s soap. Not much I can say to be excited about it. I wish I could say that it is made from genuine unicorn, but not to worry, it is completely free from magical animal by-products. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend drinking it, even if it does smell like a creamsicle, I didn&#x27;t taste test it, but again... it&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and does the job as advertised.</li>
            <li> Washes up well. Works Great for others silicone products that need to be washed in a non oil based soap ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to use with my Diva cup and it works great as far as cleaning goes. It&#x27;s unscented and mostly natural. The only thing I find weird about it is the soaps consistency. It&#x27;s literally like jello. I only need a small dollop to clean my cup but I need to give the bottle a good squeeze before anything comes out, and when it does I get a TON. I feel like I&#x27;m going to need to buy refills of this soap more because I keep accidentally using more than I need. But I like supporting Diva Cup and what they stand for so I guess it doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li> Great scent and you barely need any product to wash your cup.</li>
            <li> Works great. Light citrus sent.  Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve used this for the DivaCup and for washing hands while handling it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year and I&#x27;m still not out!  It&#x27;s a great cleaner for the cup and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue which could lead to a UTI. Completely worth it!</li>
            <li> I read several reviews about this cleaner before purchase and like many others said a little drop goes a long way! It doesn&#x27;t suds up like many soaps but it cleans all the period gunk out of my diva cup perfectly. Due to the fact that the diva cup is a silicone product, you are only supposed to use certain products to clean it so as not to ruin the integrity of the silicone. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this stuff so far. I was a little wary of the purchase initially because the price seemed a little steep, but this stuff really is very concentrated and you only need one little drop to clean the entire DivaCup. It has a really nice, light citrusy scent that is natural and very mild. It fades away rather quickly, but does restore the freshness of the cup. I&#x27;m glad I bought this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. Two drops produces enough suds to thoroughly clean the cup, even in very hard water.</li>
            <li> Great multi-use product, I like to use it as a body wash. It has a subtle scent to it that is not heavily perfumed. Wish they had a bigger bottle though.</li>
            <li> I used the DivaCup without this for a while before giving in and buying the DivaWash. I&#x27;m really glad I got it. It smells good, it&#x27;s gentle, and it&#x27;s concentrated enough that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this initially because it came with my Diva Cup.  When I ran out, I just used hand soap (cringe) until my Amazon Order arrived, because of course you can&#x27;t buy it anywhere.  Like another review said, I believe the key is in thoroughly rinsing it.  I use hot water and make sure there&#x27;s nothing left on it before I reinsert it or put it away.  I like the light scent, which is not overpowering, neutralizes odors, and quickly disappears.  I like that it only takes a tiny bit to clean the Diva Cup.  I do not use it to wash my own body or face, even though it says you can, because I simply can&#x27;t afford to do that.  This is a soap, just like some other products people are using, but it has very gentle ingredients.  In some cases, people have allergic or irritant reactions to some of these ingredients, so if you&#x27;re not rinsing well, that may be why you experience discomfort.  You can find a list of ingredients here:  http://divacup.com/products/the-divawash/.  One reason some people may have trouble with the other soap alternative mentioned in so many reviews here is because soap does not work well in hard water.  Minerals in the water cling to the soap and leave a residue.  If you don&#x27;t have soft water, you&#x27;ll definitely want to stick with this product!  It has natural emollients to keep your Diva Cup in good shape, and for the most part, most people do not have reactions to the ingredients in this product.  It would be nice if it came in a larger size, but if this is all they have, then this is what I will continue to order.  I hope this is helpful!</li>
            <li> This will be much safer to use to clean my DivaCup than soap; especially antibacterial soap. I bet it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> Use this as a wash for my Diva Cup only. Love the scent and it is gentle on my hands, doesn&#x27;t leave a film and it doesn&#x27;t discolor or dry out the silicone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people would complain about the scent, unless they are particular people.  It just smells like citrus.  So what?</li>
            <li> Love this product ... A little pricy but worth it. No harmful chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> Keeps my Diva Cup clean so I feel confident using it!</li>
            <li> I got this with the Divacup because I wanted to make sure that I had something that was definitely compatible with the material of the cup and safe to use on something that goes in such a sensitive place- it&#x27;s good stuff, it smells good, it cleans well, I can&#x27;t really complain except to say that it&#x27;s somewhat expensive.   On the other hand, it will last me quite a while, because every time I use it I only use a very small amount.  Probably worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 4 years, and it works very well.  A bottle can last up to 2 years if you&#x27;re using the correct amount, which makes it a bargain as well.</li>
            <li> This product really does smell great! It makes my DivaCup clean and I just need to use a little amount because it is concentrated. Highly recommended to use with the DivaCup or even for your body.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my diva cup! So glad they came out with a specific and natural wash. Product came as described, no complaints with the seller!</li>
            <li> This is a good buy for the price; a bottle will last for a very long time if only used to wash the DivaCup. One drop is all it takes. Pleasant citrusy smell while using, with no lingering scent after. Happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> Cleans nicely and easily. A little goes a long way. I have very sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> y love it! it&#x27;s perfect for balancing my ph! and clean my diva cup great!&lt;br /&gt;and no harmful chemicals! yes!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend purchasing this wash with the diva cup. I accidentally fell asleep without removing my diva cup after 12 hrs. After that I tried to wash it really well with hot water but it wasnt really working. All other soaps and products gave it an off smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it away for the month then washed it with diva wash. It did the trick! My cup is as clean and odorless as the day I got it. Also, it is a great wash for the nether regions during that time of the month.</li>
            <li> Broken  cap the product is everywhere inside  the box!</li>
            <li> It works just fine to wash your Diva Cup but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily work any better than regular hand soap would work. Save your money and just use hand soap.</li>
            <li> I really love the DivaWash. I have very sensitive skin so this is a wonderful product to clean the DivaCup.</li>
            <li> When I was deciding how I would wash my Diva Cup, I made sure to buy something that would not deteriorate the product over time.  I tried to research what would be best, and decided to shell out the $11 to buy the Divawash- that way I would be sure the product would last a long time.  The way I figured- it the wash would go a long way and I would have peace of mind that it would not irritate me or the product.  It has a very fresh smell as well.  I&#x27;m glad I got the Divawash.</li>
            <li> Usefull, it helps to prevent the global warming... and help with the care of the enviroment. i like it. i already use it for and experiment with stem cells but you can use it for all the thinks i said. if you use the diva cup it may be help you to clean it.</li>
            <li> Works well. A little goes a long way so it will last a while. I tend to be &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; in that region and it didn&#x27;t irritate me at all. It didn&#x27;t clean all the stain off but at least I knew it was clean. Hand soap never seemed good to clean it with.</li>
            <li> This soap is great not only to clean the DivaCup, but also to wash your face or even fake eyelashes! I ruined my last DivaCup by using antibacterial soap and also soap with fragrance in it. From now on, I will be using this soap to clean my DivaCup. I only use 1/2 a pea size drop of soap to clean out the cup, so this stuff will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Does the job and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wash to go along with the Diva Cup.&lt;br /&gt;At first, I started not to buy it because I thought $10 was a little steep for 6 oz of soap. However, the wash is extremely concentrated (you don&#x27;t even have to use the size of your pinky nail), and it leaves my Diva Cup free of odors.</li>
            <li> So, my Diva Wash arrived a day or two early which was awesome. It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent which is totally fine. It&#x27;s concentrated so you only need a little bit to wash the Diva Cup. I absolutely love this product AND seller. The Diva Wash arrived in perfect condition before the expected arrival date and I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I love how you can use this cleanser for more than one thing! I mainly use it to clean my cup and it does the job. Sometimes I&#x27;ll wash my face with it and I got to say I love it. Smells fresh and it&#x27;s so soothing :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing I will NEVER use tampons again! This method is clean, safe, durable, less time consuming....I could go on and on!</li>
            <li> This wash is amazing! I use it for my Diva Cup as well as for washing my face and for care after sex. It is also a really gentle cleanser for my 5-year-old who doesn&#x27;t always wipe well.</li>
            <li> When I first got the [[ASIN:B000FAG6X0 Diva Cup Model 1 Pre-Childbirth]], I didn&#x27;t want to spend another 10 on the diva wash, so for a while I was using Aveeno unscented body wash. It was .... ok. It didn&#x27;t cause irritation or anything, but it didn&#x27;t seem like it was cleaning the cup that well. I think that the diva wash definitely gets the cup clean. But, make sure you only use a teeny tiny bit, and lather it up on your hands first. Then rinse the cup really well with hot water (when you think it&#x27;s rinsed, rinse it some more). Otherwise you might have some irritation because the soap is so concentrated (esp. if you have hard water).   Honestly, I usually only wash the cup with soap once a day when I&#x27;m using it, and just rinse it with hot hot water the other time.   Long story short, I love the diva cup, and it is probably worth the money to buy the soap because it is so concentrated. Just be sure to rinse it very well!</li>
            <li> I love this wash not only for the diva cup but for literally any part of my body. It doesn&#x27;t smell like feminine wash it has a great light smell to it.</li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I wondered if I would need to buy bottles often. The concentration is high enough though, that I&#x27;ve found you only need a drop when cleaning your Diva Cup (or even if your using it as body wash). And it was really gentle, even if you have sensitive skin (which I definitely do). Very useful if you have Diva Cup, and definitely worth a buy, if only just for the peace of mind that you won&#x27;t get an infection or ruin your cup.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it did restore the pH levels that give off that smell that we all know.  I also used it in the boiling water to wash my diva cup with and much fresher smell.  Wish they had a larger size, but it worked like it should.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning menstrual cups!  No film or residue left on the cup; subtle, pleasant natural scent.  I use it as a facial wash when my skin is irritated and breaking out, which usually corresponds with my period.... so I keep it on the bathroom counter for a good week.  I&#x27;d love to see mini/hotel-sized bottles of this product to stash in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is super-concentrated and thick, so it does not take much to fully cleanse a cup.  My only complaint is that sometimes too much comes out of the lid at one time.  However, I can see one bottle lasting an entire year!</li>
            <li> it keeps my diva cup very clean, and nice scent too.&lt;br /&gt;bit pricy i think. i wish they sell it in bigger container,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best...perfect in every way...it even lasts a long time...love it...recommend it...also STRONGLY STRONGLY recommend the Diva Cup...it is life changing in the best of ways...</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, a little goes a long way.  I like the scent of this, light and fresh.  It states on the bottle it can also be used as a face wash but I don&#x27;t anticipate using it as such.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the wash.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, at least I hope it does.  However, it is really expensive and I can just use a mild soap to wash the cup rather than this.</li>
            <li> This smells so good and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin!!! I like that it can multitask - washing diva cup and can be used as a facial cleanser or shower gel!!</li>
            <li> For the past 3 months I don&#x27;t have any complaints with the Diva Wash. It smells good, has safe ingredients, cleans the diva cup well, and works well on the body. I used other soaps on my last diva cup and noticed it degraded very quickly, so when I bought a new one, I also bought the wash which has proven to be well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This wash is excellent for your silicone menstrual cups! I cannot say whether it well help keep politicians out of your uterus, vagina, etc., or help them from making fun of womens&#x27; &amp;#34;wherevers&amp;#34;... @realdonaldtrump #periodsarenotaninsult</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It smells a little lemony but it does clean very well. I can see using this on your face or body as well as your divacup! Very pleased and will buy again!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my lunette cup. It was a bit more affordable than the others. It a light soap and smells really good. I&#x27;ll buy again. :)</li>
            <li> I like that this product is specifically designed for the diva cup so I know it is safe to use.  I was using other soaps that left a residue and irritated my skin.  This is much better.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a pump top which makes it less convenient.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s great, and I like the smell!</li>
            <li> Works great after you get used to it. Be aware may decrease bladder capacity meaning may lead to lots of bathroom breaks if you drink a lot of water!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for other ladies looking to find a gentle wash for their diva cup that wont irritate! Works very well, just with the bottle was larger!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have a good soap to use for my diva cup so I ordered the DivaWash and just used it for the first time, it&#x27;s great! Wonderful and clean smelling, cleans the cup well and it can be used for other things beside the diva cup. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I use this daily When TOM is in town and it is gentle and me and my DIVA cup clean and happy!</li>
            <li> I got the DivaWash after using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Mild Castile Soap for awhile, and realizing that castile soap IS NOT the best thing to use on a silicone cup. Castile soap is oil-based, and oil causes the silicone molecules in the cup to become unstable which may leach from the cup into your system. Silicone is similar to a lot of other rubbers (like latex) which can be broken down when it comes in contact with oil. I knew something was odd after I began noticing my cup starting to look &amp;#34;cloudy,&amp;#34; as if it were being damaged in some way. Diva International doesn&#x27;t outright say this, but after doing a bit of investigating, this is the most plausible explanation to me. The castile soap was also not getting my cup as clean as I thought it should, it left a foggy film (from the oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the DivaWash for several months now and I think it is just fine. It gets my cup clean and smelling nice and fresh (unlike castile soap) and doesn&#x27;t really leave any residue. The thing about this soap is that you must make sure you rinse it THOROUGHLY, because the soap is very sudsy and you don&#x27;t want to leave any excess soap on the cup. The soap is gentle enough to be used to clean the cup, but is not recommended for internal use so it may cause some (very slight) irritation if any soap is left on the cup prior to insertion.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  Gets the Diva cup clean and has a fruity smell I like.  You have to use a tiny amount, and rinse well.  The first time I used it, I added a dime size amount and washed it and was stuck rinsing for a long time.  So now I use a pea size amount and it gets it clean and rinses easy.</li>
            <li> Gentle soap for the divacup, as described.</li>
            <li> This is a good cleanser for my DivaCup. The scent is light. Don&#x27;t really like that it is like a gel, sometimes it is hard to just get a small amount out, since you don&#x27;t need to use much. Other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> Cleans cup nicely. Doesn&#x27;t lather well and doesn&#x27;t smell good. After its gone I&#x27;ll just use hand soap for cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought this to wash my Diva Cup and it&#x27;s a great cleaner. It&#x27;s such a big bottle for the tiny amount you actually use each cycle so it lasts you a long time!</li>
            <li> I absolutely agree with others that there is a ton of product for the $. I bought the Divawash 10 months ago, and looks like there is about a quarter left. It takes very little of the product to do the work! I love the narrow opening on the cap and the consistency of the wash - it&#x27;s like a light gel, so it&#x27;s easy to get out just a little. I use it for my Diva Cup, but also as a natural intimate gel. I have been looking for something like this in all natural stores in town, but haven&#x27;t had luck. Divawash is perfect!!! I will definitely buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> You can use any soap with the Diva Cup (given my personal experience) but this stuff is much more gentle than regular hand soap, so I like to use it when I can.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, makes sudsy bubbles, smells fresh, a little goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t gunk up the diva cup, product is as described.</li>
            <li> This cleaner works ok but does not eliminate all odor as described. The description also read like it was a liquid but mine is more of a gel. Maybe I got a bad batch? Either way, I keep using it and it does ok but nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li> I waited six months to be sure before I posted this review. This product is irritating. I began using this because I thought I should be doing more than just boiling the cup for 3 minutes. I was wrong. That&#x27;s all that is required to sterilize. Nothing more is needed.  The months where I did use this wash I had to repeatedly call Dr.s office. You can only call them so many times before you feel like an calling in with the same problem over and over. The months I didn&#x27;t use this I had no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to be devasted if suddenly the cup became irritating which meant I could no longer use it. It was terrible not using the cup at all for a few months and having to go back to the old methods. I stopped using the cup. Bought new ones (again!) just now I tried once more and no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not let this wash ruin your Diva Experience! If you used this wash, throw it out and buy a new cup.</li>
            <li> I like that its gentle enough with no harsh chemicals or soaps but still strokg enough to clean. It smells nice too :)</li>
            <li> I like the Diva Cup wash. Its scent free. I use just a drop because it can become very soapy. I haven&#x27;t had any irritation.</li>
            <li> when i got this in the mail it had busted inside of the box, so i emailed the company and they refunded me the entire price including shipping the same day. i was more than satisfied :)</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is really any better than just boiling it to sanitize. but it&#x27;s a little easier when you have roommates. I just use a little at the end of the cycle and just rinse in between as suggested. i haven&#x27;t had any irritation or problems so i guess it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I thought this was probably just a gimmick, but after having a DivaCup for about a year I decided to give it a try. It really does a nice job cleaning the cup! It&#x27;s all shiny now! I still haven&#x27;t come up with a good way to clean those little vent holes at the top, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome as a face wash too! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause breakouts and best of all, it washes my mascara off with one rinse!</li>
            <li> Works really well. Cleans my DivaCup well. Not really necessary though, because soap and water also work.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any issues using this cleaner with my DivaCup. It is true that a little bit goes a long way so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to be buying a refill for quite a while. Great cleaner. Have not tried using it on my face because the idea of using the same cleaner for a vaginal item on my face just weirds me out, but I&#x27;ll take other&#x27;s people&#x27;s word for it when they say it&#x27;s even safe for the face. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Diva cup.  The cleanser is very thick so I have diluted it and expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Lathers well. You don&#x27;t need more than a drop. Rinses well too and smells very pleasant. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the DivaWash wasn&#x27;t going to last very long between my little sister and me using it, but it&#x27;s actually quite concentrated and you only have to use a little bit to effectively clean the DivaCup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with the amount for the price. It&#x27;s also nice to know that it&#x27;s natural and safe to use with the DivaCup. I would highly recommend picking some up!</li>
            <li> I feel safer using this than any soap I might have at home.  Does the job, gets sudsy, and is pleasant.</li>
            <li> My hands are super soft after using this. Also, it smells nice. A little expensive, though, so I won&#x27;t be buying it frequently.</li>
            <li> The cleaner works well. Smells like citrus to me. A little of the product goes a long way. Pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works great! No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I do like it, but I didn&#x27;t realize it didn&#x27;t suds much and therefore used more than I should have.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and gives great results.  It does the job of getting the Diva Cup clean without much effort on your part.  I just pour a little in, let it foam up and then rinse it out with really hot water.  Works great!!</li>
            <li> This wash is highly concentrated, so even with the somewhat-hard water in my area I get a great lather off of a very tiny amount. It&#x27;s amazing how little product is actually necessary to wash my menstrual cup out thoroughly. I expect this bottle to last a long time, and believe it to be an excellent value. No irritation issues or soap residue whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Works great! I use it with the Divacup, a great piece of ingenuity. Makes life easier and cheaper. Great products.</li>
            <li> Very gentle. Barely any scent. great for my divacup!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice soap, but doesn&#x27;t get the stink out. Rubbing alcohol and the sun with best for that</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this, but I was pleasantly surprised. A little goes a long way! A must have for the Diva Cup.  It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave a soapy residue.</li>
            <li> Smells great (very light scent, despite being unscented), product lasts a surprisingly long time. I use this twice a day during my period (morning and night), when I clean out my diva cup. It really does make a difference in how long your diva cup lasts. My first cup didn&#x27;t last as long as my second one has before become discolored and chalky.</li>
            <li> This was a nice smelling, gentle, cleanser that has done a great job keeping my Diva Cup clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This soap is great for the diva cup.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product however it doesn&#x27;t really remove the stained color of the cup after using it for over a year.</li>
            <li> no overwhelming scent&lt;br /&gt;rinses the cup better than any other soap&lt;br /&gt;not necessary for each rinse, but i would do it at the end of each day&lt;br /&gt;a little drop goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good buy that does what it says and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird film on the cup which some soaps do.&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to go Diva, its worth adding to your cart</li>
            <li> I use this for everything!  I LOVE it is a shampoo...I have SUPER oily hair and so far I&#x27;ve gone 3 days without washing it...let&#x27;s see how long I can last without washing it.  I was never able to do that with conventional shampoos.  The next morning I would be an oily stinky mess lol  When I run out of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castille soap I use this instead as a body wash.  I also use it as a face wash.  I don&#x27;t use the diva cup...never have tried it..too scared.  I got this because it was on sale for 2.50 at my local Sprouts :)</li>
            <li> Just perfect!!! It make the use of the diva cup so easy and comfortable. In case of sensitive reactions just perfect</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser ever!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for my Diva Cup for a couple years now and ignoring that little blurb about being good for the face. My skin is extremely sensitive and many products irritate my skin and leave it red. I can&#x27;t even wear makeup to cover it because it worsens it. I would never dream of using a foaming cleanser... The horror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I gave this stuff a whirl after my favorite cleanser stopped working for me and I was in a bind. I can&#x27;t believe how soft and clear my skin is now. My skin tone is even and I can&#x27;t stop touching my face it is so soft. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face for 3 weeks now and it just keeps getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amused that my menstrual cup cleanser works so well for my face and at pennies on the dollar over my previous favorite. I only have to use a BB size amount of this stuff. The savings will be tremendous. Swoon.</li>
            <li> This bottle is small and it is difficult to manage the amount you use because it comes out in globs. It also has a citrus smell, not fragrance free as stated.</li>
            <li> it smells great and I am glad i got it and its all natural especially because its for my mooncup</li>
            <li> I read another review that suggested to only use a dab for the diva cup and yah that&#x27;s really all you need. This could probably last me a couple of months or a year if I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> this product is great, it smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, nothing remarkable about it.</li>
            <li> great!! no complaints.</li>
            <li> great cleaning wash, no smells, no colors</li>
            <li> This is a great seller! I got the item quickly and it was packaged properly. Also it was as described! It definitely does its job in cleaning. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it was a great experience.</li>
            <li> however did not want to risk the item becoming sticky from the use of a wrong product. so still on a trial basis.  Angie</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! I&#x27;ve had this stuff for almost a year and I still have some left! Menstrual cups are small, so you really don&#x27;t need alot of this stuff to wash it! Works great and there&#x27;s no irritation! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a wash for my DivaCup and my 14 month old took it and I took it back and hid it from him and now I can&#x27;t find it.  I am using regular soap to wash my DivaCup out now.  It only take a small amount so when I use the Divawash, I&#x27;m sure I will get a lot of use out of it.  Now if I can only find it...</li>
            <li> Obviously cleans the Diva Cup really well (btw, 200% recommend Diva Cup... best menstrual decision I&#x27;ve ever made), but it&#x27;s also great as a personal cleanser. No harsh chemicals, and I found it works better than Summer&#x27;s Eve. I&#x27;m extremely sensitive in that area, so I was a little nervous about using it for the first time, but I had absolutely no issues. Very pleasant citrus smell. I&#x27;ve seen people complain about the price, but it&#x27;s super concentrated, so you don&#x27;t need much at all, either for cleaning the cup or yourself. Definitely won&#x27;t be going back to anything else.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I bought the was just for washing my Diva Cup, but it makes an excellent hand soap! It doesn&#x27;t foam like I thought it would, but the smell is awesome. Very light and citrusey! It&#x27;s very refreshing. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face yet, but I have another wash for that. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product is really wonderful.  I bought it at the same time as the diva cup, which I&#x27;ve had for 6 months now.  The bottle isn&#x27;t even a third gone.  It&#x27;s very concentrated and works well.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend getting it when ordering the diva cup!</li>
            <li> I have heard from other users that without washing the Diva cup somehow it will discolor, so I use this a few times during my period and it&#x27;s still clear. It&#x27;s really gentle, too, nice to know it&#x27;s safe to use elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to get it out of the bottle because it is so thick.  When it does come out, I feel like I get more than needed so I&#x27;m being wasteful.</li>
            <li> I love this wash. It has a nice, light, citrus scent to it.</li>
            <li> I think it works fine, although I dislike the smell. It&#x27;s similar to an orange cough syrup.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this for the cup, intimate area, as well as the body. When I use this I do not feel as if the wash is loaded with perfumes, rather that it is cleans gently and thoroughly. The best part is you only need a little of the wash at a time so it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cleaner along with my DivaCup. While it&#x27;s not necessary to use it every time you empty the DivaCup, I try to use a small amount once a day during my period to make sure it&#x27;s clean. The other times, hot water is sufficient. I like this cleaner because it smells great but is made without harsh chemicals. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> nothing super special about this wash. does what it says. it&#x27;s effective, and i&#x27;ve found no issues as of yet.</li>
            <li> Came in good condition and was exactly what I expected!  I&#x27;m not sure if you can use other soaps for washing the Diva Cup but I&#x27;d rather play it safe and use the stuff they recommend.</li>
            <li> Works as needed and as described. BUT PLEASE BOIL YOUR DIVA CUP EVERY MONTH!  I did not know you were supposed to do that and even with this Diva Wash I encountered issues by not boiling it.  Sanitizing the cup is a must.  Learn from my mistake :)</li>
            <li> After receiving my approval on my TANF application I decided to fly to Guatemala in order to make my final TRANsition into Denise. The operation went swimmingly except when I returned to the stated I began to bleed uncontrollably down there. At first I was concerned that I had made a misinformed decision by choosing to hire a Guatemalan  surgeon on the advice of cocktail waitress/lady of the evening but I guess what&#x27;s done was done.&lt;br /&gt;Growing more concerned with my continual loss of blood from my area I decided to consult Web MD. I searched the terms &#x27;bleeding&#x27;, &#x27;private area&#x27;, and &#x27;became a woman&#x27;. To my surprise, I was relived to discover that bleeding down there is a natural part of becoming a woman. In fact I read that it is rather unnatural for a real woman my age not to bleed down there. Man I was so relieved that I almost forgot to remove the negative Yelp review I left for Dr.Gurerra&#x27;s clinca de medicino y bodega.  Gracias Dr. Gurerra. According to WebMD there exist various products which I may use to make this totally natural occurrence less inconvenient.  I decided initially on Kotex over night with wings; however I would soon discover that this product failed to live up to the claims made on the packaging. Despite being touted as absorbent enough for all night wear it failed miserably to soak up all the blood and keep my intimates fresh and white. At that point I decided that Kotex was not for me.&lt;br /&gt;While pondering my next feminine care product selection I decided to jump onto Facebook for a quick game of Farmville.  As I signed in the first banner ad I saw was hawking a product which called it self a Diva cup. This product was advertised as being more effective and more hygienic than pads or tampons so I figured what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did as this product was amazing. It fit nice and snug up there and not a single drop of blood leaked out. I would also like to give a shout out to Facebook and how they monitor our Webusage in the background. Without it we may never realize there are products out there that we never knew we wanted; if we have to give up a little bit of privacy for this type of convenience I say sign me up! I am sure that goes doubly true for the NSA,  they just want to serve and protect us better. I digress though.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I found with the Diva cup is that I have to keep emptying it. The first couple times it was OK but by the 12th time that day it began to smell a bit funky. The included instructions stated that the diva cup should be washed with the included diva cup wash each time i emptied it. That really took care of the odor, however by the 30th time I emptied the cupi realized I was nearly out of wash. Lucky for me I have amazon prime so I was able to place my order and have it shipped free to me in two days.&lt;br /&gt;That free two day shipping was a life saver as I continued to bleed over those days and finally ran out of wash on the afternoon of the first day. I don&#x27;t remember much about those two days as I felt woozy for most of that time,  does that happen to any of you other ladies?  Anyways, I received my wash from amazon and was able to give my diva cup a good through cleaning. This wash is amazing, I must have put at least 6 pints of blood through that cup and the wash freshened it up like new. Definitely recommend it. I don&#x27;t feel to hot right now so I think I am going to hit hit submit and lay dow</li>
            <li> The Divawash is a clear gel soap that has a subtle pleasant citrus smell. It works well at neutralizing odors.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with my diva cup so i could clean it property. Its a good product, but i think soap and water will work just the same.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as expected and came a day earlier than I expected.  Using it to cleanse diva cup.</li>
            <li> I actually stopped using my cup by the time I got this so I&#x27;ve been using it as shave gel. It works well for that purpose and it smells good.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been holding off on buying the wash because i thought just using soap and water would work.. i was wrong! it got cloudy like others say and just wasn&#x27;t coming clean, no matter how hot the water or how much soap. just a dab will do ya, so it&#x27;ll last awhile. worth buying it if you&#x27;re buying a cup!!</li>
            <li> The wash is a little thick and goopy, not like other soaps but it lathers fine and it keeps my diva cup clean and odor free. I don&#x27;t have to use much (as advertised) and it leaves a pleasant but VERY light citrus odor. I haven&#x27;t specifically used it on my skin yet, but after washing my diva cup and rinsing the soap off of my hands it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hands as much as normal soap can, especially around this time of year. I will buy this again whenever I run out.</li>
            <li> First of all the Diva cup is the best invention for feminine products to date! I love my diva cup - this soap is extremely mild, yet still cleans it very well. I&#x27;ve had it for almost a year and I am just about to order more. Thanks Diva Cup!</li>
            <li> I bought this along with my Diva Cup and I am very glad that I did. It keeps my cup clean and citrus-y fresh and I have never had a problem with it irritating my skin. It lasts for a long time too as long as you use the recommended amount (about a pea sized drop with hot water). I&#x27;ve had the same wash for over a year now and I think I still have at least half a bottle! It also helps that I only use it for washing my cup and not for anything else, since it is a little costly, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> good product, smells nice. small bottle</li>
            <li> Works great, all-natural. Smells nice. I use it for The Diva Cup only.&lt;br /&gt;BUY THE DIVA CUP. BUY THE DIVA CUP.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap. It cleans, it works.</li>
            <li> I use Diva Cup for my &#x27;girl time&#x27; and this ph balanced wash is made for it. It has a light, pleasant smell and a little of this wash goes a long way. This is also great for cleansing adult novelty toys.</li>
            <li> No harsh soaps for my DivaCup!  This stuff is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Use this for cleaning my Diva Cup obviously... It smells great, not too strong. Gets the job done.  Love it :D</li>
            <li> This works as expected. It seems like I don&#x27;t need to use much to was my cup so this should last me for a while.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so this all natural cleaner is wonderful. I use it on my Diva cup every day</li>
            <li> So irritating. I love the Diva Cup but the wash is just awful.</li>
            <li> Cleans menstrual cups well.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with my cup. The fragrance isn&#x27;t appealing to me. It&#x27;s a lemongrass scent which isn&#x27;t my favorite but it does its job for the most part. It does not remove the scent nor discoloration of the cup so I recommend boiling the cup after your cycle ends.</li>
            <li> Very gentle cleanser with multiple purposes.  Great Orange scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wash along with my DivaCup and I think that it&#x27;s a great wash. However, I will be looking for an alternative that is effective, but more cost efficient. I use one drop to clean my cup after each use and depending on your flow, that could go fast or slow. It really depends on your needs. The product is great, but I would rather find something a little cheaper at a health food store than pay so much for 6 oz. If you are new to the cup game, I would definitely suggest this product. From there, you can determine if it is right for you.</li>
            <li> It works great for cleaning my DivaCup. It has a pleasant, light citrus scent while washing and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or lingering scent. You only need a drop for each wash, I can see this lasting forever.</li>
            <li> A must to have with your diva cup!</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local grocery store and my,first menstrual cup about a year ago! I love this stuff, it is much better to use for cleaninga your vulva as,regular body soap can cause infections. I have heard bad things about vagisil and,i honestly only want to stick with this. When i started birth control i often got yeast infections but this really helped keep it clean :)</li>
            <li> Nice soap with no added scents, which is good. Used it on my DivaCup and my face. Works well for both.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure what the big deal is about using this instead of a gentle hand soap to clean the Diva Cup but other then that, it works. It cleanses, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, has a nice light soap smell and is very gel like.</li>
            <li> DivaWash is a very gentle and mild cleanser for the DivaCup.  I am very sensitive to soaps and have had no problems with this since using a year ago. It is VERY concentrated---a little goes a LONG way  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> super epic cleaner. no scent, but everything feels and looks clean.</li>
            <li> Great wash to use with your DivaCup. Smells nice, works great. Will last a long time - you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> Nice citrus smell. It is a small bottle but it&#x27;s concentrated. It will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I actually own a Lunette menstrual cup rather than the Divacup, but I have been using this cleanser to wash it.  So far I really like it. It has a nice light scent and does a good job of cleaning my menstrual cup without leaving a soapy residue. I&#x27;ve just ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> Worked great! A little pricey, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a great compliment to the diva cup. The diva wash does have a very light and pleasant scent to it. Keeps the diva cup fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It cleans the Divacup well and has a pleasant citrusy smell that doesn&#x27;t leave a fragrance on the cup itself. It&#x27;s not irritating and does  the job well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap for cleaning your Diva cup. It has light scent that is easy on the nose. It&#x27;s concentrated so a little goes a long way. Keeps the cup nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do. I would suggest using this with the diva cup as opposed to other brands.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and needed something that would not be irritating. it cleans well and has a mild scent, but does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li> Love it. Second time around ordering this product. It&#x27;s changed my period so much. It&#x27;s so much less hassle and I don&#x27;t have to bother with anything over my 10 hour shift at work. There is some getting used to this product, figuring the suction out, and you have to be comfortable with yourself. Their website offers a lot of FAQs and answered any questions I had about it. I also watched a YouTube video but there was only one helpful video the other videos had really stupid people talking about it. (One girl went back to tampons and changed her tampon every time she peed...like obviously she doesn&#x27;t know how her body works) but really you just have to gauge whether this is the right product for you and how comfortable you are with the idea. Idk but it weirds some people out.&lt;br /&gt;P.s. I still wear liners with the cup because (added insurance) sometimes I don&#x27;t get the suction quite right and can leak a little but it still nothing compared to how a tampon can sometimes leak.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but I love having a good smelling, Ph balanced soap.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time too, which makes the price more justifiable.</li>
            <li> Diva cup wash arrived the day after I purchased it on 08/06/2014.  The product was exactly what I expected.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> I bought this Divawash because I had just bought my first menstrual cup ( the diva cup size 1) and I really didn&#x27;t have a wash that I thought was safe for my cup at home and didn&#x27;t want to risk using a soap that might mess with my pH balance. So I just decided to go ahead and order this as my first cup wash soap. I really like the way it smells, like a very light lemon scent. I just use a pea sized amount on my finger and use that on my cup with a bit of water and it makes a decent amount of bubbles enough for me to clean the cup thoroughly.I think this wash will last me a very long time! I would recommend this divawash to anyone who wants to get their menstrual cup clean and keep your pH balance on the healthy side even if you don&#x27;t have the diva cup you can use it for a lot of other silicone menstrual cups.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this for her Diva cup. Shipped quickly and price was good.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have had problems with using a regular antibacterial soap on my sex toys, or really any kind of soap for cleansing &amp;#34;down there.&amp;#34;  This wash solved both of those problems, and it&#x27;s actually a great face wash as well, since it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  I plan to use it with my Ladycup, but I&#x27;m still waiting on it in the mail.  As others have said, a little of this product goes a long way, and I expect this bottle to last me for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I knew I would need to buy this product when I got my Divacup and I&#x27;m glad I did. I found it hard to find any soaps like this that are safe to use with a reusable menstrual cup.... so I really only trusted this product.&lt;br /&gt;It works well and you only need a very small amount to wash your Divacup thoroughly. It smells great too! I use it in the shower each day when I have my period, just to save time and make it more convenient than washing in the sink. Would recommend for anyone with a reusable menstrual cup, or someone who needs a gentle feminine wash.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product to use with the Diva Cup or any menstrual cup.  Good quality.  Only takes a dab.  Product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> DivaWash is wonderful. It smells nice, it gets DivaCups clean, and you can use it to wash your body as well. The only thing that keeps me from rating this a 5/5 is that every time I order the DivaWash, the bottle is broken or leaking in some way. That&#x27;s a pretty big headache, but it could probably be fixed with more careful shipment.</li>
            <li> This is a very good cleaner for your DivaCup. I like how it feels and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product to wash my DivaCup.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my diva cup.  Fresh scent and all plant based/organic!</li>
            <li> it cleans well. smells great. will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to go along with the Diva Cup that I bought which I love, this product does its job but for a alternative it seems to be the same as feminine wash.</li>
            <li> Yes it is perfect for the diva cup but it is also perfect for your face! I have try many, many facial cleansers and they have all made me break out even the sensitive ones. This one won&#x27;t do that I tried it on my face out of curiosity and was amazed :)</li>
            <li> I thought it did a great job cleaning my cup and little did I realize when I bought it, that you could wash your face with it also! (Though I have yet to do that since I have another product that I like to use). But it&#x27;s great for cleaning your cup!</li>
            <li> This diva wash is somewhat essential to having a clean, fresh diva cup that&#x27;ll last for a long time! It literally gets the smell off and cleans it more thoroughly than regular soap because of the pH. And I love how you can use it as hand wash also.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the wash or the diva cup, but there is nothing like an allergic reaction down THERE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new Diva Cup user and I&#x27;m so glad I bought this wash to go with my Cup. It&#x27;s small enough that it fits in my medicine cabinet and the packaging is discreet enough that I don&#x27;t have to worry about any of my roommates getting freaked out about &amp;#34;feminine wash&amp;#34; being in our medicine cabinet. Plus, it&#x27;s great for traveling, since you can use it to clean your Diva Cup, your body, and your face! Although any gentle, unscented soap can be used to clean Diva Cups, something about having the wash made by the same company that made my Diva Cup makes me feel a lot more comfortable when I&#x27;m cleaning it, especially knowing that there&#x27;s no way this is going to break down the silicone. If you have a Diva Cup, I definitely recommend getting this wash as well!</li>
            <li> Must have for keeping the diva cup properly cleaned, no smell and very thick, a little goes a long way. I suspect it will last a long time</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells awesome and is very gentle.  I like that it is concentrated so a little goes a long way.  And the ingredients are all natural and pH balanced which is great when it comes to your, ahem, more sensitive lady areas.  I am new to the idea of a menstrual cup, so I felt really safe washing it with this product. Turns out, you can use it as a regular soap for any sensitive skin needs.  I am very happy with my wash- it does make me feel like a Diva! ( A clean one.)</li>
            <li> When I first got my Diva Cup, I tried a variety of soaps on it.  I finally broke down and bought this.  I managed to make one bottle last for nearly 2 years.  It is that concentrated. I just wish it opened another way.</li>
            <li> This is a great wash, keeps my Diva Cup in great condition. I&#x27;m not head-over-heels for the smell...but it&#x27;s not terrible!! It&#x27;s lightly citrusy. A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s a great value.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is very concentrated stuff, you really only need a drop and it bubbles up nicely. I&#x27;ve had one bottle last me over a year now, and it does an excellent job of cleaning my Diva Cup in a safe, easy way.</li>
            <li> Effectively and quickly cleans, rinses easily, and leaves no residue. Plus it smells fresh and clean. I will continue using this product to clean my Diva Cup!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I orderd this to go with my new diva cup. I opens the bottle as soon as it arrived and was pleasant py suprised that the unsented cleansing gel was indeed free from artificial perfumes but still had and amazing light fresh almost citrusy smell. They say in the directions you only need a small amount for every use, and boy are they right. The gel is quite thick so a pea sized drop or really all you need to clean your cup, which not only makes it easy to use but also makes it a great budget/ eco friendly product. You can also use this as a body/face wash,which I have not done, but in an emergency I would not hesitate to use it.</li>
            <li> It worked well and arrived on time. We felt good about buying this product.</li>
            <li> love a lot all i need is drop. i got it in febuary until now august 4th and still i have a almost full bottle</li>
            <li> Love this wash, definitely necessary when using a diva cup.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this works great for shower use or cup/toy use. The scent is light and citrusy use this all the time.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts forever! I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a cleanser for the diva cup model 1 I purchased. I have only used the diva cup for 1 cycle but having the wash makes my life easier because it&#x27;s less of a headache; I don&#x27;t have to ask myself if the cleanser I intend on using is suitable for my cup. Although I had to use a few more drops to get a good lather going compared to what I expected after reading others&#x27; reviews, I can already tell that this product is going to last me a long time. Like, at least a year, if not closer to five years (assuming it doesn&#x27;t expire by then lol). I&#x27;ve heard if others using it as a facial cleanser as well because its supposed to be gentle on your skin but I haven&#x27;t tried that so I can&#x27;t speak for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: good investment is worth the quality, quantity and convenience. Also, multi purposeful makes it more useful.</li>
            <li> This actually Lathers like a liquid soap would. It&#x27;s fragrance free and works really well. The bottle has a lot in it and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> As expected and I didn&#x27;t have any issue or problem.  I am very happy with the purchase and would buy again</li>
            <li> Even though the bottle is expensive, it does work as a great wash. It has a light lemony smell, so it is not scent-free. However, I like the scent and glad I bought this bottle with my diva cup.</li>
