            <li>Smells really nice, leaves a really nice shine and holds well.</li>
            <li>It is a working hairspray, in that it gives you some time to lift and shape it before it dries, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, pleasantly scented, and holds hair but leaves your style flexible.</li>
            <li>It smells good, is not sticky, is easy to use, and adds shine to my hair.</li>

            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Tried many others.</li>
            <li>However most of the cans I purchased clogged up.</li>
            <li>Always my favorite hair spray.</li>

            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>

            <li>What more is there to say.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I was satisfied with this hairspray though I didn&#x27;t notice that my hair was shinier.</li>
            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>This hairspray smells great, and holds decently well.</li>
            <li>It smells great and gives a decent hold without making my hair too sticky or unmanageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other hairsprays, but this is the best!</li>
            <li>Most importantly it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is a welcome surprise.  </li>
            <li>I really like this Hairspray, I have blond hair and it shines and glisten with this spray, it has good hold without being tacky, have it on Auto ship</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with all the John Frieda products I&#x27;ve tried, and they are much better priced than most of the professional brands.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need the strong hold.</li>
            <li>the cans have some dents but work fine.</li>
            <li>if fine and brown with lots of highlights.</li>
            <li>BUT DOES HOLD FINE HAIR.</li>
            <li>Now that I can get it here on Amazon with Subscribe and Save, so much the better!</li>
            <li>The hold is light.</li>
            <li>Gives added shine to my blonde hair &amp; holds great without being sticky.</li>
            <li>It is light hold which is something I prefer.</li>
            <li>I like this hairspray because it&#x27;s light and flexible.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this  hair spray and it is the only one she buys... holds great with no problems...!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for blonde hair, natural or treated hair!</li>
            <li>The result is nice, light hair which looks natural.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>It has non-dulling effect on hair to keep blonde hair bright and shine.</li>
            <li>, I have natural wavy beach like kind of hair.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous shine for blonde hair.</li>
            <li>models\\&quot; :)  Anyway....I will only purchase this one, not only because it works without drying my hair out, but Amazon has it at a great price</li>
            <li>Very pretty shine.</li>
            <li>..can&#x27;t live without it ..will buy more  </li>
            <li>Perfect hold for short or long hair.</li>
            <li>Great hold without stickiness, or making my hair a tangled mess.</li>
            <li>This hair spray works good for a light hair spray and does not get really hard, so if you need a strong hold this one is not for you.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li>If you want light hold that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;darken&amp;#34; blonde hair then you will love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I have used other blonde hair spray products, but this one works best for me.  </li>
            <li>So it takes some experience to get just the right amount for whatever look you&#x27;re going for.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased expensive salon &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; hairsprays and can easily tell you that this really is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light hold, which I like because it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Like it very much</li>
            <li>I had the older version a few years back which I loved, held perfectly without being sticky, but this new version is not the same.  </li>
            <li>The hold is just right for me..not too stiff but does provide good body.</li>
            <li>Hard to find so happy to get it even at a higher price.</li>
            <li>It is designed specially for blonde, light hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care for aerosol cans - bought Free and Clear instead</li>
            <li>and I have used this brand since it first came out.</li>
            <li>Love this for my blonde hair!</li>
            <li>Got this really fast too!</li>
            <li>Good hold, yet not too stiff.  </li>
            <li>I do not know what those positive reviews are about.</li>
            <li>I love all the John Frieda products anyway, so I&#x27;m not surprised that this works for me.</li>
            <li>JF blonde has a lot of hold, strong on the scent but not offensive, and doesn&#x27;t clog.</li>
            <li>by far my fav hairspray, not dull or heavy, delivered promptly  great price too</li>
            <li>Not sure if it does anything for the blonde, but it sure has a nice hold and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Best of all...there is very little fragrance, which is better than most &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; hairsprays that just have a sick chemical smell.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this is the only hairspray I use!</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>Spray really holds the style.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>very sticky</li>
            <li>I wish john frieda would stop changing its product lines so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Moroccanoil hairspray and did not like as much (stronger hold)</li>
            <li>I really like this hair spray.</li>
            <li>John Frieda Sheer Blonde Crystal Clear Shape and Shimmer Hair Spray is light and can be sprayed on hair with 2 or more layers&lt;br /&gt;of spray without build-up or dulling residue.  </li>
            <li>I can compare it to Nexxus Comb Thru, which has about the same amount of hold, although Nexxus is a bit more natural looking.  </li>
            <li>It provides a nice hold, but gentle and touchable (not all stiff or gummy).  </li>
            <li>It can weigh hair down if you spray too much so apply it with a very light hand.  </li>
            <li>Not sticky like so many other sprays.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with the nozzle clogging more than other hairsprays I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I typically use the CD spray and then a little of the John Frieda on top, just to be sure I get the sun filtering effects.  </li>
            <li>I use with the John Frieda Sheer Blonde shampoo and conditioner and my thin fine hair has never looked better!!</li>
            <li>Really noticed a difference, but not in the &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; - I have short, fine blonde hair and the ends are showing signs of breakage after just a week of using this product.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine and no clogging problems that I read on other reviews.</li>
            <li>It does not give you helmet head and holds with very natural look.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave or show that gross hairspray residue which was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and the product does exactly as it promises.</li>
            <li>I have colored treated hair that most hairsprays make dull.  </li>
            <li>It is the Crystal Clear.  </li>
            <li>Clear with no buildup.</li>
            <li>This spray is working really well to manage my short hair</li>
            <li>What I wrote belie was for the old product.</li>
            <li>OLD REVIEW.  </li>
            <li>Soft, bouncy, medium hold - and</li>
            <li>Smells like an old fashioned beauty shop from the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It holds well while still leaving my hair soft.</li>
            <li>it is light, yet holds naturally and firm.</li>
            <li>I have used several other salon type hairsprays and they are not near as good as John Frieda Sheer Blonde Crystal Clear Shape and Shimmer Hair Spray.  </li>
            <li>Super hold without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough not to weigh my hair down but still holds it in place.  </li>
            <li>My skin is not overly sensitive and I was in major pain.</li>
            <li>However, it does last all day, even in high humidity, without buildup or flaking.  </li>
            <li>My concern is: how much propellant has escaped so far and, several weeks from now, will they all still spray &amp; function properly?</li>
            <li>It works, is not super stiff, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>As a blonde this leaves your hair not looking dirty, yet a great hold.</li>
            <li>I usually use a different brand that offers an &amp;#34;ultra fine mist&amp;#34; but decided to order this.</li>
            <li>I love it and have used it for at least the last 5 years!!!  </li>
            <li>I purchased the JF hairspray at my local grocery store for less than $5, a true bargain.  </li>
            <li>It dries soft and adds a &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; to my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Please go back to old formula</li>
            <li>I blow dry it, curl a little to keep it from flipping up on the ends like Mary Tyler Moore, and I lightly spray hair spray when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I do still use this as I like it over other hairsprays, but I think there isn&#x27;t really much shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other hair spray on my blonde hair without making it feel sticky or hard to brush out.  </li>
            <li>Did not expect this, since other John Frieda products are high quality.</li>
            <li>I like that it isn&#x27;t too heavy/sticky, as my hair is already so thin &amp; fine.</li>

            <li> I was satisfied with this hairspray though I didn&#x27;t notice that my hair was shinier.</li>
            <li> I love this spray.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> This hairspray smells great, and holds decently well.</li>
            <li> It smells great and gives a decent hold without making my hair too sticky or unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other hairsprays, but this is the best!</li>
            <li> Most importantly it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a welcome surprise.  </li>
            <li> I really like this Hairspray, I have blond hair and it shines and glisten with this spray, it has good hold without being tacky, have it on Auto ship</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with all the John Frieda products I&#x27;ve tried, and they are much better priced than most of the professional brands.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need the strong hold.</li>
            <li> the cans have some dents but work fine.</li>
            <li> if fine and brown with lots of highlights.</li>
            <li> BUT DOES HOLD FINE HAIR.</li>
            <li> Now that I can get it here on Amazon with Subscribe and Save, so much the better!</li>
            <li> The hold is light.</li>
            <li> Gives added shine to my blonde hair &amp; holds great without being sticky.</li>
            <li> It is light hold which is something I prefer.</li>
            <li> I like this hairspray because it&#x27;s light and flexible.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this  hair spray and it is the only one she buys... holds great with no problems...!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for blonde hair, natural or treated hair!</li>
            <li> The result is nice, light hair which looks natural.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> It has non-dulling effect on hair to keep blonde hair bright and shine.</li>
            <li> , I have natural wavy beach like kind of hair.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous shine for blonde hair.</li>
            <li> models\\&quot; :)  Anyway....I will only purchase this one, not only because it works without drying my hair out, but Amazon has it at a great price</li>
            <li> Very pretty shine.</li>
            <li> ..can&#x27;t live without it ..will buy more  </li>
            <li> Perfect hold for short or long hair.</li>
            <li> Great hold without stickiness, or making my hair a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> This hair spray works good for a light hair spray and does not get really hard, so if you need a strong hold this one is not for you.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li> If you want light hold that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;darken&amp;#34; blonde hair then you will love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I have used other blonde hair spray products, but this one works best for me.  </li>
            <li> So it takes some experience to get just the right amount for whatever look you&#x27;re going for.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased expensive salon &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; hairsprays and can easily tell you that this really is the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light hold, which I like because it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Like it very much</li>
            <li> I had the older version a few years back which I loved, held perfectly without being sticky, but this new version is not the same.  </li>
            <li> The hold is just right for me..not too stiff but does provide good body.</li>
            <li> Hard to find so happy to get it even at a higher price.</li>
            <li> It is designed specially for blonde, light hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care for aerosol cans - bought Free and Clear instead</li>
            <li> and I have used this brand since it first came out.</li>
            <li> Love this for my blonde hair!</li>
            <li> Got this really fast too!</li>
            <li> Good hold, yet not too stiff.  </li>
            <li> I do not know what those positive reviews are about.</li>
            <li> I love all the John Frieda products anyway, so I&#x27;m not surprised that this works for me.</li>
            <li> JF blonde has a lot of hold, strong on the scent but not offensive, and doesn&#x27;t clog.</li>
            <li> by far my fav hairspray, not dull or heavy, delivered promptly  great price too</li>
            <li> Not sure if it does anything for the blonde, but it sure has a nice hold and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> Best of all...there is very little fragrance, which is better than most &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; hairsprays that just have a sick chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this is the only hairspray I use!</li>
            <li> VERY</li>
            <li> Spray really holds the style.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> very sticky</li>
            <li> I wish john frieda would stop changing its product lines so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Moroccanoil hairspray and did not like as much (stronger hold)</li>
            <li> I really like this hair spray.</li>
            <li> John Frieda Sheer Blonde Crystal Clear Shape and Shimmer Hair Spray is light and can be sprayed on hair with 2 or more layers&lt;br /&gt;of spray without build-up or dulling residue.  </li>
            <li> I can compare it to Nexxus Comb Thru, which has about the same amount of hold, although Nexxus is a bit more natural looking.  </li>
            <li> It provides a nice hold, but gentle and touchable (not all stiff or gummy).  </li>
            <li> It can weigh hair down if you spray too much so apply it with a very light hand.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky like so many other sprays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with the nozzle clogging more than other hairsprays I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I typically use the CD spray and then a little of the John Frieda on top, just to be sure I get the sun filtering effects.  </li>
            <li> I use with the John Frieda Sheer Blonde shampoo and conditioner and my thin fine hair has never looked better!!</li>
            <li> Really noticed a difference, but not in the &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; - I have short, fine blonde hair and the ends are showing signs of breakage after just a week of using this product.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine and no clogging problems that I read on other reviews.</li>
            <li> It does not give you helmet head and holds with very natural look.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave or show that gross hairspray residue which was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and the product does exactly as it promises.</li>
            <li> I have colored treated hair that most hairsprays make dull.  </li>
            <li> It is the Crystal Clear.  </li>
            <li> Clear with no buildup.</li>
            <li> This spray is working really well to manage my short hair</li>
            <li> What I wrote belie was for the old product.</li>
            <li> OLD REVIEW.  </li>
            <li> Soft, bouncy, medium hold - and</li>
            <li> Smells like an old fashioned beauty shop from the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It holds well while still leaving my hair soft.</li>
            <li> it is light, yet holds naturally and firm.</li>
            <li> I have used several other salon type hairsprays and they are not near as good as John Frieda Sheer Blonde Crystal Clear Shape and Shimmer Hair Spray.  </li>
            <li> Super hold without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough not to weigh my hair down but still holds it in place.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not overly sensitive and I was in major pain.</li>
            <li> However, it does last all day, even in high humidity, without buildup or flaking.  </li>
            <li> My concern is: how much propellant has escaped so far and, several weeks from now, will they all still spray &amp; function properly?</li>
            <li> It works, is not super stiff, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> As a blonde this leaves your hair not looking dirty, yet a great hold.</li>
            <li> I usually use a different brand that offers an &amp;#34;ultra fine mist&amp;#34; but decided to order this.</li>
            <li> I love it and have used it for at least the last 5 years!!!  </li>
            <li> I purchased the JF hairspray at my local grocery store for less than $5, a true bargain.  </li>
            <li> It dries soft and adds a &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; to my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Please go back to old formula</li>
            <li> I blow dry it, curl a little to keep it from flipping up on the ends like Mary Tyler Moore, and I lightly spray hair spray when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I do still use this as I like it over other hairsprays, but I think there isn&#x27;t really much shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other hair spray on my blonde hair without making it feel sticky or hard to brush out.  </li>
            <li> Did not expect this, since other John Frieda products are high quality.</li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t too heavy/sticky, as my hair is already so thin &amp; fine.</li>
            <li> I tried using this about 6 different days before I finally realized it was indeed the spray and not some other environmental issue.</li>
            <li> Really like this spray ... hard to find in our area.  </li>
            <li> It does make my hair a little shinier, but you need to be careful to not use too much as it can weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just about the same as any other mid-range priced hairspray.</li>
            <li> and I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blond and this spray does add some subtle shine, but it is very...</li>
            <li> It probably helps to keep the plastic cap on so the nozzle doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> and I have dark blonde hair and didn&#x27;t see any difference with this being a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; hairspray.</li>
            <li> I like loose beachy waves</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a high hold, but does add some &amp;#34;stay power&amp;#34; to my style.</li>
            <li> however: All 5 cans of my wife&#x27;s John Frieda hair spray had simply been \\&quot;thrown\\&quot; into the box loose, helter skelter,and with what little packing material there was, compressed and waded up into the bottom of the box.</li>
            <li> Overall though, it works well and does give you a little bit of a shine.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no hold.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful though.</li>
            <li> This product is getting harder to find in my area.  </li>
            <li> I can easily fluff my curls with my fingers or brush out at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I usually use this hairspray when I&#x27;m wearing an updo because when I wear my hair down, I like a lot of natural movement.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stink like some other hairsprays either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s specifically for blondes, but I have blonde highlights so that was why I chose this over some of the other varieties.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it four stars because if I use just the least little bit too much, it becomes stiff.  </li>
            <li> I went with the positive reviews but they steered me wrong.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dull my blonde as other hairsprays do.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dull blonde hair like some sprays!!!</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and my hair is drier than the \\&quot;younger</li>
            <li> This hairspray holds without weighing down your hair or leaving a sticky build up.</li>
            <li> The previous batch of 12 can, 3 had duds for the spray so had to discard them.</li>
            <li> I have blond hair, and it&#x27;s a noticeable improvement over heavy hair sprays that left my hair dull and stiff.</li>
            <li> Not sticky but holds tight.</li>
            <li> Heavy.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> so I order 6 at a time every few months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stiff for me</li>
            <li> Keeps hair in place w/o being stiff or stickly</li>
            <li> Not too stiff</li>
            <li> It holds the hair but not in a stiff crunchy way.</li>
            <li> so I spray very little, layering it with the CD spray.  </li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is that I&#x27;ve noticed since I started using it that my hair is A LOT drier than it was prior to using this product. :(</li>
            <li> I like it but am not sure I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> all squished into a small box</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dull the color</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has UV filters and won&#x27;t dull my color.  </li>
            <li> This hairspray holds well, but doesn&#x27;t dull my color.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> Sort of hard to find</li>
            <li> Hard to find stocked in stores.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky or hard.</li>
            <li> After reassembling the cans, they all apperar to still spray properly at least at this time.</li>
            <li> My hair is highlighted and it doesn&#x27;t feel real heavy.  </li>
            <li> well, subtle.  </li>
            <li> the smell is not good and it does not even feel like there is any hair spray coming out .. just air.</li>
            <li> This new revision of the product With revised can design is HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> the last 2 bottles I have gotten have been horrible.</li>
            <li> Too bad you cant find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I has a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> It smells horrible to me</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Has been my favorite hairspray for years!!</li>
            <li> Really like this spray ... hard to find in our area.  Not sticky like so many other sprays.</li>
            <li> This is NOT the Shape and Shimmer!  It is the Crystal Clear.  They must not be making the Shape and Shimmer, because when I order it, I get something different and without the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> my favorite, good controll without the crunch.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray. It&#x27;s light, pleasantly scented, and holds hair but leaves your style flexible. I have blond hair, and it&#x27;s a noticeable improvement over heavy hair sprays that left my hair dull and stiff. I definitely recommend this hair spray for blond hair.</li>
            <li> no issues...the cans have some dents but work fine. My wife&#x27;s hair never moves now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this now twice. The hold is light. You could still brush your fingers through your hair, yet it will hold your style. Side note, I have natural wavy beach like kind of hair.</li>
            <li> It works, is not super stiff, and smells nice. I have platinum blonde hair, layered, above shoulder length. I blow dry it, curl a little to keep it from flipping up on the ends like Mary Tyler Moore, and I lightly spray hair spray when I&#x27;m done. This keeps my hair going, and I can brush it if I need to without ruining the hold. What more could you ask for in a hair spray? I love all the John Frieda products anyway, so I&#x27;m not surprised that this works for me.</li>
            <li> Holds good and makes hair blonder!</li>
            <li> This works great for every day. It&#x27;s not a high hold, but does add some &amp;#34;stay power&amp;#34; to my style. I can still run my fingers through my hair for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I use it daily it is light, yet holds naturally and firm. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray and is rated very highly everywhere. It doesn&#x27;t have the best hold, but it does the job. Most importantly it doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hairspray.  It doesn&#x27;t dull the color and you can brush it out.  I&#x27;ve used many other hairsprays, but this is the best!</li>
            <li> This spray is working really well to manage my short hair..can&#x27;t live without it ..will buy more  I am not blonde, but it works well for gray</li>
            <li> this stuff works and doesn&#x27;t change color of hair and smells oh so good</li>
            <li> This hair spray will hold your hair however leaves your hair touchable and soft.&lt;br /&gt;This product does not build up on your hair.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well.  Doesn&#x27;t leave or show that gross hairspray residue which was exactly what I needed.  Love John Frieda products.</li>
            <li> This hairspray has medium hold, not flexible hold, which is what I was hoping for.  However, it does last all day, even in high humidity, without buildup or flaking.  I&#x27;m blond and this spray does add some subtle shine, but it is very...well, subtle.  It can weigh hair down if you spray too much so apply it with a very light hand.  I like the fact that it has UV filters and won&#x27;t dull my color.  I can compare it to Nexxus Comb Thru, which has about the same amount of hold, although Nexxus is a bit more natural looking.  I usually use this hairspray when I&#x27;m wearing an updo because when I wear my hair down, I like a lot of natural movement.  For that I use Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi hairspray, which is an HG product for me.  I typically use the CD spray and then a little of the John Frieda on top, just to be sure I get the sun filtering effects.  I purchased the JF hairspray at my local grocery store for less than $5, a true bargain.  I&#x27;m giving it four stars because if I use just the least little bit too much, it becomes stiff.  So it takes some experience to get just the right amount for whatever look you&#x27;re going for.  I like loose beachy waves so I spray very little, layering it with the CD spray.  This is the best combination for me.  I definitely recommend it though.  It&#x27;s an excellent drugstore product, as good as those costing four times as much.</li>
            <li> Holds great. Doesn&#x27;t dull my blonde as other hairsprays do.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible.  Heavy.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Good Hairspray but does not shimmer at all. Nor does it smell that great. Hold well though without being sticky. My hair if fine and brown with lots of highlights.</li>
            <li> Love love this hairspray. Makes blonde last longer!!</li>
            <li> Gives added shine to my blonde hair &amp; holds great without being sticky. Doesn&#x27;t stink like some other hairsprays either.</li>
            <li> This hair spray works good for a light hair spray and does not get really hard, so if you need a strong hold this one is not for you.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. I do not know what those positive reviews are about. Just buy something from Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;My hair gets sticky.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a welcome surprise.  I LOVE this hairspray -- not too sticky, yet holds its shape.  Definitely a re-purchase is in my future for this one.</li>
            <li> I have colored treated hair that most hairsprays make dull.  This hairspray holds well, but doesn&#x27;t dull my color.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  It&#x27;s light enough not to weigh my hair down but still holds it in place.  Have used it for years and I love it.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray.  Smells great, good light to medium hold, and makes your hair shiny not dull like most hair spays.  GREAT!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dull blonde hair like some sprays!!!</li>
            <li> NOTE.  What I wrote belie was for the old product. This new revision of the product With revised can design is HORRIBLE.  There is absolutely no hold.  5/6 sprays equal the former version with one spray.  I will never use it again.  OLD REVIEW.  This is the staple for my hair styling. I no longer can find it in the stores so happily order it through amazon..bless you Amazon! You do have to be careful though. The previous batch of 12 can, 3 had duds for the spray so had to discard them. This time, I tested each one as I took it out of the box..of course, all were perfect. The hold is just right for me..not too stiff but does provide good body.</li>
            <li> This product is great....however: All 5 cans of my wife&#x27;s John Frieda hair spray had simply been \\&quot;thrown\\&quot; into the box loose, helter skelter,and with what little packing material there was, compressed and waded up into the bottom of the box. All five caps, and the spray nozzlels as well, were knocked off and had settled to the bottom of the box under the packing. Additionally, all 5 cans have multiple dents and dings. After reassembling the cans, they all apperar to still spray properly at least at this time. My concern is: how much propellant has escaped so far and, several weeks from now, will they all still spray &amp; function properly? This is not at all like you guy&#x27;s - Amazon. VERY disapointing!&lt;br /&gt;Joe A.</li>
            <li> Really noticed a difference, but not in the &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; - I have short, fine blonde hair and the ends are showing signs of breakage after just a week of using this product.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product, but I do want to let people know that it isn&#x27;t quite shimmer! I do still use this as I like it over other hairsprays, but I think there isn&#x27;t really much shimmer to it. It does make my hair a little shinier, but you need to be careful to not use too much as it can weigh your hair down. Overall though, it works well and does give you a little bit of a shine.</li>
            <li> Great!  Works well and has a nice smell.  :)</li>
            <li> Clear with no buildup.</li>
            <li> If you want light hold that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;darken&amp;#34; blonde hair then you will love this hairspray.  It is light hold which is something I prefer.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous shine for blonde hair. Spray really holds the style. Tried many others. This is the best! Hard to find. Amazon has it all.</li>
            <li> This spray holds hair in place but still allows it to blow in the wind and keep its shape.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue to do so .</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair. This hairspray holds without weighing down your hair or leaving a sticky build up. It is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> When it works it&#x27;s great!  However most of the cans I purchased clogged up. Tried everything to get them to spray finally gave up and thre them out</li>
            <li> Keeps hair in place w/o being stiff or stickly</li>
            <li> It smells horrible to me but I&#x27;m a guy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with the nozzle clogging more than other hairsprays I&#x27;ve had. Could be a dud or could be the product. Hairspray itself is nice.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for blonde hair, natural or treated hair! I am using it for several years now. It is designed specially for blonde, light hair. It has non-dulling effect on hair to keep blonde hair bright and shine. I am a big fan of John Frieda product line. I use this hairspray with &amp;#34;Go blonder lightening  shampoo and Luxurious Volume shampoo&amp;#34;. The result is nice, light hair which looks natural.</li>
            <li> I detest hairspray as a rule. I have to wear it for work. I&#x27;m a waitress and I have very long hair. I braid it daily, but I have flyaways and my supervisor was constantly riding my back about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because it says it was specifically formulated for blonde hair, so it wouldn&#x27;t turn it brassy. So far, so good! It definitely holds my flyaways throughout my shift, without making me feel like I have &amp;#34;helmet head&amp;#34;. I can take out my braid at the end of the night and run my fingers through my hair with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star rating is that I&#x27;ve noticed since I started using it that my hair is A LOT drier than it was prior to using this product. :(</li>
            <li> Good product for fine hair.  Nice fragrance.  Hols!</li>
            <li> Always my favorite hair spray. As a blonde this leaves your hair not looking dirty, yet a great hold.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I have ever used. I have blonde hair and the product does exactly as it promises. I cannot find it anywhere so thankfully Amazon has it. I hope they never discontinue it. I have purchased expensive salon &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; hairsprays and can easily tell you that this really is the best. Washes out great as well !!!</li>
            <li> Leaves no sticky residue, but leaves a bright shine. Holds hair well!</li>
            <li> Love It!  Have used it for probably 15 years and I hope they never stop making it.  Nice, clear laquer, great hold, good shine and washes out perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have used other blonde hair spray products, but this one works best for me.  I am in my late 50&#x27;s and my hair is drier than the \\&quot;younger models\\&quot; :)  Anyway....I will only purchase this one, not only because it works without drying my hair out, but Amazon has it at a great price and I don&#x27;t have to run all over town trying to find it.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just about the same as any other mid-range priced hairspray. It does not give you helmet head and holds with very natural look.</li>
            <li> Cannot seem to find this hairspray anywhere.  Leaves my hair shiny and holds without having  helmet hair.</li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t too heavy/sticky, as my hair is already so thin &amp; fine. It sprays out in a nice mist &amp; has a pleasant fragrance. Funny, before this I hadn&#x27;t realized they had hairsprays specifically for blondes -- seems perfectly suited to my hair though!</li>
            <li> Very pretty shine. Softens and silkens hair.</li>
            <li> I use this hair spray every day.  A friend told me about it.  It is the best hair spray product that I have used for the price.  It is a very good value.  Now my daughter is using it all the time and my husband is as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Smells really nice, leaves a really nice shine and holds well. I would repurhase again for sure!</li>
            <li> JF blonde has a lot of hold, strong on the scent but not offensive, and doesn&#x27;t clog. I like it but am not sure I will purchase again. I don&#x27;t need the strong hold. My hair is getting longer.</li>
            <li> Makes my blonde hair look sticky - no shine at all.</li>
            <li> very sticky and I don&#x27;t care for aerosol cans - bought Free and Clear instead and I like it much better</li>
            <li> This is a good hairspray.  I have used it for years.  My hair is highlighted and it doesn&#x27;t feel real heavy.  Like it very much</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair spray.  Not sticky and holds well.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. It smells good, is not sticky, is easy to use, and adds shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> So sticky! I went with the positive reviews but they steered me wrong. I had the older version a few years back which I loved, held perfectly without being sticky, but this new version is not the same.  I would recommend L&#x27;Oreal Elnett instead.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it does anything for the blonde, but it sure has a nice hold and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blond and I have used this brand since it first came out. Sort of hard to find so I order 6 at a time every few months.  Good hold, yet not too stiff.  I have very fine hair and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> Very light BUT DOES HOLD FINE HAIR. Too bad you cant find it in the stores anymore. I wish john frieda would stop changing its product lines so much</li>
            <li> Love this for my blonde hair! Hard to find stocked in stores. Happy to have it on here</li>
            <li> Best hairspray I&#x27;ve had. Smells great and leaves my hair bouncy. It&#x27;s a light hold, which I like because it looks very natural. I&#x27;ve used Moroccanoil hairspray and did not like as much (stronger hold)</li>
            <li> Soft, bouncy, medium hold - and it smells nice!</li>
            <li> Super hold without weighing your hair down. I have fine hair and this is the only hairspray I use!</li>
            <li> This hairspray smells great, and holds decently well. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky or hard.</li>
            <li> I like this hairspray because it&#x27;s light and flexible. I has a bad smell. Like lacquer. Smells like an old fashioned beauty shop from the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair spray. It smells great and gives a decent hold without making my hair too sticky or unmanageable.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this  hair spray and it is the only one she buys... holds great with no problems...!</li>
            <li> John Frieda Sheer Blonde Crystal Clear Shape and Shimmer Hair Spray is light and can be sprayed on hair with 2 or more layers&lt;br /&gt;of spray without build-up or dulling residue.  In fact, it actually does make your blonde hair shimmer and shine.  It is a working hairspray, in that it gives you some time to lift and shape it before it dries, which is nice.  I love it and have used it for at least the last 5 years!!!  I have used several other salon type hairsprays and they are not near as good as John Frieda Sheer Blonde Crystal Clear Shape and Shimmer Hair Spray.  This is why I rated it with 5 stars, because it is wonderful!  B. Smith of Michigan.</li>
            <li> This product is getting harder to find in my area.  It works better than any other hair spray on my blonde hair without making it feel sticky or hard to brush out.  Love it.</li>
            <li> love this hairspray need to order more!</li>
            <li> I like the hair spray but every time I order them they won&#x27;t spray  Some and were dented all squished into a small box</li>
            <li> Not sticky but holds tight. Got this really fast too!</li>
            <li> Caution!! I received a chemical burn from Sheer Blonde spray. My skin is not overly sensitive and I was in major pain. I tried using this about 6 different days before I finally realized it was indeed the spray and not some other environmental issue. I had to wash my hair several times, change pillowcases, etc. My forehead is still healing from one burn. Did not expect this, since other John Frieda products are high quality. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. It dries soft and adds a &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; to my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> by far my fav hairspray, not dull or heavy, delivered promptly  great price too</li>
            <li> Always great. Hard to find so happy to get it even at a higher price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hairspray. What more is there to say. I usually use a different brand that offers an &amp;#34;ultra fine mist&amp;#34; but decided to order this. It&#x27;s a little stiff for me and I have dark blonde hair and didn&#x27;t see any difference with this being a &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; hairspray.</li>
            <li> Great hold without stickiness, or making my hair a tangled mess. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Not too stiff</li>
            <li> I really like this Hairspray, I have blond hair and it shines and glisten with this spray, it has good hold without being tacky, have it on Auto ship</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with this hairspray though I didn&#x27;t notice that my hair was shinier. It worked fine and no clogging problems that I read on other reviews. It probably helps to keep the plastic cap on so the nozzle doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I started buying this hairspray locally several months ago and have never looked back!  It provides a nice hold, but gentle and touchable (not all stiff or gummy).  I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s specifically for blondes, but I have blonde highlights so that was why I chose this over some of the other varieties.  All in all, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with all the John Frieda products I&#x27;ve tried, and they are much better priced than most of the professional brands.  Now that I can get it here on Amazon with Subscribe and Save, so much the better!</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for 7+ years and loved it.. the last 2 bottles I have gotten have been horrible. They have changed the formula and it is a big miss.. there is no hold at all. the smell is not good and it does not even feel like there is any hair spray coming out .. just air. John Frieda..what were you thinking.. leave your good product alone it worked great. Please go back to old formula..then i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Perfect hold for short or long hair. Just enough!</li>
            <li> I love this spray. It holds well while still leaving my hair soft. I can easily fluff my curls with my fingers or brush out at the end of the day. Best of all...there is very little fragrance, which is better than most &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; hairsprays that just have a sick chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Not too sticky. Good quality hairspray that will add shine if you are blond.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray!! It holds the hair but not in a stiff crunchy way. Works so well. Adds a shine also. I use with the John Frieda Sheer Blonde shampoo and conditioner and my thin fine hair has never looked better!!</li>
