            <li>The instructions...or someone mentioned, that it&#x27;s best to pat the lotion on your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so impressed and happy with this product</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer that is perfect for my summer skin and to lock in moisture and benefits from the lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product and am now a convert.</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>I have no clue what it is about this product, but it is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I abhor feeling greasy-faced when going to bed, and this is a good lightweight moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and my skin is good to go all day till I remove everything at night.</li>
            <li>The stuff is good</li>
            <li>I like it, and it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Even if this doesn&#x27;t work for you they have so many great products something is bound to be good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable with good smell.</li>
            <li>Leaves kind of a greasy feel as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is nice and maybe it works for others.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great layering moisturizer with lots of lubricious slip, and absorbs quickly with ultra lightweight feel.</li>
            <li>This is also not bad price wise, who knows it might just be me that this does not work for.</li>
            <li>It leave my skin very smooth</li>
            <li>If you do not do this, the product will not absorb and will just lay on top of skin, causing you to feel greasy.</li>
            <li>The only lotion that is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>This place is prob the cheapest you&#x27;ll be able to find in America...</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>LIght, non greasy, t and wonderful for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Arrived perfectly and had instructions printed on it in English.</li>
            <li>One more day of moisturizing and</li>
            <li>my skin was feeling more hydrated than it had ever been for years.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, no complaints : )</li>
            <li>I really love Hada Labo products.</li>
            <li>Apply to damp skin and don&#x27;t forget to pat.:)</li>
            <li>I have ordered a bunch more products to try.</li>
            <li>The rohto hadalabo hyaluronic acid cream is much much much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it, and I have been using it for a year now.  </li>
            <li>Just Ok...?</li>
            <li>it does keep it more moisturized than it would be without it</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping, nice product.</li>
            <li>It works really well for my skin, i feel good every night use it after shower.</li>
            <li>the price is great and the shipping was pretty fast!</li>
            <li>Hadalabo has a great skincare ingredient SHA, Super Hyaluronic Acid , which holds twice the amount of water than normal HA.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Dermalogica fan for years, but this cheaper product seems to be comparable or even better.  </li>
            <li>Milk is equivalent to a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>you have combo, oily, or skin that just benefits from light moisture</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a light consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and leaves the skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The toner has more water in it and keeps the skin looking plump and moist because the toner contains the right amount of water to react with the acid.</li>
            <li>Hadalabo is basically considered a beauty staple in Japan and is a very popular skincare line, my Japanese friend tried to explain to me the details of Eastern skincare.</li>
            <li>I really feel it&#x27;s great for my combo sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s particularly special, but I don&#x27;t have any complaints either.</li>
            <li>By patting the lotion, it certainly leaves my skin more hydrated and moisturized as i work around the needed area of my face.</li>
            <li>is much cheaper, and you get more product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am assuming the skin is able to absorb the lotion than gently massaging it.</li>
            <li>At first it feels very nice but after having it on my face for longer than half an hour it makes it sooo shiny and greasy looking which doesn&#x27;t happen with most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to and prefer skincare products to absorb on the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not brand loyal</li>
            <li>It is really moisturizing but light on face.</li>
            <li>Great for humid climates or oily skin that can&#x27;t take heavy moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have used Japanese skincare products before (Shiseido, Kose) and generally liked them, but not this one.</li>
            <li>When I applied this milky lotion, it was not oily, and was immediately absorbed by my skin.  </li>
            <li>but this plumps out my skin and makes it feel so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>already* getting the hyaluronic acid from the clear lotion, right?---so adding the Milky one on top seems extraneous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not gonna lie, but the ratio of water to acid in the lotion just isn&#x27;t right for my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it was an out of this world product, but because I know what type of product this is and what it&#x27;s capable of doing, obviously don&#x27;t expect looking 10 years younger with this but for just hydrating the skin this is great, very very good if you want to give your skin that extra moisture boost, this should be used somewhat like a toner, give it a bit of time to absorb because this is definitely on the thicker side of &amp;#34;toners&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But if your skin is truly oily or normal this is too rich for you.</li>
            <li>A toner is equivalent to lotion in Japanese skincare, and instead of more clarifying purposes (Western skincare), they tend to be more hydrating and replenishing.</li>
            <li>When I put this on my skin, it feels sticky at first.</li>
            <li>I tried this first as a sample from a company that was thinking about importing it.</li>
            <li>There is also no real scent which is nice.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected from such great reviews and advertisements.</li>
            <li>But i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a must-have, especially if you own the clear Lotion Moist.</li>
            <li>I love how long it lasts and how it moisturizes my face.</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m just acne prone, so I&#x27;m very particular about what I use for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and was very excited to use this product (I bought the Hadalabo Lotion and Milk).</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products for dealing with dry skin!</li>
            <li>I have very blotchy skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have the whole line.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really fast for me and the people who say it is oily or greasy have applied too much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like that lotion is really hydrate my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really hydrate and the product was sticky and non-absorbant.  </li>
            <li>or this is simply is too rich for your skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why the Milky Lotion is less popular than the clear Lotion</li>
            <li>but I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is entirely non greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Use it on my face everyday and my skin is much better now.</li>
            <li>Also, I do not have the greasy or heavy feeling most people experience.</li>
            <li>The toner (green one) is a bit better, it&#x27;s lighter and easier to spread.</li>
            <li>Would be great if your skin is not sensitive and extremely flakey and dry.</li>
            <li>But being water-based, the clear Lotion Moist doesn&#x27;t have the retention properties to lock all that goodness in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just surprised by the size.</li>
            <li>Also for those who are sensitive to smells this product has no smell at all.</li>
            <li>Sensitive too.</li>
            <li>It came early as well.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to cosmetic products that smell like chemicals, here you</li>
            <li>Your skin can only absorb so much hyaluronic.</li>
            <li>I gave this product a shot since other reviewers seemed to rave about the properties, but I really felt like I was just putting straight glycerin on my face-</li>
            <li>So you would think this product would be great for dry skin, but sadly if did not work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s an okay product for maybe night time when no one will see you, but not good for throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This one is exactly the same as the green one just thicker and in higher concentration.</li>
            <li>Hence it was with some trepidation that I tried this new product when it was on sale at my local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>I have normally dry skin, so my skin will not naturally produce much moisture, but the high acid content of the lotion is constantly trying to pull moisture.</li>
            <li>It feels a little sticky at first, but after a few minutes it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>This is meant for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need to use any other moisturizer, it has a light texture and a little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and also brighten my face a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I really do not like the constant tapping motion that needs to be done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to any other brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the other Japanese cream I named.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I abhor feeling greasy-faced when going to bed, and this is a good lightweight moisturizer. I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s particularly special, but I don&#x27;t have any complaints either.</li>
            <li> Hadalabo is basically considered a beauty staple in Japan and is a very popular skincare line, my Japanese friend tried to explain to me the details of Eastern skincare. I have dry skin, and was very excited to use this product (I bought the Hadalabo Lotion and Milk). A toner is equivalent to lotion in Japanese skincare, and instead of more clarifying purposes (Western skincare), they tend to be more hydrating and replenishing. Milk is equivalent to a light moisturizer. Hadalabo has a great skincare ingredient SHA, Super Hyaluronic Acid , which holds twice the amount of water than normal HA. So you would think this product would be great for dry skin, but sadly if did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the lotion is like water and you take very very little and start tapping it all over your face till it absorbs. The problem is, this tapping can literally take MINUTES, it usually takes me five minutes of literally tapping and pressing my face to get it to absorb. If you do not do this, the product will not absorb and will just lay on top of skin, causing you to feel greasy. The Milk, for me, even takes LONGER to absorb and you MUST use the patting method for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However no matter what I do, it leaves me feeling heavy and greasy. I usually end up feeling itchy and end up washing it off after thirty minutes. I really do not like the constant tapping motion that needs to be done. I&#x27;m used to and prefer skincare products to absorb on the skin quickly. I prefer my Cerave lotion to this ( which also has hyaluronic acid, is much cheaper, and you get more product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this product is so raved about, I would try it for the shear interest. I have used Japanese skincare products before (Shiseido, Kose) and generally liked them, but not this one. This is also not bad price wise, who knows it might just be me that this does not work for.</li>
            <li> This is like my 5th bottle. The only lotion that is perfect for my skin. I love how long it lasts and how it moisturizes my face. I&#x27;m just surprised by the size. I bought a bottle in Korea for the same price but it was a lot bigger. I mix rosehip/argan oil with a dime size of this lotion. LOVE. This place is prob the cheapest you&#x27;ll be able to find in America...I tried Walgreens but this place seems to still be cheaper.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  LIght, non greasy, t and wonderful for sensitive skin. Use  it under the sun screen&lt;br /&gt;And it lasts forever !!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived perfectly and had instructions printed on it in English. This has been a miracle product for me, especially since I have been dealing with dry, flaky skin all winter. It feels a little sticky at first, but after a few minutes it is absorbed. Also for those who are sensitive to smells this product has no smell at all. This is one of my favorite products for dealing with dry skin! I could definitely see this being used alone as a moisturizer in the summer time.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin, and will have bad acne if I use facial products with any fragrance.  Hence it was with some trepidation that I tried this new product when it was on sale at my local pharmacy.  I was having a bad cold at the same time, and the skin around my nose was peeling from too much blowing. When I applied this milky lotion, it was not oily, and was immediately absorbed by my skin.  To my delight the next morning, there was visibly less peeling on my nose.  One more day of moisturizing and my skin was feeling more hydrated than it had ever been for years. I totally endorse this product, and for those sitting on the fence, take the plunge and try!  I have been a loyal Dermalogica fan for years, but this cheaper product seems to be comparable or even better.  I just wish there was spf in this. Otherwise, no complaints : )</li>
            <li> It works really well for my skin, i feel good every night use it after shower. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, nice product. Use it on my face everyday and my skin is much better now. It met my expectations!</li>
            <li> I purchased the milk in a set with the lotion. I have combination skin,no ily in the Summer and very dry and flaky in the Winter. This is used after the lotion to help lock in moisture. Yes, you could use any moisturizer but this one has been the best for my skin! I have very blotchy skin and it used to have acne now I&#x27;m just acne prone, so I&#x27;m very particular about what I use for my skin. This milk is perfect for me. I&#x27;m 35 and have no wrinkles yet but this plumps out my skin and makes it feel so soft and smooth! It&#x27;s also even toned where I can go without makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the am as my daytime moisturizer over the lotion and I like the face shops rice cerimide essance then I apply the milk and I like TonyMoly Latte art face primer. Then I use my BB cream or foundation and my skin is good to go all day till I remove everything at night. At bedtime I do the same process but I add serums and always use an aha acid. I layer my products then I like a sleeping mask. This process has made my skin behave the milk alone I apply when my skin is damp. You only need a tiny amount. I really feel it&#x27;s great for my combo sensitive skin. It&#x27;s even toned and I haven&#x27;t broken out at all! I really love Hada Labo products. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to any other brand and I&#x27;m not brand loyal I&#x27;m just so impressed and happy with this product I won&#x27;t need anything else;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have combo, oily, or skin that just benefits from light moisture this is great! Apply to damp skin and don&#x27;t forget to pat.:) the price is great and the shipping was pretty fast! I have ordered a bunch more products to try. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough. Even if this doesn&#x27;t work for you they have so many great products something is bound to be good. Great moisturizer that is perfect for my summer skin and to lock in moisture and benefits from the lotion. I&#x27;m really happy with this product and am now a convert. I get the hype with Hada Labo!

            <li> I have dry/oily skin. No matter how hydrated i maintain, i still have areas that stays dry (the corner of my brow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion has a light consistency. It definitely does not have any fragrance, which i am thankful for. The instructions...or someone mentioned, that it&#x27;s best to pat the lotion on your face. It definitely takes time to pat the lotion on face and neck but i can see why. By patting the lotion, it certainly leaves my skin more hydrated and moisturized as i work around the needed area of my face. I am assuming the skin is able to absorb the lotion than gently massaging it. Also, I do not have the greasy or heavy feeling most people experience.</li>
            <li> Meh. The rohto hadalabo hyaluronic acid cream is much much much better in my opinion. I have average skin. Sensitive too. And this causes me to break out very badly! Leaves kind of a greasy feel as well. Won&#x27;t buy again. I&#x27;ll stick with the other Japanese cream I named. No smell either. Would be great if your skin is not sensitive and extremely flakey and dry. Bit too pricey too. Not what I expected from such great reviews and advertisements. But nothing wrong with shipping or packaging. It came early as well.</li>
            <li> I have no clue what it is about this product, but it is AMAZING!  I tend to get dryer skin, especially in the midwest winters.  I don&#x27;t even need to use any other moisturizer, it has a light texture and a little goes a long way.  I will continue to order this.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable with good smell.</li>
            <li> It is really moisturizing but light on face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have the whole line. It absorbs really fast for me and the people who say it is oily or greasy have applied too much or this is simply is too rich for your skin. This is meant for dry and sensitive skin. I have oily skin because my skin is over compensating for its dryness and this balances everything out for me. But if your skin is truly oily or normal this is too rich for you. Research the rest of their line before you buy. I use this in conjunction with their lotion and use this during the day and the cream at night. Does not irritate skin at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe its just me.  I didn&#x27;t feel like that lotion is really hydrate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Price is nice and maybe it works for others.</li>
            <li> I love it, and I have been using it for a year now.  It leaves my skin so soft and also brighten my face a little bit.  I will continuing buy this product.</li>
            <li> Just Ok...? The toner (green one) is a bit better, it&#x27;s lighter and easier to spread. I know this one&#x27;s a lotion and that&#x27;s a toner but I find using both at once is so repetitive and doesn&#x27;t give you 2x the effects of anything. Why use both hyaluronic acid toner and lotion when I can use a hadalabo toner and then a tinted moisturizer with spf over it to save time in the morning?? This one is exactly the same as the green one just thicker and in higher concentration. The stuff is good I&#x27;m not gonna lie, but the ratio of water to acid in the lotion just isn&#x27;t right for my skin. I have normally dry skin, so my skin will not naturally produce much moisture, but the high acid content of the lotion is constantly trying to pull moisture. The lotion dries to form a film that clings to my skin.. it does keep it more moisturized than it would be without it but it feels a bit rubbery. I only use 1-2 drops but I have pretty sensitive skin so I can feel the difference.  The toner has more water in it and keeps the skin looking plump and moist because the toner contains the right amount of water to react with the acid. I can&#x27;t feel the toner on my skin. SOOO the toner would get a 5 star from me. But this is the unnecessary partner that I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> No smell AT ALL. If you are sensitive to cosmetic products that smell like chemicals, here you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY moisturizing. When I put this on my skin, it feels sticky at first. but as i massage on my face.. oh emm geeee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cheaper online than in other off-line beauty shops ($20-25)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it was an out of this world product, but because I know what type of product this is and what it&#x27;s capable of doing, obviously don&#x27;t expect looking 10 years younger with this but for just hydrating the skin this is great, very very good if you want to give your skin that extra moisture boost, this should be used somewhat like a toner, give it a bit of time to absorb because this is definitely on the thicker side of &amp;#34;toners&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am slowly building my collection of this brand and I have to say I love this lotion.  It leave my skin very smooth and I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a shot since other reviewers seemed to rave about the properties, but I really felt like I was just putting straight glycerin on my face- it didn&#x27;t really hydrate and the product was sticky and non-absorbant.  I even woke up with sticky face the next day.  I bought the matching hyaluronic acid cream with it and same thing.  Not a good line of skin care if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Known as the &amp;#34;ignored, less-favored&amp;#34; sister of the Hada Labo family. It has the same patented Hyaluronic Acid complex as the star-of-the-show,(Hada Labo Lotion Moist) and is just as functional---but the base is a oil/water emulsion that gives it a milky, creamier texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lotion Moist, in contrast, is a clear, watery liquid with low viscosity -- thus able to penetrate skin faster than the heavier Milky Lotion. But being water-based, the clear Lotion Moist doesn&#x27;t have the retention properties to lock all that goodness in. That&#x27;s where a regular moisturizer steps in, like the Milky Lotion. A oil/water emulsion does this job by adding a slightly occlusive layer of moisture, that seals in all the Hyaluronic yumminess, while preventing it from evaporating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you could technically use any moisturizer you like that acts as an occlusive cover -- i mean, you&#x27;re *already* getting the hyaluronic acid from the clear lotion, right?---so adding the Milky one on top seems extraneous. Your skin can only absorb so much hyaluronic. Besides, we like to use other moisturizers that offer different ingredients, like peptides and antioxidants. That&#x27;s why the Milky Lotion is less popular than the clear Lotion Moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do buy this, it&#x27;s a great layering moisturizer with lots of lubricious slip, and absorbs quickly with ultra lightweight feel. Great for humid climates or oily skin that can&#x27;t take heavy moisturizers. I like it, and it&#x27;s a good product. But i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a must-have, especially if you own the clear Lotion Moist.</li>
            <li> I tried this first as a sample from a company that was thinking about importing it. It is great. You only need to use a small amount so the bottle lasts quite a while. It is entirely non greasy and absorbs quickly. There is also no real scent which is nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this lotion! It&#x27;s lightweight and leaves the skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> At first it feels very nice but after having it on my face for longer than half an hour it makes it sooo shiny and greasy looking which doesn&#x27;t happen with most moisturizers. I would say it&#x27;s an okay product for maybe night time when no one will see you, but not good for throughout the day. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
