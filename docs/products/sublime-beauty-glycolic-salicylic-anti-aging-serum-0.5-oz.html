            <li>I love it when things are packaged</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Also this is a great seller, really want to do a fantastic job!</li>
            <li>and my skin feels smoother and more refined.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a safe, effective treatment for mild acne, oily skin, textural changes and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in people of most skin types.</li>
            <li>I am a Product Tester and was offered this Anti-Aging Serum by Sublime at a special price during a promotion the company was having; in exchange, I would test their product and give you my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>This serum is on par with the rest of the Sublime line in maintaining premium ingredients, noticable EFFECTIVE results and working quickly.</li>
            <li>I started using this to eliminate the fine lines around my eyes, which are more noticeable when smiling.</li>
            <li>Although this serum is marketed as anti-aging, I really think that it should more so be noted for its acne-fighting abilities because it has proved to be one of the most effective serums for acne I have tried.  </li>
            <li>So far so good:)</li>
            <li>I follow up with a daytime moisturizer and it works fine under makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked wonders on minimizing those fine lines I&#x27;ve started to notice.</li>
            <li>I still get the same great results, but now I don&#x27;t have any dryness on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is my honest opinion that this anti-aging serum by Sublime works very well and has become part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>Really is fantastic</li>
            <li>It is a great product overall, it removes those blackheads after two or three applications from the area.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product, although for my needs I will switch it up with others rather than using it every day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different skin products and always like to try out something new, so I was happy to have a chance to receive this for my honest review.  </li>
            <li>nice...makes me feel so special.  </li>
            <li>That is very important to me because I have sensitive skin that will break out easily.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and just</li>
            <li>These are very effective but strong ingredients that may dry out skin, so be sure to only use this serum all-over a couple of times each week, or prepare to use it as a spot treatment nightly.</li>
            <li>Perfect product to clear adult acne and improve the skin tone and texture of my mature skin.</li>
            <li>all things a woman like me is interested in and longing for in a serum!  </li>
            <li>After the first time I tried it, my husband could even tell the difference!</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive a promotional discount in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It feels really nice going on, and my pores seem smaller.</li>
            <li>I actually got this in the sampler box and immediately liked it.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks so far I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>love it so far-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a serum, which I love, because serums tend to have a more concentrated dose of active ingredients than do creams.</li>
            <li>The pump operates easily to get the clear liquid serum out.  </li>
            <li>Mild acid solutions, such as salicylic acid and glycolic acid, encourage the peeling of the top layer of skin and the opening of plugged follicles, which helps reestablish the normal skin-cell replacement cycle.</li>
            <li>It absorbed very quickly and I was left with no residue on my face.</li>
            <li>When I apply it to my face, I do find that the smell is a bit overwhelming for a split second, but then it subsides surprisingly fast.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I always check with a new product is the scent - this definitely has a bit of an astringent smell, but that&#x27;s not shocking since it contains salicylic acid, so it should be a bit acrid.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in a beautiful little bag that I will definitely re-use.  </li>
            <li>I have mild adult acne on my chin and it is very bothersome to me</li>
            <li>This gives the skin a much smoother look and</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this serum-</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a product for years that really worked to reduce pore size.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it is a pump dispenser, this way I always get just the right amount without waste or contamination.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice how it comes in a drawstring fabric bag - makes it seem special and gives you a little extra that can be used for something else!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and glides on like silk and has a soft, subtle scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Glycolic Acid is the most active and beneficial of the Alpha-Hydroxy-Acids (AHA) in skin care and is made from sugar canes.</li>
            <li>My skin is of Anglo-Irish ancestry, fair, and has in the past shown irritation to some nationally known brands for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using all of the products I&#x27;ve purchased and am a loyal customer for all of the reasons stated above.</li>
            <li>All of their products are made with high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>I follow the directions to the letter: clean face, dry skin, apply, and overlay with moisturizing cream or sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t suffer from adult acne much anymore, I am 74</li>
            <li>Once inside the cell, it will trigger new formation of collagen and turn on the synthesis of dermal glycosaminoglycans to plump up the cell and the ground substances in the skin to reduce wrinkles on the skins surface.</li>
            <li>Glycolic Acid also affects the newly forming keratin cells at the bottom of the stratum corneum causing the bulk of the stratum corneum to lift off and separate from the underlying skin.</li>
            <li>Like many other topical acne treatments, salicylic acid must be used continuously, even after acne lesions have healed.</li>
            <li>I was in search of a more affordable, multipurpose alternative to my department store-brand serums, which are pretty pricey and only treat one area of concern, such as aging only or acne only.</li>
            <li>seems to dry out my skin a little more than I expected, but easy to use and seems to help control the acne I can&#x27;t seem to outgrow...</li>
            <li>It has also helped clear up my skin by unclogging my pores.</li>
            <li>Personally, my blemishes respond well to glycolic and salicylic acid as an acne treatment, but my sensitive skin dries out if it gets too much of those two ingredients, so I have started using this serum as a nightly spot treatment.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs completely.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use much to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li>I have definitely noticed a difference in the way my skin looks and feels and would absolutely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I find that once a week at night is all my sensitive skin needs.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after using this</li>
            <li>This serum is pretty thin and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>The addition of aloe keeps it from stinging like most other serums that contain salicylic acid, and the lack of oil makes it usable by my son who loves it as well as it calms and clears his acne, he has to maintain oil-free products (harder than you think to find!)</li>
            <li>It is the only AHA which is able to penetrate through the cell walls by virtue of its small molecular size.</li>
            <li>It has not dried my skin out or been too harsh for me at all but for people with sensitive skin I would recommend using it every other day just to be safe.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Salicylic acid is a mild acid that works as a keratolytic agent it encourages the sloughing of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>I really have to be careful with any products that I use on my face.</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone skin and did not expect this serum to help clear up my face because I thought it was just an anti-aging product, but the glycolic and salicylic acids have truly helped to clear up my oily skin and dry out my often-red blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Glycolic  and salicylic ifserum, along with the new ageless line, face whisperer and the dry brushing, recommended by sublime beauty website, made all the different for me.</li>

            <li> Personally, my blemishes respond well to glycolic and salicylic acid as an acne treatment, but my sensitive skin dries out if it gets too much of those two ingredients, so I have started using this serum as a nightly spot treatment.  </li>

            <li> This serum is pretty thin and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> The addition of aloe keeps it from stinging like most other serums that contain salicylic acid, and the lack of oil makes it usable by my son who loves it as well as it calms and clears his acne, he has to maintain oil-free products (harder than you think to find!)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It feels really nice going on, and my pores seem smaller. My face feels smoother and softer now, too.&lt;br /&gt;Initially I was only using it at night because I thought maybe it would make me feel oily, but I&#x27;ve been using it in&lt;br /&gt;the mornings now, too. It absorbs completely. I follow up with a daytime moisturizer and it works fine under makeup.</li>
            <li> I actually got this in the sampler box and immediately liked it. Skin texture,blemishes and smoothness of my skin have vastly improved within the two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it. This serum is on par with the rest of the Sublime line in maintaining premium ingredients, noticable EFFECTIVE results and working quickly. The addition of aloe keeps it from stinging like most other serums that contain salicylic acid, and the lack of oil makes it usable by my son who loves it as well as it calms and clears his acne, he has to maintain oil-free products (harder than you think to find!) so this was a pleasant surprise for him. Pretty amazing stuff! Sublime hasn&#x27;t dissapointed yet, I&#x27;ll continue using all of the products I&#x27;ve purchased and am a loyal customer for all of the reasons stated above.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best serums that I have ever used. I would give it more than 5 stars, if I could. I have loved all of the Sublime Beauty products that I have used. All of their products are made with high quality ingredients. That is very important to me because I have sensitive skin that will break out easily. I really have to be careful with any products that I use on my face. I have used products with glycolic acid before with great results. I have also used salicylic acid, but it was always in my acne products. I have never used a serum containing both. This serum is truly amazing and I just can&#x27;t get over how well it works on my face. My acne totally dried up and my pores looked so small and clear, especially all of the pores around my nose. I have very oily skin, so I started using it everyday. I noticed though, that my skin really started to get dry when using it everyday, so I started using it every other day. I still get the same great results, but now I don&#x27;t have any dryness on my face. This serum is pretty thin and goes on easily. I didn&#x27;t need to use much to cover my entire face. It absorbed very quickly and I was left with no residue on my face. I was very happy to be able to try this serum for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sublime Glycolic Salicylic Serum for two months now and I LOVE it! It absorbs quickly and just a very small amount goes a long way. I have definitely noticed a difference in the way my skin looks and feels and would absolutely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Such a great serum!! Im so in love with it. What a great combo of GLYCOLIC and SALICYLIC Acid!! Your skin will be clearer than ever before. Plus you will not have acne because of this product. I use Glycolic acid every day to prevent acne. So I was glad to find this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycolic Acid is the most active and beneficial of the Alpha-Hydroxy-Acids (AHA) in skin care and is made from sugar canes. It is the only AHA which is able to penetrate through the cell walls by virtue of its small molecular size. Once inside the cell, it will trigger new formation of collagen and turn on the synthesis of dermal glycosaminoglycans to plump up the cell and the ground substances in the skin to reduce wrinkles on the skins surface. Glycolic Acid also affects the newly forming keratin cells at the bottom of the stratum corneum causing the bulk of the stratum corneum to lift off and separate from the underlying skin. This gives the skin a much smoother look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic acid is a mild acid that works as a keratolytic agent it encourages the sloughing of dead skin cells. It&#x27;s a safe, effective treatment for mild acne, oily skin, textural changes and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in people of most skin types. Mild acid solutions, such as salicylic acid and glycolic acid, encourage the peeling of the top layer of skin and the opening of plugged follicles, which helps reestablish the normal skin-cell replacement cycle. For milder acne, salicylic acid helps unclog pores to resolve and prevent lesions. It does not have any effect on the production of sebum or the presence of  P. acnes bacteria. Like many other topical acne treatments, salicylic acid must be used continuously, even after acne lesions have healed. Its effects stop when you stop using it, so your skin will return to its uneven shedding; pores become clogged, and acne returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I am a Product Tester and was offered this Anti-Aging Serum by Sublime at a special price during a promotion the company was having; in exchange, I would test their product and give you my honest feedback. I can honestly say that I love this product. It&#x27;s a serum, which I love, because serums tend to have a more concentrated dose of active ingredients than do creams. (But that&#x27;s just my personal opinion) I also love the fact that it is a pump dispenser, this way I always get just the right amount without waste or contamination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this wonderful serum 3 times a week and the results are astounding! It&#x27;s nice and light and glides on like silk and has a soft, subtle scent. It&#x27;s worked wonders on minimizing those fine lines I&#x27;ve started to notice. It has also helped clear up my skin by unclogging my pores. Sublime contains glycolic acid and salicylic acid which are natural fruit ingredients with exfoliating properties that encourages the sloughing of dead skin cells improving the tone and texture of my skin. My skin looks radiant and more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my honest opinion that this anti-aging serum by Sublime works very well and has become part of my skin care routine. If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, what are you waiting for? Your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this serum works great!</li>
            <li> I started using this to eliminate the fine lines around my eyes, which are more noticeable when smiling. I really like the feel of this serum- leaves my skin feeling very smooth and moisturized. Plus the glycolic and salicylic acids are well known for anti aging skin care. Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle.  Should I say more.  I love it.  Pores what pores?! Lol.  Really is fantastic</li>
            <li> It is a great product overall, it removes those blackheads after two or three applications from the area. Although, the disappointing news is that it doesn&#x27;t really diminish or prevent blemishes from happening, but it does swell down the redness of pimples. I will keep on using it on my infected area to see if there&#x27;s any difference in the longterm.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks so far I am satisfied with this product. I find that once a week at night is all my sensitive skin needs. I&#x27;m looking forward to continued use and results.</li>
            <li> seems to dry out my skin a little more than I expected, but easy to use and seems to help control the acne I can&#x27;t seem to outgrow...</li>
            <li> This serum makes my skin look and feel absolutely fantastic! My pores appear smaller and my blackheads are finally clearing up. Perfect product to clear adult acne and improve the skin tone and texture of my mature skin.</li>
            <li> Great for spotting problem areas on face. Love it!</li>
            <li> Again, as one exiting her 8th decade, what can one hope for?  Two applications since Sublime Beauty Anti Aging Serum with GLYCOLIC and SALICYLIC acid exfoliation serum entered the skin care regimen, and I can say without reservation that the facial skin is softer and appears clearer and brighter from the applications.  I follow the directions to the letter: clean face, dry skin, apply, and overlay with moisturizing cream or sunscreen.  My skin is of Anglo-Irish ancestry, fair, and has in the past shown irritation to some nationally known brands for sensitive skin.  With the regimen of Sublime Beauty products, and this is the fourth addition to the collection, I have not had any skin irritation, redness, rash, or breakouts.  Not a thing I can do about the stack of years behind me, but I can put my best face forward!</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I&#x27;ve been looking for a product for years that really worked to reduce pore size. This works beautifully!!! I&#x27;m so glad I tried it. Sublime has wonderful products so I had great hopes this would work. It DID!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different skin products and always like to try out something new, so I was happy to have a chance to receive this for my honest review.  It&#x27;s really nice how it comes in a drawstring fabric bag - makes it seem special and gives you a little extra that can be used for something else!  The pump operates easily to get the clear liquid serum out.  The first thing I always check with a new product is the scent - this definitely has a bit of an astringent smell, but that&#x27;s not shocking since it contains salicylic acid, so it should be a bit acrid.  When I apply it to my face, I do find that the smell is a bit overwhelming for a split second, but then it subsides surprisingly fast.  The serum feels pleasant on my skin and quickly is absorbed in - no greasy residue.  I do notice some decreased irritation, although my seborrhea is not completely soothed by the serum.  Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product, although for my needs I will switch it up with others rather than using it every day.</li>
            <li> A good addition to my regimen. Seems to help with reducing pore size and lines.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely loved this product! It arrived in a beautiful little bag that I will definitely re-use.  I love it when things are packaged nice...makes me feel so special.  I have mild adult acne on my chin and it is very bothersome to me so when I was given the chance to test this and give my honest opinion I happily agreed. This serum contains Salicylic Acid (3%) and Glycolic Acid (2%) along with other beneficial ingredients to clear skin.  It exfoliates, unclogs pores and helps even skin tone and reduce age spots...all things a woman like me is interested in and longing for in a serum!  It has not dried my skin out or been too harsh for me at all but for people with sensitive skin I would recommend using it every other day just to be safe.  I have been using it at night and following up with a moisturizer.  I have seen an improvement in my acne as well as my clogged pores.  I look forward to the long term results as I continue to use this product.  :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t suffer from adult acne much anymore, I am 74 so that might be why, but this has shrunk the pores on my face using just twice a week for a total of 4 times.  Looking at my skin this morning, I was thrilled and had to look up this order to update my review.  Also this is a great seller, really want to do a fantastic job!</li>
            <li> I Must say this Anti Aging serum is up there with my favorites.It gave me smoother, smaller pores and clearer skin, &amp; the results were almost immediate! The glycolic &amp; salicylic acids are wonderful for my skin! After the first time I tried it, my husband could even tell the difference! I was lucky enough to receive a promotional discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I have many Sublime Beauty products &amp; I absolutely love &amp; use every one!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles at the moment and hopefully never will after using these great products. My skin feels soft after using this and I like to layer it with the vitamin c spf30 cream. It has a very light scent that goes away after you put it on and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky on the face. So far so good:)</li>
            <li> love it so far- so good!</li>
            <li> I,ve been slowly switching to all the sublime products for the last few months. Glycolic  and salicylic ifserum, along with the new ageless line, face whisperer and the dry brushing, recommended by sublime beauty website, made all the different for me. I became a firm believer that using cosmetic fro just one manufacturer makes all the difference to the skin aperiane, working to deliver the promices. Looking forward to try all the sublime beauty products in order to select the perfect combination for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I was in search of a more affordable, multipurpose alternative to my department store-brand serums, which are pretty pricey and only treat one area of concern, such as aging only or acne only. Although this serum is marketed as anti-aging, I really think that it should more so be noted for its acne-fighting abilities because it has proved to be one of the most effective serums for acne I have tried.  + Surprisingly very effective for acne. I have acne-prone skin and did not expect this serum to help clear up my face because I thought it was just an anti-aging product, but the glycolic and salicylic acids have truly helped to clear up my oily skin and dry out my often-red blemishes.  + Essentially multiple beauty products combined into one. As part of my beauty routine, I use a daily face wash with salicylic acid, a nightly pore refiner primer, a daily serum, and a weekly exfoliator, all of which can get pretty expensive. This serum combines all of those different products into one since applying it a couple of times each week has helped to unclog my pores, exfoliate my skin of hidden residue, and clear up my blemishes.  + Multipurpose. This can be used as an all-over serum if you have aging skin concerns, or as a spot treatment if you have acne concerns. Personally, my blemishes respond well to glycolic and salicylic acid as an acne treatment, but my sensitive skin dries out if it gets too much of those two ingredients, so I have started using this serum as a nightly spot treatment.  * One thing to note before purchasing is that different skin types will likely respond differently to glycolic and salicylic acid. These are very effective but strong ingredients that may dry out skin, so be sure to only use this serum all-over a couple of times each week, or prepare to use it as a spot treatment nightly. I do both on a regular interval basis and have seen drastic improvements in the way my skin looks - my blemishes around my chin have cleared up, and my face looks radiant without getting oily or shiny throughout the day. Highly recommend this product, and that is coming from someone who has tried seemingly a million different acne products the last few years.  I received a sample of this anti-aging serum from Sublime Beauty for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Use 3 times a weeks and my skin feels smoother and more refined. Received product at discount for review.</li>
