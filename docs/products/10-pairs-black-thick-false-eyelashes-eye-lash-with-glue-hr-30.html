            <li>anyways love these lashes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on them.</li>
            <li>but thats okay</li>
            <li>They hold well, and they definitely add great volume!</li>
            <li>I shared them since there were so many .</li>
            <li>I bought these lashes because they looked nice and full.</li>
            <li>Besides that, these lashes are great if you want more than a natural eye look.</li>
            <li>Lashes nice and bold</li>
            <li>These are good eyelashes, very voluminous and Vegas-y.</li>
            <li>very cute , nice product,goes on good and firm bendable and</li>
            <li>Other than no glue these lashes look great!</li>
            <li>These lashes are so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They were fine and worked, as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a little extension and brighten up your eyes, these are great !!!</li>
            <li>These got here really fast, the package was in nice condition and unopened</li>
            <li>So in conclusion these are absolutely fabulous lashes</li>
            <li>THEY ARE CHEAP....</li>
            <li>They apply very easily and look really awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They last all day when applied correctly and they look natural and beautiful!</li>
            <li>really like them , makes eyes have pop and senual look for evening or day,very good price and came fast</li>
            <li>just not as full as i wanted them to be.</li>
            <li>IM TOTALLY PLEASED WITH THIS PROVIDER WITH THE WAY HOW FAST THIS ITEM CAME</li>
            <li>Full and sleek looking lashes.</li>
            <li>these are super wide, so they are good for trimming.</li>
            <li>WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>Have to trim them to give a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money .</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect for any false lashes.</li>
            <li>Overall, they are great lashes and are definitely full but way too long for me.</li>
            <li>The lashes are good for me and aren&#x27;t too heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Revlon&#x27;s eyelash glue, it holds on strong and it has a brush applicator and it dries clear</li>
            <li>which was alright with me since I have a personal favorite for lash glue since I have sensitive eyes!</li>
            <li>so be gentle there</li>
            <li>I only ordered these lashes because they were cheap</li>
            <li>I had to wait a whole month to get this</li>
            <li>I havent even had a chance to wear them and it really upsets me that I cant.</li>
            <li>When I put them on I was VERY upset.</li>
            <li>The photos they shpw with them on are very misleading.</li>
            <li>you really can just go get some...</li>
            <li>They shipped fast too .l</li>
            <li>I liked the lashes, but the glue in every package was dried up</li>
            <li>I was so excited when they finally came and they took forever to come but whatever they come from china</li>
            <li>I have cut the tubes open just to make sure and not a single drop of glue was in those tubes.</li>
            <li>and I did not have high expectations.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I do recommend is getting your own glue but other than that</li>
            <li>Kind of hard when I doing a job and have no glue.</li>
            <li>I expected the quality to be sub-par because they were so cheap</li>
            <li>I normally can get 4-5 wears out of one pair of lashes.</li>
            <li>but normally I would buy them by pack of 5 for a $1.00</li>
            <li>The lashes are well made and for 10 pairs for $6 including shipping are very worth it although don&#x27;t rely on the glue that it comes with because I have opened about 2 tubes of those and both were empty</li>
            <li>The lashes are good, but every single tube of glue was dried out.</li>
            <li>some people like it to look a little more natural and this is for you.</li>
            <li>They are very full just like the picture and come neatly in a little box for storage.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I really like them, this is my second order</li>
            <li>Be gentle removing glue there fragile and will break.</li>
            <li>But I was so pleasantly surprised when I received my order.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE UR</li>
            <li>THEY ARE THICK AND SEXY</li>
            <li>WORTH THE MONEY SPENT!</li>
            <li>$ is not less.</li>
            <li>They are really full and thick, but the are pretty stiff and look pretty unnatural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that major</li>
            <li>AND I WILL BE USING THEM AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional Make-up Artist who buys lashes in bulk on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>They are also a little stiff, but they do look cute on.</li>
            <li>I went to try the first pair on and noticed there wasn&#x27;t any glue in the little tube.</li>
            <li>The lashes are a bit stiff and don&#x27;t really give a natural look.</li>
            <li>Cheap very thick band does not stay on with glue</li>

            <li> Cheap very thick band does not stay on with glue</li>
            <li> and they arrived earlier than what I anticipated and they last for a long time.</li>
            <li> FULL AND NOT TOO THIN....</li>
            <li> Lasting me a long time!</li>
            <li> but it just contained several small empty tubes, even when i got a high quality name brand eyelash glue</li>
            <li> When I put them on I looked like I was ready for halloween or even a drag show, not cute at all.</li>
            <li> When I received them and tried it on, I found that they were too long.</li>
            <li> Lashes are too long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard at first</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little set back.</li>
            <li> one of them was defekt, but that were what i have expected.</li>
            <li> All the glue packets were empty, however.</li>
            <li> They are empty cases at the pack of each pack.</li>
            <li> My advice, save your money and watch carefully for things like this.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes came in quite sooner than i expected.  </li>
            <li> Some of the glue were empty and don&#x27;t stick well.</li>
            <li> The packaging sucks (not the person selling but the lashes package itself) and the lashes last long</li>
            <li> Each glue tube was completely empty!  </li>
            <li> If you like realistic but dramatic lashes then these are for you.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money,i do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews before purchasing!  </li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT: The lashes are made well for what you pay, each set of lashes comes with a little tube of glue</li>
            <li> The lashes that I usually wear are Ardell&#x27;s, but their prices keep going up every other week.</li>
            <li> It was very stiff and would not really bend to place on the eye.</li>
            <li> wasted my time on opening the glue packs.</li>
            <li> Glue that is suppose to come with each pair,is completely dried up.</li>
            <li> Glue came with was dried out and unusable</li>
            <li> I really liked these lashes when I saw them but the guy is horrible!</li>
            <li> The glue is dried out but, come on, buy a tube for around $4.00 in the drug store.</li>
            <li> Yes these are a little stiff if you&#x27;re not used to putting them on.</li>
            <li> They are WAY too dramatic, even if I was going for a dramatic look they are still too much.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my little sister for when she gets her makeup done!</li>
            <li> they are a little bit flimsy  hard to put on  </li>
            <li> i had bought these lashes because i wanted to try out fake big lashes</li>
            <li> Its hard to get it off.</li>
            <li> at least there are a lot of them</li>
            <li> The lash band was way to thick.</li>
            <li> Poorly made, and STIFF.</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to get off of the package but not that difficult.</li>
            <li> wouldnt buy it again, for personal reasons, not that its a bad product.</li>
            <li> Sadly :/</li>
            <li> The glue isn&#x27;t so well, so I didn&#x27;t use the glue that came with the false lashes.  </li>
            <li> i just read before writing this one there is no glue just empty tubes:(</li>
            <li> SO FAKE</li>
            <li> I have been wearing fake lashed for forty years</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re very dramatic.</li>
            <li> If you want something that&#x27;s obviously fake then these are for you!  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed</li>
            <li> I was very shocked and disappointed.</li>
            <li> but these are horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE MY EYE LASHES THEY ARE THICK AND SEXY MAKES YOUR EYES LOOK EXOTIC. LOVE THEM ! I WILL DEF BUY AGAIN AS ALWAYS THX GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> BEAUTIFUL....WOULD RECOMMEND....FULL AND NOT TOO THIN....LOVE LOVE LOVE....PREFER NOT HAVE THE PRE GLUED LASHES...EASIER TO WORK WITH....NICE JOB AMAZON. WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> The eye lashes seem used. The glue is not even there. I like the fullness but doesnt work. Sadly :/</li>
            <li> These got here really fast, the package was in nice condition and unopened so I felt safe opening it. :P  THE PRODUCT: The lashes are made well for what you pay, each set of lashes comes with a little tube of glue but it&#x27;s not too reliable so I&#x27;m ordering another kind. It&#x27;s not that major but it&#x27;s a little set back. The lashes are good for me and aren&#x27;t too heavy at all.</li>
            <li> i had bought these lashes because i wanted to try out fake big lashes and i was so happy when they came i couldnt wait to put a pair on and like on many reviews i just read before writing this one there is no glue just empty tubes:(</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking of very good deal. But i must say you&#x27;ll get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;1.99 $ + Shipping Still it costed me around 8$.&lt;br /&gt;And 8$ is not less. These are totally plastics and with no glue.&lt;br /&gt;They have given glue packs but all are empty.&lt;br /&gt;Just wasted my time on opening the glue packs.</li>
            <li> Cheap very thick band does not stay on with glue</li>
            <li> These lashes are so easy to apply. i even raised mine up toward the outer area of my eyes and it gave me a beautiful almond shape i loove these eyelashes i will def. order more</li>
            <li> I really like them, this is my second order and they arrived earlier than what I anticipated and they last for a long time. I normally can get 4-5 wears out of one pair of lashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes are well made and for 10 pairs for $6 including shipping are very worth it although don&#x27;t rely on the glue that it comes with because I have opened about 2 tubes of those and both were empty I have cut the tubes open just to make sure and not a single drop of glue was in those tubes.</li>
            <li> I give the product an over-all rating of 5 stars, but for this review, I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars because none of the eyelash glue has any glue in them. I have to buy the glue separately.</li>
            <li> very cute , nice product,goes on good and firm bendable and firm,,,i really like them , makes eyes have pop and senual look for evening or day,very good price and came fast delivery,,,love them want more,like plenty more,,</li>
            <li> These lashes are very cheap. Poorly made, and STIFF. I went to try the first pair on and noticed there wasn&#x27;t any glue in the little tube. I opened the next one to use that glue, NO GLUE was in the tube. I opened 6 out of the 10 pair looking for a tube that actually had GLUE in it. Well, come to my surprise there was NO GLUE WHAT SO EVER IN ANY OF THE 10 TUBES. These lashes are a JOKE anyway!</li>
            <li> Beautiful!! I reuse next day!! Different kind each order but still nice!! Be gentle removing glue there fragile and will break. I&#x27;ve also even had some break trying to get them out of the pack so be gentle there too they may be the only problem I have with the lashes I get from this seller.</li>
            <li> I used to used that brand eyelash months ago but normally I would buy them by pack of 5 for a $1.00 and I do recommend it, just the glue suck</li>
            <li> wouldnt buy it again, for personal reasons, not that its a bad product. just not as full as i wanted them to be. some people like it to look a little more natural and this is for you. would recommend this product. good quality, sturdy, its nice.</li>
            <li> I only ordered these lashes because they were cheap and I did not have high expectations. But I was so pleasantly surprised when I received my order.&lt;br /&gt;The lashes are packaged just like the picture depicts. They apply very easily and look really awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the glue that comes with the lashes is nothing to write home about. I suggest using NYX Lash glue. You can purchase it at Ulta or online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely order these lashes if you wear falsies often or if you&#x27;re a makeup artist.</li>
            <li> Wow! Was I impressed.... I do not use the glue so I threw mine out. Lashes nice and bold I get lots of compliments but definitely get lash glue like Duo</li>
            <li> I had to wait a whole month to get this and once I did they didnt look anything like the picture displayed and there was no glue included into the package. I am so disappointed</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the best.  They are really full and thick, but the are pretty stiff and look pretty unnatural.  If you want something that&#x27;s obviously fake then these are for you!  They also aren&#x27;t the kind that you can wear more than once!</li>
            <li> They were fine and worked, as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Only one of them was defekt, but that were what i have expected.</li>
            <li> Glue that is suppose to come with each pair,is completely dried up. This is not worth the money,i do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The lash band was way to thick. It was very stiff and would not really bend to place on the eye.</li>
            <li> I OVER LOVE MY LASHES! They are AWESOME!!!! Will be ordering more. I will spread the word! Great lashes thank you so much signed happy custo</li>
            <li> I loved them and will be ordering more thank you.I have all my girls wonting some so i told them all about you</li>
            <li> These are good eyelashes, very voluminous and Vegas-y. All the glue packets were empty, however.</li>
            <li> Bold and beautiful. Great for stage!</li>
            <li> I love this eyelashes! Would defintely order them again.</li>
            <li> IM TOTALLY PLEASED WITH THIS PROVIDER WITH THE WAY HOW FAST THIS ITEM CAME AND IT WAS PACKAGE IN A NICE BOX AND I WILL BE USING THEM AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are good for the price but they do have a lot of adhesive to make them stick to the plastic tray. Its hard to get it off. They are also a little stiff, but they do look cute on.</li>
            <li> Awesome lashes. Great quality. Could go for 3 or 4 uses. Glue came with was dried out and unusable which was alright with me since I have a personal favorite for lash glue since I have sensitive eyes! GREAT PRODUCT! WORTH THE MONEY SPENT!</li>
            <li> I really liked these lashes when I saw them but the guy is horrible! I havent even had a chance to wear them and it really upsets me that I cant.</li>
            <li> they are a little bit flimsy  hard to put on  but kind of okay  at least there are a lot of them</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. The packaging sucks (not the person selling but the lashes package itself) and the lashes last long I can reuse them better than those $2 for 10 pack of lashes in china (which tear after one or two uses) anyways love these lashes I would definitely buy it again. It&#x27;s a little hard at first but eventually it gets flexible</li>
            <li> These are my favorite lashes! If you like realistic but dramatic lashes then these are for you. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on them. They are just perfect! They don&#x27;t come with eyelash glue but thats okay because I like using my Revlon glue instead. I highly recommend Revlon&#x27;s eyelash glue, it holds on strong and it has a brush applicator and it dries clear so it&#x27;s perfect for any false lashes. So in conclusion these are absolutely fabulous lashes and I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional Make-up Artist who buys lashes in bulk on a regular basis.  I came across these and thought these were a great deal so I ordered them.  I expected the quality to be sub-par because they were so cheap but these are horrible.  I would NEVER wear these or apply on my clients.  They remind me of the lashes you see on those old-school baby dolls.  Very cheap looking.  Probably won&#x27;t bother returning but I definitely won&#x27;t be using them.</li>
            <li> The glues do not exist. They are empty cases at the pack of each pack. I was very shocked and disappointed.</li>
            <li> The lashes are good, but every single tube of glue was dried out. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Lasting me a long time! I have used maybe 3 pairs in about 4 months! They hold well, and they definitely add great volume!</li>
            <li> DO NOT!!!! I REPEAT DO NOT WASTE UR $ ON THESE!!!! GRANTED THEY ARE CHEAP....BUT THEY LOOK SO FAKE ITS A SHAME!!!!! THIS IS A CASE OF &amp;#34;U GET WHAT U PAY FOR!!!!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I was so excited when they finally came and they took forever to come but whatever they come from china what do you expect. When I put them on I was VERY upset. They are WAY too dramatic, even if I was going for a dramatic look they are still too much. When I put them on I looked like I was ready for halloween or even a drag show, not cute at all. My advice, save your money and watch carefully for things like this. BELIEVE THE COMMENTS.</li>
            <li> These are nice lashes. But be warmed they&#x27;re very dramatic. The photos they shpw with them on are very misleading. And there is no glue bt for the price you really can just go get some...</li>
            <li> The eyelashes came in quite sooner than i expected.  They are very full just like the picture and come neatly in a little box for storage.  The only thing that I do recommend is getting your own glue but other than that I would definitely recommend these to others!</li>
            <li> I wear these everyday,easy to put on and they r great!I will order more! Very sexy! And my eyes pop out!</li>
            <li> I bought these lashes because they looked nice and full. When I received them and tried it on, I found that they were too long. The lashes are a bit stiff and don&#x27;t really give a natural look. Some of the glue were empty and don&#x27;t stick well. So I would recommend buying your own glue. Overall, they are great lashes and are definitely full but way too long for me.</li>
            <li> This was suppose to include the eyelash glue but it just contained several small empty tubes, even when i got a high quality name brand eyelash glue the lashes do  not stay on. I can not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am always leery about buying online. But I was very happy to receive these and they are just what I wanted! Love them!</li>
            <li> Lashes are too long.  Have to trim them to give a more natural look.  The glue isn&#x27;t so well, so I didn&#x27;t use the glue that came with the false lashes.  Besides that, these lashes are great if you want more than a natural eye look.</li>
            <li> I just went to the post office to pick up my package and was very happy with the lashes that were inside. I have been wearing fake lashed for forty years and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different kinds. Yes these are a little stiff if you&#x27;re not used to putting them on. The glue is dried out but, come on, buy a tube for around $4.00 in the drug store. The lashes that I usually wear are Ardell&#x27;s, but their prices keep going up every other week. I use to pay6  $2.50 a pair now they&#x27;e up to almost $6.00 I personally can&#x27;t afford them anymore, so I had to look elsewhere. I can&#x27;t believe I can get 10 pairs for this price. I&#x27;m very happy and will be ordering a lot of them because I have to wear lashes. I don&#x27;t have any of my own.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews before purchasing!  I bought these so my 5th grader could perfect his Alex (Clockwork Orange) costume for Halloween.  When we went to put them on, however, we discovered there was no glue in ANY of the packages. Each glue tube was completely empty!  So the lashes may seem like a bargain, but you have to go buy your own glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on the quality of the lashes because, after buying the glue, I never managed to get the lashes on The Boy.  Too squirmy, and it turned in to quite the debacle.  We had to draw lashes on his face. Still looked like a good Alex, though.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely fast and my order came in a beautiful package! I bought these for my little sister for when she gets her makeup done! They last all day when applied correctly and they look natural and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Full and sleek looking lashes. Take time with the glue and trim to your eyes! these are super wide, so they are good for trimming.</li>
            <li> this pack of 10 is awesome, they ear well and are pretty comfortable. well worth the money . They shipped fast too .l I shared them since there were so many . if you are looking for a little extension and brighten up your eyes, these are great !!!</li>
            <li> I liked the lashes, but the glue in every package was dried up and I could&#x27;nt use it. Kind of hard when I doing a job and have no glue. Probably wpnt order from here again</li>
            <li> These lashes were a steal for the price! They are a little hard to get off of the package but not that difficult. Everything is as pictured only there is no glue so i suggest buying a separate bottle. Other than no glue these lashes look great!</li>
