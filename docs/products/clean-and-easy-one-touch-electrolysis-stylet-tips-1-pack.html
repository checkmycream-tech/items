            <li>Good cost for what you get.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was good and the tips wernt bent.</li>
            <li>but these were good as a backup item.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before and I am very pleased with the One Touch Stylet Tip.</li>
            <li>The stylet tips bend very easily.  </li>
            <li>Since this is a review for the stylus tips and not the device I will write more there.</li>
            <li>This is more of a design flaw than a criticism of the stylet tip.</li>
            <li>You pay more for razor blades.</li>
            <li>The postage should have come to 1.95 at most.</li>
            <li>Im sure</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want to spend 100$ or more</li>
            <li>This is ok, but they bend too easily for my liking</li>
            <li>however they break way to easy because they bend too easily</li>
            <li>They work to some extent, but they bend way too easily.</li>
            <li>They bend sooooo easy, they shouldn&#x27;t be so pricey.</li>
            <li>The wire in the stylet tip is easily bent when replacing the plastic and metal cover on the electralysis machine.</li>
            <li>They will bend easily, but I think thats the nature of the beast.  </li>
            <li>They do bend easily, but I just cut it off at the bend, disinfect and reuse the tip for awhile.  </li>
            <li>They bend so easily and you end up having no stylet or having to purchase them constantly-stopped buying them.</li>
            <li>The tend to bend easily.</li>
            <li>its always good to have extras,came on time and all new.</li>
            <li>They work fine for the electrolysis kit -</li>
            <li>They insert into the pours nicely, but will bend very easy if not careful.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend the whole Deluxe Electrolysys machine product and these tips are of no use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but my once, gorilla toes, are now hair free.</li>
            <li>Hoping Clean and Easy (seller) also has tips that are the correct length again.</li>
            <li>really they work ok.</li>
            <li>and you have the time then its not a bad product to have for some quick modifications to your hygiene</li>
            <li>so I gave up the whole method of product removal, but you don&#x27;t mind changing them every couple of weeks or month than you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>but the needles prevent the success I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to straighten it enough without damaging it.</li>
            <li>The whole process is time-consuming, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>if the system these were meant for worked I would have rated this higher.  </li>
            <li>Just right with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The company will not only sell you defective, and possibly used products - which can pass on contagions to you - but when notified, will not respond in any coherent relevant way.  </li>
            <li>for large areas-</li>
            <li>The machine itself is flimsy and breaks down too easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the needle seem to bend much and it takes time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have VERY noticeable scars from using this device.</li>
            <li>After buying many boxes that were unusable because the tips were too short, I was able to get stylet tips that were long enough again.</li>
            <li>The tips are fine, they work with the One Touch (all model years seem to be the same - works on the one my mom had in the 80&#x27;s and the more recent model I purchased several years</li>
            <li>i have unwanted facial hair around my lips and and neck - plus hair on my eye brows that i clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, I am always wanting to be more than the average customer, so I look at the technicalities of how these systems work.</li>
            <li>I had no real luck using this product and found professional galvanic electrolysis to be a better investment for permanent hair removal.</li>
            <li>Back in the 90&#x27;s, it seemed like I was able to use one needle a few times; but these days I am lucky to get into one pore before the needle bends.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it has very much diminish the amount of facial hair: and yes it is permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They certainly do not make exchanges easy, or even possible.  </li>
            <li>the needle retracts completely and never reaches root of the hair.</li>
            <li>think the tips are too short, in the sense that you can&#x27;t really reach the root of the hair to zap it - this is the fault of the machine and how the stylet is designed.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, planned obsolescence is a major part of this product, so I had to order more tips right away.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to open the new stylus tips yet.</li>
            <li>It is very cheaply made, poorly designed, and gimicky.</li>
            <li>I never used the tips, because the Deluxe Electrolysis... was useless.  </li>
            <li>So far the second one has done several hundred hairs and counting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I wasted money for the electrolysis for the first place</li>

            <li> Some tips are actually defective, and will not be long enough once installed correctly in the appliance.</li>
            <li> complete let down in my book.</li>
            <li> These tips will not last you very long.</li>
            <li> the tips are forever long.</li>
            <li> do  they need to be that long?</li>
            <li> especially in places where the skin is rough like your under arms</li>
            <li> They work well for thick hairs but very fine hairs are difficult to treat and the follicle is much smaller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure Ill have a few scars form the learning process.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I bought these for a total of $7 with s&amp;h.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BYPLE has absolutely no business being supported by Amazon.  </li>
            <li> These were replacement tips and were just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that these are too costly (as the product hasn&#x27;t improved any).</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I am very careful not to bend it, but it always happens.</li>
            <li> Putting it in, dropping it, sitting it down storage, and use can all bend it.</li>
            <li> This method of insertion results in less bent metal stylet tips.</li>
            <li> and the \\&quot;needle\\&quot; gets pulled out of the base way too easily.  </li>
            <li> I got this about a week ago and at first felt like it was impossible to use.</li>
            <li> This weighed less an ounce and yet was 5.10 to ship!  </li>
            <li> SAVE your face..even if your desperate.. GET LASER and then get a little electrolysis that the laser didnt clear after..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen such a useless product.</li>
            <li> They often bend while being installed-too expensive for the short time they work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is used for small area- not large&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;parts of bikini and face</li>
            <li> I just hate that they are very unforgiving for any slight misdirection.  </li>
            <li> The machine came with two and the first one didn&#x27;t break I tried to make it longer and pulled it out of the base.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about the tips, but this electrolysis machine is a total waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I mean, they are replacements.  </li>
            <li> Icky!</li>
            <li> Very hard to get into the root of the hair</li>
            <li> , I did not use it at all, and these tips are so weak!</li>
            <li> Lousy</li>
            <li> To add 3.15 S&amp;H for a product this small was crazy!</li>
            <li> Just useless, it did nothing for my hypothyroidism or the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Once it is bent, it is impossible to use it.</li>
            <li> It bends and crooks and it&#x27;s impossible to use it.</li>
            <li> Did not work at ALL, and was incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> Painful!</li>
            <li> It was AWFUL!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> SAVE your face..even if your desperate.. GET LASER and then get a little electrolysis that the laser didnt clear after..</li>
            <li> I like them because I need them in order to do my electrolysis... however they break way to easy because they bend too easily and the \\&quot;needle\\&quot; gets pulled out of the base way too easily.  Yet they get the job done. So yes I buy them, but I also think that they could and definitely should make some improvements on these things...</li>
            <li> I got this about a week ago and at first felt like it was impossible to use. I&#x27;m sure Ill have a few scars form the learning process. I stuck with it. Since this is a review for the stylus tips and not the device I will write more there. I haven&#x27;t had to open the new stylus tips yet.The machine came with two and the first one didn&#x27;t break I tried to make it longer and pulled it out of the base.So far the second one has done several hundred hairs and counting. I don&#x27;t find them that fragile. Im jsut hoping the replacement stylus are smaller than the ones that came with it. They work well for thick hairs but very fine hairs are difficult to treat and the follicle is much smaller.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about the tips, but this electrolysis machine is a total waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Great product, as listed. I have used this product before and I am very pleased with the One Touch Stylet Tip.</li>
            <li> Product is way too flimsy!!!! Lousy a!$ product!!!!A complete let down in my book. I would rate this at zero if I could!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen such a useless product. Very hard to get into the root of the hair and it never never worked even once for me. I would not recommend the whole Deluxe Electrolysys machine product and these tips are of no use.</li>
            <li> They work to some extent, but they bend way too easily. They often bend while being installed-too expensive for the short time they work.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I bought these for a total of $7 with s&amp;h. Today they are $10 with s&amp;h! They bend sooooo easy, they shouldn&#x27;t be so pricey.</li>
            <li> I have the One-touch electrolysis machine and needed additional stylet tips to use with it.  I was happy to see that I could&lt;br /&gt;order it at Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> These tips will not last you very long. I am very careful not to bend it, but it always happens. Putting it in, dropping it, sitting it down storage, and use can all bend it. I haven&#x27;t been able to straighten it enough without damaging it.</li>
            <li> its always good to have extras,came on time and all new. thakn you</li>
            <li> The wire in the stylet tip is easily bent when replacing the plastic and metal cover on the electralysis machine. Once it is bent, it is impossible to use it. This is more of a design flaw than a criticism of the stylet tip. I found it helpful to hold he cover hear my ear to listen while inserting he stylet tip. If a metal springing noice is heard, back off and try again util he metal tip comes out of the end of the cover without a metal springing noise. This method of insertion results in less bent metal stylet tips.</li>
            <li> Back in the 90&#x27;s, it seemed like I was able to use one needle a few times; but these days I am lucky to get into one pore before the needle bends.  Not to mention, in order for the needle to get into the pore, I have to glue the springs in place or else the needle retracts completely and never reaches root of the hair. I agree with other reviewers that these are too costly (as the product hasn&#x27;t improved any). The electrolysis kit does work but the needles prevent the success I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with this product.</li>
            <li> This is ok, but they bend too easily for my liking so I gave up the whole method of product removal, but you don&#x27;t mind changing them every couple of weeks or month than you should be fine.  Other than that really they work ok.</li>
            <li> Would reccomend it to anyone who has a hair problem on their chin, face, cheeks, eyebrows, or any where else.</li>
            <li> Did not work at ALL, and was incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> They work fine for the electrolysis kit - I just hate that they are very unforgiving for any slight misdirection.  They will bend easily, but I think thats the nature of the beast.  Good cost for what you get.  I mean, they are replacements.  You pay more for razor blades.</li>
            <li> The tips are fine, they work with the One Touch (all model years seem to be the same - works on the one my mom had in the 80&#x27;s and the more recent model I purchased several years ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the tips are too short, in the sense that you can&#x27;t really reach the root of the hair to zap it - this is the fault of the machine and how the stylet is designed. I had no real luck using this product and found professional galvanic electrolysis to be a better investment for permanent hair removal.</li>
            <li> Product is inconsistent in quality at best.  Some tips are actually defective, and will not be long enough once installed correctly in the appliance. Others have defective springs - you&#x27;ll get one use, maybe two. If you do buy these - and they do work, when manufactured correctly - do NOT buy from BYPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BYPLE has absolutely no business being supported by Amazon.  The company will not only sell you defective, and possibly used products - which can pass on contagions to you - but when notified, will not respond in any coherent relevant way.  They certainly do not make exchanges easy, or even possible.  Either the people at BYPLE cannot speak English well or simply do not care.</li>
            <li> These were replacement tips and were just what I expected.  They do bend easily, but I just cut it off at the bend, disinfect and reuse the tip for awhile.  I bought the one touch a couple of years ago.  I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but my once, gorilla toes, are now hair free. -(No offense to any gorillas)</li>
            <li> This weighed less an ounce and yet was 5.10 to ship!  The postage should have come to 1.95 at most. To add 3.15 S&amp;H for a product this small was crazy!</li>
            <li> I tried using an at-home electrolysis kit. It was AWFUL!!! Painful! Icky! I sent the kit back and these replacement styluses. I will NOT purchase a similar product again.</li>
            <li> After buying many boxes that were unusable because the tips were too short, I was able to get stylet tips that were long enough again. Purchased a 1-pack from BYPLE and they were like the originals I had, and worked great. Unfortunately, planned obsolescence is a major part of this product, so I had to order more tips right away. Hoping Clean and Easy (seller) also has tips that are the correct length again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I wasted money for the electrolysis for the first place, I did not use it at all, and these tips are so weak! It bends and crooks and it&#x27;s impossible to use it.</li>
            <li> They bend so easily and you end up having no stylet or having to purchase them constantly-stopped buying them. The machine itself is flimsy and breaks down too easily and quickly. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Perfect addition to the Deluxe Electrolysis One Touch</li>
            <li> the tips are forever long. do  they need to be that long? i feel like I&#x27;m going to break them sometimes. especially in places where the skin is rough like your under arms</li>
            <li> I never used the tips, because the Deluxe Electrolysis... was useless.  Just useless, it did nothing for my hypothyroidism or the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I like the way this device is set up. Of course, I am always wanting to be more than the average customer, so I look at the technicalities of how these systems work. The whole process is time-consuming, but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Works great in the home electrolysis device. They insert into the pours nicely, but will bend very easy if not careful.</li>
            <li> Im sure if the system these were meant for worked I would have rated this higher.  Packaging was good and the tips wernt bent.</li>
            <li> The tend to bend easily. Fragile, but work and do their job.</li>
            <li> being a male i have unwanted facial hair around my lips and and neck - plus hair on my eye brows that i clean off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has very much diminish the amount of facial hair: and yes it is permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the needle seem to bend much and it takes time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its best to use this product with salt water - works more efficiently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is used for small area- not large&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;parts of bikini and face that&#x27;s about it and neck -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend 100$ or more and you have the time then its not a bad product to have for some quick modifications to your hygiene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for large areas- id frankly just suggest to look for lazic  removal deals because in my personal opinion no product can do the job of lazic</li>
            <li> Time consuming but works great.</li>
            <li> Just right with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The stylet tips bend very easily.  I do not recommend these for purchase.  Wish I had not purchased the electrolysis machine.</li>
            <li> but these were good as a backup item.  I still haven&#x27;t had to buy another box admittedly, so I would only recommend one if you just use it yourself.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great for the no mi&#x3D;ore hair people!</li>
            <li> If you have the electrolysis kit, you&#x27;re gonna need these eventually.</li>
            <li> I have VERY noticeable scars from using this device. It is very cheaply made, poorly designed, and gimicky. I wish I hadn&#x27;t ignored all of the reviews advising people to leave electrolysis to the professionals. It can work but you might be left with patches of discolored skin.</li>
