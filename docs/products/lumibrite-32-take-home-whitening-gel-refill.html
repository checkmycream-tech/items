            <li>Arrived in good time.</li>
            <li>Good value gel, which I used with plastic made to measure holders from my dentists.</li>
            <li>A good buy all around.</li>
            <li>I have not had a good tube of it yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to get this gel in a GOOD delivery system.</li>
            <li>But, now that I can get it for a better price I love it!!</li>
            <li>however, he charged me about 50% more!  </li>
            <li>This is easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li>however it works just fine and is a great price.</li>
            <li>This product is really amazing.</li>
            <li>Not a miracle worker, but does a nice job.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why I use it at night- by morning, the striations are gone and teeth are nice and</li>
            <li>The product itself is just as effective as the one I purchased from my dentist for $30.00 a tube.  </li>
            <li>I have my own trays molded by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>mint flavor isn&#x27;t very strong but it doesn&#x27;t mask the peroxide taste at all.</li>
            <li>The Whitening gel does not come out of the seringe easily!</li>
            <li>Sane exact thing as what I got at dentist&#x27;s office, and at a great discount.</li>
            <li>Whitens your teeth greatly within the first 5 days.  </li>
            <li>This gel really does a great job.</li>
            <li>I guess if I had a big date and wanted to look my best</li>
            <li>I can tell you that I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times.  </li>
            <li>I leave this on 1 hour which is more than the recommended time</li>
            <li>love this gel.  </li>
            <li>No terrible smell.  </li>
            <li>Not knowing any better, I paid it and kept buying them.  </li>
            <li>sure that it is better than those that take 30 minutes tho</li>
            <li>Most dogs in his breed are arthritic by his age.  </li>
            <li>but hopefully it gets better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not disgusting</li>
            <li>Also, I have a concern that the product&#x27;s effects are short-lived and you have to keep buying more and more to maintain any whitening that does occur.</li>
            <li>AND I FEEL SAFE USING IT.  </li>
            <li>You just&lt;br /&gt;need to make sure that you have a mouth form set up</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with my new smile</li>
            <li>This wonderful product is affordable on Amazon as opposed to other methods.</li>
            <li>Whitens as advertised and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This gel is much more effective than the one supplied by my dentist, which needed to be in for 30 minutes plus and made my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The price is fantastic too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me, I just don&#x27;t understand why it doesn&#x27;t come out as smoothly.</li>
            <li>Cheap product.</li>
            <li>This is great whitener in that it really only takes 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>Great product, same as what my dentist gave me for whitening...... way cheaper on amazon though!</li>
            <li>Not too impressed after a few months.</li>
            <li>I bought the refills at a great price to further whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>LumiBrite is pretty strong stuff!</li>
            <li>Super cheap and</li>
            <li>get this product for about the same price from my dentist, so I think I will stick to that method to ensure freshness, but it is a good product.</li>
            <li>I leave mine on the full hour, but supposedly you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the drug srtore products, but none of them worked as quickly and efficiently as this one.</li>
            <li>The very first time used, my teeth were 5 shades whiter than what I had just done at the Dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>MY TEETH ARE REAL AND NOT ONE SHADE OF WHITENESS AT ALL!!</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the deal products like crest white stripes and all of the others are very quick/ temporary solutions that really aren&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing online instead of the dentist because of cost savings.</li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t shoot off as it had before ... and boom -- 4 days worth of gel out.</li>
            <li>It is useful and practical.  </li>
            <li>I found that I was going through the syringes pretty quickly, though, so I started putting the gel on a toothbrush to apply it to my teeth, then putting my custom trays on.</li>
            <li>a few years ago through a livingsocial special and loved it.</li>
            <li>I do suggest using a remineralizing gel right after using the LumiBrite 32%--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used products that cost this same amount (and more) that did NOTHING, I even fell for that light thing gimmick you shine on your teeth that makes you look like a complete fool.</li>
            <li>This product lightens your teeth the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li>Oh yeah, and the LumiBrite does work really well to brighten teeth!</li>
            <li>The first syringe that I opened up keeps getting stuck.  </li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>I do recommend, drying your teeth with a towel prior to application, so the gel sticks better.</li>
            <li>I bought my first batch of LumiBrite from my dentist as a &#x27;touch-up kit&#x27; after going through Zoom tooth whiting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27; good to find a place that will save a few bucks and no sales tax to pay. will buy again</li>
            <li>Great Price as the Dentist tries to charge $100 for this same item.</li>
            <li>I had a good result from my last whitening which was almost ten years ago.</li>
            <li>Good whitening was achieved...not super white, but I think my natural tooth color is somewhat yellowish, and there is probably only so much that can be done with my coffee-stained teeth.</li>
            <li>I had experience no discomfort and was able to keep it in for about 30mins, which is the same amount of time I normally keep in my whitener.</li>
            <li>Effects:&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to make my teeth more sensitive in general.</li>
            <li>I like this gel cause its easy to use and only takes 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t get more than 5 days per syringe and the gel will dry out if not capped immediately after application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works VERY well whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This has worked like a charm and my teeth is sooo much whiter.</li>
            <li>This solution is very airy and bubbly.  </li>
            <li>this stuff really works well...  </li>
            <li>Product was very cloudy.</li>
            <li>it was very grainy and bubbled in my mouth like I was foaming.</li>
            <li>This purchase was a real find -- much cheaper than what my dentist was selling it</li>
            <li>They let me believe it was only available through them.</li>
            <li>When I tried to get the solution out of the syringe, it was not working very well.</li>
            <li>i get ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have just started using it, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I am especially surprised that it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and my teeth are already whiter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference in whiteness at all.</li>
            <li>better product than expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was free and next day.</li>
            <li>Originally I was worried it would be expired because I thought this could only be some by a dentist</li>
            <li>Professional performance for the half the price, it doesn&#x27;t get much better than that!</li>
            <li>I have only used it once since its arrival but the product works as good as the previous set from my dentist in Jersey.</li>
            <li>highly suggest it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I recently went to my dentist who provided me complimentary teeth whitening trays and some tubes.</li>
            <li>With the dentist syringes I got about two weeks worth, with this product I only got TWO DAYS worth&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t need to purchase new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice to find a product that works and takes only a few minutes to do the job.  </li>
            <li>The 2 things I strongly dislike about this product is that it is grainy, so putting it in teeth whitening trays was kind of weird... and that this stuff foams in my mouth, so I was constantly getting up to spit in the sink.</li>
            <li>Better then any other home whitening product out there!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly the same whitening agent that came from the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 tubes and have only opened the first.</li>
            <li>Wow, did I ever get hosed buying this from the dentist!  </li>
            <li>this is the exact same whitnening gel that I purchased from my dentist...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s available here at roughly half what a dentist may charge for these use-at-home units.</li>
            <li>I like many have tried many tooth whiting products all very expensive might I add....</li>
            <li>I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE GOOD REVIEWS ARE INVESTORS IN THE COMPANY DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!</li>
            <li>I went to have my teeth professionally 1 hour whitened at the Dentist&#x27;s office and was so disapointed that I went to Amazon and ordered this product as I had done before.</li>
            <li>Product had thickened so much it wouldn&#x27;t come out of the syringe properly.</li>
            <li>He has been on a two chew maintenance program since he was four years old.  </li>
            <li>I used lumibrite before and this product seems old.  </li>
            <li>Same refills the dentist gives but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>sure wished there were at least 3 tubes for the money.</li>
            <li>My daughter, a dental hygienist said it was old.</li>
            <li>The price was right for this product but one was jammed and could not be used.  </li>
            <li>I put the first syringe aside and tried the second one, and had the same problem.  </li>
            <li>I INITIALLY GOT THIS PRODUCT FROM MY DENTIST, SO IT COMES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>The tubes are some times hard to work and can not get the gel out easy.</li>
            <li>Keeps my smile brite for half the price....can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, but it is really hard to get out of the syringe.  </li>
            <li>We follow the chews with two small dog biscuits to clean his teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I have not experienced any side effects except for the desired whiter teeth :)</li>
            <li>Uses WAY less gel in one treatment, and has the added benefit of getting between my teeth a little better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any results other that what was provided by my previous bleaching after first use.</li>
            <li>No long hours.....love it !</li>
            <li>Also, the expiration date of the product was much longer than what I previously purchased from the dentist.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order my lumibrite on line in the future as this is the exact same product I purchase from my dentist for half the price and works just as well.</li>
            <li>This is the same product that I got from my dentist, except that it cost half as much.</li>

            <li> I leave mine on the full hour, but supposedly you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the drug srtore products, but none of them worked as quickly and efficiently as this one.</li>
            <li> The very first time used, my teeth were 5 shades whiter than what I had just done at the Dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> MY TEETH ARE REAL AND NOT ONE SHADE OF WHITENESS AT ALL!!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the deal products like crest white stripes and all of the others are very quick/ temporary solutions that really aren&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth purchasing online instead of the dentist because of cost savings.</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t shoot off as it had before ... and boom -- 4 days worth of gel out.</li>
            <li> It is useful and practical.  </li>
            <li> I found that I was going through the syringes pretty quickly, though, so I started putting the gel on a toothbrush to apply it to my teeth, then putting my custom trays on.</li>
            <li> a few years ago through a livingsocial special and loved it.</li>
            <li> I do suggest using a remineralizing gel right after using the LumiBrite 32%--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products that cost this same amount (and more) that did NOTHING, I even fell for that light thing gimmick you shine on your teeth that makes you look like a complete fool.</li>
            <li> This product lightens your teeth the first time you use it.  </li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and the LumiBrite does work really well to brighten teeth!</li>
            <li> The first syringe that I opened up keeps getting stuck.  </li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> I do recommend, drying your teeth with a towel prior to application, so the gel sticks better.</li>
            <li> I bought my first batch of LumiBrite from my dentist as a &#x27;touch-up kit&#x27; after going through Zoom tooth whiting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; good to find a place that will save a few bucks and no sales tax to pay. will buy again</li>
            <li> Great Price as the Dentist tries to charge $100 for this same item.</li>
            <li> I had a good result from my last whitening which was almost ten years ago.</li>
            <li> Good whitening was achieved...not super white, but I think my natural tooth color is somewhat yellowish, and there is probably only so much that can be done with my coffee-stained teeth.</li>
            <li> I had experience no discomfort and was able to keep it in for about 30mins, which is the same amount of time I normally keep in my whitener.</li>
            <li> Effects:&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to make my teeth more sensitive in general.</li>
            <li> I like this gel cause its easy to use and only takes 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t get more than 5 days per syringe and the gel will dry out if not capped immediately after application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works VERY well whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This has worked like a charm and my teeth is sooo much whiter.</li>
            <li> This solution is very airy and bubbly.  </li>
            <li> this stuff really works well...  </li>
            <li> Product was very cloudy.</li>
            <li> it was very grainy and bubbled in my mouth like I was foaming.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a real find -- much cheaper than what my dentist was selling it</li>
            <li> They let me believe it was only available through them.</li>
            <li> When I tried to get the solution out of the syringe, it was not working very well.</li>
            <li> i get ready in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I have just started using it, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I am especially surprised that it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and my teeth are already whiter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference in whiteness at all.</li>
            <li> better product than expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was free and next day.</li>
            <li> Originally I was worried it would be expired because I thought this could only be some by a dentist</li>
            <li> Professional performance for the half the price, it doesn&#x27;t get much better than that!</li>
            <li> I have only used it once since its arrival but the product works as good as the previous set from my dentist in Jersey.</li>
            <li> highly suggest it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recently went to my dentist who provided me complimentary teeth whitening trays and some tubes.</li>
            <li> With the dentist syringes I got about two weeks worth, with this product I only got TWO DAYS worth&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t need to purchase new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice to find a product that works and takes only a few minutes to do the job.  </li>
            <li> The 2 things I strongly dislike about this product is that it is grainy, so putting it in teeth whitening trays was kind of weird... and that this stuff foams in my mouth, so I was constantly getting up to spit in the sink.</li>
            <li> Better then any other home whitening product out there!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly the same whitening agent that came from the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 tubes and have only opened the first.</li>
            <li> Wow, did I ever get hosed buying this from the dentist!  </li>
            <li> this is the exact same whitnening gel that I purchased from my dentist...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s available here at roughly half what a dentist may charge for these use-at-home units.</li>
            <li> I like many have tried many tooth whiting products all very expensive might I add....</li>
            <li> I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE GOOD REVIEWS ARE INVESTORS IN THE COMPANY DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!</li>
            <li> I went to have my teeth professionally 1 hour whitened at the Dentist&#x27;s office and was so disapointed that I went to Amazon and ordered this product as I had done before.</li>
            <li> Product had thickened so much it wouldn&#x27;t come out of the syringe properly.</li>
            <li> He has been on a two chew maintenance program since he was four years old.  </li>
            <li> I used lumibrite before and this product seems old.  </li>
            <li> Same refills the dentist gives but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> sure wished there were at least 3 tubes for the money.</li>
            <li> My daughter, a dental hygienist said it was old.</li>
            <li> The price was right for this product but one was jammed and could not be used.  </li>
            <li> I put the first syringe aside and tried the second one, and had the same problem.  </li>
            <li> I INITIALLY GOT THIS PRODUCT FROM MY DENTIST, SO IT COMES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> The tubes are some times hard to work and can not get the gel out easy.</li>
            <li> Keeps my smile brite for half the price....can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but it is really hard to get out of the syringe.  </li>
            <li> We follow the chews with two small dog biscuits to clean his teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any side effects except for the desired whiter teeth :)</li>
            <li> Uses WAY less gel in one treatment, and has the added benefit of getting between my teeth a little better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any results other that what was provided by my previous bleaching after first use.</li>
            <li> No long hours.....love it !</li>
            <li> Also, the expiration date of the product was much longer than what I previously purchased from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order my lumibrite on line in the future as this is the exact same product I purchase from my dentist for half the price and works just as well.</li>
            <li> This is the same product that I got from my dentist, except that it cost half as much.</li>
            <li> product noticeably whitens teeth with only minor side effects.</li>
            <li> The product has a long expiration date on it, so I put it aside until I needed it recently.  </li>
            <li> I brush regularly with Rembrandt toothpaste, so that also helps keep your teeth white, but when my teeth become less white, only one or two uses for touch-up is all I need.  </li>
            <li> It sustains whiteness for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Maintains her white teeth as expected.</li>
            <li> The instructions in the Lumibrite box were in a Foreign language and nothing written in English.</li>
            <li> I miss my other product (Nite white)</li>
            <li> After this happend to me, I noticed that other people had the same problem.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, it took time to order, days to ship, saved little and the product was inferior to the same product thru the dentist.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that I think the quantity of whitener in the tube is less than those available from my dentist; but I could be wrong.</li>
            <li> Winston is now nearly 10 and shows very little sign of joint depreciation.  </li>
            <li> If time permits, I also suggest laying down on your back while the gel is working, since that would prevent your saliva from washing off the gel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Do not use less product as you would end up with different colours on your teeth ( treated versus untreated)</li>
            <li> I was afraid the 32% would be too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually contouring to every little nook and cranny in your teeth.</li>
            <li> However, like other feedback, for some reason, it&#x27;s difficult to squeeze out after the first or second treatment.</li>
            <li> The little piece of plastic you snap off to open the tube is also the cap-</li>
            <li> However, after paying shipping it only saved a little over a dollar.</li>
            <li> It is past the 30 day return allowance, and there seems to be no other recourse.  </li>
            <li> Product is the same used by my dentist but for half the price!</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to keep from getting on your gums and sometimes bleached the gums a little bit for a day (like most bleaches do)</li>
            <li> Crest whitestrips are around $50 to 60 bucks a pop these days and last no more than 30 days, so do yourself a favor and look at the longterm ....</li>
            <li> No problems with thickening as reported in other reviews.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t able to get the product out of the tube :(</li>
            <li> One tube was gone in one use and other tube broke.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be whitening, but not sure why this batch is gritty, and solidifying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The biggest problem was the luminaries normally siphons out in a thin stream in the whitening trays.</li>
            <li> so I was at first skeptical</li>
            <li> Hopefully the next one will not be so hard to use.</li>
            <li> You would need at least one tube for one go for proper coverage.</li>
            <li> I need to use both hands to push the plunger down to get the product out.  </li>
            <li> The cost was quite a bit less than if I had purchased it from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I already had the trays from previous whitening in the dentist&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> LumiBrite worked just as well at a cost of much less.</li>
            <li> I already had whitening trays from my previous dentist trip</li>
            <li> Again the teeth looked whiter after a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I wanted to follow up on whitening my teeth, so I decided to order the 32% gel on here because the 16% is not available.</li>
            <li> Probably wasted 25% of it.</li>
            <li> Money wasted.</li>
            <li> Less time with bleaching trays and NO sensitivity!  </li>
            <li> It did stain a few small spots on my gums for a little while, but it was gone by morning.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried because I have sensitive teeth and a small area on one tooth that is fake-</li>
            <li> Crest whitestrips are an implosive and expensive product that are so painful and manipulate because the results are not longterm, thus making you keep having to buy and buy and buy more.</li>
            <li> I always lose the little cap on the syringe!</li>
            <li> The products sold in drugstores are very temporary and are painful.</li>
            <li> I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave it on my teeth for 30-45 minutes</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this thru my dentist.</li>
            <li> Cold items especially cause a little bit of pain</li>
            <li> Based on cost vs value, this was not a very good investment.</li>
            <li> I use this product quite frequently but on two occasions I received the syringes and 1 of them is impossible to get the product out-</li>
            <li> Used to use bleach from my dentist and had to keep my bleaching trays in at least two to three hours.  </li>
            <li> this is common-</li>
            <li> frustrating- gets blocked up and does not come out no matter how hard you try........</li>
            <li> Not a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply a small amount of gel.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the syringe too thick which results in difficulty spreading the gel evenly and in overflow into the mouth which is unpleasant and wastes the gel.</li>
            <li> I read one review that said solution was very thick.  </li>
            <li> so thin it seeps out of trays.  </li>
            <li> Trouble is the injection thing they have the gel packed in stinks.</li>
            <li> it worked out verrrry expensive and hence as an alternative he suggested me to go for lumibrite until I can afford Lumineers.</li>
            <li> Something must be wrong with my batch.</li>
            <li> Immediately after using, your teeth will probably look a bit weird and striated--</li>
            <li> and it seems to work just as well as the expensive version.</li>
            <li> if you bleach, reach for this and you will not be sorry</li>
            <li> The gel was nearly impossible to dispense from the syringe, and after fighting with it for awhile, realized that it was because the product itself was crystallized.  </li>
            <li> BAD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I did everything they told me but the stuff seeped out and went onto my tounge and gum and burned soo bad.</li>
            <li> My product may have come from a bad batch.  </li>
            <li> And so I am disappointed in my purchase from this merchant.</li>
            <li> but oh my gosh are they painful!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> not as good as others</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but it is really hard to get out of the syringe.  I need to use both hands to push the plunger down to get the product out.  I got 2 syringes and have only used one.  Hopefully the next one will not be so hard to use.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Exactly the same whitening agent that came from the dentist&#x27;s office.  Not a miracle worker, but does a nice job.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this from my dentist so I knew it was a great product.  But, now that I can get it for a better price I love it!!</li>
            <li> Works VERY well whitening my teeth.  The same product that my dentist uses. Use it weekly.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of getting this same product from my dentist however, I payed One Hundred &amp; thirty dollars for it. This gel really does a great job. I didn&#x27;t have and still don&#x27;t have any tooth sensitivity at all. It is almost impossible to keep from getting on your gums and sometimes bleached the gums a little bit for a day (like most bleaches do) but it goes away and doesn&#x27;t do any damage to your mouth. It works best if you have a well fitted mouthpiece. I saw results in 2 days. I&#x27;ve used products that cost this same amount (and more) that did NOTHING, I even fell for that light thing gimmick you shine on your teeth that makes you look like a complete fool. LumiBrite is pretty strong stuff! I went up about 4 to 5 shades.</li>
            <li> I like many have tried many tooth whiting products all very expensive might I add.... Here&#x27;s the deal products like crest white stripes and all of the others are very quick/ temporary solutions that really aren&#x27;t so great. The products sold in drugstores are very temporary and are painful. I guess if I had a big date and wanted to look my best I&#x27;d spend the $50 bucks and buy the two hour kit but oh my gosh are they painful!!!!!!  The beauty with the  pharmaceutical grade whiting systems are that they address things like tooth/ gum pain, as well as last a lot longer, etc.  Lumibrite does require a visit to your dentist to get the molded trays made but thats what makes the product work so well!!!! It&#x27;s actually contouring to every little nook and cranny in your teeth. Crest whitestrips are around $50 to 60 bucks a pop these days and last no more than 30 days, so do yourself a favor and look at the longterm .... It&#x27;s about $250 for the stater kit which gives you the molds for your teeth as well as 4 bleaching syringes. One syringe lasts about 60 to 90 days. I simply put a quarter of the 36% solution in the molds and 5 minutes later I&#x27;m done . I can tell you that I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my teeth. Do it!!!!! Crest whitestrips are an implosive and expensive product that are so painful and manipulate because the results are not longterm, thus making you keep having to buy and buy and buy more.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times.  So, now I use it for touch-ups.  It sustains whiteness for a long time.  I brush regularly with Rembrandt toothpaste, so that also helps keep your teeth white, but when my teeth become less white, only one or two uses for touch-up is all I need.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best do-it-yourself teeth whitening product I have tried.....and that has been many.     I went to have my teeth professionally 1 hour whitened at the Dentist&#x27;s office and was so disapointed that I went to Amazon and ordered this product as I had done before. The very first time used, my teeth were 5 shades whiter than what I had just done at the Dentist&#x27;s office. I leave this on 1 hour which is more than the recommended time but I have no gum or teeth sensitivity afterwards. GREAT PRODUCT !    OH..and BTW, my Dentist sells this product to those who have the at home tray system for $50 a syringe so this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!  Great doing business!!</li>
            <li> This product lightens your teeth the first time you use it.  Less time with bleaching trays and NO sensitivity!  This wonderful product is affordable on Amazon as opposed to other methods.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this brand for using with my teeth whitening tray.  And it is cheaper on Amazon then it is at my dentist office.</li>
            <li> Best whitening stuff on the market!</li>
            <li> Product received as promised and on time. I have been using this product and the results are satisfactory. You would need at least one tube for one go for proper coverage. Do not use less product as you would end up with different colours on your teeth ( treated versus untreated)</li>
            <li> This is the best thing that ever happened to my teeth. I have tetracycline in my teeth and have always been yellow. I&#x27;ve tried various products and when I visited my dentist to check the option of Lumineers procedure it worked out verrrry expensive and hence as an alternative he suggested me to go for lumibrite until I can afford Lumineers. This has worked like a charm and my teeth is sooo much whiter. I would recommend this to everyone who want whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once since its arrival but the product works as good as the previous set from my dentist in Jersey. I had experience no discomfort and was able to keep it in for about 30mins, which is the same amount of time I normally keep in my whitener. Would definitely reorder. My only concern is that I think the quantity of whitener in the tube is less than those available from my dentist; but I could be wrong. See my photo showing where the content starts and stop.</li>
            <li> Great Price as the Dentist tries to charge $100 for this same item.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time. Good value gel, which I used with plastic made to measure holders from my dentists. This gel is much more effective than the one supplied by my dentist, which needed to be in for 30 minutes plus and made my teeth sensitive.  I kept this gel on for about 15 minutes, longer than the instructions indicated, but had no sensitivity problems. Good whitening was achieved...not super white, but I think my natural tooth color is somewhat yellowish, and there is probably only so much that can be done with my coffee-stained teeth. I was happy with the results and would purchase again. No problems with thickening as reported in other reviews.</li>
            <li> This solution is very airy and bubbly.  Won&#x27;t hold on to mouth trays.  Solution so thin it seeps out of trays.  I read one review that said solution was very thick.  Something must be wrong with my batch.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and works great. The price is fantastic too. A good buy all around. Try it!</li>
            <li> I recently went to my dentist who provided me complimentary teeth whitening trays and some tubes. The tubes were not Lumibrite, but after 1 use of my dentist-provided bleach, I saw a difference. This product claims to provide whitening in 3 minutes every day for 2 weeks. I decided to leave on for 30 minutes last night while I was watching TV. My teeth were extremely white looking with the bleaching trays in. The 2 things I strongly dislike about this product is that it is grainy, so putting it in teeth whitening trays was kind of weird... and that this stuff foams in my mouth, so I was constantly getting up to spit in the sink. I didn&#x27;t really see any results other that what was provided by my previous bleaching after first use. I&#x27;ll re-update my review after I finish the tubes.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use!  Seemed frozen or harden.  Wasn&#x27;t able to get the product out of the tube :(</li>
            <li> Excellent.&lt;br /&gt; Great product...</li>
            <li> love this gel.  No sensitivity.  No terrible smell.  Wish the packaging was easier to reseal.  I always lose the little cap on the syringe!</li>
            <li> Whitens the teeth perfectly. However, like other feedback, for some reason, it&#x27;s difficult to squeeze out after the first or second treatment. It doesn&#x27;t bother me, I just don&#x27;t understand why it doesn&#x27;t come out as smoothly.</li>
            <li> BAD PRODUCT. Faulty tube dispenser! One tube was gone in one use and other tube broke. Cheap product. Same name brand as sold at my dentist office but NOT THE SAME QUALITY. Beware</li>
            <li> So after getting teeth whitened a while ago, dentist gave me these home refill cartridges to touch up teeth.  When I ran out I went back to dentist who charged $30 a syringe.  Not knowing any better, I paid it and kept buying them.  Then I found this deal on amazon.  Super cheap and this stuff really works well...  Better then any other home whitening product out there!!!</li>
            <li> This is great whitener in that it really only takes 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure that it is better than those that take 30 minutes tho</li>
            <li> This product worked as promised, delivering substantially whiter teeth.  The cost was quite a bit less than if I had purchased it from my dentist.  I already had the trays from previous whitening in the dentist&#x27;s office.  I had a good result from my last whitening which was almost ten years ago. LumiBrite worked just as well at a cost of much less.</li>
            <li> Wife has been using LimiBrite for a couple years now. Maintains her white teeth as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 tubes and have only opened the first. Product had thickened so much it wouldn&#x27;t come out of the syringe properly. When it did come out it shot out all at once, wasting all of the product.</li>
            <li> Used to use bleach from my dentist and had to keep my bleaching trays in at least two to three hours.  This product works in only 10 or 15 minutes.  Great price from Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> Winston is now nearly 10 and shows very little sign of joint depreciation.  Most dogs in his breed are arthritic by his age.  He has been on a two chew maintenance program since he was four years old.  We follow the chews with two small dog biscuits to clean his teeth.  He is a 68 lb. Airedale.</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply a small amount of gel. It comes out of the syringe too thick which results in difficulty spreading the gel evenly and in overflow into the mouth which is unpleasant and wastes the gel.</li>
            <li> The product would not come out of the syringe properly. Product was very cloudy. Once I did get it out it was very grainy and bubbled in my mouth like I was foaming. Could not use it in tray like it should have been used.</li>
            <li> I have used in the past.  It does seem to help.</li>
            <li> Product is the same used by my dentist but for half the price! Great value and recommended for take home whitening.</li>
            <li> I got LumiBrite molded liners and gel whitening (the 16%) a few years ago through a livingsocial special and loved it. I wanted to follow up on whitening my teeth, so I decided to order the 32% gel on here because the 16% is not available. I was a bit worried because I have sensitive teeth and a small area on one tooth that is fake- I was afraid the 32% would be too strong. It was a pleasant surprise using it! It did stain a few small spots on my gums for a little while, but it was gone by morning. I do suggest using a remineralizing gel right after using the LumiBrite 32%-- it reduced sensitivity a lot. Oh yeah, and the LumiBrite does work really well to brighten teeth! After 2-3 uses, I could already tell my teeth were brighter. Immediately after using, your teeth will probably look a bit weird and striated-- that&#x27;s why I use it at night- by morning, the striations are gone and teeth are nice and white!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remineralizing gel I ordered is: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VEZ1LY/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o01_s00_i03?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1  --I highly suggest it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and to the reviews that wish the tubes came with tip covers- they do! The little piece of plastic you snap off to open the tube is also the cap- just turn it over and it fits perfectly on the end.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist and works well.</li>
            <li> was so happy to find this whitener on line instead of having to go to my dentist to get it a wonderful whitener that works great</li>
            <li> This purchase was a real find -- much cheaper than what my dentist was selling it for!!&lt;br /&gt;You need to have the bite trays to use it and store this product in the refrigerater.</li>
            <li> I used lumibrite before and this product seems old.  The Whitening gel does not come out of the seringe easily!</li>
            <li> Does not brighten my teeth as white as I wanted. The tubes are some times hard to work and can not get the gel out easy.</li>
            <li> This is the product my dentist sold me with my whitening trays.  I get my refills on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Whitens as advertised and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought the lumibright 32% gel refill.  the syringes look the same but the amount of volume is not even close to what the volume was from the dentist.  With the dentist syringes I got about two weeks worth, with this product I only got TWO DAYS worth&lt;br /&gt; in one syringe.  Not a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Wow, did I ever get hosed buying this from the dentist!  They let me believe it was only available through them.</li>
            <li> The packaging was perfect, and the price was unbeatable.</li>
            <li> After I got the zoom my dentist recommended this for maintenance, and it works great!  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> One of the 4 seringes was dried; too much hustle to return it, si Injust kept it. Iverall the end result if the product is great!</li>
            <li> I just got my fitted mouth tray and bleach from dentist. I did everything they told me but the stuff seeped out and went onto my tounge and gum and burned soo bad. I had to put a papper towel in my mouth to keep it from burning and staying onto my teeth. It bleached spots on my teeth, which dimished after but hopefully it gets better</li>
            <li> Great product, same as what my dentist gave me for whitening...... way cheaper on amazon though!</li>
            <li> Product works!  Only 7 minutes a day for 5 days - My teeth is brilliantly white.  Product is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> When I tried to get the solution out of the syringe, it was not working very well. So, I removed the cap, and it flowed effortlessly, then when I placed the trays against my teeth they felt gritty, like sand. The product seems to be whitening, but not sure why this batch is gritty, and solidifying.&lt;br /&gt;I get this product for about the same price from my dentist, so I think I will stick to that method to ensure freshness, but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Nice to find a product that works and takes only a few minutes to do the job.  I put the trays in, shave and take them out.</li>
            <li> The first syringe that I opened up keeps getting stuck.  Cannot get product out.  Have to move on to next one.</li>
            <li> This product works well and I have not experienced any side effects except for the desired whiter teeth :)</li>
            <li> this is the exact same whitnening gel that I purchased from my dentist...however, he charged me about 50% more!  I always see a result when I use this gel.  I use it with the trays that I had made at my dentist.  I usually leave it on my teeth for 30-45 minutes --while i get ready in the morning.  I keep mine in the refrigerator...my hygienist told me it stays fresher longer.  will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this product quite frequently but on two occasions I received the syringes and 1 of them is impossible to get the product out- Seems like this is common- frustrating- gets blocked up and does not come out no matter how hard you try........dissapointed with that......</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve tried. I found that I was going through the syringes pretty quickly, though, so I started putting the gel on a toothbrush to apply it to my teeth, then putting my custom trays on. Uses WAY less gel in one treatment, and has the added benefit of getting between my teeth a little better.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years...  It always delivers and whitens/brightens my teeth and people ask me how I keep my teeth so white!  This product is a winner!</li>
            <li> It&#x27; good to find a place that will save a few bucks and no sales tax to pay. will buy again</li>
            <li> If anyone has obtained teeth-whitening from a dentist, you&#x27;ll recognize this brand of gel. It&#x27;s available here at roughly half what a dentist may charge for these use-at-home units.</li>
            <li> The instructions in the Lumibrite box were in a Foreign language and nothing written in English. I have no way of knowing if there is something I should know about this product and how to use it.</li>
            <li> Same refills the dentist gives but at a much lower price. Almost 1/3 of the cost here on Amazon and it seems to work just as well as the expensive version. I already had whitening trays from my previous dentist trip so I didn&#x27;t need to purchase new ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duration of Use:&lt;br /&gt;For me, the syringes lasted about 7 days a piece so I bought two packages to last around 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste:&lt;br /&gt;The mint flavor isn&#x27;t very strong but it doesn&#x27;t mask the peroxide taste at all. It&#x27;s not disgusting but it&#x27;s bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Effects:&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to make my teeth more sensitive in general. Cold items especially cause a little bit of pain but it isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;The product noticeably whitens teeth with only minor side effects. Definitely worth purchasing online instead of the dentist because of cost savings.</li>
            <li> I used this product over 15 times already and it just didn&#x27;t whiten to the extent that it is supposed to.  Also, I have a concern that the product&#x27;s effects are short-lived and you have to keep buying more and more to maintain any whitening that does occur.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order my lumibrite on line in the future as this is the exact same product I purchase from my dentist for half the price and works just as well. Also, the expiration date of the product was much longer than what I previously purchased from the dentist. Keeps my smile brite for half the price....can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I INITIALLY GOT THIS PRODUCT FROM MY DENTIST, SO IT COMES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AND I FEEL SAFE USING IT.  THANKS!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  Great deal also.  You just&lt;br /&gt;need to make sure that you have a mouth form set up&lt;br /&gt;already since this doesn&#x27;t come with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery also.</li>
            <li> IVE USED ALL THREE BOXES AND NO RESULTS!!! MY TEETH ARE REAL AND NOT ONE SHADE OF WHITENESS AT ALL!! I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE GOOD REVIEWS ARE INVESTORS IN THE COMPANY DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!</li>
            <li> Sane exact thing as what I got at dentist&#x27;s office, and at a great discount.</li>
            <li> I have just started using it, and I really like it. I am especially surprised that it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and my teeth are already whiter. Good product!  UPDATE Jan 2015  Not too impressed after a few months. I don&#x27;t see much difference in whiteness at all. I miss my other product (Nite white) but it&#x27;s much more expensive.</li>
            <li> better product than expected. Dentist approved. No long hours.....love it ! if you bleach, reach for this and you will not be sorry</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing. I have tried all the drug srtore products, but none of them worked as quickly and efficiently as this one. I am very happy with my new smile</li>
            <li> I like this gel cause its easy to use and only takes 3-5 minutes. I do recommend, drying your teeth with a towel prior to application, so the gel sticks better. If time permits, I also suggest laying down on your back while the gel is working, since that would prevent your saliva from washing off the gel.&lt;br /&gt;I sure wished there were at least 3 tubes for the money.</li>
            <li> The price was right for this product but one was jammed and could not be used.  After this happend to me, I noticed that other people had the same problem.  Will probably consider buying again in the future but not if I can find another place with the same price.  The product itself is just as effective as the one I purchased from my dentist for $30.00 a tube.  Was a big savings through Amazon.  Just wish they all arrived in usable condition.</li>
            <li> I bought my first batch of LumiBrite from my dentist as a &#x27;touch-up kit&#x27; after going through Zoom tooth whiting. That batch cost me a$65.00.  This is the same product that I got from my dentist, except that it cost half as much. Professional performance for the half the price, it doesn&#x27;t get much better than that!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this thru my dentist. I tried amazon as it was cheaper. However, after paying shipping it only saved a little over a dollar. The biggest problem was the luminaries normally siphons out in a thin stream in the whitening trays. Amazon purchase was sticky and blobby. Probably wasted 25% of it. My daughter, a dental hygienist said it was old. Ultimately, it took time to order, days to ship, saved little and the product was inferior to the same product thru the dentist. Never would order this thru amazon again.</li>
            <li> Great value here to get it for 1/2 of what it costs at my dentist office ($30).&lt;br /&gt;The product works great</li>
            <li> I keep buying this product, because it works and doesn&#x27;t HURT. Trouble is the injection thing they have the gel packed in stinks. I have not had a good tube of it yet. either the tip goes shooting off, or, as what happened just now, all the gel came flying through. It didn&#x27;t come, didn&#x27;t come... I was holding the \\&quot;needle\\&quot; part so it wouldn&#x27;t shoot off as it had before ... and boom -- 4 days worth of gel out. Money wasted. Very annoying. I&#x27;d like to get this gel in a GOOD delivery system. If anyone knows of one, please write.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me Lumibrite 32% a year ago for whitening because I have sensitivity issues. After three weeks usage my teeth were noticeably whiter with no sensitivity problems. I bought the refills at a great price to further whiten my teeth. Again the teeth looked whiter after a week and a half. I have my own trays molded by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get more than 5 days per syringe and the gel will dry out if not capped immediately after application.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was free and next day.</li>
            <li> Great product that gives great results in a matter of days so I would have to give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> My product may have come from a bad batch.  The gel was nearly impossible to dispense from the syringe, and after fighting with it for awhile, realized that it was because the product itself was crystallized.  I put the first syringe aside and tried the second one, and had the same problem.  I ordered the product last October (2012) and see in the reviews that another customer from around that time had a similar issue.  The product has a long expiration date on it, so I put it aside until I needed it recently.  It is past the 30 day return allowance, and there seems to be no other recourse.  And so I am disappointed in my purchase from this merchant.</li>
            <li> It is useful and practical.  I like it for my dental treatment.  I will buy it again in the future.</li>
            <li> The product appears to be working okay.  However, one of two syringes leaked all over packaging, so 80% of the product was waisted.  Based on cost vs value, this was not a very good investment.</li>
            <li> Originally I was worried it would be expired because I thought this could only be some by a dentist so I was at first skeptical however it works just fine and is a great price.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use with excellent results!  It was recommended by my dental hygienist who also uses it regularly</li>
            <li> Great product.  Whitens your teeth greatly within the first 5 days.  I leave mine on the full hour, but supposedly you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
