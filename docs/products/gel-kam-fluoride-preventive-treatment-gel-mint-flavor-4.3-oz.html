            <li>Priceless!</li>
            <li>I have been using Gel kam for a number of years and am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>A manual toothbrush is probably the best applicator.</li>
            <li>this is great if your teeth hurt for no reason!!</li>
            <li>Pleasant tasting, too!</li>
            <li>Very good for preventing gum bleeding</li>
            <li>Amazon is a great choice</li>
            <li>Great taste.  </li>
            <li>works great to help fluoride my teeth.</li>
            <li>it tastes great too.</li>
            <li>This works great for me.</li>
            <li>Picture was a great description of what to look for to help me decide.</li>
            <li>It was very effective in reducing the pain of that tooth.  </li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>Product and delivery good.  </li>
            <li>The mint flavor tastes good, too.  </li>
            <li>I paid $20 for that.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, unless I do not understand something, this item does not provide either good price or good treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good added supplement.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps someone, and good luck.</li>
            <li>(the teeth need to be clean to best absorb the fluoride.)</li>
            <li>Happy with product and seller:)</li>
            <li>great and will buy more</li>
            <li>, hey, the fewer dental expenses the better!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>They did not change this product, but you need to make sure you get it from someone with a good reputation.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s almost as effective as the treatment I got at the dentist...</li>
            <li>Gel Kam treats both of these when used correctly, and it is probably the single-most effective item I have used to both treat sensitivity and prevent cavities/</li>
            <li>While Sensodyne helps reduce my sensitivity, Gel Kam is in a league of its own here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is very easy, after brushing my teeth, I spread this paste on the teeth.</li>
            <li>Gel Kam is the best product for sensitive teeth...</li>
            <li>There is no other, unless you want cinnamon, and I don&#x27;t like the taste of that, so if you need Gel Kam, get it at the best price you can find it.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have teeth in better condition now.  </li>
            <li>I had tried many things and my dentist recommended this product.</li>
            <li>have ordered this many times and it is always delivered as promised</li>
            <li>He said these take better to whitening treatments, so I assume the composition of the teeth has something to do with the effects of things like this.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you get it under your gumline.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Have switched to a novamin containing product which works much better at repairing teeth and desensitizing exposed roots.</li>
            <li>If used as a normal toothpaste, it is not going to work very effectively.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product,as I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in many years.</li>
            <li>For anyone with sensitive teeth, this is a great product...</li>
            <li>I ordered it here and got it quickly and easily!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use as you just put it on your toothbrush and brush for a minute and then spit.</li>
            <li>Has too strong of a taste</li>
            <li>Great product, although a bit &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34;, if it will help my teeth that have caused me major issues after radiation treatments for throat cancer.</li>
            <li>find a huge value in this bottle.  </li>
            <li>This product is not always readily available in my area</li>
            <li>For reasons I do not understand, I cannot find it available for sale in this metropolitan area of 3 million.  </li>
            <li>It is available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have braces and it&#x27;s important to prevent cavities.  </li>
            <li>Time is important</li>
            <li>Since we were already ordering a birthday gift, we could order both and get free shipping to our door.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t even put a price on how important that is to me.</li>
            <li>Great tooth strenthener for daily use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only good for you</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s dentist recommended this gel for him because he is under chemo and he wanted a mild cleaner.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are more prone to decay than most, and this has ran on my father&#x27;s side for as long as anyone can remember.</li>
            <li>another reviewer mentions, I wish that I had become aware that fluoride gel was effective and available over-the-counter years earlier.  </li>
            <li>it is far more than toothpaste, trust me.</li>
            <li>My teeth happen to be just too sensitive to be able to use it.</li>
            <li>Worth it if you like your teeth</li>
            <li>If applied to teeth which are not already clean, it is not going to work very well at all</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t know how well it worked for years, so I can&#x27;t really give  it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>This product meets my daily needs and I am well pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This was recommended as a substuite for the toothpaste, however users should be aware that this is not toothpaste</li>
            <li>I had a dentist suggest that I use something like this daily and it would keep my teeth healthy for life.  </li>
            <li>I will come back for better feedback.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the future.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, my teeth feel more &#x27;solid&#x27; aready if that makes any sense, they look healthier, and I&#x27;m just going to keep on using this gel.  </li>
            <li>Colgate probably went back to what Gel-Kam  used to be many many years ago - it was sold by prescription only</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time and definately would buy again.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the product!</li>
            <li>I hot some custom brightening trays that I use with this gel.</li>
            <li>I have also found it effective for relieving the occasional sensitive tooth.  </li>
            <li>It certainly has for me, as it is the difference in being able to enjoy hot and cold beverages without pain, as well as continuing to have my own teeth...</li>
            <li>like to mention that previously I have had not so great dental habits like daily soda, and coffee, no flossing etc...</li>
            <li>My husband enjoys this toothpaste, but this was the only easy website where I found it at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Have to wait and see the long term results but unlike other products made to do what it does the taste is great and you don&#x27;t have to stand around with your lips sealed waiting to get on with life.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look at the $15 price tag as being too much for toothpaste</li>
            <li>Too much fluoride can cause spotting of teeth for some people.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It was really bothering me anytime</li>
            <li>The dentist treatment (which did nothing)cost me out out of pocket about twice as much as one tube of this gel which will give me about a million treatments for my tooth.  </li>
            <li>if you need a treatment to stop dental decay/cavities, or if you have really sensitive teeth, this is a product worth trying.</li>
            <li>It is also very helpful in helping to control root surface decay.</li>
            <li>this is much more simple, and seems to have the exact same effect.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended that I use more fluoride due to the medication I take.  </li>
            <li>If only I&#x27;d noticed that my crest pro health had the same form of fluoride in a greater concentration before I bought this.</li>
            <li>High content level of stannous flouride.  </li>
            <li>Not only I lost the money I paid, but I have lost precious time - I literally can&#x27;t live without proper fluoride formula - I am in pain and can&#x27;t eat or drink normally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fluoride treatment that should NOT be used as a normal toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to brush it on, always with a soft toothbrush, and then I have extra protection that is very important to my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s extremely effective and it has the potential to improve the quality of life.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very sensitive sometimes</li>
            <li>When used properly, the science does not fail.  </li>
            <li>This fluoride treatment is cheap and probably effective but the stannous (tin) fluoride has a metallic taste that is unpleasant.</li>
            <li>and I do mind that the seller shows the old picture of the old package/formula, but will send you the new package/formula - this is misleading and stealing.</li>
            <li>So far I have been please.</li>
            <li>so I guess it works so far.</li>
            <li>I have had sensitive teeth for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>However, I can tell you that when I use this product that the cavities stop and the sensitivity all but completely resides.</li>
            <li>I saved the old green/red/white carton for reference when Colgate (years ago) changed the color of the carton, and the taste of the Gel-Kam.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It has no metallic taste and seems to work well for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a family member had has sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>According to her, this product worked wonders with her sensitive teeth, so based on that fact alone, I am giving this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended Gel Kam for my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>More or less, you initially brush the teeth using a standard toothpaste and floss, then brush this product into the teeth, spit, and then leave it be.</li>
            <li>I live in a rural area and drink non-fluoridated well water.  </li>
            <li>and it does a decent job with even minor toothaches.</li>
            <li>Not often available at local pharmacies, but they will usually order it on request, so save yourself time and fuel and order it online here.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t personally notice a difference if it is helping or not as far as keeping my teeth protected, it hasn&#x27;t left any stains on my teeth so far that others here have talked about.</li>
            <li>should mention that my water supply is direct and untreated from a deep well and does not contain detectable fluoride.  </li>
            <li>I just painted the gel on my sensitive spot with a makeup brush before bed and left it on.</li>
            <li>It has totally changed my dental routines, I no longer have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It is messy to use, but to me, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have a molar that has become very sensitive near the root due to nighttime clenching and grinding.  </li>
            <li>Other than the taste and carton change, the information on the new red/white carton remained the same, i.e., 0.4% stable stannous flouride preventative gel for sensitive teeth and cavity protection.</li>
            <li>Works very well to keep our teeth sensitivity down.  </li>

            <li> so I guess it works so far.</li>
            <li> I have had sensitive teeth for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> However, I can tell you that when I use this product that the cavities stop and the sensitivity all but completely resides.</li>
            <li> I saved the old green/red/white carton for reference when Colgate (years ago) changed the color of the carton, and the taste of the Gel-Kam.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It has no metallic taste and seems to work well for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a family member had has sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> According to her, this product worked wonders with her sensitive teeth, so based on that fact alone, I am giving this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Gel Kam for my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> More or less, you initially brush the teeth using a standard toothpaste and floss, then brush this product into the teeth, spit, and then leave it be.</li>
            <li> I live in a rural area and drink non-fluoridated well water.  </li>
            <li> and it does a decent job with even minor toothaches.</li>
            <li> Not often available at local pharmacies, but they will usually order it on request, so save yourself time and fuel and order it online here.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t personally notice a difference if it is helping or not as far as keeping my teeth protected, it hasn&#x27;t left any stains on my teeth so far that others here have talked about.</li>
            <li> should mention that my water supply is direct and untreated from a deep well and does not contain detectable fluoride.  </li>
            <li> I just painted the gel on my sensitive spot with a makeup brush before bed and left it on.</li>
            <li> It has totally changed my dental routines, I no longer have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It is messy to use, but to me, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a molar that has become very sensitive near the root due to nighttime clenching and grinding.  </li>
            <li> Other than the taste and carton change, the information on the new red/white carton remained the same, i.e., 0.4% stable stannous flouride preventative gel for sensitive teeth and cavity protection.</li>
            <li> Works very well to keep our teeth sensitivity down.  </li>
            <li> I have had fewer dental problems in my old age as I did any other time in my life.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by major university dental center to me for use in custom trays.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth with fluoride toothpaste, rinse, squeeze a small amount (~1/2&amp;#34; long bead) of Gel-Kam onto finger or toothbrush and apply to teeth, swish almost constantly until too much saliva accumulates (3-10minutes), then spit out without rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , a minor thing is that the product doesn&#x27;t come in the package shown above.</li>
            <li> So I am not giving the product a bad review so much as I want to caution others that if you have sensitive teeth or teeth with gum recessions, this may not be the right product for you.</li>
            <li> Floride treatment at dentist is around $30, and does not protect for long.</li>
            <li> so let it sit as long as you can (1-2 min).  </li>
            <li> As long as this product is offered on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have used Gel Kam for quite a while now, and it is a major reason I still have teeth and a major reason that hot or cold drinks do not cause me severe pain.</li>
            <li> Item was just as described and arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> And the active ingredient, inactive ingredients, weight, UPC code, and NDC number are also the same.</li>
            <li> The box is actually the white box without the green.</li>
            <li> Use half regular toothpaste and half Gel Kam for daily brushing.  </li>
            <li> Thought for sure that I had a bad cavity or even an infection, but xrays showed nothing.  </li>
            <li> It was not very minty flavored either.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> It has streamlined my health expenses (after &#x27;aging out&#x27; of parents dental coverage) and has brought me immense comfort in eating everyday things I used to forgo while preserving my budget</li>
            <li> Its messy, and tastes medicinal, but it was a prescription only item until ~a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Gelcam leaves your teeth cleaner, not just harder.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was as expected.  </li>
            <li> After 4 years of no cavities using Gel Kam (usually I use the treatment in addition to toothpaste for one month then use a whitening toothpaste alone for a month and alternate)</li>
            <li> I took that as a clue and started my online hunting for the truth about Gel Kam and its flouride active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> The product is essentially the same, but I was confused as to what the difference was between the two products.</li>
            <li> A tube will last at least a month.</li>
            <li> I was using Gel-Kam for 20 years, but previously, it was sold in green/red package as advertised here, on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The stanous fluoride doesn&#x27;t work for me at all - maybe it works for people with less sensitivity.</li>
            <li> , I can chew anything hot or cold...  </li>
            <li> I would not have wasted my money had I known.</li>
            <li> Our denist has recommended using Gel-Kam for years and we find that few pharmacies keep it in stock anymore.  </li>
            <li> Same stuff as at Walgreens except was a couple bucks less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have started to lose enamel pretty bad since I was a teenager</li>
            <li> Turns out I had a bad case of sensitive teeth when contact with food, air, hot, or cold.  </li>
            <li> Gel-Kam tastes bad, is the most expensive toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used, and is so watery that half of it falls off the brush before I can replace the awkward cap that dates back to the primitive plastics of the &#x27;50s.  </li>
            <li> ProHealth toothpaste which is few times less expensive and is sold everywhere contains 0.475% of fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;Prescription strength fluoride toothpaste I got in dentist office Clinpro 5000 contains 1.1% Sodium Fluoride.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommends this and it is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> My dentist wanted me to use this gelcam to help prevent cavities and its just hard to always get at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Hard to find-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this if I notice any negative effects but as of now it&#x27;s working like a charm.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not as effective as Prevident.</li>
            <li> Its 0.4% concentration is weak in comparison to Prevident&#x27;s 1.1%.</li>
            <li> The gel is too thin and would run through the brush.</li>
            <li> I see that they ignored my warning about advertising wrong picture of the product - therefore I decided to give people a warning.</li>
            <li> It is stannous fluoride and in the mint flavor it does not taste like this horrible metallic taste people are saying in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Taste is not too bad.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of reviews on here about it tasting bad or not being stannous fluoride.  </li>
            <li> If you have ever used the fluoride trays you know how annoying that can get..</li>
            <li> brush with it and the pain is gone, i had a root canal and the tooth hurt so bad, so instead of getting the tooth pulled, i brush with gel kam and the pain is gone!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I will buy and use this item for years to come. Don&#x27;t look at the $15 price tag as being too much for toothpaste it is far more than toothpaste, trust me. This has allowed me to stay away from having another root canal. Priceless!</li>
            <li> I pruchase Gel Kam because my dentist recommeded it.  I live in a rural area and drink non-fluoridated well water.  I therefore need a fluoride supplement daily.  Gel Kam seems to do the trick.  This product is not always readily available in my area however Amazon has always come through for me. This product meets my daily needs and I am well pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended as a substuite for the toothpaste, however users should be aware that this is not toothpaste it is a separate gel treatment for after you&#x27;re done brushing.</li>
            <li> High content level of stannous flouride.  Helps prevent cavities and even helps reduce the pain of existing cavities a bit.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Gel-Kam tastes bad, is the most expensive toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used, and is so watery that half of it falls off the brush before I can replace the awkward cap that dates back to the primitive plastics of the &#x27;50s.  I use it on the recommendation of my dentist, and have been cavity-free for five years.  For reasons I do not understand, I cannot find it available for sale in this metropolitan area of 3 million.  It is available from Amazon.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy it here.</li>
            <li> Works very well to keep our teeth sensitivity down.  Our dentist recommends this and it is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Very good for preventing gum bleeding</li>
            <li> Have to wait and see the long term results but unlike other products made to do what it does the taste is great and you don&#x27;t have to stand around with your lips sealed waiting to get on with life.</li>
            <li> I had a dentist suggest that I use something like this daily and it would keep my teeth healthy for life.  I have been using it ever since and wish I had this knowledge when I was much younger.  Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> My husband like the product</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as noted.</li>
            <li> Daily fluoride treatment to reduce cavities. Taste is not too bad. Floride treatment at dentist is around $30, and does not protect for long. A tube will last at least a month.</li>
            <li> The gel is too thin and would run through the brush. It was not very minty flavored either. I would not have wasted my money had I known.</li>
            <li> I have started to lose enamel pretty bad since I was a teenager and I have needed something to help me keep the rest of what I have before it wears away. My teeth are very sensitive sometimes and so I bought this product. Although I don&#x27;t personally notice a difference if it is helping or not as far as keeping my teeth protected, it hasn&#x27;t left any stains on my teeth so far that others here have talked about. I admittedly only use it about once a week though. It is easy to use as you just put it on your toothbrush and brush for a minute and then spit. You don&#x27;t eat anything for 30 minutes afterward to let it soak onto your teeth. So far I have been please. If you have ever used the fluoride trays you know how annoying that can get.. this is much more simple, and seems to have the exact same effect.</li>
            <li> Have used for years, was recommended by a dentist because I was getting a lot of cavities.  Since using have had way fewer cavities.  This stuff works.</li>
            <li> You could feel it working and it does a decent job with even minor toothaches. Get this just in case. good stuff.</li>
            <li> The pharmacies in my area are always out of this when I need it.  Amazon is a great choice and I can order multiple tubes.</li>
            <li> This seems to help a lot with sensitivity.  Only been using it for a few days but I like it</li>
            <li> This was recommended by major university dental center to me for use in custom trays. Still have all my teeth so I guess it works so far.</li>
            <li> I have braces and it&#x27;s important to prevent cavities.  I use Gel-Kam for the fluoride.  There are a lot of reviews on here about it tasting bad or not being stannous fluoride.  I order mine at my local Walgreens Pharmacy.  They order it from their wholesaler and it comes in the next business day.  It is stannous fluoride and in the mint flavor it does not taste like this horrible metallic taste people are saying in other reviews.  They did not change this product, but you need to make sure you get it from someone with a good reputation.</li>
            <li> I have used Gel-Kam for about 5-6 years beginning when I unknowingly cracked a tooth.  It was very effective in reducing the pain of that tooth.  I have also found it effective for relieving the occasional sensitive tooth.  I brush my teeth with fluoride toothpaste, rinse, squeeze a small amount (~1/2&amp;#34; long bead) of Gel-Kam onto finger or toothbrush and apply to teeth, swish almost constantly until too much saliva accumulates (3-10minutes), then spit out without rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that my water supply is direct and untreated from a deep well and does not contain detectable fluoride.  Thus, toothpaste and Gel-Kam are my only deliberate exposure to fluoride.  Too much fluoride can cause spotting of teeth for some people.  This has not happened for me when used as described above.  I would guess that no one would have spotting if the product were used as directed--spitting out the saliva after swishing, rather than swallowing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer mentions, I wish that I had become aware that fluoride gel was effective and available over-the-counter years earlier.  I&#x27;d have teeth in better condition now.  Sigh...</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I use this in addition to ,my regular toothpaste.  Since I started using Gel Kam my visits to the dentist have been non-events.</li>
            <li> My dentist wanted me to use this gelcam to help prevent cavities and its just hard to always get at the pharmacy.I ordered it here and got it quickly and easily! Fantastic product,as I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in many years.Happy with product and seller:)</li>
            <li> I have had sensitive teeth for quite awhile. I had tried many things and my dentist recommended this product. It works very well.</li>
            <li> Hard to find- but too pricey</li>
            <li> My teeth happen to be just too sensitive to be able to use it. So I am not giving the product a bad review so much as I want to caution others that if you have sensitive teeth or teeth with gum recessions, this may not be the right product for you.</li>
            <li> I just use it. I cannot find it in CVS/Walgreens, so I ordered it at Amazon. I need time to evaluate the result. I will come back for better feedback.</li>
            <li> great and will buy more</li>
            <li> My orthodontist says it remineralizes teeth and inhibits bacteria. If only I&#x27;d noticed that my crest pro health had the same form of fluoride in a greater concentration before I bought this. I might as well just leave some of that on my teeth and save the money and shipping.</li>
            <li> I have a molar that has become very sensitive near the root due to nighttime clenching and grinding.  It was really bothering me anytime I ate anything sweet, cold or hot, or even if the tooth was touched. Basically all the time.  The X-rays showed no cavities.  The Dentist gave me an in-office treatment and recommended that I get a flouride gel to use at home.  The dentist treatment (which did nothing)cost me out out of pocket about twice as much as one tube of this gel which will give me about a million treatments for my tooth.  The Gel Kam basically cured my sensitivity in one treatment.  This was last week, maybe I will need to re-treat periodically.  I just painted the gel on my sensitive spot with a makeup brush before bed and left it on.</li>
            <li> have ordered this many times and it is always delivered as promised</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and this is the only thing that works for me.  I use it faithfully after brushing my teeth both morning and night.</li>
            <li> Great taste.  Will be ordering more in the future.  Was advised by my dentist to use for my aligners at night.</li>
            <li> For anyone with sensitive teeth, this is a great product...Just follow the directions and let it do its job...I suffer with ultra, sensitve gums and the flouride seems to soothe them...I use it every morning and if I need it I put it on again at night...It&#x60;s almost as effective as the treatment I got at the dentist...</li>
            <li> Product and delivery good.  Won&#x27;t know how well it worked for years, so I can&#x27;t really give  it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Same stuff as at Walgreens except was a couple bucks less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years at the recommendation of my dentist.  I have had fewer dental problems in my old age as I did any other time in my life.</li>
            <li> At the dentist one day, I heard him comment to a hygienist that the patients that used gel-kam had miracle mouths compared to those who didn&#x27;t.  I took that as a clue and started my online hunting for the truth about Gel Kam and its flouride active ingredient.  I started using this after every time I brush.  IT IS NOT TOOTHPASTE!!!! It is a treatment gel to be put on after brushing.  Time is important so let it sit as long as you can (1-2 min).  It has totally changed my dental routines, I no longer have sensitive teeth, I can chew anything hot or cold...  After 4 years of no cavities using Gel Kam (usually I use the treatment in addition to toothpaste for one month then use a whitening toothpaste alone for a month and alternate) I&#x27;ll be hooked for life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find a huge value in this bottle.  When used properly, the science does not fail.  It has streamlined my health expenses (after &#x27;aging out&#x27; of parents dental coverage) and has brought me immense comfort in eating everyday things I used to forgo while preserving my budget, hey, the fewer dental expenses the better!  As long as this product is offered on Amazon I&#x27;ll be a customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to mention that previously I have had not so great dental habits like daily soda, and coffee, no flossing etc... but now my current dentist doesn&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li> Has too strong of a taste and I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement when using it. I ended up throwing it out.</li>
            <li> My husband enjoys this toothpaste, but this was the only easy website where I found it at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Our denist has recommended using Gel-Kam for years and we find that few pharmacies keep it in stock anymore.  Since we were already ordering a birthday gift, we could order both and get free shipping to our door.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week or so.  For some reason I&#x27;ve noticed my teeth get whiter, though this product isn&#x27;t meant to whiten teeth and others have claimed that it stains their teeth.  Remember there are different types of teeth that take differently, my dentist said there are teeth with a gray hue, and teeth with a bluish yellowish hue, and I have the latter.  He said these take better to whitening treatments, so I assume the composition of the teeth has something to do with the effects of things like this.  Though this isn&#x27;t whitening, if it reinforces the enamel and you use it after brushing thoroughly, I don&#x27;t see why it would cause problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my teeth feel more &#x27;solid&#x27; aready if that makes any sense, they look healthier, and I&#x27;m just going to keep on using this gel.  I&#x27;ll update this if I notice any negative effects but as of now it&#x27;s working like a charm.</li>
            <li> I was using Gel-Kam for 20 years, but previously, it was sold in green/red package as advertised here, on Amazon. The problem, that you will not receive the green/red package - you will receive blue/red package with a different product. It looks like Colgate changed the formula and the packaging, but sellers do not advertise it properly. The seller has to advertise the picture of the product they actually sell. The formula in green/red package was different - it was not stanous fluoride - it was sodium flouride. The stanous fluoride doesn&#x27;t work for me at all - maybe it works for people with less sensitivity. Colgate probably went back to what Gel-Kam  used to be many many years ago - it was sold by prescription only and I don&#x27;t mind calling my dentist and ask for prescription. But I do mind that Colgate changed the packaging and formula, but didn&#x27;t change the name of the product and I do mind that the seller shows the old picture of the old package/formula, but will send you the new package/formula - this is misleading and stealing. Not only I lost the money I paid, but I have lost precious time - I literally can&#x27;t live without proper fluoride formula - I am in pain and can&#x27;t eat or drink normally. BTW I contacted the seller and they answered to me that they sell this product by the sku number(?). I see that they ignored my warning about advertising wrong picture of the product - therefore I decided to give people a warning.</li>
            <li> There is no other, unless you want cinnamon, and I don&#x27;t like the taste of that, so if you need Gel Kam, get it at the best price you can find it. Not often available at local pharmacies, but they will usually order it on request, so save yourself time and fuel and order it online here.</li>
            <li> I have used Gel Kam for quite a while now, and it is a major reason I still have teeth and a major reason that hot or cold drinks do not cause me severe pain. My teeth are more prone to decay than most, and this has ran on my father&#x27;s side for as long as anyone can remember. Sensitivity is also a big issue. Gel Kam treats both of these when used correctly, and it is probably the single-most effective item I have used to both treat sensitivity and prevent cavities/decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fluoride treatment that should NOT be used as a normal toothpaste. If used as a normal toothpaste, it is not going to work very effectively. If applied to teeth which are not already clean, it is not going to work very well at all (the teeth need to be clean to best absorb the fluoride.) More or less, you initially brush the teeth using a standard toothpaste and floss, then brush this product into the teeth, spit, and then leave it be. Then it works its magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I am not a dentist, I cannot tell you from a scientific perspective how this product works. However, I can tell you that when I use this product that the cavities stop and the sensitivity all but completely resides. While Sensodyne helps reduce my sensitivity, Gel Kam is in a league of its own here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you need a treatment to stop dental decay/cavities, or if you have really sensitive teeth, this is a product worth trying. It&#x27;s not cheap but it&#x27;s extremely effective and it has the potential to improve the quality of life. It certainly has for me, as it is the difference in being able to enjoy hot and cold beverages without pain, as well as continuing to have my own teeth...and I can&#x27;t even put a price on how important that is to me.</li>
            <li> I saved the old green/red/white carton for reference when Colgate (years ago) changed the color of the carton, and the taste of the Gel-Kam. Other than the taste and carton change, the information on the new red/white carton remained the same, i.e., 0.4% stable stannous flouride preventative gel for sensitive teeth and cavity protection. And the active ingredient, inactive ingredients, weight, UPC code, and NDC number are also the same. Hopefully this info will assist in making a purchase decision.</li>
            <li> Great product, although a bit &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34;, if it will help my teeth that have caused me major issues after radiation treatments for throat cancer.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great tooth strenthener for daily use.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and i can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use this. Its messy, and tastes medicinal, but it was a prescription only item until ~a year ago.  Worth it if you like your teeth</li>
            <li> Gel Kam is the best product for sensitive teeth...aah! Relief! Pleasant tasting, too! It is also very helpful in helping to control root surface decay.</li>
            <li> You should read the Harvard University study about fluoride</li>
            <li> works great to help fluoride my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gel kam for a number of years and am very happy with this product.It  was recomended by my  Dentistb and has helped me with my oral hygene.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, takes the sensitivity of my teeth.Tried it for the first time and definately would buy again.  Like it.</li>
            <li> Gel-Kam is the last thing I use after brushing and flossing.  It doesn&#x27;t take long to brush it on, always with a soft toothbrush, and then I have extra protection that is very important to my teeth.  The mint flavor tastes good, too.  Thanks for the product!</li>
            <li> This item has 0.4% of fluoride, which is actually very low concentration.&lt;br /&gt;Crest ProHealth toothpaste which is few times less expensive and is sold everywhere contains 0.475% of fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;Prescription strength fluoride toothpaste I got in dentist office Clinpro 5000 contains 1.1% Sodium Fluoride. I paid $20 for that.&lt;br /&gt;Thus, unless I do not understand something, this item does not provide either good price or good treatment.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband as a recommendation from our dentist.  Seems to be helping maintain the enamel on his teeth.</li>
            <li> This fluoride treatment is cheap and probably effective but the stannous (tin) fluoride has a metallic taste that is unpleasant. I would recommend Prevident, which is a prescription toothpaste that uses sodium fluoride instead. It has no metallic taste and seems to work well for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I hot some custom brightening trays that I use with this gel. I use the two for five minutes a night. Its dramatically reduced sensitivity</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I use more fluoride due to the medication I take.  It&#x27;s a good added supplement. It&#x27;s not only good for you it tastes great too.</li>
            <li> This works great for me. Got this as dentist recommended for my sensitivity.  It is messy to use, but to me, it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s dentist recommended this gel for him because he is under chemo and he wanted a mild cleaner.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> Gelcam leaves your teeth cleaner, not just harder.  Make sure you get it under your gumline.  A manual toothbrush is probably the best applicator. Floss before you use it so that nothing keeps the product from reaching every part of each tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was as expected.  A tracking number was provided; I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Wish I had known about this thirty years ago before all my cavities. Gel Kam stops the sensitivity of your teeth and it has almost totally stopped my cavities. Love it!</li>
            <li> Item was just as described and arrived earlier than expected! Picture was a great description of what to look for to help me decide.</li>
            <li> Gel-Kam does work as advertised. Brushing it on teeth applies fluoride to strengthen the enamel. Unfortunately it is not as effective as Prevident. Its 0.4% concentration is weak in comparison to Prevident&#x27;s 1.1%.</li>
            <li> this is great if your teeth hurt for no reason!! brush with it and the pain is gone, i had a root canal and the tooth hurt so bad, so instead of getting the tooth pulled, i brush with gel kam and the pain is gone!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a family member had has sensitive teeth. According to her, this product worked wonders with her sensitive teeth, so based on that fact alone, I am giving this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this product isn&#x27;t actually a toothpaste that you&#x27;re supposed to brush/clean your teeth with. It&#x27;s somewhat of a topical gel/cream that you brush on and leave on for a short duration. In the end, you spit it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a minor thing is that the product doesn&#x27;t come in the package shown above. The box is actually the white box without the green. The product is essentially the same, but I was confused as to what the difference was between the two products.</li>
            <li> ugh, really left a metallic taste in my mouth.  Have switched to a novamin containing product which works much better at repairing teeth and desensitizing exposed roots.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended Gel Kam for my sensitive teeth.  I had severe throbbing pain in my back teeth on one side that resulted in shooting pains in my mouth with each bite. Thought for sure that I had a bad cavity or even an infection, but xrays showed nothing.  Turns out I had a bad case of sensitive teeth when contact with food, air, hot, or cold.  Brush affected area with Gel Kam and the pain subsides after one week and gone after two weeks.  Dentist recommends to use Gel Kam all of the time even when no sensitivity exists to prevent future flare ups. Use half regular toothpaste and half Gel Kam for daily brushing.  Hope this helps someone, and good luck.</li>
            <li> I always use this gel, when I have teeth hurt.&lt;br /&gt;this is very easy, after brushing my teeth, I spread this paste on the teeth.</li>
