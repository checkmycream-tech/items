            <li>This is a good quality buffer but not a miracle.</li>
            <li>We tried one from the mall once, and my wife loved it until it wore away.</li>
            <li>Save your money on a good lunch or a manicure.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for buffing nails to shine but since I use polish I&#x27;m not that concerned with shiny nails.  </li>
            <li>These would make a good gift too.</li>
            <li>Good price and good things!&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>

            <li>but it here works good price can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I had a triangular block from the drugstore that I loved and lost, so I bought this as a replacement.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Nevo one I had.</li>
            <li>The Flash Shiner is a good way to sand and buff nails.  </li>
            <li>good concept though</li>
            <li>Good product and I would recommend</li>
            <li>But for the price, it does a good job.</li>

            <li>Very satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>Despite that, I&#x27;m very pleased for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the price point.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, shines your fingers as if putting polish on it, its better than using nail polish</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m so happy I bought this product.</li>
            <li>i was really excited for this buffer since majority of the people posted very good reviews.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I tried this buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the instruction very easy to follow, and got gorgeous results.  </li>
            <li>I would buy then more of these, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>Though it was a set of 3 should have read a bit more way over priced for one!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this works, but I love it!</li>
            <li>My nails have never looked more shiny!  </li>
            <li>After using this buffer you would not be able to tell if it&#x27;s polish or nude nails!  </li>
            <li>This is so much better!</li>
            <li>Stunning shine!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love this nail buffer!</li>
            <li>I love this nail buffer!</li>
            <li>I love the shine it gives!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t be able to buff your nail with this just shine!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>My wife got this from me as a stocking stuffer, and while I have not used it personally, she swears it is an excellent product that makes her nails shiny and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Great for that quick buff to make my nails look good before going out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly the best nail buffer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>They work amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too cheap to complain about, and honestly I am happy with the results and for once am not having to wear nail polish.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t regret buying it but don&#x27;t expect it to be amazing,</li>
            <li>This nail block really does work great!</li>
            <li>It did make my nails have a nice shine</li>
            <li>My wife bought similar products from Singapore and was very happy with them, so she was happy to find these in Amazon.</li>
            <li>then my thumb and scrubs away with some kind of sponge looking thing.</li>
            <li>I really liked this, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be THAT shiny</li>
            <li>I like that the buffer does not file the nail to be honest,</li>
            <li>My nails can get really shiny with this buffer, so I consider this an excellent purchase!  </li>
            <li>The selection of grits on the filing surface is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;You will be able to control the amount of surface area buffed with good</li>
            <li>does make your nails shine nicely - however</li>
            <li>Good to keep nail healthy.</li>
            <li>I would say the product is not as good, but for the price it&#x27;s a worthwhile purchase.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing is they are .75</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the price was great!!</li>
            <li>they work nicely.  </li>
            <li>The buff and shine parts works well, but I don&#x27;t think this is as good for smoothing out nail ridges and making polish stick to your nails better.</li>
            <li>Just as good or better as the one a friend of mine paid $25.00 for at a mall Kiosk.</li>
            <li>and I liked the way my nail was smoothed and shined by her product.....</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who likes to do their own nails at home.</li>
            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s kind of a nature way to keep your nail shine.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails and my girlfriends as well.  </li>
            <li>This provided a great shine and has held up for many many uses.</li>
            <li>This product gives you really nice, shiny nails in a flash.</li>
            <li>Electronics, gadgets, and tools make up the majority of my Amazon purchases so I wasn&#x27;t really sure about how to pick a good nail buffer.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend has her own thoughts on my nails now being glossier than hers</li>
            <li>These will do nicely.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do my nails in a salon, but this buffer does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m kind of disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it worls beautifully!</li>
            <li>Great for a quick buff.  </li>
            <li>The price was great and it came fairly quickly from the company I purchased it from.</li>
            <li>Buy these, and put some good lotion like curel or jergens on your nails, and you&#x27;ll have supple and strong and shiny nails.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>its the most amazing product on the market..don&#x27;t bother looking</li>
            <li>Keeps nails nice and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Making them look nice and healthy.</li>
            <li>makes nails nice and shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I love being able to get that nice shine on my nails between salon visits.  </li>
            <li>The first time you use it, it&#x27;s gives your nails a beautiful, smooth shine!</li>
            <li>My nails look great, very shiny, nail polish shiny!</li>
            <li>Avoid this flash shiner and find a more consistant and suitable product.</li>
            <li>The cost was very cheap and there was no shipping charge.</li>
            <li>Very cheap product.  </li>
            <li>I could like a rougher edge, but the buffer goes to a very smooth edge which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>Love it works great and is fast!</li>
            <li>My family couldn&#x27;t believe how nicely and easily they worked</li>
            <li>Good price, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is so fast it will not take you more than a minute to get a beautiful nail-polish-like  shine on your nails.</li>
            <li>I get to have shiny strong nails without having to spend lots of money to get them done and without taking up my own time to do them myself</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good buffer, but i wish I could find the kind I used to have where there were coarser grit options.</li>
            <li>It works great, easy to use, does what I was expecting, good price, easy ordering, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>love it ~ looks great &amp; does the job and~made me feel more like a woman with pretty shiny  nails</li>
            <li>For those of us that nail polish splits their nails, this is a product that is most welcomed.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to pick a company that isn&#x27;t trying to jack you for the shipping.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>They seem to hold up better than this one.</li>
            <li>It makes your nails so shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>Just do like 10 seconds per side and your nails look fantastic!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more for gifts &amp; replacements for myself when this one wears out.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more when I need.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found anything that gives me a better sheen.</li>
            <li>These buffers are okay</li>
            <li>I never paint my nails or get manicures, and these help my nails look healthy and glossy.</li>
            <li>Just bought six more for stocking stuffers after trying this one out.</li>
            <li>I will order more for gifts,  </li>
            <li>It works much better than those I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>I am beyond happy that I only had to spend $3 to get my nails looking this good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased I purchased this buffer, it&#x27;s cheaper and probably better than the OPI one.</li>
            <li>but this one is better quality.</li>
            <li>Kind of cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Will buy more if this one ever does wear out.</li>
            <li>It is way cheaper and will pass for okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>top purchase</li>
            <li>AN OKAY PRODUCT, WHEN I USED IT</li>
            <li>I have used many buffers.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like to put anything on your nail, but like it to look shiny and healthy, this is the product you must have.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m glad I can get them through the Amazon Marketplace.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order two more because I want to have these around for spares.</li>
            <li>This buffer is so much better than any buffer I can buy at the beauty supply or drugstore.</li>
            <li>I buff them, moisturize, and then paint them whatever color and always get a nice smooth coat.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, gives me healthy looking nails</li>
            <li>(I know from experience :))</li>
            <li>Ladies love it.</li>
            <li>I like them better than the Seacret buffing blocks because these are a bit softer, have more &#x27;give&#x27; to them -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK I guess for a nail buffer.</li>
            <li>And after doing several of my best buffing jobs with this, it still doesn&#x27;t give me the glossy look.</li>
            <li>The best value is to buy several (or more) at one purchase.</li>
            <li>I can use my buffer while I watch TV and my nails are looking shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Flash Shiner work better than nail buffer.</li>
            <li>and I noticed there nails look a heck of a lot better.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I came home and &amp;#34;Amazonned&amp;#34; it :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll def be buying more after the Flash Shiner Nail Buffer wears out.</li>
            <li>I was looking more for a file and not a buffer.</li>
            <li>If you want one that works even better get the buffing block form SEACRET.</li>
            <li>Nails look healthy, and application can be repeated often.</li>
            <li>I have had much better.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when this one wears out.</li>
            <li>But i think it could be more cheaper.</li>
            <li>This is everything I could have wished for and more.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many buffers including the shammy type with a buffing cream</li>
            <li>It is better than a topcoat because it does not flake, chip or rub off.</li>
            <li>I think I will be able to get maybe another 5 uses before I retire it.</li>
            <li>so I bought a lot more and gave them away to friends and family..</li>
            <li>Great product, value, service and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This brand wokrs much better than some of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I got the buffer in the $40 nail set and the flash shiner is way better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>Got one of these in a kit and it was much better.</li>
            <li>this is MJZ signing out:))</li>
            <li>So glad to see you can buy it seperately.</li>
            <li>This buffer is actually the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>This once created a smooth feel and amazing shine after one buffing, and it lasted 3 weeks before I needed to touch them up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the buffers I&#x27;m used to have more grit</li>
            <li>Nice and cheap, yet does a great job at buffing my nails to a high gloss shine.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Product worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>and they do a surprisingly good job, kind of amazing, actually.</li>
            <li>It has lost some of its shine ability but still works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>It keeps my nails looking good and strong when they are not polished, and it is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>If you purchase this product you will not even have to buy the clear top coats because this buffer gives a great shine.</li>
            <li>The buffer is worth more than it even costs!</li>
            <li>But the shininess just makes your nail ridges more noticeable because the other sides don&#x27;t work the best.</li>
            <li>It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
            <li>This buffer work amazingly well and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Far cheaper and works great.</li>
            <li>Wife loved them fast shipping</li>
            <li>You absolutely will be delighted when you see how shiney your nails will be.</li>
            <li>Shiner Nail Buffer gives you a great shine without polish.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and very simple to use!&lt;br /&gt;It will not take you more than 5 minutes to have shiny and healthy nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great by easily buffing your nails to a smooth shine that makes it look as though there was a coat of clear nail polish applied!  </li>
            <li>I tried this buffer for the first time while visiting a friend in D.C. and fell in love!  </li>
            <li>It takes a while to go through the 3 steps, but is easy to do while watching TV, or otherwise preoccupied.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought 3 more.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and makes your nails shiny without the chipping from nail polish.</li>
            <li>The buffer was really good; it gives such a nice shine.</li>
            <li>My nails aren&#x27;t in the greatest condition right now because of my constantly wearing/removing nail polishes, so I&#x27;m giving them a break for a while.  </li>
            <li>But that first buff was so shiny and amazing.</li>
            <li>These are really amazing at first.  </li>
            <li>My wife took me to the salon for the first time a couple months ago and the one thing I liked was the nail buffed look.</li>
            <li>..how you get that shine with the fine grit buffing tool (like sandpaper) is by removing some of your nail.</li>
            <li>Leaves my nails super shiny without the use of nail polish!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy, and leaves my nails so shiny and smooth, even better than topcoat.</li>
            <li>I use these in the making of my model airplanes, but my wife uses them for nail care and wants more!</li>
            <li>As I buffed away I couldn&#x27;t get over how shiny my nails were becoming; it was like claying your car and having a fresh coat of wax!</li>
            <li>Its so gentle and pretty and almost gives you the shine of a million dollar top coat!!</li>
            <li>Very happy with purchase, makes my fingernails really shine, easy to use and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>It does work a little though, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>but you can smooth ridges and buff them beforehand.</li>
            <li>, my nails have never been this smooth, free from ridges and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;Super-fast shipping from this seller.</li>
            <li>After using, my nails felt smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy who likes to dress well, stay physically fit, keep well groomed and appreciate that in others.</li>
            <li>all it did is buff and shine my nails weren&#x27;t smooth after</li>
            <li>Makes my nails feel fancy and smooth.</li>
            <li>these are fairly cheap; I&#x27;ve used it twice and the gray sides are already coming</li>
            <li>I have found that my nail polish lasts longer when I smooth out the surface of my nail.</li>
            <li>but you can also get that really cheap or use olive oil or whatever.</li>
            <li>I liked the demo one at the mall but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money.  </li>
            <li>Practical and light to carry everywhere</li>
            <li>Great for stuffed basket gift sets or personal use!</li>
            <li>and it was so cheap</li>
            <li>My nails are so smooth and shiny after using this Nail buffer..</li>
            <li>I used it about a week ago and my nails are STILL shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Works great, and will probably need to be replaced at the same rate as the mall one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and it makes your nails shiny.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic and I just ordered another.</li>
            <li>figured I&#x27;d try to find a cheap replacement</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good when you first use it.</li>
            <li>However I received my order fast and it works great , they just really need to change that pic .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my nails have shined this much!!!</li>
            <li>This does give a nice shine to the nails, but I&#x27;ve found that it thins the nails just enough that they tear more easily.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the first one I got in the keosk at the mall and just as good.</li>
            <li>Very easy and fast to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, light and economical.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is so easy and that it works so fast.</li>
            <li>Great for vacations, easy to pack foam block, nothing to break; no stinky wet polish.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>I did love the shine it gave my nails after the first use.</li>
            <li>It does not have any buffer qualities -- the original has diamond dust buffer strip.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast as well! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>Hands look clean and neat without being too girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If an individual likes a natural shiny appearance to nails with out applying polish, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Then I tried this buffer and quickly had smooth shiny nails.</li>
            <li>I have tried SEVERAL buffers and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li>more of a healthy natural buffed shine.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with an original product from Israel, and purchased this as an economic substitute.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product specially if we don&#x27;t want to put any color to the nails.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price, and does exactly what i hoped it would!  </li>
            <li>Basically this block when used correctly will take the surface of your finger/toenails down to a perfect smooth surface which can then be buffed to a high glossy shine.  </li>
            <li>They seemed really shiny to me, and make my nails look much more &amp;#34;hygienic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>I use polish to help strengthen my nails, just a nice clear coat of another product I have reviewed.  </li>
            <li>The buffer does last a good amount of time , which could vary as to the frequency of usage.</li>
            <li>its the soft kind so it doesn&#x27;t take off the layer of nail</li>
            <li>I love walgreens even though the majority of senior citizens shop their haha</li>
            <li>I only got 3 good uses out of it.</li>
            <li>It is the true deal.  </li>
            <li>This one was okay, but unfortunately really didn&#x27;t approach the level of buffing that the Seacret one did.</li>
            <li>guy gets one if you want nice looking natural nails.</li>
            <li>but for now it is cool to have around.</li>
            <li>Or maybe this is for you to use on your natural nails so they will look nice and shiny without damaging them.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price either.</li>
            <li>Easy and fast to use!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect solution -- in just a few quick strokes, the nails are shiny and pretty -- and the price is great, much less than a manicure at the spa.  </li>
            <li>but the shine wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>Does the job quickly too.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different buffers and this one is better than any I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails super shiny for a couple week.</li>
            <li>it makes my nails super shiny.</li>
            <li>I purchased this expecting to have super shiny nails.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly step three shined my nails.</li>
            <li>My husband tried it on one of his nails and then determined he needed to go back and roughen it to a more manly finish since it worked so well  :)</li>
            <li>Man this thing got my nails super shinny.</li>
            <li>white side, however, is an excellent buffer and the glossy shine is still the same 24 hours later.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would buy so many more once this one breaks or gets dull, this is so much better than the ones at those mall kiosks and way cheaper!</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and it is very good as a nail buffer.</li>
            <li>So I do use a nice clear polish right after I finish buffing.</li>
            <li>It was cheaply made and I don&#x27;t think the grit was consistent as it should be to buff and shine nails.</li>
            <li>No only he solved my problem but he actually made sure that I was 100% happy and</li>
            <li>have very rough nails to start with, so I&#x27;m very happy to have the three grits on one soft block that&#x27;s well made.</li>
            <li>Works very well and super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I was able to do my wife&#x27;s toenails and fingernails with one unit, then its pretty much done.  </li>
            <li>Everybody loved them at first and then came to the same conclusions that I did..</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for in a buffer!  </li>
            <li>These little buffers do a GREAT job buffing and shining.  </li>
            <li>Using a flash block like this will allow you to give yourself (or someone else) a great looking shiny set of nails with little effort.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped for a replacement for my Seacret brand buffer, which did such an amazing job.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and like neat nails but tend to destroy nail polish, buffing is a great option.</li>
            <li>My wife likes her nails looking freshly manicured but because we travel  </li>
            <li>, it is really soft and in few minutes you get awesome nails.</li>
            <li>My nails look incredibly clear, shiny, &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d say worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>They work well, but aren&#x27;t worth $30.</li>
            <li>Does not do a good job of smoothing out rough spots on nails.  </li>
            <li>Have fun</li>
            <li>They definitely bring your nails to a nice shine.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Makes them look freshly manicured every time.</li>
            <li>For a fraction of that, you can have ten shiny nails in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li>For this very reason I&#x27;ve purchased a nail buffer at Target before and it worked good enough for my needs</li>
            <li>time to go kill something and eat it over an open fire I built with my bare (but beautiful looking) hands.</li>
            <li>When you are finished with the white side you have a nicely manicured shiny nail.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the miniscule amount I paid.</li>
            <li>So I was thrilled to find this one for only a couple dollars.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool how it works.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the $5.</li>
            <li>If u wanna spend more on shipping then product&#x27;s original value then only go for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier, cheaper &amp; better for my nails to simply keep them trimmed, clean &amp; buffed.</li>
            <li>This is not a buffer to rid your nails of ridges but after you use another buffer to buff out the ridges you can quickly get a fast super shine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, doesn&#x27;t damage your nails, and shines nails as well as clear polish.</li>
            <li>They are well made but did not have the right roughness that my wife wanted.</li>
            <li>Price is right.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and it was shipped immediately.</li>
            <li>any more just buy this one it shines your nails like no other</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought high end ones from salons, cheap ones from the grocery store and none managed to impress me.</li>
            <li>Very, very manicure-friendly and useful.</li>
            <li>None of the sides were strong enough to smooth a ridge in your nail polish or even your nails.  </li>
            <li>It buffed out the yellow stains from my nail polish and my nails look super healthy.</li>
            <li>Go ahead and look good right down to your finger nails.</li>
            <li>A simple little tool that gives you that awesome glossy nail look and feel in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers have said, these nail buffers work really well;  they smooth out the nail (not ridges) and put a nice polish on them.  </li>
            <li>You have to keep them up, though, because after using this I found that my nails got minor scratches more easily and became very bland-looking, very fast.</li>
            <li>Needed a new one and looked here and decided to try these as what&#x27;s the downside they are so cheap.  </li>
            <li>You do only receive one, but it is great, especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li>but it really is like super duper shiny.</li>
            <li>Nail buffer is easy to use and gives my nails a professional shine.</li>
            <li>The Amazon description was very clear and accurate.</li>
            <li>They wear out after a few weeks, depending on how much you use them, but give the nails a beautiful gloss without much effort.  </li>
            <li>works very well, great buff, however the down side is these are not very long lasting, but for the price they are a good bargain</li>
            <li>I used to buy very cheap buffers, this is sooooooooo different.</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It works fine now the old man seems to have had a manicure.  </li>
            <li>It is surprising how shiny this little block makes my nails.</li>
            <li>Quick, easy shine on fingernails and toenails in about ten minutes while you watch TV.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at my nails, they were just so shiny.</li>
            <li>first saw this at a mall, and figured for a couple dollars I might as well try it.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it advertises to do.  </li>
            <li>Not only are you able to shine your nails</li>
            <li>Makes my nails real shiny!  </li>
            <li>However, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy Flash Shiner again or recommend it to a friend, as the price is so reasonable!</li>
            <li>but I think the company needs to include instructions on which side to use first and what it suppose to accomplish.</li>
            <li>Trim and file your nails first then buff.</li>
            <li>But with the shipping cost it really just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>My mom came back from the grocery store with a $2 one that was about 10 times better than this one.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using the buffers, my nails have grown so much that I have to file them once a week!</li>
            <li>No fake nails for me &amp; I manage to chip off nail polish within 24hours.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Surely there must be a way to get a buffer only I thought.</li>
            <li>it should be exactly what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>They fall apart the first time used.</li>
            <li>The shine didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend!! :)</li>
            <li>each and the shipping is the same no matter how many you buy.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Will be back for more.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for saving my wallet!</li>
            <li>a side note, I purchased another nail buffer with a cheaper price tag, that came in a pack of 3 with pretty colors.  </li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>OK, that&#x27;s enough...</li>
            <li>This is my first buffer and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I saw the same product at a home show costing more than five times what it cost on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and i was once willing to pay</li>
            <li>If you want the first 2 steps, you&#x27;ll have to buy them separately.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive - so they are worth buying.even though they wear out fast.</li>
            <li>Very durable and useful.</li>
            <li>It actually work and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t remember very clear), but it is of the same amazing effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried out several different brands of nail buffers, including the kind you can get from those mall kiosks, and this one is far and away my favorite.</li>
            <li>this is an okay buffer for the price, it is different on the sides, and works pretty well, however i have bought better buffers, but not for the same price, on here, so it does okay, but if you are looking for something that does more, then go for the more expensive one!</li>
            <li>What there is of the buffer works okay, but it doesn&#x27;t have the slightly rougher side that I use the most frequently.  </li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s good for its price, but I recently found out I could buy these from an international company for about fifty cents (USD)</li>
            <li>It is so affordable, arrived fast, and I will be ordered more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spend the extra money on the good one next time.</li>
            <li>This came really fast and was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>It cleans your nails and brings out a very noticable shine on your first treatment</li>
            <li>you didn&#x27;re really want in the first place.</li>
            <li>these are really pretty flimsy and too flexible to be of much use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as the Seacret nail buffers, but these cost a small fraction of the price</li>
            <li>I have bought those mall kiosk buffers in the past and loved them</li>
            <li>If you look at the customer images for this well that is exactly how my nails were after using this buffer, and that was about a day after scrubbing my nails with a toothbrush and bleach/water concoction, having used one of those cheap nail varnishes that managed to stain my nails a while back.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, I needed something to fill in my order for free shipping and picked this from my list of small priced items.</li>
            <li>but if your nails are &#x27;ridgy&#x27; I&#x27;d use a regular buffer first to smooth out and then use this one.</li>
            <li>However, thay do ware out very quickly; They are only .75 each, so that makes up for it.</li>
            <li>The instructions were simple and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>It was not bulky or big and it was really easy to handle.</li>
            <li>good polishing thigh, but do not last long</li>
            <li>i accidentally scraped the edge of my nail against one of the sides and it created a large rip.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and natural.  </li>
            <li>It would be great if they made one grey side (instead of two) one green side, and two white sides, as the white side doesn&#x27;t work good after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>It does buff to a very high shine though so it does what it claims even if it isn&#x27;t what you expect.</li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was to much and came to Amazon</li>
            <li>and I could never get any real length.  </li>
            <li>These manicuring blocks really do the job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what else to say, I am not a connoisseur of nail-care products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>my perky friend tells me...then pitches me on a whole kit of gew and gunk</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommended.</li>
            <li>but realistically they are probably very overpriced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell a difference from any of the sides.</li>
            <li>Like that it works and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and find it very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>All sides of this are smooth and almost the same texture...</li>
            <li>The grey and green sides which are used first, do a great job and are gentle on the nail surface.</li>
            <li>So it is not of much use to me.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>The buffing sides are still gentle</li>
            <li>The product shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>Thanks for the glassy nails.</li>
            <li>Just very</li>
            <li>but didn&#x27;t produce a very shiny nail.</li>
            <li>I really like these buffers.  </li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>Without that, nothing really works as it should.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my Husband and Step Son and their nails also look real shiny.</li>
            <li>Fast communication and very concern about his clients.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even out the nail as much as some I have used before, but</li>
            <li>not what i expected but ok</li>
            <li>I really like this buffer.</li>
            <li>The result is very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>It really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Works really well on real nails as well as acrylic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Will be more careful reading the product information</li>
            <li>The smooth shiny side ripped on the second use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and they all are very durable, one buffer lasts for me ~3 mnth</li>
            <li>Hello bought these blocks and work very well</li>
            <li>Seller fast and efficient.  </li>
            <li>A nice low key shine .</li>
            <li>I noticed with other ridge filers, you have to go very light</li>
            <li>I purchased one for less than half the price from a local big box and was much more impressed.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, shine lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I originally was duped at a mall several years ago and got their \\&quot;kit\\&quot; which included this and some lotion for about $25.  </li>
            <li>This plus a rich hand cream like aquaphor same effect.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long, but it&#x27;s certainly worth the relatively small effort involved and best of all NO MESS!</li>
            <li>The surfaces loose their texture very quickly.</li>
            <li>Got the package and used it and it buffed the tiny ridges out of my nails just as good as the more expensive version.  </li>
            <li>They are so reasonable that I ordered three, to be sure I had enough to last awhile.</li>
            <li>I think this is working pretty good but pretty expensive</li>
            <li>So, I look down and think that my grubby thumbnail looks better now</li>
            <li>I bought this because I recently got a job in New York City and wanted my nails to look natural yet healthy and professional.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly on both natural and artificial nails.</li>
            <li>The shine on my nails is better than any polish could do for much less work.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the bomb , it took my less than 2 minutes to have saloon shiny nails ,love it.</li>
            <li>I actually like these better than the Seacret buffers at the mall because the ridge smoother is not so gritty and it feels a bit smoother on my nails.  </li>
            <li>Also, as I have gotten older, my nails were breaking</li>
            <li>I love the glossy, wet, clear look.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s only good for a few buffs.</li>
            <li>Decent buffers for the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better but much more expensive.</li>
            <li>If you like a high shine on your nails without always using polish this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>this buffer amazed everyone who I demonstrated it to- highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and will buy another when this one becomes overly used.</li>
            <li>step produces a high luster.</li>
            <li>High shine that has lasted over a week.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>As others have stated, it doesn&#x27;t last long as the surface wears out quickly - I&#x27;d order one to make sure you like it and then order 3-4 at once if you buff regularly or do both nails/toes.</li>
            <li>I would have paid a little more to have it come with the oil</li>
            <li>The problem I&#x27;ve had with mine is that it didn&#x27;t last very long and the results diminish rather quickly, a real bummer since it is such a great product out of the starting gate.  </li>
            <li>so I have been looking for a low maintenance, clean, professional look without the use of nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a few different brands of nail buffers and honestly, this gets my nails shinier than most of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>It seriously shined it so much that it looks like I have clear nail polish on, I love it!</li>
            <li>I have many other cheaper choices only for nail-shining.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really upset.</li>
            <li>So, the next thing I know I buffed all the nails on my right hand.</li>
            <li>If you think about this for a second, they are (1) paying for these peoples&#x27; tickets, (2) paying for them to stay there, and (3) paying them pretty decent money to sell these pieces of foam.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Revlon&#x27;s CrazyShine for a number of years and decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase it again, but if you only need it for an important date coming up they would definitely get the job done!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by how well this works.  </li>
            <li>Once I had the clear nail polish on, they looked even shinier!</li>
            <li>it looks like I&#x27;m wearing clear polish!</li>
            <li>Frankly, it&#x27;s easier to just put clear nail polish on!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like I have clear nail polish on!  </li>
            <li>The shine is much better than I get with other products, and seems to last longer as well.</li>
            <li>As for the white buffer side, it seems equivalent to the Seacret buffer and much better than the Revlon or other drugstore</li>
            <li>Maybe a week of complete shine!  </li>
            <li>Every side of the buffer felt the exact same..</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as described, if you follow the simple three steps.</li>
            <li>So I went home and found this, bought it and it works exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>This product was EXACTLY the same thing!</li>
            <li>I actually use a different buffer to smooth my nails, then I use the light grey and white surfaces on THIS one to shine!</li>
            <li>of the 4 sides do the exact same thing...</li>
            <li>Just as good as mall kiosk products... seems to be wearing down a little faster?</li>
            <li>I did one hand with the old buffer and one hand with the new.</li>
            <li>This buffer made a huge difference, in contrast to my previous buffers.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the same nail block I had previously because it was better for smoothing and polish adhering.</li>
            <li>The buffer seems to be far too mild and does not really do the job that is intended.  </li>
            <li>If you only have little ridges on your nails, it would probably still be okay</li>
            <li>You use three sides of the buffer in the order from rougher to smoother and it shines your nails like you have a clear coat on them</li>
            <li>So shiny, it looks like I&#x27;m wearing a clear polish.</li>
            <li>They looked as if I had put a clear coat before even putting anything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, clean up your act and get a half dozen of these.</li>
            <li>The Flash Shine hand looks like I used clear ultra glossy nail polish on it.</li>
            <li>This makes your nails look like they have a clear coat of shiny nail polish all the time that doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>no need to wear a clear coat.</li>
            <li>It makes your nails look like you have clear polish on them.</li>
            <li>They buff to look shiny like they have a clear coat on them.</li>
            <li>It Buffers my Nails so shiny that it looks like I have clear nail polish on it.</li>
            <li>It looks like I&#x27;m wearing clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>and they still look like I have a clear coat on them.</li>
            <li>Not quite like a clear coat now...</li>
            <li>It does make your nails look as if you have clear polish on them without using chemicals or chipping.  </li>
            <li>I ended up finding a nearly identical one for a lower price at CVS.</li>
            <li>This buffer is lightweight and works like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>Only takes like 10 minutes to really buff them up.</li>
            <li>Shines the same as that expensive one and is great for both men and women, You have to have natural unpainted nails thou or it will stain the buffer and it will not work at all anymore</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do nail polish but the natural shine was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this maybe five or six times and the paper is completely worn out.</li>
            <li>But you can use the white side to your hearts desire, that&#x27;s the one that really brings out the shine, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And naturally Amazon had this product.  </li>
            <li>The one that is supposed to basically file doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all, and the last side, which is supposed to buff the nail to a shine, buffs it to not quite a shine.</li>
            <li>My husband bought the complete kit of this product for me when we travelled to Cape Town in SA, since then we have  been trying to get our hands on it.</li>
            <li>For me that keeps natural nails, it solves my manicure problems.</li>
            <li>I will get a professional manicure.  </li>
            <li>story short, why not just buy them online for a reasonable price?  </li>
            <li>Left my nails feeling looking very glassy and shiny, even after 24 hours since I buffed them.</li>
            <li>They do a professional looking job.  </li>
            <li>I use mine perhaps once a week when I do complete manicure -</li>
            <li>or just leave the nails with Gods natural shine.</li>
            <li>The buffer (white) side works well and makes nails very shiny.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it three times</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that there is much buff left after I used it once</li>
            <li>finished nails look like they are professionally manicured.  </li>
            <li>I wish Amazon would sell directly, get packs of three (no shipping).</li>
            <li>It looks like I&#x27;ve had my nails done professionally.</li>
            <li>and you are ready to move to the next color.  </li>
            <li>A few light strokes and move on.  </li>
            <li>I think I am at about 10-12 uses so far for $3.</li>
            <li>My old one lasted years.  </li>
            <li>They only difference is this one doesn&#x27;t have the really course side for shaping your nails.</li>
            <li>Buffer is lightweight and works like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>All sides are too soft</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>When my daughter told me she was still using her old one, I thought it was time for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing: since no instructions are included it is important to note that you should not overly buff (longer than about 20 seconds) on the darkest side as you can make your nails too thin thereby defeating the whole purpose!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my nails went from dull to super shiny.</li>
            <li>I mean it was cheap!</li>
            <li>I am not sure what people were talking about when they said they were only able to get one use.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this with two other very similar products, and all three perform as good, if not better than the one we were demoed at the mall.</li>
            <li>File as usual; then use the dark side, then the blue, then the white, and you get a great shine without all the gook and smell.</li>
            <li>this one will probably not be as high quality as the above</li>
            <li>I did read the reviews before purchase--the really low, really high and in betweens.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and affordable but it&#x27;s not a professional nail item.</li>
            <li>On the fourth use it did not work properly becaue too much of the serface had completely worn off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how long the shine will last, or how long the actual buffer will last, but as of right now..I love it!</li>
            <li>Sadly the happiness ended after the third use.</li>
            <li>it is only mediocre  Not as good as the ones at the kiosk&#x27;s at the mall.  </li>
            <li>A few seconds on each side you have clean shinny nails that are long lasting without much fuss or rubbing or thinning of the nails.  </li>
            <li>It shines nails like no other and at a price</li>
            <li>The green &amp; grey sides wear out VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>I expected it to smooth the ridges on the nails buff it and then shine it like i am used to with the other nail buffers i had.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well, but the nails loose their shine the same day you buff them.</li>
            <li>These buffers came with no instructions, so I didn&#x27;t know which order to use the buffer sides; and the end product was smooth, but dull nails.</li>
            <li>I know they are cheap, but dang, I used it once, and the grey material used for  ridge removals ripped after a few swipes</li>
            <li>My only criticism would be that I wish it came with 2 white polishing sides rather than 2 grey sides, as it&#x27;s always the polishing side that wears out first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed o_o</li>
            <li>but I was surprised to see some of the reviews as low as 1 star based on stuff like the picture misleading them or that it fell apart.</li>
            <li>The Revlon is barely shiny by comparison.</li>
            <li>Actually, when having my nails done professionally the technician used this to shine my nails.</li>
            <li>but apparently its suppose to do that.</li>
            <li>No regrets whatsoever.</li>
            <li>it leaves the nails with the option to do a complete manicure of colored nails, french, etc.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re bare.</li>
            <li>When you finally finish and wash it off the shine is completely gone.</li>
            <li>, it has strong chemical smell, may not good for your health.</li>
            <li>I do dishes and other \\&quot;real woman\\&quot; chores, and cannot keep up with nail polish.</li>
            <li>This Flash Shiner Nail Buffer is on a whole other level.</li>
            <li>This buffer works just as good as those expensive ones!</li>
            <li>My nails are very shiny for a long long time.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to carry in your purse for quick touch ups.  </li>
            <li>This product makes your nails shine like they have clear polish on and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>A month&#x27;s use for just a few bucks seems like a bargain to me, so although I can&#x27;t compare the durability of one buffer (or how long its shine lasts) to the expensive mall kit buffers, I can say these do give good results that don&#x27;t disappear in a few days, and with free and prompt shipping, whether you order 1 or 20, they are just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was upset at first because I thought it stopped working after a few uses.</li>
            <li>Then the files got too worn down to make much difference.</li>
            <li>I read from other reviews that they wear down quickly.  </li>
            <li>You use three sides of the buffer in the order from rougher to smoother and it shines your nails like you have a clear coat on them that is long lasting.</li>
            <li>My problem with it was that it did not have a side rough enough to remove stains (like this style of block buffer normally does).  </li>
            <li>This little three sided nail buffer is a very clever way to nicer nails with a simple 1, 2, 3 sequence.</li>
            <li>These little beauty tool works real well.</li>
            <li>this little buffer is very convenient for me.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, but dont use it too much or you will wear down your nails and they will become weak and sensitive!!</li>

            <li> Definitely a good product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality buffer but not a miracle.</li>
            <li> We tried one from the mall once, and my wife loved it until it wore away.</li>
            <li> Save your money on a good lunch or a manicure.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for buffing nails to shine but since I use polish I&#x27;m not that concerned with shiny nails.  </li>
            <li> These would make a good gift too.</li>
            <li> Good price and good things!&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> yet do just as good a job.</li>
            <li> good quality. .</li>
            <li> God good good.</li>
            <li> Good quality</li>
            <li> but it here works good price can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> I had a triangular block from the drugstore that I loved and lost, so I bought this as a replacement.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Nevo one I had.</li>
            <li> The Flash Shiner is a good way to sand and buff nails.  </li>
            <li> good concept though</li>
            <li> Good product and I would recommend</li>
            <li> But for the price, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I originally loved this product.  </li>
            <li> Good one for the price</li>
            <li> It does a good job of polishing my nails.</li>
            <li> good product</li>
            <li> Very nice and handy.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Despite that, I&#x27;m very pleased for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the price point.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, shines your fingers as if putting polish on it, its better than using nail polish</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m so happy I bought this product.</li>
            <li> i was really excited for this buffer since majority of the people posted very good reviews.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I tried this buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the instruction very easy to follow, and got gorgeous results.  </li>
            <li> I would buy then more of these, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Though it was a set of 3 should have read a bit more way over priced for one!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works, but I love it!</li>
            <li> My nails have never looked more shiny!  </li>
            <li> After using this buffer you would not be able to tell if it&#x27;s polish or nude nails!  </li>
            <li> This is so much better!</li>
            <li> Stunning shine!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> I love Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this nail buffer!</li>
            <li> I love this nail buffer!</li>
            <li> I love the shine it gives!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t be able to buff your nail with this just shine!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> My wife got this from me as a stocking stuffer, and while I have not used it personally, she swears it is an excellent product that makes her nails shiny and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Great for that quick buff to make my nails look good before going out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly the best nail buffer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> They work amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too cheap to complain about, and honestly I am happy with the results and for once am not having to wear nail polish.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret buying it but don&#x27;t expect it to be amazing,</li>
            <li> This nail block really does work great!</li>
            <li> It did make my nails have a nice shine</li>
            <li> My wife bought similar products from Singapore and was very happy with them, so she was happy to find these in Amazon.</li>
            <li> then my thumb and scrubs away with some kind of sponge looking thing.</li>
            <li> I really liked this, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be THAT shiny</li>
            <li> I like that the buffer does not file the nail to be honest,</li>
            <li> My nails can get really shiny with this buffer, so I consider this an excellent purchase!  </li>
            <li> The selection of grits on the filing surface is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;You will be able to control the amount of surface area buffed with good</li>
            <li> does make your nails shine nicely - however</li>
            <li> Good to keep nail healthy.</li>
            <li> I would say the product is not as good, but for the price it&#x27;s a worthwhile purchase.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing is they are .75</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the price was great!!</li>
            <li> they work nicely.  </li>
            <li> The buff and shine parts works well, but I don&#x27;t think this is as good for smoothing out nail ridges and making polish stick to your nails better.</li>
            <li> Just as good or better as the one a friend of mine paid $25.00 for at a mall Kiosk.</li>
            <li> and I liked the way my nail was smoothed and shined by her product.....</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who likes to do their own nails at home.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s kind of a nature way to keep your nail shine.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and my girlfriends as well.  </li>
            <li> This provided a great shine and has held up for many many uses.</li>
            <li> This product gives you really nice, shiny nails in a flash.</li>
            <li> Electronics, gadgets, and tools make up the majority of my Amazon purchases so I wasn&#x27;t really sure about how to pick a good nail buffer.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has her own thoughts on my nails now being glossier than hers</li>
            <li> These will do nicely.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do my nails in a salon, but this buffer does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m kind of disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, it worls beautifully!</li>
            <li> Great for a quick buff.  </li>
            <li> The price was great and it came fairly quickly from the company I purchased it from.</li>
            <li> Buy these, and put some good lotion like curel or jergens on your nails, and you&#x27;ll have supple and strong and shiny nails.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> its the most amazing product on the market..don&#x27;t bother looking</li>
            <li> Keeps nails nice and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Making them look nice and healthy.</li>
            <li> makes nails nice and shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I love being able to get that nice shine on my nails between salon visits.  </li>
            <li> The first time you use it, it&#x27;s gives your nails a beautiful, smooth shine!</li>
            <li> My nails look great, very shiny, nail polish shiny!</li>
            <li> Avoid this flash shiner and find a more consistant and suitable product.</li>
            <li> The cost was very cheap and there was no shipping charge.</li>
            <li> Very cheap product.  </li>
            <li> I could like a rougher edge, but the buffer goes to a very smooth edge which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> Love it works great and is fast!</li>
            <li> My family couldn&#x27;t believe how nicely and easily they worked</li>
            <li> Good price, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is so fast it will not take you more than a minute to get a beautiful nail-polish-like  shine on your nails.</li>
            <li> I get to have shiny strong nails without having to spend lots of money to get them done and without taking up my own time to do them myself</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good buffer, but i wish I could find the kind I used to have where there were coarser grit options.</li>
            <li> It works great, easy to use, does what I was expecting, good price, easy ordering, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> love it ~ looks great &amp; does the job and~made me feel more like a woman with pretty shiny  nails</li>
            <li> For those of us that nail polish splits their nails, this is a product that is most welcomed.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to pick a company that isn&#x27;t trying to jack you for the shipping.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> They seem to hold up better than this one.</li>
            <li> It makes your nails so shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> Just do like 10 seconds per side and your nails look fantastic!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more for gifts &amp; replacements for myself when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more when I need.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything that gives me a better sheen.</li>
            <li> These buffers are okay</li>
            <li> I never paint my nails or get manicures, and these help my nails look healthy and glossy.</li>
            <li> Just bought six more for stocking stuffers after trying this one out.</li>
            <li> I will order more for gifts,  </li>
            <li> It works much better than those I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> What more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> I am beyond happy that I only had to spend $3 to get my nails looking this good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased I purchased this buffer, it&#x27;s cheaper and probably better than the OPI one.</li>
            <li> but this one is better quality.</li>
            <li> Kind of cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Will buy more if this one ever does wear out.</li>
            <li> It is way cheaper and will pass for okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> top purchase</li>
            <li> AN OKAY PRODUCT, WHEN I USED IT</li>
            <li> I have used many buffers.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like to put anything on your nail, but like it to look shiny and healthy, this is the product you must have.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m glad I can get them through the Amazon Marketplace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order two more because I want to have these around for spares.</li>
            <li> This buffer is so much better than any buffer I can buy at the beauty supply or drugstore.</li>
            <li> I buff them, moisturize, and then paint them whatever color and always get a nice smooth coat.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, gives me healthy looking nails</li>
            <li> (I know from experience :))</li>
            <li> Ladies love it.</li>
            <li> I like them better than the Seacret buffing blocks because these are a bit softer, have more &#x27;give&#x27; to them -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK I guess for a nail buffer.</li>
            <li> And after doing several of my best buffing jobs with this, it still doesn&#x27;t give me the glossy look.</li>
            <li> The best value is to buy several (or more) at one purchase.</li>
            <li> I can use my buffer while I watch TV and my nails are looking shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Flash Shiner work better than nail buffer.</li>
            <li> and I noticed there nails look a heck of a lot better.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I came home and &amp;#34;Amazonned&amp;#34; it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll def be buying more after the Flash Shiner Nail Buffer wears out.</li>
            <li> I was looking more for a file and not a buffer.</li>
            <li> If you want one that works even better get the buffing block form SEACRET.</li>
            <li> Nails look healthy, and application can be repeated often.</li>
            <li> I have had much better.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> But i think it could be more cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is everything I could have wished for and more.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many buffers including the shammy type with a buffing cream</li>
            <li> It is better than a topcoat because it does not flake, chip or rub off.</li>
            <li> I think I will be able to get maybe another 5 uses before I retire it.</li>
            <li> so I bought a lot more and gave them away to friends and family..</li>
            <li> Great product, value, service and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This brand wokrs much better than some of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I got the buffer in the $40 nail set and the flash shiner is way better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Got one of these in a kit and it was much better.</li>
            <li> this is MJZ signing out:))</li>
            <li> So glad to see you can buy it seperately.</li>
            <li> This buffer is actually the best I have found.  </li>
            <li> This once created a smooth feel and amazing shine after one buffing, and it lasted 3 weeks before I needed to touch them up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the buffers I&#x27;m used to have more grit</li>
            <li> Nice and cheap, yet does a great job at buffing my nails to a high gloss shine.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Product worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> and they do a surprisingly good job, kind of amazing, actually.</li>
            <li> It has lost some of its shine ability but still works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> It keeps my nails looking good and strong when they are not polished, and it is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> If you purchase this product you will not even have to buy the clear top coats because this buffer gives a great shine.</li>
            <li> The buffer is worth more than it even costs!</li>
            <li> But the shininess just makes your nail ridges more noticeable because the other sides don&#x27;t work the best.</li>
            <li> It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
            <li> This buffer work amazingly well and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Far cheaper and works great.</li>
            <li> Wife loved them fast shipping</li>
            <li> You absolutely will be delighted when you see how shiney your nails will be.</li>
            <li> Shiner Nail Buffer gives you a great shine without polish.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and very simple to use!&lt;br /&gt;It will not take you more than 5 minutes to have shiny and healthy nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great by easily buffing your nails to a smooth shine that makes it look as though there was a coat of clear nail polish applied!  </li>
            <li> I tried this buffer for the first time while visiting a friend in D.C. and fell in love!  </li>
            <li> It takes a while to go through the 3 steps, but is easy to do while watching TV, or otherwise preoccupied.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I bought 3 more.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and makes your nails shiny without the chipping from nail polish.</li>
            <li> The buffer was really good; it gives such a nice shine.</li>
            <li> My nails aren&#x27;t in the greatest condition right now because of my constantly wearing/removing nail polishes, so I&#x27;m giving them a break for a while.  </li>
            <li> But that first buff was so shiny and amazing.</li>
            <li> These are really amazing at first.  </li>
            <li> My wife took me to the salon for the first time a couple months ago and the one thing I liked was the nail buffed look.</li>
            <li> ..how you get that shine with the fine grit buffing tool (like sandpaper) is by removing some of your nail.</li>
            <li> Leaves my nails super shiny without the use of nail polish!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy, and leaves my nails so shiny and smooth, even better than topcoat.</li>
            <li> I use these in the making of my model airplanes, but my wife uses them for nail care and wants more!</li>
            <li> As I buffed away I couldn&#x27;t get over how shiny my nails were becoming; it was like claying your car and having a fresh coat of wax!</li>
            <li> Its so gentle and pretty and almost gives you the shine of a million dollar top coat!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase, makes my fingernails really shine, easy to use and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It does work a little though, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> but you can smooth ridges and buff them beforehand.</li>
            <li> , my nails have never been this smooth, free from ridges and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;Super-fast shipping from this seller.</li>
            <li> After using, my nails felt smooth as glass.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who likes to dress well, stay physically fit, keep well groomed and appreciate that in others.</li>
            <li> all it did is buff and shine my nails weren&#x27;t smooth after</li>
            <li> Makes my nails feel fancy and smooth.</li>
            <li> these are fairly cheap; I&#x27;ve used it twice and the gray sides are already coming</li>
            <li> I have found that my nail polish lasts longer when I smooth out the surface of my nail.</li>
            <li> but you can also get that really cheap or use olive oil or whatever.</li>
            <li> I liked the demo one at the mall but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money.  </li>
            <li> Practical and light to carry everywhere</li>
            <li> Great for stuffed basket gift sets or personal use!</li>
            <li> and it was so cheap</li>
            <li> My nails are so smooth and shiny after using this Nail buffer..</li>
            <li> I used it about a week ago and my nails are STILL shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works great, and will probably need to be replaced at the same rate as the mall one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it makes your nails shiny.  </li>
            <li> This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic and I just ordered another.</li>
            <li> figured I&#x27;d try to find a cheap replacement</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good when you first use it.</li>
            <li> However I received my order fast and it works great , they just really need to change that pic .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my nails have shined this much!!!</li>
            <li> This does give a nice shine to the nails, but I&#x27;ve found that it thins the nails just enough that they tear more easily.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the first one I got in the keosk at the mall and just as good.</li>
            <li> Very easy and fast to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, light and economical.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is so easy and that it works so fast.</li>
            <li> Great for vacations, easy to pack foam block, nothing to break; no stinky wet polish.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love this so much!</li>
            <li> I did love the shine it gave my nails after the first use.</li>
            <li> It does not have any buffer qualities -- the original has diamond dust buffer strip.  </li>
            <li> Arrived fast as well! &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Hands look clean and neat without being too girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If an individual likes a natural shiny appearance to nails with out applying polish, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Then I tried this buffer and quickly had smooth shiny nails.</li>
            <li> I have tried SEVERAL buffers and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li> more of a healthy natural buffed shine.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with an original product from Israel, and purchased this as an economic substitute.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product specially if we don&#x27;t want to put any color to the nails.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price, and does exactly what i hoped it would!  </li>
            <li> Basically this block when used correctly will take the surface of your finger/toenails down to a perfect smooth surface which can then be buffed to a high glossy shine.  </li>
            <li> They seemed really shiny to me, and make my nails look much more &amp;#34;hygienic&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> I use polish to help strengthen my nails, just a nice clear coat of another product I have reviewed.  </li>
            <li> The buffer does last a good amount of time , which could vary as to the frequency of usage.</li>
            <li> its the soft kind so it doesn&#x27;t take off the layer of nail</li>
            <li> I love walgreens even though the majority of senior citizens shop their haha</li>
            <li> I only got 3 good uses out of it.</li>
            <li> It is the true deal.  </li>
            <li> This one was okay, but unfortunately really didn&#x27;t approach the level of buffing that the Seacret one did.</li>
            <li> guy gets one if you want nice looking natural nails.</li>
            <li> but for now it is cool to have around.</li>
            <li> Or maybe this is for you to use on your natural nails so they will look nice and shiny without damaging them.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price either.</li>
            <li> Easy and fast to use!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect solution -- in just a few quick strokes, the nails are shiny and pretty -- and the price is great, much less than a manicure at the spa.  </li>
            <li> but the shine wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> Does the job quickly too.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different buffers and this one is better than any I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails super shiny for a couple week.</li>
            <li> it makes my nails super shiny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this expecting to have super shiny nails.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly step three shined my nails.</li>
            <li> My husband tried it on one of his nails and then determined he needed to go back and roughen it to a more manly finish since it worked so well  :)</li>
            <li> Man this thing got my nails super shinny.</li>
            <li> white side, however, is an excellent buffer and the glossy shine is still the same 24 hours later.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would buy so many more once this one breaks or gets dull, this is so much better than the ones at those mall kiosks and way cheaper!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it is very good as a nail buffer.</li>
            <li> So I do use a nice clear polish right after I finish buffing.</li>
            <li> It was cheaply made and I don&#x27;t think the grit was consistent as it should be to buff and shine nails.</li>
            <li> No only he solved my problem but he actually made sure that I was 100% happy and</li>
            <li> have very rough nails to start with, so I&#x27;m very happy to have the three grits on one soft block that&#x27;s well made.</li>
            <li> Works very well and super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I was able to do my wife&#x27;s toenails and fingernails with one unit, then its pretty much done.  </li>
            <li> Everybody loved them at first and then came to the same conclusions that I did..</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for in a buffer!  </li>
            <li> These little buffers do a GREAT job buffing and shining.  </li>
            <li> Using a flash block like this will allow you to give yourself (or someone else) a great looking shiny set of nails with little effort.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped for a replacement for my Seacret brand buffer, which did such an amazing job.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and like neat nails but tend to destroy nail polish, buffing is a great option.</li>
            <li> My wife likes her nails looking freshly manicured but because we travel  </li>
            <li> , it is really soft and in few minutes you get awesome nails.</li>
            <li> My nails look incredibly clear, shiny, &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d say worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> They work well, but aren&#x27;t worth $30.</li>
            <li> Does not do a good job of smoothing out rough spots on nails.  </li>
            <li> Have fun</li>
            <li> They definitely bring your nails to a nice shine.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li> Makes them look freshly manicured every time.</li>
            <li> For a fraction of that, you can have ten shiny nails in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li> For this very reason I&#x27;ve purchased a nail buffer at Target before and it worked good enough for my needs</li>
            <li> time to go kill something and eat it over an open fire I built with my bare (but beautiful looking) hands.</li>
            <li> When you are finished with the white side you have a nicely manicured shiny nail.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the miniscule amount I paid.</li>
            <li> So I was thrilled to find this one for only a couple dollars.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool how it works.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the $5.</li>
            <li> If u wanna spend more on shipping then product&#x27;s original value then only go for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier, cheaper &amp; better for my nails to simply keep them trimmed, clean &amp; buffed.</li>
            <li> This is not a buffer to rid your nails of ridges but after you use another buffer to buff out the ridges you can quickly get a fast super shine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, doesn&#x27;t damage your nails, and shines nails as well as clear polish.</li>
            <li> They are well made but did not have the right roughness that my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> Price is right.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and it was shipped immediately.</li>
            <li> any more just buy this one it shines your nails like no other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought high end ones from salons, cheap ones from the grocery store and none managed to impress me.</li>
            <li> Very, very manicure-friendly and useful.</li>
            <li> None of the sides were strong enough to smooth a ridge in your nail polish or even your nails.  </li>
            <li> It buffed out the yellow stains from my nail polish and my nails look super healthy.</li>
            <li> Go ahead and look good right down to your finger nails.</li>
            <li> A simple little tool that gives you that awesome glossy nail look and feel in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, these nail buffers work really well;  they smooth out the nail (not ridges) and put a nice polish on them.  </li>
            <li> You have to keep them up, though, because after using this I found that my nails got minor scratches more easily and became very bland-looking, very fast.</li>
            <li> Needed a new one and looked here and decided to try these as what&#x27;s the downside they are so cheap.  </li>
            <li> You do only receive one, but it is great, especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li> but it really is like super duper shiny.</li>
            <li> Nail buffer is easy to use and gives my nails a professional shine.</li>
            <li> The Amazon description was very clear and accurate.</li>
            <li> They wear out after a few weeks, depending on how much you use them, but give the nails a beautiful gloss without much effort.  </li>
            <li> works very well, great buff, however the down side is these are not very long lasting, but for the price they are a good bargain</li>
            <li> I used to buy very cheap buffers, this is sooooooooo different.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It works fine now the old man seems to have had a manicure.  </li>
            <li> It is surprising how shiny this little block makes my nails.</li>
            <li> Quick, easy shine on fingernails and toenails in about ten minutes while you watch TV.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at my nails, they were just so shiny.</li>
            <li> first saw this at a mall, and figured for a couple dollars I might as well try it.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it advertises to do.  </li>
            <li> Not only are you able to shine your nails</li>
            <li> Makes my nails real shiny!  </li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy Flash Shiner again or recommend it to a friend, as the price is so reasonable!</li>
            <li> but I think the company needs to include instructions on which side to use first and what it suppose to accomplish.</li>
            <li> Trim and file your nails first then buff.</li>
            <li> But with the shipping cost it really just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> My mom came back from the grocery store with a $2 one that was about 10 times better than this one.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using the buffers, my nails have grown so much that I have to file them once a week!</li>
            <li> No fake nails for me &amp; I manage to chip off nail polish within 24hours.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Surely there must be a way to get a buffer only I thought.</li>
            <li> it should be exactly what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> They fall apart the first time used.</li>
            <li> The shine didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend!! :)</li>
            <li> each and the shipping is the same no matter how many you buy.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Will be back for more.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for saving my wallet!</li>
            <li> a side note, I purchased another nail buffer with a cheaper price tag, that came in a pack of 3 with pretty colors.  </li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> OK, that&#x27;s enough...</li>
            <li> This is my first buffer and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I saw the same product at a home show costing more than five times what it cost on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and i was once willing to pay</li>
            <li> If you want the first 2 steps, you&#x27;ll have to buy them separately.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive - so they are worth buying.even though they wear out fast.</li>
            <li> Very durable and useful.</li>
            <li> It actually work and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t remember very clear), but it is of the same amazing effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried out several different brands of nail buffers, including the kind you can get from those mall kiosks, and this one is far and away my favorite.</li>
            <li> this is an okay buffer for the price, it is different on the sides, and works pretty well, however i have bought better buffers, but not for the same price, on here, so it does okay, but if you are looking for something that does more, then go for the more expensive one!</li>
            <li> What there is of the buffer works okay, but it doesn&#x27;t have the slightly rougher side that I use the most frequently.  </li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s good for its price, but I recently found out I could buy these from an international company for about fifty cents (USD)</li>
            <li> It is so affordable, arrived fast, and I will be ordered more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spend the extra money on the good one next time.</li>
            <li> This came really fast and was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> It cleans your nails and brings out a very noticable shine on your first treatment</li>
            <li> you didn&#x27;re really want in the first place.</li>
            <li> these are really pretty flimsy and too flexible to be of much use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as the Seacret nail buffers, but these cost a small fraction of the price</li>
            <li> I have bought those mall kiosk buffers in the past and loved them</li>
            <li> If you look at the customer images for this well that is exactly how my nails were after using this buffer, and that was about a day after scrubbing my nails with a toothbrush and bleach/water concoction, having used one of those cheap nail varnishes that managed to stain my nails a while back.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I needed something to fill in my order for free shipping and picked this from my list of small priced items.</li>
            <li> but if your nails are &#x27;ridgy&#x27; I&#x27;d use a regular buffer first to smooth out and then use this one.</li>
            <li> However, thay do ware out very quickly; They are only .75 each, so that makes up for it.</li>
            <li> The instructions were simple and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> It was not bulky or big and it was really easy to handle.</li>
            <li> good polishing thigh, but do not last long</li>
            <li> i accidentally scraped the edge of my nail against one of the sides and it created a large rip.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and natural.  </li>
            <li> It would be great if they made one grey side (instead of two) one green side, and two white sides, as the white side doesn&#x27;t work good after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> It does buff to a very high shine though so it does what it claims even if it isn&#x27;t what you expect.</li>
            <li> These work really well.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was to much and came to Amazon</li>
            <li> and I could never get any real length.  </li>
            <li> These manicuring blocks really do the job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what else to say, I am not a connoisseur of nail-care products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> my perky friend tells me...then pitches me on a whole kit of gew and gunk</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommended.</li>
            <li> but realistically they are probably very overpriced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell a difference from any of the sides.</li>
            <li> Like that it works and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and find it very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> All sides of this are smooth and almost the same texture...</li>
            <li> The grey and green sides which are used first, do a great job and are gentle on the nail surface.</li>
            <li> So it is not of much use to me.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> The buffing sides are still gentle</li>
            <li> The product shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..</li>
            <li> Thanks for the glassy nails.</li>
            <li> Just very</li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t produce a very shiny nail.</li>
            <li> I really like these buffers.  </li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> Without that, nothing really works as it should.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my Husband and Step Son and their nails also look real shiny.</li>
            <li> Fast communication and very concern about his clients.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even out the nail as much as some I have used before, but</li>
            <li> not what i expected but ok</li>
            <li> I really like this buffer.</li>
            <li> The result is very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> It really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Works really well on real nails as well as acrylic.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Will be more careful reading the product information</li>
            <li> The smooth shiny side ripped on the second use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and they all are very durable, one buffer lasts for me ~3 mnth</li>
            <li> Hello bought these blocks and work very well</li>
            <li> Seller fast and efficient.  </li>
            <li> A nice low key shine .</li>
            <li> I noticed with other ridge filers, you have to go very light</li>
            <li> I purchased one for less than half the price from a local big box and was much more impressed.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, shine lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I originally was duped at a mall several years ago and got their \\&quot;kit\\&quot; which included this and some lotion for about $25.  </li>
            <li> This plus a rich hand cream like aquaphor same effect.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long, but it&#x27;s certainly worth the relatively small effort involved and best of all NO MESS!</li>
            <li> The surfaces loose their texture very quickly.</li>
            <li> Got the package and used it and it buffed the tiny ridges out of my nails just as good as the more expensive version.  </li>
            <li> They are so reasonable that I ordered three, to be sure I had enough to last awhile.</li>
            <li> I think this is working pretty good but pretty expensive</li>
            <li> So, I look down and think that my grubby thumbnail looks better now</li>
            <li> I bought this because I recently got a job in New York City and wanted my nails to look natural yet healthy and professional.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly on both natural and artificial nails.</li>
            <li> The shine on my nails is better than any polish could do for much less work.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb , it took my less than 2 minutes to have saloon shiny nails ,love it.</li>
            <li> I actually like these better than the Seacret buffers at the mall because the ridge smoother is not so gritty and it feels a bit smoother on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Also, as I have gotten older, my nails were breaking</li>
            <li> I love the glossy, wet, clear look.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s only good for a few buffs.</li>
            <li> Decent buffers for the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen better but much more expensive.</li>
            <li> If you like a high shine on your nails without always using polish this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> this buffer amazed everyone who I demonstrated it to- highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and will buy another when this one becomes overly used.</li>
            <li> step produces a high luster.</li>
            <li> High shine that has lasted over a week.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, it doesn&#x27;t last long as the surface wears out quickly - I&#x27;d order one to make sure you like it and then order 3-4 at once if you buff regularly or do both nails/toes.</li>
            <li> I would have paid a little more to have it come with the oil</li>
            <li> The problem I&#x27;ve had with mine is that it didn&#x27;t last very long and the results diminish rather quickly, a real bummer since it is such a great product out of the starting gate.  </li>
            <li> so I have been looking for a low maintenance, clean, professional look without the use of nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different brands of nail buffers and honestly, this gets my nails shinier than most of the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It seriously shined it so much that it looks like I have clear nail polish on, I love it!</li>
            <li> I have many other cheaper choices only for nail-shining.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really upset.</li>
            <li> So, the next thing I know I buffed all the nails on my right hand.</li>
            <li> If you think about this for a second, they are (1) paying for these peoples&#x27; tickets, (2) paying for them to stay there, and (3) paying them pretty decent money to sell these pieces of foam.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Revlon&#x27;s CrazyShine for a number of years and decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase it again, but if you only need it for an important date coming up they would definitely get the job done!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by how well this works.  </li>
            <li> Once I had the clear nail polish on, they looked even shinier!</li>
            <li> it looks like I&#x27;m wearing clear polish!</li>
            <li> Frankly, it&#x27;s easier to just put clear nail polish on!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like I have clear nail polish on!  </li>
            <li> The shine is much better than I get with other products, and seems to last longer as well.</li>
            <li> As for the white buffer side, it seems equivalent to the Seacret buffer and much better than the Revlon or other drugstore</li>
            <li> Maybe a week of complete shine!  </li>
            <li> Every side of the buffer felt the exact same..</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as described, if you follow the simple three steps.</li>
            <li> So I went home and found this, bought it and it works exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> This product was EXACTLY the same thing!</li>
            <li> I actually use a different buffer to smooth my nails, then I use the light grey and white surfaces on THIS one to shine!</li>
            <li> of the 4 sides do the exact same thing...</li>
            <li> Just as good as mall kiosk products... seems to be wearing down a little faster?</li>
            <li> I did one hand with the old buffer and one hand with the new.</li>
            <li> This buffer made a huge difference, in contrast to my previous buffers.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying the same nail block I had previously because it was better for smoothing and polish adhering.</li>
            <li> The buffer seems to be far too mild and does not really do the job that is intended.  </li>
            <li> If you only have little ridges on your nails, it would probably still be okay</li>
            <li> You use three sides of the buffer in the order from rougher to smoother and it shines your nails like you have a clear coat on them</li>
            <li> So shiny, it looks like I&#x27;m wearing a clear polish.</li>
            <li> They looked as if I had put a clear coat before even putting anything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, clean up your act and get a half dozen of these.</li>
            <li> The Flash Shine hand looks like I used clear ultra glossy nail polish on it.</li>
            <li> This makes your nails look like they have a clear coat of shiny nail polish all the time that doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> no need to wear a clear coat.</li>
            <li> It makes your nails look like you have clear polish on them.</li>
            <li> They buff to look shiny like they have a clear coat on them.</li>
            <li> It Buffers my Nails so shiny that it looks like I have clear nail polish on it.</li>
            <li> It looks like I&#x27;m wearing clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> and they still look like I have a clear coat on them.</li>
            <li> Not quite like a clear coat now...</li>
            <li> It does make your nails look as if you have clear polish on them without using chemicals or chipping.  </li>
            <li> I ended up finding a nearly identical one for a lower price at CVS.</li>
            <li> This buffer is lightweight and works like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> Only takes like 10 minutes to really buff them up.</li>
            <li> Shines the same as that expensive one and is great for both men and women, You have to have natural unpainted nails thou or it will stain the buffer and it will not work at all anymore</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do nail polish but the natural shine was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this maybe five or six times and the paper is completely worn out.</li>
            <li> But you can use the white side to your hearts desire, that&#x27;s the one that really brings out the shine, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And naturally Amazon had this product.  </li>
            <li> The one that is supposed to basically file doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all, and the last side, which is supposed to buff the nail to a shine, buffs it to not quite a shine.</li>
            <li> My husband bought the complete kit of this product for me when we travelled to Cape Town in SA, since then we have  been trying to get our hands on it.</li>
            <li> For me that keeps natural nails, it solves my manicure problems.</li>
            <li> I will get a professional manicure.  </li>
            <li> story short, why not just buy them online for a reasonable price?  </li>
            <li> Left my nails feeling looking very glassy and shiny, even after 24 hours since I buffed them.</li>
            <li> They do a professional looking job.  </li>
            <li> I use mine perhaps once a week when I do complete manicure -</li>
            <li> or just leave the nails with Gods natural shine.</li>
            <li> The buffer (white) side works well and makes nails very shiny.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it three times</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that there is much buff left after I used it once</li>
            <li> finished nails look like they are professionally manicured.  </li>
            <li> I wish Amazon would sell directly, get packs of three (no shipping).</li>
            <li> It looks like I&#x27;ve had my nails done professionally.</li>
            <li> and you are ready to move to the next color.  </li>
            <li> A few light strokes and move on.  </li>
            <li> I think I am at about 10-12 uses so far for $3.</li>
            <li> My old one lasted years.  </li>
            <li> They only difference is this one doesn&#x27;t have the really course side for shaping your nails.</li>
            <li> Buffer is lightweight and works like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> All sides are too soft</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> When my daughter told me she was still using her old one, I thought it was time for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing: since no instructions are included it is important to note that you should not overly buff (longer than about 20 seconds) on the darkest side as you can make your nails too thin thereby defeating the whole purpose!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my nails went from dull to super shiny.</li>
            <li> I mean it was cheap!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what people were talking about when they said they were only able to get one use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this with two other very similar products, and all three perform as good, if not better than the one we were demoed at the mall.</li>
            <li> File as usual; then use the dark side, then the blue, then the white, and you get a great shine without all the gook and smell.</li>
            <li> this one will probably not be as high quality as the above</li>
            <li> I did read the reviews before purchase--the really low, really high and in betweens.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and affordable but it&#x27;s not a professional nail item.</li>
            <li> On the fourth use it did not work properly becaue too much of the serface had completely worn off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the shine will last, or how long the actual buffer will last, but as of right now..I love it!</li>
            <li> Sadly the happiness ended after the third use.</li>
            <li> it is only mediocre  Not as good as the ones at the kiosk&#x27;s at the mall.  </li>
            <li> A few seconds on each side you have clean shinny nails that are long lasting without much fuss or rubbing or thinning of the nails.  </li>
            <li> It shines nails like no other and at a price</li>
            <li> The green &amp; grey sides wear out VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> I expected it to smooth the ridges on the nails buff it and then shine it like i am used to with the other nail buffers i had.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well, but the nails loose their shine the same day you buff them.</li>
            <li> These buffers came with no instructions, so I didn&#x27;t know which order to use the buffer sides; and the end product was smooth, but dull nails.</li>
            <li> I know they are cheap, but dang, I used it once, and the grey material used for  ridge removals ripped after a few swipes</li>
            <li> My only criticism would be that I wish it came with 2 white polishing sides rather than 2 grey sides, as it&#x27;s always the polishing side that wears out first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed o_o</li>
            <li> but I was surprised to see some of the reviews as low as 1 star based on stuff like the picture misleading them or that it fell apart.</li>
            <li> The Revlon is barely shiny by comparison.</li>
            <li> Actually, when having my nails done professionally the technician used this to shine my nails.</li>
            <li> but apparently its suppose to do that.</li>
            <li> No regrets whatsoever.</li>
            <li> it leaves the nails with the option to do a complete manicure of colored nails, french, etc.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re bare.</li>
            <li> When you finally finish and wash it off the shine is completely gone.</li>
            <li> , it has strong chemical smell, may not good for your health.</li>
            <li> I do dishes and other \\&quot;real woman\\&quot; chores, and cannot keep up with nail polish.</li>
            <li> This Flash Shiner Nail Buffer is on a whole other level.</li>
            <li> This buffer works just as good as those expensive ones!</li>
            <li> My nails are very shiny for a long long time.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to carry in your purse for quick touch ups.  </li>
            <li> This product makes your nails shine like they have clear polish on and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> A month&#x27;s use for just a few bucks seems like a bargain to me, so although I can&#x27;t compare the durability of one buffer (or how long its shine lasts) to the expensive mall kit buffers, I can say these do give good results that don&#x27;t disappear in a few days, and with free and prompt shipping, whether you order 1 or 20, they are just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I was upset at first because I thought it stopped working after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Then the files got too worn down to make much difference.</li>
            <li> I read from other reviews that they wear down quickly.  </li>
            <li> You use three sides of the buffer in the order from rougher to smoother and it shines your nails like you have a clear coat on them that is long lasting.</li>
            <li> My problem with it was that it did not have a side rough enough to remove stains (like this style of block buffer normally does).  </li>
            <li> This little three sided nail buffer is a very clever way to nicer nails with a simple 1, 2, 3 sequence.</li>
            <li> These little beauty tool works real well.</li>
            <li> this little buffer is very convenient for me.  </li>
            <li> It works really well, but dont use it too much or you will wear down your nails and they will become weak and sensitive!!</li>
            <li> After about a month, the whole thing is degraded and pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> So yay to shiny nails but boo to my buffer not lasting long enough to see the fruits of its labors.</li>
            <li> That one is more expensive though, and doesnt hold up for too long either.</li>
            <li> But then, I&#x27;m pretty hard on them.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long.. only</li>
            <li> i was accosted at the mall by someone trying to sell me this for a hundred dollars, but i got this for less than five and works great and my other nails look just like the one the crazy lady at the mall did with the hundred dollar buffer.</li>
            <li> You have to work pretty hard to get your nails shiny with this..and even then it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much I used them as stocking stuffers this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> that is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> and they did last a long time.</li>
            <li> The shine doesn&#x27;t last as long as SeaSecret.</li>
            <li> The rough side of this buffer is not rough at all.</li>
            <li> but the buffer didn&#x27;t last every long.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t last a long time.  </li>
            <li> But they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It works really well the first few times you use it, but after only a few uses there is no more grit left on it and its garbage.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that this little block produces very professional results.  </li>
            <li> was a little confused because the description does not specify how many buffers you get, but the picture shows three.  </li>
            <li> and it was send the same day and didn&#x27;t receive til Friday which is a long wait !    </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long, but at this price they don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li> not durable doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> But after using it for a while I discovered that the shine doesn&#x27;t last very long and also</li>
            <li> The light green is redundant as it does the same as the black.</li>
            <li> the only difference between the two besides the price is the flash buffer has a grey and white sides while the other has blue.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well but every time I hold it the black and green parts start rubbing off on my hands</li>
            <li> None the less, had I known I was only buying one, I still would have done it, and I will definitely buy this product again whenever my current one wears out.</li>
            <li> This nail buffer makes my nails shine, I ofen just give them a quick buff if I have plain nails and want to add a small shine to them.</li>
            <li> This one little product made my nails look professionally done.  </li>
            <li> This buffer does nothing to or for your nails, it&#x27;s a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> cheaper than a seller girl recommended near a mall (dead sea?</li>
            <li> The shine lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Works the same as the more expensive dead sea spa buffer.  </li>
            <li> It smoothed out the rough spots but definitely no shine.</li>
            <li> I expected to get three, but only one came.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that the shine side of the buffer does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it lasts for, but do these things really last long with such regular use?  </li>
            <li> And the shine lasts so long!</li>
            <li> Nothing needs to dry.</li>
            <li> However after only a few uses, the white buffing side doesn&#x27;t buff as well.</li>
            <li> You start with the gray side, follow with the green side and lastly use the white side.</li>
            <li> But this one did not live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> but it fell apart after a single use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really easy to use, and much less expensive than other similar products.</li>
            <li> when I contacted the seller they said meaning of 3 pieces is the product has 3 sides Green, Grey and white to use.</li>
            <li> product does the same job but for a lot less</li>
            <li> As a man, I usually try to do my own nails, and do so in a haphazard manner.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find my usual Dead Sea ones at a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li> The mall one cost $20, this one almost ten times less.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last long with heavy use</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that on my nails, the effect doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been cut up by all of them not called &amp;#34;Flash Shiner.&amp;#34; If around four dollars per buffer seems aa little steep, remember that they will last 5-6 buffings before you&#x27;ll feel like you need another.</li>
            <li> After only 5 uses, it was almost unusable and left my nails looking dull and ridgy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made clearly of all styrofoam, not nice material.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the block will last</li>
            <li> A few moments later and wha la!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected when they came in...</li>
            <li> The directions: Buff with Gray, then Green, then White and return to the sleeve</li>
            <li> The black--supposedly rough--side is not even remotely close to being an emery board comparison.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected</li>
            <li> Either way it was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> only worked for a few times</li>
            <li> I really only intended to do the nails that had dried up glue on them, but they ended up looking so glossy and shiny</li>
            <li> The gray sides are not very efficient at smoothing the ridges.</li>
            <li> and I found this much less expensive version that does exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> Since having a baby, I don&#x27;t have much time for manicures, but I don&#x27;t like my hands to look sloppy.  </li>
            <li> For the cost I was not expecting it to hold up long term, but I expected it to last at least a couple of months, not 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> These are the same quality as the are in the nail kits, but are a small fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s the name of the other one:</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, since another similar product from a different buyer disappointed me, but I love this buffer!</li>
            <li> It has already outlasted the other kinds.</li>
            <li> There are other brands out there</li>
            <li> This product does the job, but unlike other nail buffers, the shine on this one lasts about 2 days versus the two weeks</li>
            <li> IN COMPARISON WITH THE OTHER I HAD, AFTER A MONTH  I  THROW IT.</li>
            <li> it left small horizontal scratches all over my nails.</li>
            <li> Not sure about a weekly use, i only use maybe twice a month.</li>
            <li> These work, but they don&#x27;t compare to the other brand.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long just a few strokes</li>
            <li> It is small enough to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is I ordered mines on October on a Thursday and thought it was going to be shipped the next day like usual but no not Friday or Saturday or Sunday or Monday</li>
            <li> The package included other items, however not worth that price.  </li>
            <li> but of course washing hands will dull them back again.</li>
            <li> its not worth the price until unless they are sending you 3 pieces not 3 sides.</li>
            <li> Not worth whatever they cost.</li>
            <li> Hey,  I&#x27;m a guy who chewed his nails till late middle age.</li>
            <li> Shiny nails without buying a whole expensive kit of stuff.  </li>
            <li> this is instantly a better manicure than bare nails without the nasty chemicals of nail polish</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well suited for an average made buffer.</li>
            <li> thats all i have to say not worth it</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the trade-off to me.</li>
            <li> and once she walked away I put it down on the nearest shelf and walked away.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 at one time, and even with the cost of shipping, they were less than $3 each.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other nail buffers/shiners before and they didn&#x27;t make my nails half as shiny as this one does!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s half of a half percentage of what the kiosks at the mall want to sell it to you.</li>
            <li> I can use it in less than 5 minutes while watching</li>
            <li> I got less than a month out it.</li>
            <li> so it takes much less time than it&#x27;s taking with this one.</li>
            <li> I have used others in the distant past that took away the ridges.</li>
            <li> I ordered 5 since the shipping cost didn&#x27;t change from the minimum and that averaged my cost to a little over a buck thirty apiece.</li>
            <li> The little block is 3 1/2\\</li>
            <li> Just takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> It was a little misleading.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed only because it didn&#x27;t work as well as my more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I am still using my little shiner.  </li>
            <li> and my nails always  look like they have a little polish</li>
            <li> Since neither the expensive nor the cheaper versions last very long, it maybe makes sense to go cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Call me crazy, but it might be because the profit margin on these things is absolutely through the roof.  </li>
            <li> No need to buy Dead Sea stuff at a mall kiosk.  </li>
            <li> Thought it was Premier by Dead Sea which I had tried.</li>
            <li> I was always intrigued in these things, and bought one for my uneven and peeling nail beds.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The gray and green sides don&#x27;t work as well as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Even I can buff my nails, and polish them with just a few rubs.</li>
            <li> I have the one from the dead sea products which is $10 on their website</li>
            <li> Waste of $5.</li>
            <li> The guy at the mall started me off with the idea, but I wouldn&#x27;t let him work on my nails because who knows who had just been worked on previously!</li>
            <li> No, I am not gay.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the size makes it a tiny bit awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I usually end up picking at the dried up glue and it leaves my nails looking scuffed up and cloudy.</li>
            <li> This one lasted only a few weeks before it was useless.  </li>
            <li> The only bad part is that all the sides are a hard sponge part with a little bit of different texture.</li>
            <li> Basically the entire product is completely useless.</li>
            <li> I had something like this in the past</li>
            <li> No more nail polish for this gal.</li>
            <li> I have used products like this in the past...</li>
            <li> I gave these to the girls that I play Bunco with along with a small tube of handcream.  </li>
            <li> I guess it would be one use if you rub and rub and rub excessively</li>
            <li> I have owned two nail buffers in the past that were purchased from mall kiosks, and I&#x27;ve used a couple that are shaped like nail files.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately the shine doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long.</li>
            <li> I take it from her since I wasn&#x27;t in the mood for a hard sell</li>
            <li> you dont have to press that hard to get a shine.</li>
            <li> However, I realized that I was pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> However it turns out the quality is really bad, the &amp;#34;sand paper&amp;#34; barely sticks together loosing all those small particles immediately when you start using it.</li>
            <li> At least these were inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This thing literally sucks.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> This is NOT a nail file - it will not get rid of ridges, unless they are very, very small.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend people using daily bad for your nails.</li>
            <li> This one shocked me since it actually worked.</li>
            <li> I hate fingernail polish, but like my nails to shine as if they have clear polish.</li>
            <li> I notice after a number of hand washings, the gleam is dimly thin and the shine is slowly gone.</li>
            <li> As an elderly woman with poor eyesight and shaky hands, giving myself a manicure had become a chore almost beyond me.  </li>
            <li> This sucks!</li>
            <li> I am trying to strengthen my thin, peeling nails</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t catch and get worse.</li>
            <li> Nail polish just made them worse.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not uncommon for me to get some on my nails.</li>
            <li> not thats its not a good value for one, however its just wrong to show one thing and deliver another</li>
            <li> the sides of the buffers were very weak too.</li>
            <li> I hate to paint my fingernails - or have anyone else do it - and this makes them a little nicer without the paint.</li>
            <li> Product description is wrong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to get to nail salons .</li>
            <li> but they always came in expensive nail kits.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong one.</li>
            <li> I purchased these nail buffer/shiners after having used an expensive one from one of those mall kiosk companies.  </li>
            <li> i am so sick and tired of sellers depicting a product falsely.</li>
            <li> until I was told that it would cost me around $30, which sounded insane for a little buffer.  </li>
            <li> Again, for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> bad thing</li>
            <li> and I was so frustrated I send the company</li>
            <li> I bought this online and wasn&#x27;t particularly disappointed-</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> stinks!</li>
            <li> All I can seem to find are the finer ones. :(</li>
            <li> but I was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> but i was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> This is extremely horrible dont buy it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice and cheap, yet does a great job at buffing my nails to a high gloss shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried out several different brands of nail buffers, including the kind you can get from those mall kiosks, and this one is far and away my favorite. The shine is much better than I get with other products, and seems to last longer as well. My only criticism would be that I wish it came with 2 white polishing sides rather than 2 grey sides, as it&#x27;s always the polishing side that wears out first.</li>
            <li> Since having a baby, I don&#x27;t have much time for manicures, but I don&#x27;t like my hands to look sloppy.  This is the perfect solution -- in just a few quick strokes, the nails are shiny and pretty -- and the price is great, much less than a manicure at the spa.  I already ordered another one -- wonderful find!</li>
            <li> I bought i nail buffer at the mall and it worked great but its worn out, so i bought this one. I don&#x27;t care for the feel of it, and i don&#x27;t think it works as well, but it still makes your nails shiny. I would just prefer something else.</li>
            <li> These work really well. I ended up finding a nearly identical one for a lower price at CVS. The first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t stop staring at my nails, they were just so shiny. It takes a while to go through the 3 steps, but is easy to do while watching TV, or otherwise preoccupied. They seemed really shiny to me, and make my nails look much more &amp;#34;hygienic&amp;#34;. Everyone in my family uses them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first saw this at a mall, and figured for a couple dollars I might as well try it.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it advertises to do.  Shining nails almost instantly.  Great product and great gift.  For those of us that nail polish splits their nails, this is a product that is most welcomed.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a salon owner.  I hate to paint my fingernails - or have anyone else do it - and this makes them a little nicer without the paint. File as usual; then use the dark side, then the blue, then the white, and you get a great shine without all the gook and smell.</li>
            <li> Wife loved them fast shipping</li>
            <li> I actually like these better than the Seacret buffers at the mall because the ridge smoother is not so gritty and it feels a bit smoother on my nails.  I noticed with other ridge filers, you have to go very light or you end up scratching, rather than smoothing your nails.  As for the white buffer side, it seems equivalent to the Seacret buffer and much better than the Revlon or other drugstore brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, you also can&#x27;t beat the price.  Don&#x27;t buy from the mall kiosk.  For the price of one block at the mall, you can buy 20 of these from a vendor on Amazon.  Just be sure to pick a company that isn&#x27;t trying to jack you for the shipping.  One of the sellers I looked at wanted to charge me $3.99 shipping for each $.75 block that I ordered.  Obviously I chose the seller who was wiling to put all 20 into one envelope, and charge me accordingly.</li>
            <li> If you like a high shine on your nails without always using polish this is the product for you. Not only are you able to shine your nails but you can smooth ridges and buff them beforehand. I like this product so much I used them as stocking stuffers this past Christmas. It was a hit.</li>
            <li> This buffer is lightweight and works like a professional manicure. You use three sides of the buffer in the order from rougher to smoother and it shines your nails like you have a clear coat on them that is long lasting.  It is small enough to carry in your purse for quick touch ups.  Excellent product for an excellent price</li>
            <li> My MIL loves, loves these buffers.  Made me get her a case so she would never run out.</li>
            <li> Attention!!! Product description is wrong. As there picture and description shows 3 pieces in one order they will send you only one piece. when I contacted the seller they said meaning of 3 pieces is the product has 3 sides Green, Grey and white to use. as they have already mentioned this in there product description. If u wanna spend more on shipping then product&#x27;s original value then only go for it. its not worth the price until unless they are sending you 3 pieces not 3 sides.</li>
            <li> Works well, does the job it was made to do.  Makes my nails real shiny!  Doesn&#x27;t last very long.. only con!  Maybe a week of complete shine!  Only takes like 10 minutes to really buff them up. &lt;3 Wonderful!</li>
            <li> This nail buffer didn&#x27;t shine up my nails quite as well as the one a sales lady at a mall kiosk tried on my thumbnail.  That shine lasted 3 weeks versus the 1-week shine I got from Flash Shiner.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy Flash Shiner again or recommend it to a friend, as the price is so reasonable! I ordered 3 at one time, and even with the cost of shipping, they were less than $3 each.  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love this so much! I&#x27;ve had other nail buffers/shiners before and they didn&#x27;t make my nails half as shiny as this one does! It seriously shined it so much that it looks like I have clear nail polish on, I love it! I would buy then more of these, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Yes!  They work amazingly well.  Pick up 3 or 4 for the price and share them with friends like I did to cut shipping.  I originally was duped at a mall several years ago and got their \\&quot;kit\\&quot; which included this and some lotion for about $25.  Needed a new one and looked here and decided to try these as what&#x27;s the downside they are so cheap.  Got the package and used it and it buffed the tiny ridges out of my nails just as good as the more expensive version.  My family couldn&#x27;t believe how nicely and easily they worked so I got them as stocking stuffers for my mom and sisters.  Again, for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> The stuff from the buffer comes off onto your nails. But it works.</li>
            <li> These nail buffers are very simple to use , three steps . My wife likes her nails looking freshly manicured but because we travel  it&#x27;s difficult to get to nail salons . We tried these nail buffers and her finger nails look like she had them done at a salon . We&#x27;re very impressed and so are our friends who have ordered them after seeing ours. You absolutely will be delighted when you see how shiney your nails will be.</li>
            <li> The product works well but I think the company needs to include instructions on which side to use first and what it suppose to accomplish. My nails did shine but the ridges were still there. I have used others in the distant past that took away the ridges. Over all a good product for the price. A word to the wise, do not use this as a nail file. Trim and file your nails first then buff. You&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this nail buffer is GREAT! It shines nails like no other and at a price that&#x27;s half of a half percentage of what the kiosks at the mall want to sell it to you. The seacrest spa kiosk at my local mall wanted to sell me the buffer for $35+tax and I thought it was to much and came to Amazon and I&#x27;m so glad I did. Shines the same as that expensive one and is great for both men and women, You have to have natural unpainted nails thou or it will stain the buffer and it will not work at all anymore, Sister messed hers up LOL ...     Only complaint is I ordered mines on October on a Thursday and thought it was going to be shipped the next day like usual but no not Friday or Saturday or Sunday or Monday and I was so frustrated I send the company a messaged complaining about the shippement and 3hours later I got a message with an appology and it was send the same day and didn&#x27;t receive til Friday which is a long wait !    Shine lasts around 13days, Give 3 stars because I think if I wouldn&#x27;t have messaged them furious it wouldn&#x27;t have been shipped</li>
            <li> This buffer is almost identical to the nail buffer that the kiosk in the mall was selling as part of a hand and nail care kit. Theirs included cuticle oil and hand lotion, but was $79. This buffer work amazingly well and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Does the job at a great price</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but without instructions I can&#x27;t tell which order to use each side. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter, my nails have never been this smooth, free from ridges and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;Super-fast shipping from this seller.</li>
            <li> My wife took me to the salon for the first time a couple months ago and the one thing I liked was the nail buffed look. I don&#x27;t do nail polish but the natural shine was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does the same job but for a lot less and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Works like advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Bigger than it looks</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;This Shiner Nail Buffer gives you a great shine without polish.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and very simple to use!&lt;br /&gt;It will not take you more than 5 minutes to have shiny and healthy nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product! I will definitely buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;Attaching before/after photos</li>
            <li> Prefer the ones others talk about from the kiosk / mall.  They seem to hold up better than this one.</li>
            <li> Works you just have to use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this online and wasn&#x27;t particularly disappointed- I mean it was cheap! But with the shipping cost it really just wasn&#x27;t worth it. It&#x27;s made clearly of all styrofoam, not nice material. My mom came back from the grocery store with a $2 one that was about 10 times better than this one. It does work a little though, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for these,  but they always came in expensive nail kits.  These are the same quality as the are in the nail kits, but are a small fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> This nail block really does work great! It makes your nails so shiny and smooth! I would definitely recommend this! Just do like 10 seconds per side and your nails look fantastic!</li>
            <li> It works great, easy to use, does what I was expecting, good price, easy ordering, fast shipping. Very happy with purchase. I will be buying more for gifts &amp; replacements for myself when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> These worked great and not as pricey as some. It did make my nails have a nice shine but of course washing hands will dull them back again. So I do use a nice clear polish right after I finish buffing. Will be ordering more when I need.</li>
            <li> Keep one at home, one at work.  Great for a quick buff.  Haven&#x27;t found anything that gives me a better sheen.</li>
            <li> These buffers are okay but we&#x27;re not what my wife was looking for. They are well made but did not have the right roughness that my wife wanted. The Amazon description was very clear and accurate. The Amazon customer reviews were helpful. It was well packaged and arrived on schedule.</li>
            <li> Did not know you could even buy these. For men we pay 5.00 extra just for them to shine using this and now I can do it my self and my nails are even shiner</li>
            <li> Makes nails look shiny and gorgeous.  Very pretty and natural.  Also, as I have gotten older, my nails were breaking and I could never get any real length.  Since I&#x27;ve been using the buffers, my nails have grown so much that I have to file them once a week!</li>
            <li> These manicuring blocks really do the job. After using, my nails felt smooth as glass. So shiny, it looks like I&#x27;m wearing a clear polish. Just made another purchase recently and will continue to purchase them. Very easy to use. I highly recommend this product, it worls beautifully!</li>
            <li> Though it was a set of 3 should have read a bit more way over priced for one!</li>
            <li> My wife bought similar products from Singapore and was very happy with them, so she was happy to find these in Amazon. However it turns out the quality is really bad, the &amp;#34;sand paper&amp;#34; barely sticks together loosing all those small particles immediately when you start using it. Basically the entire product is completely useless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what else to say, I am not a connoisseur of nail-care products. I used it as prescribed, now my nails shine compared to what they were like before.</li>
            <li> I used this maybe five or six times and the paper is completely worn out. It was cheap, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail buffer addict. No fake nails for me &amp; I manage to chip off nail polish within 24hours. It&#x27;s easier, cheaper &amp; better for my nails to simply keep them trimmed, clean &amp; buffed. I&#x27;ve bought high end ones from salons, cheap ones from the grocery store and none managed to impress me. This one shocked me since it actually worked. My nails look great, very shiny, nail polish shiny! It was great. I happy danced, sang sonnets and all that. Sadly the happiness ended after the third use. The green &amp; grey sides wear out VERY quickly. Ever after one use I saw the wear and tear. Why can&#x27;t anyone make a buffer that works great &amp; lasts??? Someone on another review mentioned a buffer they found at CVS for 1.49. I&#x27;ll look for it &amp; report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the name of the other one: Salon Plus 3-Way Buffer distributed by Rite Aid for $1.49</li>
            <li> Found this nail buffer to give you an acceptable shine when you don&#x27;t have the time for polish.  I liked it so much I bought 3 more.</li>
            <li> Does everything it is supposed to do.  Just as listed.  Exactly what I was looking for in a buffer!  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> You do only receive one, but it is great, especially considering the price.  Not sure how long it lasts for, but do these things really last long with such regular use?  It&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. I never paint my nails or get manicures, and these help my nails look healthy and glossy. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as the Seacret nail buffers, but these cost a small fraction of the price so I will continue using these. Thank you to the seller for this great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my nails have shined this much!!! They looked as if I had put a clear coat before even putting anything. Once I had the clear nail polish on, they looked even shinier!</li>
            <li> Very, very, very good.  Does what it says it does.  Price is right.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just bought six more for stocking stuffers after trying this one out. The guy at the mall started me off with the idea, but I wouldn&#x27;t let him work on my nails because who knows who had just been worked on previously! I have had these before (different mall kiosk experience 20 years ago!) and they did last a long time. When my daughter told me she was still using her old one, I thought it was time for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing: since no instructions are included it is important to note that you should not overly buff (longer than about 20 seconds) on the darkest side as you can make your nails too thin thereby defeating the whole purpose! But you can use the white side to your hearts desire, that&#x27;s the one that really brings out the shine, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping. And for some reason I received a 30 cent promotion?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use these on my toenails on the month or so a year that I give them a rest from pedicures. I do not like manicures, so this is a way to make my nails look finished with no actual polish.</li>
            <li> I appreciate good grooming, so here is my story. I&#x27;m standing in the big box membership warehouse store when this perky gal slides up, grabs my hand...then my thumb and scrubs away with some kind of sponge looking thing. A few moments later and wha la! I&#x27;ve got a shiny thumbnail. I&#x27;m a guy who likes to dress well, stay physically fit, keep well groomed and appreciate that in others. So, I look down and think that my grubby thumbnail looks better now then it did 30 seconds ago. You can do this at home for only $19.95 my perky friend tells me...then pitches me on a whole kit of gew and gunk I&#x27;m suppose to slather over my nails and hands. But I just want the buffer I plead. Nope, comes as a kit only. I take it from her since I wasn&#x27;t in the mood for a hard sell and once she walked away I put it down on the nearest shelf and walked away. Surely there must be a way to get a buffer only I thought. And naturally Amazon had this product.  I ordered 5 since the shipping cost didn&#x27;t change from the minimum and that averaged my cost to a little over a buck thirty apiece. Hands look clean and neat without being too girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys, clean up your act and get a half dozen of these. Go ahead and look good right down to your finger nails.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works great and I plan on using it a lot. The price was great and it came fairly quickly from the company I purchased it from. This is a great buy for the price! If you purchase this product you will not even have to buy the clear top coats because this buffer gives a great shine.</li>
            <li> I used to buy very cheap buffers, this is sooooooooo different. It works great, it is really soft and in few minutes you get awesome nails. Great price too. Absolutely recommended.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good when you first use it. However after only a few uses, the white buffing side doesn&#x27;t buff as well. It would be great if they made one grey side (instead of two) one green side, and two white sides, as the white side doesn&#x27;t work good after a couple of uses. I did love the shine it gave my nails after the first use. I love the glossy, wet, clear look.</li>
            <li> Flash Shiner Nail Buffer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product for both men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are concerned about being well manicured.</li>
            <li> I love being able to get that nice shine on my nails between salon visits.  Works very well and super easy to use.  Good price, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I followed the steps to buff my nails and after 3 weeks they are still shiny!  I don&#x27;t know how this works, but I love it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ask question just buy it....its the most amazing product on the market..don&#x27;t bother looking any more just buy this one it shines your nails like no other</li>
            <li> I did not get what I thought I had ordered.  Not sellers problem, my misunderstanding of what it is but I am using it.</li>
            <li> Great amazing.made my nails look awesome and healthier than before. Everyone notices and It feels great and shiney too! Buy this.</li>
            <li> It is good to have this.  If buffs my nails beautifully.  Good job&lt;br /&gt;This tecnology is great.  I wish we could buy it locally.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, since another similar product from a different buyer disappointed me, but I love this buffer! I will purchase another for myself and others as gifts.</li>
            <li> I really liked this, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be THAT shiny but it really is like super duper shiny. I&#x27;m amazed o_o</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully!  My nails have never looked more shiny!  It&#x27;s also really easy to use, and much less expensive than other similar products.</li>
            <li> I will order more for gifts,  It works much better than those I&#x27;ve used before.  Very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Tried out this buffer after reading some reviews about it. It works really well the first few times you use it, but after only a few uses there is no more grit left on it and its garbage. I think I might have used it about 4 times before it was done.</li>
            <li> I have bought those mall kiosk buffers in the past and loved them but realistically they are probably very overpriced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true this one will probably not be as high quality as the above but I was surprised to see some of the reviews as low as 1 star based on stuff like the picture misleading them or that it fell apart. If you look at the customer images for this well that is exactly how my nails were after using this buffer, and that was about a day after scrubbing my nails with a toothbrush and bleach/water concoction, having used one of those cheap nail varnishes that managed to stain my nails a while back. I like that the buffer does not file the nail to be honest, &#x27;cause if you think about it that&#x27;s only thinning your nail, so I always skipped that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too cheap to complain about, and honestly I am happy with the results and for once am not having to wear nail polish. I actually think they&#x27;ll last longer than the kiosk product did.</li>
            <li> Keeps nails nice and healthy.  Gives great shine without polish.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected when they came in... Every side of the buffer felt the exact same.. Gave them to my daughter maybe she&#x27;ll think they&#x27;re doing something and use them on her nails..</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the result. My nails are very shiny for a long long time. Definitely a good product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I expected it to smooth the ridges on the nails buff it and then shine it like i am used to with the other nail buffers i had. all it did is buff and shine my nails weren&#x27;t smooth after</li>
            <li> Wow!  After using this buffer you would not be able to tell if it&#x27;s polish or nude nails!  So shiny after using this!  Also helps with adhesion of polish...I use polish to help strengthen my nails, just a nice clear coat of another product I have reviewed.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been using Revlon&#x27;s CrazyShine for a number of years and decided to try something new. Truthfully, I needed something to fill in my order for free shipping and picked this from my list of small priced items. I&#x27;m totally amazed at the difference in shine between the Revlon and this Flash Shiner. I did one hand with the old buffer and one hand with the new. The Flash Shine hand looks like I used clear ultra glossy nail polish on it. The Revlon is barely shiny by comparison. I do dishes and other \\&quot;real woman\\&quot; chores, and cannot keep up with nail polish. This is so much better! No flaking or chipping, and no hand-waving drying time. Lets not forget the expense of the nail polish, polish remover, cotton balls....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so fast it will not take you more than a minute to get a beautiful nail-polish-like  shine on your nails. The little block is 3 1/2\\&quot; x 1 1/2\\&quot; x 1\\&quot;, and by the way, you get only one block, even though there are three in the picture. It has three colors on the sides. The directions: Buff with Gray, then Green, then White and return to the sleeve (plastic it came in). If this ever wears out I will definitely purchase another one, but I don&#x27;t see how it could wear out. Stunning shine!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell a difference from any of the sides. The one that is supposed to basically file doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all, and the last side, which is supposed to buff the nail to a shine, buffs it to not quite a shine.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails feel fancy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works great. Holds up well.</li>
            <li> No need to buy Dead Sea stuff at a mall kiosk.  This plus a rich hand cream like aquaphor same effect.</li>
            <li> Like that it works and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Back in January, I was bombarded in the mall from someone selling these as a \\&quot;kit\\&quot; for around $70. I was shocked at how my nail looked when he tested it on me but despite the fact that I loved the result, I just couldn&#x27;t afford it. He kept lowering the price to convince me but I didn&#x27;t have money to spend on my nails at the time so I decided against it. Then, about a month ago, I found out what it was called so I decided to look it up online and I found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$3 and it did just what the mall guy did to my nail. My nails look incredibly clear, shiny, &amp; healthy. What more could I ask for? I am beyond happy that I only had to spend $3 to get my nails looking this good. 5 stars isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> It works great! I&#x27;ll give it five stars no doubt!</li>
            <li> good polishing thigh, but do not last long</li>
            <li> The shine doesn&#x27;t last as long as SeaSecret.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife. It is way cheaper than what the mall snakey mall guys try to sell you. It files, polishes and buffs. Good price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, shine lasts a long time.  I hate fingernail polish, but like my nails to shine as if they have clear polish.</li>
            <li> My husband bought the complete kit of this product for me when we travelled to Cape Town in SA, since then we have  been trying to get our hands on it. For me that keeps natural nails, it solves my manicure problems. I will recommend it any day to any body.</li>
            <li> The shiner nail buffers arrived on time and are very nice.  I read from other reviews that they wear down quickly.  They are so reasonable that I ordered three, to be sure I had enough to last awhile.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and find it very satisfactory. If an individual likes a natural shiny appearance to nails with out applying polish, this is perfect. Price is very reasonable. The buffer does last a good amount of time , which could vary as to the frequency of usage.</li>
            <li> Great product- this buffer amazed everyone who I demonstrated it to- highly recommended. I tossed out my nail polish products after this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality buffer but not a miracle. It does shine well but the shine wears off quickly. I am trying to strengthen my thin, peeling nails so am not using nail polish or gel polish, just oils and buffing. The buffing helps to even out the peeling so they don&#x27;t catch and get worse. I&#x27;m pleased I purchased this buffer, it&#x27;s cheaper and probably better than the OPI one.</li>
            <li> My nails have never been as shiny when buffed.  This product is wonderful!</li>
            <li> The rough side of this buffer is not rough at all. All sides of this are smooth and almost the same texture...wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It makes finger nails shine as advertised. Thank You! It&#x27;s a Very Nice item to shine your finger nails with.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one my wife had from years ago.  It is a great gift, she loves it.</li>
            <li> We tried one from the mall once, and my wife loved it until it wore away. I bought this for my wife and one for my mother. My wife loves hers.</li>
            <li> Used it on my husband as soon as I got it and now he has a shiny pointer fingernail! Love it!</li>
            <li> This came really fast and was exactly what I was looking for.  I had something like this in the past but this one is better quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong one. Thought it was Premier by Dead Sea which I had tried. Don&#x27;t think this one did as well as that one</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It works well and I especially like the white side which is used last to buff the nail surface. It just a moment&#x27;s time your nail surface will look like glass. It is amazing. The grey and green sides which are used first, do a great job and are gentle on the nail surface. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> i am so sick and tired of sellers depicting a product falsely. it should be exactly what is shown in the picture. this price is for one buffer not 3 like the picture shows. not thats its not a good value for one, however its just wrong to show one thing and deliver another</li>
            <li> This product makes your nails shine like they have clear polish on and it lasts a long time.I believe the act of buffing is good for your nails as it gets the blood flowing!</li>
            <li> Awful! The only side that functions in the manner promoted is the white side that puts on a finishing floss. The black--supposedly rough--side is not even remotely close to being an emery board comparison. The light green is redundant as it does the same as the black. At least these were inexpensive. I did read the reviews before purchase--the really low, really high and in betweens. I like to be objective when giving reviews. Save your money on a good lunch or a manicure.</li>
            <li> why do they call it a buffer? it doesn&#x27;t do nothing except for shining. I have many other cheaper choices only for nail-shining.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really upset.</li>
            <li> This buffer works just as good as those expensive ones! Leaves my nails super shiny without the use of nail polish!</li>
            <li> This buffer is actually very good at buffing.  My problem with it was that it did not have a side rough enough to remove stains (like this style of block buffer normally does).  None of the sides were strong enough to smooth a ridge in your nail polish or even your nails.  It does buff to a very high shine though so it does what it claims even if it isn&#x27;t what you expect.</li>
            <li> Kind of cheaply made. Seems like rubbing paper over your nails but eventually it will work. Just takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> Awesome and cheap! Same as they sell in the malls but with no pushy salesman. Highly recommend this product and will buy another when this one becomes overly used.</li>
            <li> This sucks! I know they are cheap, but dang, I used it once, and the grey material used for  ridge removals ripped after a few swipes</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
            <li> I had purchased the premier nail set and wore out my buffer so thought I would take a chance on this cheaper buffer. It works just as well as the more expensive one that came in the set and at a third of the price. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was advertised as a Seacret buffer, but it&#x27;s not.  The buffer came dented, since it wasn&#x27;t processed properly.  What there is of the buffer works okay, but it doesn&#x27;t have the slightly rougher side that I use the most frequently.  So it is not of much use to me.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My nails can get really shiny with this buffer, so I consider this an excellent purchase!  No more nail polish for this gal.</li>
            <li> It was cheaply made and I don&#x27;t think the grit was consistent as it should be to buff and shine nails. I purchased one for less than half the price from a local big box and was much more impressed. Won&#x27;t be using this.</li>
            <li> This little three sided nail buffer is a very clever way to nicer nails with a simple 1, 2, 3 sequence.Very convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different nail buffing gadgets, but this one is head and shoulders above the rest.  It&#x27;s quick and easy to use, doesn&#x27;t damage your nails, and shines nails as well as clear polish.</li>
            <li> The Flash Shiner does a great job of buffing and shining my nails. My only complaint is that the size makes it a tiny bit awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  Seems to wear out faster than some I have used but I&#x27;d say worth the money.  Nail buffers are awesome by the way!  This makes your nails look like they have a clear coat of shiny nail polish all the time that doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> These last longer than the stick ones you buy. Does the job quickly too. Will buy more if this one ever does wear out. It has already outlasted the other kinds.</li>
            <li> love it ~ looks great &amp; does the job and~made me feel more like a woman with pretty shiny  nails</li>
            <li> The selection of grits on the filing surface is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;You will be able to control the amount of surface area buffed with good precision.&lt;br /&gt;Final step produces a high luster.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the same as the ones you get at the kiosk at the mall. It is way cheaper and will pass for okay.</li>
            <li> As a man, I usually try to do my own nails, and do so in a haphazard manner.  Occassionaly,  3 or 4 times a year I will get a professional manicure.  I had been using a Dremel tool to buff my nails until at my last manicure the nailist used one of these.  I had to have one.  Ordered it off Amazon.  Works wonders.  Worth every penny.  I can use it in less than 5 minutes while watching TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike in Mesa</li>
            <li> I work at GNC in a mall, and every year, some company in Israel sends people over to work in the malls at kiosks and sell things like nail buffers.  If you think about this for a second, they are (1) paying for these peoples&#x27; tickets, (2) paying for them to stay there, and (3) paying them pretty decent money to sell these pieces of foam.  How in the hell do they afford to do this?  Call me crazy, but it might be because the profit margin on these things is absolutely through the roof.  These probably cost under .25 cents to make (perhaps even 10ish), and they sell them for about $30 at mall kiosks.  No wonder they can afford to do this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, why not just buy them online for a reasonable price?  They work well, but aren&#x27;t worth $30.</li>
            <li> Good thing these are fairly cheap; I&#x27;ve used it twice and the gray sides are already coming off.&lt;br /&gt;It does make your nails shine nicely - however, I thought it would do some filing.  It does not file at all.  It&#x27;s solely a &amp;#34;buff&amp;#34; and shiner.</li>
            <li> I thought that a buffer was a buffer was a buffer. Then I tried this buffer and quickly had smooth shiny nails. This buffer made a huge difference, in contrast to my previous buffers.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly on both natural and artificial nails.</li>
            <li> Does not do a good job of smoothing out rough spots on nails.  It&#x27;s good for buffing nails to shine but since I use polish I&#x27;m not that concerned with shiny nails.  It&#x27;s OK, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very nice and handy. Works wonderful. Good to keep nail healthy. I recommend this product specially if we don&#x27;t want to put any color to the nails.</li>
            <li> Very good item my nails are lightened! top purchase</li>
            <li> The picture shows three buffers but I only received one from each order.  Not what I expected but I may have not read the disc well enough.  Either way it was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> works very well, great buff, however the down side is these are not very long lasting, but for the price they are a good bargain</li>
            <li> AN OKAY PRODUCT, WHEN I USED IT THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE USED IT DID NOT HOLD THE NAIL SHINE AFTER MY SHOWER,</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!  A nice low key shine . Shine lasts for about 2 weeks. Even got my husband buffed! Lol</li>
            <li> Product worked pretty good. I gave it a 3 star rating because i was under the impression i was getting 3 and only got 1.</li>
            <li> These little buffers do a GREAT job buffing and shining.  My nails aren&#x27;t in the greatest condition right now because of my constantly wearing/removing nail polishes, so I&#x27;m giving them a break for a while.  These buffers cleaned up the peeling, and man, do they make your nails shine!</li>
            <li> I have used many buffers.  This one produces the shiniest and fastest finish of all of them.  This is not a buffer to rid your nails of ridges but after you use another buffer to buff out the ridges you can quickly get a fast super shine.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This nail buffer works great. Couldn&#x27;t get to the store to buy one so ordered it on amazon and it makes nails shiny and beautiful like I put a coat of gloss on.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different buffers and this one is better than any I have ever tried. The buffing sides are still gentle so they don&#x27;t shred your nails, and the shine is unparalleled. My nails are so shiny it looks like I&#x27;m wearing clear polish!</li>
            <li> It works. Actually, when having my nails done professionally the technician used this to shine my nails. She did say that only salons could get the Flash Shiner Nail Buffer....well not so! Amazon has it. I love Amazon!</li>
            <li> These suck. They fall apart the first time used. Not worth whatever they cost. Zero star option please.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by how well this works.  I have significant nail ridges and this made my nails look great!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well but every time I hold it the black and green parts start rubbing off on my hands</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly the best nail buffer I&#x27;ve ever used.  If you don&#x27;t like to put anything on your nail, but like it to look shiny and healthy, this is the product you must have.</li>
            <li> My now retired manicurist used to use these and give me  mine after every mani. Now I&#x27;m glad I can get them through the Amazon Marketplace. They give a great &amp;#34;buffed&amp;#34; look (which is very different from polish). Hey,  I&#x27;m a guy who chewed his nails till late middle age. It&#x27;s my vanity-but I don&#x27;t want to look sissified! I just want buffed nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very rough nails to start with, so I&#x27;m very happy to have the three grits on one soft block that&#x27;s well made. There are other brands out there but I&#x27;ve been cut up by all of them not called &amp;#34;Flash Shiner.&amp;#34; If around four dollars per buffer seems aa little steep, remember that they will last 5-6 buffings before you&#x27;ll feel like you need another. I get them from UFP Technoligies on Amazon and three last me about 4-5 months. Of course they can be bought by the dozen at a saving from this price. Whatever makes you happy!</li>
            <li> It works fine now the old man seems to have had a manicure.  My wife paid $20 for a similar application.</li>
            <li> I love this nail buffer! It makes my nails super shiny for a couple week.</li>
            <li> Perfectly named product. I am amazed. The shine on my nails is better than any polish could do for much less work. The product shipped fast. I&#x27;m going to order two more because I want to have these around for spares. These would make a good gift too. I am extremely happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This buffer does nothing to or for your nails, it&#x27;s a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> Nail buffer is easy to use and gives my nails a professional shine. I canâ€™t use chemical nail polish, so this is a great alternative. The price is right and it was shipped immediately.</li>
            <li> Shiny nails without buying a whole expensive kit of stuff.  This buffer is so much better than any buffer I can buy at the beauty supply or drugstore.</li>
            <li> I was always intrigued in these things, and bought one for my uneven and peeling nail beds. It&#x27;s quick and easy, and leaves my nails so shiny and smooth, even better than topcoat. I buff them, moisturize, and then paint them whatever color and always get a nice smooth coat. I love this thing, gives me healthy looking nails I don&#x27;t need to hide with color.</li>
            <li> Great price, compared to mall kiosk</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 2 or 3 uses. Then the files got too worn down to make much difference. Very nice results while it lasted though!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb , it took my less than 2 minutes to have saloon shiny nails ,love it.</li>
            <li> The buffer is o.k.  It didn&#x27;t come with any oil as i understood it would  without the oil it is only mediocre  Not as good as the ones at the kiosk&#x27;s at the mall.  The shine didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of days.  I would have paid a little more to have it come with the oil</li>
            <li> Love it works great and is fast!</li>
            <li> Overall it did the job it was suppose to do, but it left a lot of residue around and underneath my finger nails.</li>
            <li> It works really well, but dont use it too much or you will wear down your nails and they will become weak and sensitive!! (I know from experience :))</li>
            <li> Good price and good things!&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper than a seller girl recommended near a mall (dead sea? can&#x27;t remember very clear), but it is of the same amazing effect.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have shiny nails but the buffer didn&#x27;t last every long. So yay to shiny nails but boo to my buffer not lasting long enough to see the fruits of its labors.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Used it ONCE. And it&#x27;s now in the trash</li>
            <li> Frankly, it&#x27;s easier to just put clear nail polish on!</li>
            <li> it makes my nails super shiny. its the soft kind so it doesn&#x27;t take off the layer of nail but apparently its suppose to do that. I like it a lot</li>
            <li> Left my nails feeling looking very glassy and shiny, even after 24 hours since I buffed them. Definitely recommend!! :)</li>
            <li> works like a charm. no need to wear a clear coat. this is instantly a better manicure than bare nails without the nasty chemicals of nail polish</li>
            <li> Does what those thieves try to sell you in the mall but is not $30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I am a man, yes I take care of my nails. Ladies love it.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than the ones at the mall, does what it says it will do. You have to keep them up, though, because after using this I found that my nails got minor scratches more easily and became very bland-looking, very fast. Despite that, I&#x27;m very pleased for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I purchased these nail buffer/shiners after having used an expensive one from one of those mall kiosk companies.  I would say the product is not as good, but for the price it&#x27;s a worthwhile purchase.  Since neither the expensive nor the cheaper versions last very long, it maybe makes sense to go cheaper.  This is NOT a nail file - it will not get rid of ridges, unless they are very, very small.</li>
            <li> These are great..! I like them better than the Seacret buffing blocks because these are a bit softer, have more &#x27;give&#x27; to them - yet do just as good a job. My nails shine like there&#x27;s water on them.</li>
            <li> Works great! Had it for over a month and stays shiney for days! Easy and fast to use! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This works great .. good quality. . Fast shipping.. I would buy again . Thanks for the glassy nails. I was very pleased with the price point.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this product before.  I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. If I could have given it a zero, I would have!</li>
            <li> Does not work..don&#x27;t waste your money!! I wanted an etre without the kit, but you cannot find them so I tried this..stinks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK I guess for a nail buffer. It cleans your nails and brings out a very noticable shine on your first treatment but unfortunately the shine doesn&#x27;t stay on for very long. I notice after a number of hand washings, the gleam is dimly thin and the shine is slowly gone. The price is reasonable and affordable but it&#x27;s not a professional nail item. For the price it&#x27;s well suited for an average made buffer. Avoid this flash shiner and find a more consistant and suitable product.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well, but the nails loose their shine the same day you buff them. And after doing several of my best buffing jobs with this, it still doesn&#x27;t give me the glossy look. Just very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s only good for a few buffs. The surfaces loose their texture very quickly.</li>
            <li> Very easy and fast to use.  High shine that has lasted over a week.  Best buffer I have used in years.</li>
            <li> Still use this constantly. Great product for a great price. No regrets whatsoever. God good good. Would recommend it to all</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, these nail buffers work really well;  they smooth out the nail (not ridges) and put a nice polish on them.  They just don&#x27;t last a long time.  I was able to do my wife&#x27;s toenails and fingernails with one unit, then its pretty much done.  The nice thing is they are .75 each and the shipping is the same no matter how many you buy.  The best value is to buy several (or more) at one purchase.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  It makes your nails look like you have clear polish on them. The shine lasts a long time.  Shipping was fast and the price was great!!</li>
            <li> only worked for a few times</li>
            <li> Good quality but didn&#x27;t produce a very shiny nail.</li>
            <li> It is surprising how shiny this little block makes my nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased this expecting to have super shiny nails. I have used products like this in the past...But this one did not live up to my expectations. It did leave some shine to the nails, but not nearly enough. I would not have bought it if I had known.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend used it on my nails and I work as a mechanic. My nails were shiny and I looked like I just got a manicure. That tells you how well it will work on womens nails. No, I am not gay. Have fun</li>
            <li> I really like these buffers.  They do a professional looking job.  The only down side is that the shine side of the buffer does not last very long.</li>
            <li> it works a 100% can&#x27;t complain about a thing. I walked into walgreens the next day and saw a similar one for 69 cents..... Haha but if theirs no walgreens by then but it here works good price can&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;PS I love walgreens even though the majority of senior citizens shop their haha</li>
            <li> Great invention and they work nicely.  I use mine perhaps once a week when I do complete manicure - it leaves the nails with the option to do a complete manicure of colored nails, french, etc. or just leave the nails with Gods natural shine. Will be back for more.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I have always had brittle nails.  Nail polish just made them worse.  I can use my buffer while I watch TV and my nails are looking shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Great product, came in excellent condition. I thought 2 products would come with it, since I saw it in the picture. It was a little misleading. but great nail buffer, keeps it rejuvenated and shiny.</li>
            <li> You have to work pretty hard to get your nails shiny with this..and even then it doesn&#x27;t last long. Not what I had hoped for, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Same product sold at local mall for $59.00 , I double checked after getting this for my wife same item same manufacture. Wife loves it, she says it works the same</li>
            <li> Flash Shiner work better than nail buffer. The shine looks like you have polish on.</li>
            <li> I have found that my nail polish lasts longer when I smooth out the surface of my nail. I had a triangular block from the drugstore that I loved and lost, so I bought this as a replacement. The buff and shine parts works well, but I don&#x27;t think this is as good for smoothing out nail ridges and making polish stick to your nails better. I ended up buying the same nail block I had previously because it was better for smoothing and polish adhering.</li>
            <li> Decent buffers for the price.  They don&#x27;t last very long, but at this price they don&#x27;t have to.  They definitely bring your nails to a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I gave these to the girls that I play Bunco with along with a small tube of handcream.  It was a great gift and I noticed there nails look a heck of a lot better.</li>
            <li> Great shine but if your nails are &#x27;ridgy&#x27; I&#x27;d use a regular buffer first to smooth out and then use this one. As others have stated, it doesn&#x27;t last long as the surface wears out quickly - I&#x27;d order one to make sure you like it and then order 3-4 at once if you buff regularly or do both nails/toes.</li>
            <li> A friend had let me borrow hers before so I had to see if I could get one.  It works so well that you don&#x27;t even need to apply nail polish for the &#x27;shiny&#x27; look.  Very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> Great price and they do a surprisingly good job, kind of amazing, actually. But they don&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;d buy a bunch if I were you.</li>
            <li> For the $3.25 you pay for it, it works alright. The gray and green sides don&#x27;t work as well as others I&#x27;ve used. The buffer (white) side works well and makes nails very shiny. But the shininess just makes your nail ridges more noticeable because the other sides don&#x27;t work the best. I don&#x27;t regret buying it but don&#x27;t expect it to be amazing,</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Nevo one I had.</li>
            <li> This product does the job, but unlike other nail buffers, the shine on this one lasts about 2 days versus the two weeks I&#x27;m accustomed to. After about a month, the whole thing is degraded and pretty much useless. I would say it&#x27;s good for its price, but I recently found out I could buy these from an international company for about fifty cents (USD) each so I guess its okay but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price, and does exactly what i hoped it would!  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really necessary to use fancy oils and lotions in order to get shiny nails.</li>
            <li> Just as good or better as the one a friend of mine paid $25.00 for at a mall Kiosk.Did not have cuticle oil but you can also get that really cheap or use olive oil or whatever.</li>
            <li> The reason I put 2 stars, which is &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t like it&amp;#34; is because it did not hold up at all. I got less than a month out it. I had to do it once a week, because the shine was gone by then. I only got 3 good uses out of it. On the fourth use it did not work properly becaue too much of the serface had completely worn off.  For the cost I was not expecting it to hold up long term, but I expected it to last at least a couple of months, not 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This buffer works well and leaves a great shine. I use it about once per week, and get about 4-5 uses out of one buffer before the edges start to fray. A month&#x27;s use for just a few bucks seems like a bargain to me, so although I can&#x27;t compare the durability of one buffer (or how long its shine lasts) to the expensive mall kit buffers, I can say these do give good results that don&#x27;t disappear in a few days, and with free and prompt shipping, whether you order 1 or 20, they are just what I was looking for. Plus you&#x27;re not stuck with cuticle oil and lotion bottles you didn&#x27;re really want in the first place. I have looked, and you cannot find a reliable source for just the buffer from those mall kits. Buy these, and put some good lotion like curel or jergens on your nails, and you&#x27;ll have supple and strong and shiny nails.</li>
            <li> The first time you use it, it&#x27;s gives your nails a beautiful, smooth shine! After only 5 uses, it was almost unusable and left my nails looking dull and ridgy.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with an original product from Israel, and purchased this as an economic substitute.  Well, you get what you pay for.  It does not have any buffer qualities -- the original has diamond dust buffer strip.  Without that, nothing really works as it should.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. She hates painting her nails. We recently were at the Mall and a salesman tried selling her this with some lotion for like $50 at a kiosk. I came home and &amp;#34;Amazonned&amp;#34; it :) It is just like the one he tried selling us. It works perfect on her nails. They buff to look shiny like they have a clear coat on them. Great Buy! Thanks Amazon for saving my wallet!</li>
            <li> This buffer is awesome! It works exactly as described, if you follow the simple three steps. I was amazed at how quickly step three shined my nails. Very impressive. I&#x27;ll def be buying more after the Flash Shiner Nail Buffer wears out. So far I&#x27;ve used it three times and I get the same results each time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after getting ambushed in the mall by a kiosk seller.  I was really impressed with the buffer that made my nails shine like I had polish on them.  That is, I was impressed until I asked the price.  When I was told that the buffer, cuticle oil and hand cream would cost me $50, I tucked tail and RAN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got home, I went on Amazon to see what I could find here.  After reading the reviews I tried this buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the instruction very easy to follow, and got gorgeous results.  My nails look so shiny.  This is great since I work as a nurse, and cannot wear polish.  I will definitly purchase these buffers again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I purchased another nail buffer with a cheaper price tag, that came in a pack of 3 with pretty colors.  I was very dissapointed.  These buffers came with no instructions, so I didn&#x27;t know which order to use the buffer sides; and the end product was smooth, but dull nails.</li>
            <li> I liked the demo one at the mall but didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money.  So I went home and found this, bought it and it works exactly the same.  Now my nails look great!</li>
            <li> I received this Nail Buffer and it is just wonderful. It Buffers my Nails so shiny that it looks like I have clear nail polish on it. I tried it on my Husband and Step Son and their nails also look real shiny.</li>
            <li> The nail buffer is a very good product and it works well; however, it was not what I wanted. I was looking more for a file and not a buffer. I contacted the seller and he wrote me back immediatly. No only he solved my problem but he actually made sure that I was 100% happy and satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this seller 100%. Fast communication and very concern about his clients. Good to do business with!!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase, makes my fingernails really shine, easy to use and would definitely recommend. Practical and light to carry everywhere</li>
            <li> The package included other items, however not worth that price.  I did like the way my nails looked and I found this much less expensive version that does exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> This is a great nail buffer!  It doesn&#x27;t even out the nail as much as some I have used before, but the resulting shine is great! It looks like I&#x27;m wearing clear nail polish. My husband tried it on one of his nails and then determined he needed to go back and roughen it to a more manly finish since it worked so well  :)</li>
            <li> This item is total garbage. 1st the item came with a hole on one of the filing sides. Then I tried using it and it had air bubbles in it from when it was glued incorrectly to the board. And lastly I tried using the buffing side and it peeled off! Did I mention this was only after one use! Total waste of money!! I tried contacting the seller to inform them of their defective item they are selling and they never responded to me!</li>
            <li> These little beauty tool works real well. They shine my nails without any nail polish; that&#x27;s what I perfer. However, thay do ware out very quickly; They are only .75 each, so that makes up for it. I like to get a lot of them so I can use them as disposables.. If you want one that works even better get the buffing block form SEACRET. That one is more expensive though, and doesnt hold up for too long either.</li>
            <li> The Flash Shiner is a good way to sand and buff nails.  No polish needed!  Nails look healthy, and application can be repeated often.</li>
            <li> I was waylayed by a demonstrator in the mall and I liked the way my nail was smoothed and shined by her product.....until I was told that it would cost me around $30, which sounded insane for a little buffer.  This product was EXACTLY the same thing!</li>
            <li> This nail buffer works just as a great as ones that costs 12 times the price.  It is so affordable, arrived fast, and I will be ordered more in the future.</li>
            <li> Far cheaper and works great.</li>
            <li> not what i expected but ok</li>
            <li> This one little product made my nails look professionally done.  Great value for the price!  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is extremely horrible dont buy it thats all i have to say not worth it</li>
            <li> I really like this buffer. The cost was very cheap and there was no shipping charge. I will order the same one later whe I wear this one out!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that there is much buff left after I used it once and my mom used it once. But that first buff was so shiny and amazing. But I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth it if it&#x27;s only gonna buff once or twice!</li>
            <li> I adore these things.</li>
            <li> I have had much better.  Very cheap product.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> finished nails look like they are professionally manicured.  Much cheaper than the first one I got in the keosk at the mall and just as good.</li>
            <li> i was accosted at the mall by someone trying to sell me this for a hundred dollars, but i got this for less than five and works great and my other nails look just like the one the crazy lady at the mall did with the hundred dollar buffer. and i can buy a ton of these for one of those!</li>
            <li> As an elderly woman with poor eyesight and shaky hands, giving myself a manicure had become a chore almost beyond me.  Enter the Flash Shiner Nail Buffer.  It has solved my problem.  Even I can buff my nails, and polish them with just a few rubs. The result is very satisfactory.  It doesn&#x27;t last long, but it&#x27;s certainly worth the relatively small effort involved and best of all NO MESS!</li>
            <li> It works just as advertised. I would recommend it to anyone who likes to do their own nails at home.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says it does. It shines the hell out of my nails. Makes them look freshly manicured every time. And the shine lasts so long! I wash dishes every day and the shine lasts over a week.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! I use these in the making of my model airplanes, but my wife uses them for nail care and wants more!</li>
            <li> The buffer seems to be far too mild and does not really do the job that is intended.  I would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The Nail buffer works as it described. I like it because it&#x27;s kind of a nature way to keep your nail shine. I do not like the liquid nail shiner, it has strong chemical smell, may not good for your health.</li>
            <li> UNTIL  NOW IS THE BEST SHINER I HAVE TRIED.  WORKS PERFECT AND IT SEEMS TO BE&lt;br /&gt;STURDY IN COMPARISON WITH THE OTHER I HAD, AFTER A MONTH  I  THROW IT.</li>
            <li> The buffer started to give in (peeled off) the first time I used it. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Using a flash block like this will allow you to give yourself (or someone else) a great looking shiny set of nails with little effort.  I have been asked if I have nail polish on before and no I don&#x27;t lol.  Basically this block when used correctly will take the surface of your finger/toenails down to a perfect smooth surface which can then be buffed to a high glossy shine.  Very attractive and easy to use.  I do my own nails and my girlfriends as well.  She rather enjoys it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been to a mall recently, you&#x27;ve probably had a salesperson buff one of your nails with one of these that they sell as part of a fifty dollar kit. For a fraction of that, you can have ten shiny nails in the comfort of your own home. Great if you don&#x27;t have time to apply polish before heading out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, shines your fingers as if putting polish on it, its better than using nail polish</li>
            <li> not durable doesn&#x27;t last very long.  good concept though</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I didn&#x27;t expect something so inexpensive to work so well. It really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> i was really excited for this buffer since majority of the people posted very good reviews. but i was very disappointed. it left small horizontal scratches all over my nails. it did make them shiny but not to the extent some people claim. the sides of the buffers were very weak too. i accidentally scraped the edge of my nail against one of the sides and it created a large rip.</li>
            <li> I love this nail buffer! The first time I used it my nails went from dull to super shiny. I would definately recommend it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It is the true deal.  It is the 3 way shine, A few seconds on each side you have clean shinny nails that are long lasting without much fuss or rubbing or thinning of the nails.  the shine is longlasting... best buffer on the market (and I have tried many).  I wish Amazon would sell directly, get packs of three (no shipping).</li>
            <li> Great for that quick buff to make my nails look good before going out. Don&#x27;t recommend people using daily bad for your nails. Not sure about a weekly use, i only use maybe twice a month.</li>
            <li> This nail buffer makes my nails shine, I ofen just give them a quick buff if I have plain nails and want to add a small shine to them. Making them look nice and healthy.</li>
            <li> Works really well on real nails as well as acrylic. Not bad for the price either. Good product and I would recommend</li>
            <li> these are really pretty flimsy and too flexible to be of much use.&lt;br /&gt;I would  not buy these buffers again.</li>
            <li> Just as good as mall kiosk products... seems to be wearing down a little faster? But who cares when you can get them at this price. Great for stuffed basket gift sets or personal use!</li>
            <li> My mom wanted one of these after a lady in a kiosk at the mall had used her as a demo. It was out of price range and rightfully so (they wanted over $100 for the kit). I found this online and it was so cheap I thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try it out. It delivered the same results as the more expensive product. Great find.</li>
            <li> I had hoped for a replacement for my Seacret brand buffer, which did such an amazing job. This one was okay, but unfortunately really didn&#x27;t approach the level of buffing that the Seacret one did.</li>
            <li> This provided a great shine and has held up for many many uses. I will be ordering more when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> My nails are so smooth and shiny after using this Nail buffer.. But i think it could be more cheaper. But i&#x27;ll buy another one again when it&#x27;ll be needed</li>
            <li> Purchased these because of the cost &amp; I couldn&#x27;t find my usual Dead Sea ones at a reasonable cost.  These work, but they don&#x27;t compare to the other brand.  I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> I have tried SEVERAL buffers and this one by far is the best. I love the shine it gives! It looks like I&#x27;ve had my nails done professionally. I&#x27;m not sure how long the shine will last, or how long the actual buffer will last, but as of right now..I love it!</li>
            <li> I do not paint or get my nails done so having this little buffer is very convenient for me.  I get to have shiny strong nails without having to spend lots of money to get them done and without taking up my own time to do them myself</li>
            <li> This buffer files, smooths, and buffs to a great finish.  Easy to use, light and economical.  Recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The buffer is worth more than it even costs! Very, very manicure-friendly and useful. Arrived fast as well! &#x3D;] I recommend this for all lacqueristas.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to replace one that I bought years ago. I was a little disappointed only because it didn&#x27;t work as well as my more expensive one. But for the price, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good buffer, but i wish I could find the kind I used to have where there were coarser grit options. All I can seem to find are the finer ones. :(</li>
            <li> This does give a nice shine to the nails, but I&#x27;ve found that it thins the nails just enough that they tear more easily.  Not worth the trade-off to me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it is very good as a nail buffer. I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I recently got a job in New York City and wanted my nails to look natural yet healthy and professional. I used it about a week ago and my nails are STILL shiny and smooth. It buffed out the yellow stains from my nail polish and my nails look super healthy. I recommend every girl AND guy gets one if you want nice looking natural nails.</li>
            <li> Works the same as the more expensive dead sea spa buffer.  I&#x27;m sticking to these for now on.</li>
            <li> This product gives you really nice, shiny nails in a flash. I love that it is so easy and that it works so fast.</li>
            <li> Electronics, gadgets, and tools make up the majority of my Amazon purchases so I wasn&#x27;t really sure about how to pick a good nail buffer. I use cyanoacrylate adhesives for my RC plane hobby and it&#x27;s not uncommon for me to get some on my nails. I usually end up picking at the dried up glue and it leaves my nails looking scuffed up and cloudy. For this very reason I&#x27;ve purchased a nail buffer at Target before and it worked good enough for my needs but it fell apart after a single use. I decided to use Amazon this time around and trust the crowd rating to get a longer lasting buffer. This Flash Shiner Nail Buffer is on a whole other level. I really only intended to do the nails that had dried up glue on them, but they ended up looking so glossy and shiny that it made the non buffed nails look out of place.  So, the next thing I know I buffed all the nails on my right hand. Of course then I look at one hand next to another and I have no choice but to remain symmetrical so, the left hand gets the same treatment. As I buffed away I couldn&#x27;t get over how shiny my nails were becoming; it was like claying your car and having a fresh coat of wax! It&#x27;s been 5 days since I buffed my nails and they still look like I have a clear coat on them. My girlfriend has her own thoughts on my nails now being glossier than hers so I&#x27;ll be using this product sparingly, but my sister, mom, and coworker all have added this to their shopping list after having seen my nails.  OK, that&#x27;s enough...time to go kill something and eat it over an open fire I built with my bare (but beautiful looking) hands.</li>
            <li> I recently had a baby so I have been looking for a low maintenance, clean, professional look without the use of nail polish.  This is everything I could have wished for and more.  I have tried many buffers including the shammy type with a buffing cream and I can tell you that this little block produces very professional results.  You start with the gray side, follow with the green side and lastly use the white side. It doesn&#x27;t take long just a few strokes and you are ready to move to the next color.  When you are finished with the white side you have a nicely manicured shiny nail.  It is better than a topcoat because it does not flake, chip or rub off. I absolutely love it!  The shine lasts for about a week.  I believe this block will give me plenty of applications and months of use.  I am not sure what people were talking about when they said they were only able to get one use.  I guess it would be one use if you rub and rub and rub excessively but you do not need to do this.  A few light strokes and move on.  I highly recommend! I have uploaded a pic.  This took me about 2 minutes total for all 10 fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 2 Months Later...  I am still using my little shiner.  It has lost some of its shine ability but still works pretty good.  Not quite like a clear coat now...more of a healthy natural buffed shine.  Definitely makes the nail nicer than not using it.  I think I am at about 10-12 uses so far for $3. I think I will be able to get maybe another 5 uses before I retire it. This is definitely worth the miniscule amount I paid. A very nice, inexpensive, disposable, nail implement that works as intended.</li>
            <li> Product appears that you will receive 3 but only one arrived  Will not reorder  Will be more careful reading the product information</li>
            <li> Best one I have ever used!!!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this when my wife was impressed with a mall saleswoman&#x27;s pitch.  The mall one cost $20, this one almost ten times less.  Works great, and will probably need to be replaced at the same rate as the mall one.  She loves it.  I purchased this with two other very similar products, and all three perform as good, if not better than the one we were demoed at the mall.</li>
            <li> I originally loved this product.  It does make your nails look as if you have clear polish on them without using chemicals or chipping.  But after using it for a while I discovered that the shine doesn&#x27;t last very long and also..how you get that shine with the fine grit buffing tool (like sandpaper) is by removing some of your nail. Then after you have used it for a while your nails are thinner.  Then they tear or break off.  Too bad.  I bought one at a local beauty supply store then was happy to find them at Amazon so I bought a lot more and gave them away to friends and family.. Everybody loved them at first and then came to the same conclusions that I did..</li>
            <li> A copycat of one I used to have.  My old one lasted years.  This one lasted only a few weeks before it was useless.  I&#x27;ll spend the extra money on the good one next time.</li>
            <li> Good one for the price</li>
            <li> I think this is working pretty good but pretty expensive</li>
            <li> Pretty good. I could like a rougher edge, but the buffer goes to a very smooth edge which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> perfect!  Works great!</li>
            <li> Works just like the one I got at the mall, but 1/4 the price. They only difference is this one doesn&#x27;t have the really course side for shaping your nails.</li>
            <li> Great product, value, service and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am a guy and I saw a YouTube demonstration for one of these blocks and just thought it was the coolest thing! So I was thrilled to find this one for only a couple dollars. I&#x27;m not sure how long the block will last but for now it is cool to have around.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this item to shine my nails but I was sadly disappointed. It smoothed out the rough spots but definitely no shine.</li>
            <li> The smooth shiny side ripped on the second use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I received this product the day before it was supposed to arrive. This is my first buffer and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I&#x27;ve recommended this to my mom and friends already.</li>
            <li> I Like this product and I am very happy  to buy again. Buffer is lightweight and works like a professional manicure. You use three sides of the buffer in the order from rougher to smoother and it shines your nails like you have a clear coat on them that is long lasting. It is small enough to carry in your purse. Excellent product for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of polishing my nails. There are 4 sides to it and they all are very durable, one buffer lasts for me ~3 mnth</li>
            <li> Works great by easily buffing your nails to a smooth shine that makes it look as though there was a coat of clear nail polish applied!  I saw the same product at a home show costing more than five times what it cost on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it makes your nails shiny.  My only complaint is that on my nails, the effect doesn&#x27;t last too long.  But then, I&#x27;m pretty hard on them.</li>
            <li> Man this thing got my nails super shinny. Wish it had lasted longer&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing it doesn&#x27;t last long with heavy use</li>
            <li> makes nails nice and shiny and healthy looking. even my fiance is using this stuff for this nails. good product</li>
            <li> I bought this after being stopped at a kiosk at the mall selling a similar product for around $40. This product is easy to use and makes your nails shiny without the chipping from nail polish. Once or twice a month is sufficient as overuse can lead to thinning of your nails.</li>
            <li> Works great, just like I had at my manipedi.</li>
            <li> The picture shows two items but I only received one . However I received my order fast and it works great , they just really need to change that pic .</li>
            <li> My wife got this from me as a stocking stuffer, and while I have not used it personally, she swears it is an excellent product that makes her nails shiny and beautiful.  I concur.  Her nails are in fact shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> There is a difference among the various types of these things.  This brand wokrs much better than some of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> This nail buffer is really good and at a great price. I have the one from the dead sea products which is $10 on their website and i was once willing to pay but their site has issues when it comes to checkout. I got the buffer in the $40 nail set and the flash shiner is way better and cheaper. I purchased 4 and gave 3 away. the only difference between the two besides the price is the flash buffer has a grey and white sides while the other has blue. brown and white. All in all this is a great find, my nails look great.</li>
            <li> this is an okay buffer for the price, it is different on the sides, and works pretty well, however i have bought better buffers, but not for the same price, on here, so it does okay, but if you are looking for something that does more, then go for the more expensive one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few different brands of nail buffers and honestly, this gets my nails shinier than most of the more expensive ones. This is fantastic. I actually use a different buffer to smooth my nails, then I use the light grey and white surfaces on THIS one to shine! It&#x27;s fantastic and I just ordered another.</li>
            <li> Got one of these in a kit and it was much better. However I am still using these as a backup.</li>
            <li> Hello bought these blocks and work very well you dont have to press that hard to get a shine. My toes look very cool!! thank you UFP  this is MJZ signing out:)) Michael</li>
            <li> Does the job. I&#x27;ve seen better but much more expensive. These will do nicely.  Seller fast and efficient.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I tried this buffer for the first time while visiting a friend in D.C. and fell in love!  It definitely measures up to my expectations!!!</li>
            <li> Quick, easy shine on fingernails and toenails in about ten minutes while you watch TV. Nothing needs to dry. Great for vacations, easy to pack foam block, nothing to break; no stinky wet polish. Three steps to shine, just follow directions on bag.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do my nails in a salon, but this buffer does a nice job.  I had one in a kit &amp; wondered what I was going to do when it wore out.  So glad to see you can buy it seperately.</li>
            <li> I use this along with [[ASIN:B0001EKT06 Nailtiques Oil Therapy (.5 oz.)]] and my nails always  look like they have a little polish but they&#x27;re bare. Buy this instead of the $30.00 ones from the mail kiosk. Same stuff.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> These are really amazing at first.  You only get one (not three) in a package.  For some reason I am usually good about these things but missed that, whoops! The problem I&#x27;ve had with mine is that it didn&#x27;t last very long and the results diminish rather quickly, a real bummer since it is such a great product out of the starting gate.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase it again, but if you only need it for an important date coming up they would definitely get the job done!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Deep Sea Cosmetics 4-way nail buffer which I&#x27;ve had for about 5 years now.&lt;br /&gt;I figured I&#x27;d try to find a cheap replacement and I&#x27;m kind of disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;3 of the 4 sides do the exact same thing...&lt;br /&gt;The white side, however, is an excellent buffer and the glossy shine is still the same 24 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;So basically, you get 2 functions from this piece. Step 3 &amp; step 4. If you want a really good finishing piece, then this will be great for you. If you want the first 2 steps, you&#x27;ll have to buy them separately.</li>
            <li> These work well.  They wear out after a few weeks, depending on how much you use them, but give the nails a beautiful gloss without much effort.  Inexpensive - so they are worth buying.even though they wear out fast.</li>
            <li> All sides are too soft so you won&#x27;t be able to buff your nail with this just shine! So very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wow. You get what you paid for. This thing literally sucks. The gray side leaves gray dust in between your fingernails. When you finally finish and wash it off the shine is completely gone. I tried rebuffing it then putting lotion on my hands and again the shine disappeared. Waste of $5.</li>
            <li> I have owned two nail buffers in the past that were purchased from mall kiosks, and I&#x27;ve used a couple that are shaped like nail files.  This buffer is actually the best I have found.  With the others, I was used to re-buffing my nails once a week.  This once created a smooth feel and amazing shine after one buffing, and it lasted 3 weeks before I needed to touch them up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little confused because the description does not specify how many buffers you get, but the picture shows three.  I expected to get three, but only one came.  None the less, had I known I was only buying one, I still would have done it, and I will definitely buy this product again whenever my current one wears out.</li>
            <li> The instructions were simple and easy to follow. The buffer was really good; it gives such a nice shine. It&#x27;s almost like I have clear nail polish on!  It was not bulky or big and it was really easy to handle.</li>
            <li> A simple little tool that gives you that awesome glossy nail look and feel in a matter of minutes. If you&#x27;re like me and like neat nails but tend to destroy nail polish, buffing is a great option. Lasts ages.</li>
            <li> The gray sides are not very efficient at smoothing the ridges. If you only have little ridges on your nails, it would probably still be okay but the buffers I&#x27;m used to have more grit so it takes much less time than it&#x27;s taking with this one. I won&#x27;t get getting this again.</li>
            <li> One side is already falling off after 1 use. I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Its so gentle and pretty and almost gives you the shine of a million dollar top coat!! I would buy so many more once this one breaks or gets dull, this is so much better than the ones at those mall kiosks and way cheaper!</li>
            <li> This product came a day after I received it. I had only ordered it standered. The fat flash shiner nail buffer looks very nice. The only bad part is that all the sides are a hard sponge part with a little bit of different texture. I thought it was going to have one side with a plastic because the plastic part takes out the reall shine in acrylic nails. Or maybe this is for you to use on your natural nails so they will look nice and shiny without damaging them.</li>
            <li> It keeps my nails looking good and strong when they are not polished, and it is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m so happy I bought this product. Very durable and useful. It actually work and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool how it works. I was upset at first because I thought it stopped working after a few uses. However, I realized that I was pushing too hard. Totally worth the $5.</li>
            <li> I love this product! If you do not like to wear polish on your nails but want them to look shiny, this is for you. In just a moment, you can have beautiful shiny nails using this buffer. I recommend this product!</li>
