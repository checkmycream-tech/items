            <li>For the price - it&#x27;s a nice mirror.</li>
            <li>Nice make up mirror.</li>
            <li>I think that the oval shape is quite nice because it fits the shape of your head.</li>
            <li>The color of the lamp is nice too, and it came well packaged.</li>
            <li>Kind of a &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34</li>
            <li>would have liked it to be a taller mirror</li>
            <li>but thats my own fault for not buying one</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t need all that and can&#x27;t spend that kind of money.</li>
            <li>The mirror does get a bit warm after a while</li>
            <li>It is a nice design and</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast &amp; arrived perfectly unharmed.</li>
            <li>The lighting is very bright and the magnification is just the right amount.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the exact kind of style that I wanted, and it works incredibly well.</li>
            <li>:) very pleased</li>
            <li>I needed a new mirror, this on fits my needs perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Light is nice and bright.</li>
            <li>The magnification is okay, the light is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just really the perfect size and looks so cute sitting on my vanity.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite things that I own.</li>
            <li>but I would have liked it to be a bit more brighter.</li>
            <li>Light is not as bright as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>The light is not that bright.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me.  </li>
            <li>The light is bright but not blinding.</li>
            <li>for the price it might be suitable for some..</li>
            <li>Good quality and very useful</li>
            <li>It works great and is just the right size</li>
            <li>The wall mirror was just too far away for checking to make sure that my application looked flawless from close up as well as from a distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the design and the magnification plus light, but now I&#x27;m shopping for a really good set of tweezers...Yikes.</li>
            <li>Not as bright as I expected but by all means the mirror is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great purchase if you are looking for a great makeup mirror</li>
            <li>The light is bright enough and the magnification side is perfect for eyebrow shaping!I would recommend this mirror to everyone.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s huge!</li>
            <li>It is okay for a mirror.</li>
            <li>I bought this lighted makeup mirror to aid me in seeing better to apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li>so I have a desk lamp behind/beside it for more lighting</li>
            <li>She says it is the best one she has had, even compared to bigger and pricier models.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the light on the mirror</li>
            <li>Love the thumb switch.</li>
            <li>This mirror helps in doing makeup, but would have been much better if it was brighter.  </li>
            <li>It is better than nothing...</li>
            <li>Very small,nit happy at all with it.</li>
            <li>She gets rid of hairs with it and thats ok with me</li>
            <li>Thank you Conair for making such a perfect mirror...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad bit smaller than what I was looking for, but it&#x27;s perfect for any vanity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too tall for my counter top.</li>
            <li>Love the oval shape.</li>
            <li>What I like most about this mirror is the oval shape.  </li>
            <li>Most faces are oval, meaning taller than wider and the shape of this mirror better fits my face.  </li>
            <li>: Okay here is an update.</li>

            <li>Most magnifying mirrors I have seen will make your face look distorted.  </li>
            <li>but the light still running after 1 year!</li>
            <li>great design (modern and minimalist) and</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve been better off going to target or walmart.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to improve doing my makeup and tweezing my brows.  </li>

            <li>Great mirror  just not quite bright enough</li>
            <li>Florescent light is the best for applying makeup (besides natural daylight).</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tilt the mirror up more than 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li>One more word is required for the review.</li>
            <li>The light is really bright and the magnification is fantastic.</li>
            <li>well still works :)</li>
            <li>After seeing this item for sale at Target for $40, I checked Amazon and was pleased to see it for $29.53, so I promptly ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Great lighting, chic and smooth, and the highest magnification I&#x27;ve seen for such a great price.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that you CAN replace the bulbs.</li>
            <li>It took a while to find a good mirror with the right lighting.</li>
            <li>Great mirror, but the light burned out in the first month???  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bright and perfect for my little vanity  I can see clearly on both sides to do my make up love it !!</li>
            <li>I have bougth anotherone from costco for 19.99 and its has a white great light, loved it, By mistake I gave it away...</li>
            <li>Not as bright as I&#x27;d like and seems to run hot.</li>
            <li>The magnification is pretty good though.</li>
            <li>This would be a good lighted makeup mirror if it was bright enough, it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li>Very good light, not heavy</li>
            <li>It looks super nice on vanity</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and the price was nice.</li>
            <li>it is so great, really helps light up your face and makes it easy to see anything youre doing, and i love the magnified side to do my eyebrows</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this until 2 days later the light stopped working.</li>
            <li>Might be fine if your room is better lighted.</li>
            <li>The mirror is ok, but slightly smaller than I wanted &amp; the light isn&#x27;t very bright.  </li>
            <li>i love my mirror with light, I was looking this for a while .</li>
            <li>Smaller mirror and the lightening is not as ideal.</li>
            <li>A nightlight would produce more light than this mirror.</li>
            <li>Lighting is still better then a bathroom light</li>
            <li>and I love it, about the light in my opinion</li>
            <li>Love the way it looks with the chrome finish and light weight.</li>
            <li>Made of cheap plastic that I&#x27;m sure would break if you accidentally dropped it.</li>
            <li>i just wish this light was illuminating my face better.</li>
            <li>Amazing I used right away</li>
            <li>Well lit, overall good makeup mirror!</li>
            <li>The light is bright and works very well for the &amp;#34;detail&amp;#34; work.</li>
            <li>The light isn&#x27;t too bright and illuminates the whole oval around the mirror, not just one spot.</li>
            <li>the height is good since I set it on a high desk.</li>
            <li>There is just a HUGE problem with it that I can&#x27;t ignore.</li>
            <li>Overall %100 happy with it.</li>
            <li>Wish the light was brighter.</li>
            <li>I was in the store and was looking at some mirrors with 7x magnification which were fantastic and that&#x27;s why I went home, went online, and found this Conair.</li>
            <li>The stand is light, cheap, plastic-y feeling.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this mirror has a light on the edges and reverses for a close up view.</li>
            <li>you see fit...</li>
            <li>Update 1/17/16 - This light switch cracked and the light no longer</li>
            <li>The lights are soft and not overly bright.</li>
            <li>I wish the light were brighter for my needs.</li>
            <li>I have it sitting on the bathroom counter, so I do have the added light from the bathroom lights.</li>
            <li>The light works well</li>
            <li>This is great, I just bought a second one to give to my Mum for Christmas!</li>
            <li>Great mirror, smaller than I imagined</li>
            <li>One day, however, I went to turn on the light to discover the switch</li>
            <li>Light quit working after 2 months.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has had two &amp;#34;mishaps&amp;#34; - one her fault, one not and it was such a great mirror</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t light up well</li>
            <li>and the light still works.</li>
            <li>The light stopped working a month after I received it</li>
            <li>The magnification is amazing, and it really helps him put in and take out his lenses.</li>
            <li>the light is a bonus, i use this every day.</li>
            <li>This is a great double sided mirror.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like how the light switch was on the wire either</li>
            <li>but I was unimpressed with the power of the light on the mirror.  </li>
            <li>use it without the light</li>
            <li>just wish the light was brighter</li>
            <li>This is a well made mirror, the light works well</li>
            <li>Good mirror, I love the two mirror options (magnified and regular).</li>
            <li>Good size for adult faces/heads.  </li>
            <li>The oval shape lends character to it and the mirror is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Good even light, and a magnified mirror on the back, for fine work.</li>
            <li>The light is just right!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t look into a more expensive one as I might get hooked and spend more cash out of pocket when this mirror for me does a perfect job.</li>
            <li>Item was not in original packaging when received.  </li>
            <li>Seems well made and the light is bright enough to fill in shadows caused by overhead light.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>This mirror is perfect for everyday makeup application!  </li>
            <li>A week early!!!!! I was so excited and happy to get to use it sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li>Functional, clean design.  </li>
            <li>I think the light is bright enough.  </li>
            <li>Nope..not bright enough for me.</li>
            <li>it is bright enough!</li>
            <li>The item itself is in my opinion and the person i got it for looks amazing so clear .The</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine it would be good for applying makeup even, what with the yellow cast it gives off.</li>
            <li>This mirror is good enough</li>
            <li>This was a good mirror for a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift and when it came I was pleasantly surprised that it was as nice as ones that I&#x27;ve seen in stores for triple the price.</li>
            <li>But if I&#x27;m right up to it and have another overhead light on in my bedroom, it works.</li>
            <li>so light can be helpful in seeing things more clearly.  </li>
            <li>After that, a bigger mirror with more amplification is better.</li>
            <li>Shame on you guys for putting such a flimsy switch on such a great product!</li>
            <li>my sensational gelpolish LED lamp item was in the same box wen I paid Separate shipping and handling # smh.</li>
            <li>Perfect for low lit areas and the magnification is enough to make putting on make-up easier</li>
            <li>The magnification is great, but the illumination is somewhat dim compared to her old model.  </li>
            <li>so I just ordered my second one and am hoping for the same great mirror :)</li>
            <li>but the light bulb gets very hot quickly so it radiates too much heat onto my face.  </li>
            <li>(Maybe even too much!!</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t going to move the mirror at all, then it&#x27;s fine, but if you want to adjust it, not so much.</li>
            <li>And my daughter certainly leaves this light on a lot.</li>
            <li>Recieved it 2 days later very fast shipping very satisfied customer</li>
            <li>Says it&#x27;s bright enough but still gentle</li>
            <li>The light on the mirror seems more for decoration, than for actual use.</li>
            <li>I like my old Conair one better and will probably give this one to someone else.</li>
            <li>; product thats slightly useful.</li>
            <li>I like have the two sides to work with - the magnetic side is useful, but it&#x27;s also nice to have the standard mirror.  </li>
            <li>Sure wish it was a brighter white light this would have made it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>You def need more natural type lighting and this is just too unflattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am really glad I checked on Amazon, was going to some local stores, this was so much simpler!!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experience the bulb problem, but I&#x27;ll probably change it (see the other review) for another brighter light since the light is more &amp;#34;fashionable&amp;#34; rather than practical.</li>
            <li>We were a little worried that it&#x27;d be too small, but it&#x27;s just great and is a great price.</li>
            <li>,price was right</li>
            <li>Could use a slightly brighter light at full setting, but OK</li>
            <li>I really like the oval shape and don&#x27;t see that available as much.</li>
            <li>This one was exactly the same, but much more economical.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my very first REAL makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>This mirror is ok, but its more oval making it not wide enough .</li>
            <li>My problem is that the thing does not tilt very much.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great mirror so far.</li>
            <li>Not bad the lighting has lasted but its cheaper looking and way smaller in person, if you looking for a high quality or elegant one</li>
            <li>It is a pretty mirror but</li>
            <li>This is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>Price is so much better than buying the same one in a store.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this to replace the exact one that didn&#x27;t survive the drop test from the vanity.</li>
            <li>The cord is long enough, magnification is great, and the lighting is plenty for day or night.</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I wanted, it has two magnifying mirrors</li>
            <li>I DO love the mirror though and did not want to send it back</li>
            <li>I actually put a much better switch on the mirror than the one it came with (if you look through my reviews you will see the switch I used).  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li>Having never had one, I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it was dim or cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>It does get a bit hot to the touch after a while.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>love it , that simple</li>
            <li>Makes plucking my eyebrows a whole lot easier!</li>
            <li>It gets really hot.</li>
            <li>I love that it has the double sides.</li>
            <li>but this one is more than enough power.</li>
            <li>Shipped exactly as promised with no damage.</li>
            <li>;-)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I actually like this one better</li>
            <li>and it does not get too hot.</li>
            <li>purchased for my daughter in law who said it was exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one at target.</li>
            <li>Most stores, including bed bath and beyond want over $100 for a similar mirror.</li>
            <li>Like it better than the last Conair makeup mirror I had as it was a touch on and sometimes came on during a power surge.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have bought a larger one with more magnification also</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described and was an affordable price, shipped on time and was functional when we received it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Mfgs love to make things you have to throw out when a simple thing like a bulb burns out.</li>
            <li>The light on this mirror is too dim.</li>
            <li>However, if I had to pick between my old mirror and this one, this one would win hands down.</li>
            <li>Now older and wearing makeup of her own this is a more modern take on the past</li>
            <li>The mirrow is as big as i thought it would be, its not heavy, and i can do my make up with so better!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve grown accustom to it and now just see it as a romantic soft glow kind of lighting.</li>
            <li>I love the look of the mirror, but the light is a little much.  </li>
            <li>The light is bright, but perhaps a little too yellow of a tinge for a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li>After about 5 seconds on being on, the whole mirror gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li>Most mirrors like this that light up are a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li>Light on the mirror is not bright enough to illuminate the task being performed, it is a very good supplement to regular bathroom lighting ( this seems to be true of all illuminated mirrors regardless of size).</li>
            <li>This one is just as nice for half the price.</li>
            <li>the light seems strong yet my face still seems to be a little bit in darkness.</li>
            <li>Also, light is more soft and not a crisp white light.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish it was a little bit brighter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine size, but definitely not any sort of &amp;#34;vanity&amp;#34; lighting or magnification any different than turning on the light in your bathroom and standing at the sink and using that mirror.</li>
            <li>It has enough light and it does not take much space on the table.  </li>
            <li>too much~</li>
            <li>I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>When you order a mirror that has a light, you assume, it will be bright enough to at least produce some sort of illumination. .</li>
            <li>I certainly expected more out of this product....</li>
            <li>I asked once to use it and she was very hesitant but she allowed me to use it.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>My daughter also loves it, so much that she ask me to get her one.</li>
            <li>I do like this mirror for the magnify/light -- works well for that specific task based activity requiring light and close up views.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirror!</li>
            <li>Also, The light is yellow.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Putting makeup on has been so much easier since getting this mirror.</li>
            <li>Thank you I really like it</li>
            <li>and it not be ready.</li>
            <li>I see my whole face.</li>
            <li>my whole face not just one side.</li>
            <li>I also like that it doesnt fog up much when i take a shower, so i can use it after my shower.</li>
            <li>This mirror doesn&#x27;t provide enough light for my room.</li>
            <li>but too much that the reflection is distorted.</li>
            <li>I really like the finish and design.</li>
            <li>so much for being pithy.</li>
            <li>The light could be a bit brighter, but I just readjust the mirror to get the necessary brightness needed.</li>
            <li>I have never had a vanity mirror before and really wanted one to help with putting on makeup.</li>
            <li>Very well constructed mirror and stand.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t used it that much, either.</li>
            <li>This is all I expected and more</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to keep this mirror.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>works as expected and makes it so much easier when plucking my brows :)</li>
            <li>The lighting is pretty good, not extremely bright</li>
            <li>It does get dirty easily, but it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It has one side that gets real up, close, and personal on areas of your face that may need more defining when applying makeup or even when in need of plucking out those extra hairs.</li>
            <li>Not exactly what he expected, but is able to use it just fine.  </li>
            <li>A large round mirror would be better suited for applying makeup.</li>
            <li>The mirror is decent size and the magification is on point.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product for the price</li>
            <li>Be sure to check measurements as you may want the actual mirror to be bigger.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the soft light from my lamp seemed to actually outshine this mirror.</li>
            <li>only thing is i would like the switch to be on the stand to be more convenient, not sure how important that is though...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this mirror to everyone.</li>
            <li>Conair used to be high quality and now their stuff is junk.  </li>
            <li>Priced well and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>However, the price is reasonable and the image is clear and not distorted.</li>
            <li>The lighting is soft &amp; gentle.</li>
            <li>so I can see my face up close or normal and</li>
            <li>Wish this had more mirror space, it is narrow.</li>
            <li>Only 1 con, it gets really hot, really fast.</li>
            <li>other times it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I will continue to look for a new mirror.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any issues with my new mirror.</li>
            <li>The light around the edge illuminates my face so that I can actually see in the regular side of the mirror.</li>
            <li>Very clear.</li>
            <li>She says \\&quot;the mirror lights up my life\\&quot; and allows her to find all her imperfections that she then talks to me about ad nauseam, very early in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its too small Conair have a bigger size of the same model which is much more comfortable for make-up</li>
            <li>Back to my old Clairol light up mirror until I find its equal.</li>
            <li>Works as intended, but I wish the lights were a bit brighter and did not make the outside of the mirror scorching hot.</li>
            <li>Same exact one.</li>
            <li>The light is very dim and not adequate for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>The guy spends like an hour in front of it everyday, and he is now able to clean every little pore on his face since it has a magnifying side and lights up.</li>
            <li>The other side gives you a full face view of how you look so far.</li>
            <li>Just be careful of the edges when it&#x27;s been in use for a while, it tends to get quite hot!</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give this mirror five stars has to do with the fact that the light is not very bright and I have to get right in front of it to see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>Returned this item; it was so cheaply made and the light was totally useless</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift for my fourteen year old niece</li>
            <li>Have not had the mirror long enough to test the electric light, but I generally use natural daylight at a window when I work on my face.</li>
            <li>I use this mirror daily for getting ready for work in the morning.  </li>
            <li>But it does emmit heat and is dim.</li>
            <li>For a makeup mirror (my intended use) I would recommend a much rounder, wider, larger mirror.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is not touch sensitive.</li>
            <li>the only thing with the Marrow is it gets overheated too fast.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t touch it much when I&#x27;m doing my makeup so again, not a big deal.</li>
            <li>Gave this to my wife for Christmas after her old make up mirror gave up the ghost.  </li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter uses this every day.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s size causes my wife to have to move around to see what her old mirror showed.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and can&#x27;t see up close as well</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected, but both my daughter and wife love the mirror and use it daily.</li>
            <li>I am able to see pores and small stray facial hairs with ease.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re short on space or $, it&#x27;s a decent mirror for the price.</li>
            <li>It also takes a long time of using it before it starts to get really</li>
            <li>The light radiates heat, which I didn&#x27;t care for, and the oval shape is rather small.</li>
            <li>And heat build up in a mirror is never a good thing. :)</li>
            <li>If you are looking to do something like pull small hairs, this may not be the mirror for you as you will need stronger light.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I can upgrade to a stronger bulb or if I will have to use the bathroom ceiling lights along with the mirror light, but just a word of caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, the light is not very bright.</li>
            <li>You can see deep into your pores and very clearly too.</li>
            <li>Both the regular and the magnifying sides are very clear mirror quality.  </li>
            <li>The other downside is how hot it can get</li>
            <li>Wish the mirror was a little bigger and the light a bit brighter but overall 5 stars..</li>
            <li>The light is dim &amp; yellow and the magnified side has a foggy film over it that makes it hard to see your reflection in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be returning it simply because my 50+ year old eyes need 1.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s off a faint warm glow.</li>
            <li>a little handheld round mirror couldn&#x27;t tweeze my eyebrows for the love of God..</li>
            <li>One side works as a regular mirror and the other side is a magnification mirror that really lets you see up close to your face for shaving or grooming.</li>
            <li>The light is not bright enough for me to rave about but not dark enough for me to return .</li>
            <li>light is not bright at all</li>
            <li>So hot, even, that touching it is painful.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is the light is not bright enough for me.</li>
            <li>The magnifying side also has a light and makes it easy to remove those annoying defects.</li>
            <li>The light is weak and has a yellow cast.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> For the price - it&#x27;s a nice mirror.</li>
            <li> Nice make up mirror.</li>
            <li> I think that the oval shape is quite nice because it fits the shape of your head.</li>
            <li> The color of the lamp is nice too, and it came well packaged.</li>
            <li> Kind of a &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34</li>
            <li> would have liked it to be a taller mirror</li>
            <li> but thats my own fault for not buying one</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t need all that and can&#x27;t spend that kind of money.</li>
            <li> The mirror does get a bit warm after a while</li>
            <li> It is a nice design and</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast &amp; arrived perfectly unharmed.</li>
            <li> The lighting is very bright and the magnification is just the right amount.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the exact kind of style that I wanted, and it works incredibly well.</li>
            <li> :) very pleased</li>
            <li> I needed a new mirror, this on fits my needs perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Light is nice and bright.</li>
            <li> The magnification is okay, the light is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just really the perfect size and looks so cute sitting on my vanity.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite things that I own.</li>
            <li> but I would have liked it to be a bit more brighter.</li>
            <li> Light is not as bright as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> The light is not that bright.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me.  </li>
            <li> The light is bright but not blinding.</li>
            <li> for the price it might be suitable for some..</li>
            <li> Good quality and very useful</li>
            <li> It works great and is just the right size</li>
            <li> The wall mirror was just too far away for checking to make sure that my application looked flawless from close up as well as from a distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the design and the magnification plus light, but now I&#x27;m shopping for a really good set of tweezers...Yikes.</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I expected but by all means the mirror is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great purchase if you are looking for a great makeup mirror</li>
            <li> The light is bright enough and the magnification side is perfect for eyebrow shaping!I would recommend this mirror to everyone.</li>
            <li> It was the perfect size and reflection, however I didn&#x27;t feel that the light source was bright enough.  </li>
            <li> Fine mirror!  </li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s huge!</li>
            <li> It is okay for a mirror.</li>
            <li> I bought this lighted makeup mirror to aid me in seeing better to apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li> so I have a desk lamp behind/beside it for more lighting</li>
            <li> She says it is the best one she has had, even compared to bigger and pricier models.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have the light on the mirror</li>
            <li> Love the thumb switch.</li>
            <li> This mirror helps in doing makeup, but would have been much better if it was brighter.  </li>
            <li> It is better than nothing...</li>
            <li> Very small,nit happy at all with it.</li>
            <li> She gets rid of hairs with it and thats ok with me</li>
            <li> Thank you Conair for making such a perfect mirror...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad bit smaller than what I was looking for, but it&#x27;s perfect for any vanity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too tall for my counter top.</li>
            <li> Love the oval shape.</li>
            <li> What I like most about this mirror is the oval shape.  </li>
            <li> Most faces are oval, meaning taller than wider and the shape of this mirror better fits my face.  </li>
            <li> : Okay here is an update.</li>

            <li> Love it on my vanity/make up table</li>
            <li> Most magnifying mirrors I have seen will make your face look distorted.  </li>
            <li> but the light still running after 1 year!</li>
            <li> great design (modern and minimalist) and</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve been better off going to target or walmart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to improve doing my makeup and tweezing my brows.  </li>

            <li> The light around the mirror is perfect because she can use it anywhere, even where the light might not be good enough to put on make up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great mirror  just not quite bright enough</li>
            <li> Florescent light is the best for applying makeup (besides natural daylight).</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tilt the mirror up more than 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li> One more word is required for the review.</li>
            <li> The light is really bright and the magnification is fantastic.</li>
            <li> well still works :)</li>
            <li> After seeing this item for sale at Target for $40, I checked Amazon and was pleased to see it for $29.53, so I promptly ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Great lighting, chic and smooth, and the highest magnification I&#x27;ve seen for such a great price.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that you CAN replace the bulbs.</li>
            <li> It took a while to find a good mirror with the right lighting.</li>
            <li> Great mirror, but the light burned out in the first month???  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright and perfect for my little vanity  I can see clearly on both sides to do my make up love it !!</li>
            <li> I have bougth anotherone from costco for 19.99 and its has a white great light, loved it, By mistake I gave it away...</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I&#x27;d like and seems to run hot.</li>
            <li> The magnification is pretty good though.</li>
            <li> This would be a good lighted makeup mirror if it was bright enough, it&#x27;s just okay.  </li>
            <li> Very good light, not heavy</li>
            <li> It looks super nice on vanity</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and the price was nice.</li>
            <li> it is so great, really helps light up your face and makes it easy to see anything youre doing, and i love the magnified side to do my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this until 2 days later the light stopped working.</li>
            <li> Might be fine if your room is better lighted.</li>
            <li> The mirror is ok, but slightly smaller than I wanted &amp; the light isn&#x27;t very bright.  </li>
            <li> i love my mirror with light, I was looking this for a while .</li>
            <li> Smaller mirror and the lightening is not as ideal.</li>
            <li> A nightlight would produce more light than this mirror.</li>
            <li> Lighting is still better then a bathroom light</li>
            <li> and I love it, about the light in my opinion</li>
            <li> Love the way it looks with the chrome finish and light weight.</li>
            <li> Made of cheap plastic that I&#x27;m sure would break if you accidentally dropped it.</li>
            <li> i just wish this light was illuminating my face better.</li>
            <li> Amazing I used right away</li>
            <li> Well lit, overall good makeup mirror!</li>
            <li> The light is bright and works very well for the &amp;#34;detail&amp;#34; work.</li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t too bright and illuminates the whole oval around the mirror, not just one spot.</li>
            <li> the height is good since I set it on a high desk.</li>
            <li> There is just a HUGE problem with it that I can&#x27;t ignore.</li>
            <li> Overall %100 happy with it.</li>
            <li> Wish the light was brighter.</li>
            <li> I was in the store and was looking at some mirrors with 7x magnification which were fantastic and that&#x27;s why I went home, went online, and found this Conair.</li>
            <li> The stand is light, cheap, plastic-y feeling.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this mirror has a light on the edges and reverses for a close up view.</li>
            <li> you see fit...</li>
            <li> Update 1/17/16 - This light switch cracked and the light no longer</li>
            <li> The lights are soft and not overly bright.</li>
            <li> I wish the light were brighter for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have it sitting on the bathroom counter, so I do have the added light from the bathroom lights.</li>
            <li> The light works well</li>
            <li> This is great, I just bought a second one to give to my Mum for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Great mirror, smaller than I imagined</li>
            <li> One day, however, I went to turn on the light to discover the switch</li>
            <li> Light quit working after 2 months.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has had two &amp;#34;mishaps&amp;#34; - one her fault, one not and it was such a great mirror</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t light up well</li>
            <li> and the light still works.</li>
            <li> The light stopped working a month after I received it</li>
            <li> The magnification is amazing, and it really helps him put in and take out his lenses.</li>
            <li> the light is a bonus, i use this every day.</li>
            <li> This is a great double sided mirror.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how the light switch was on the wire either</li>
            <li> but I was unimpressed with the power of the light on the mirror.  </li>
            <li> use it without the light</li>
            <li> just wish the light was brighter</li>
            <li> This is a well made mirror, the light works well</li>
            <li> Good mirror, I love the two mirror options (magnified and regular).</li>
            <li> Good size for adult faces/heads.  </li>
            <li> The oval shape lends character to it and the mirror is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> Good even light, and a magnified mirror on the back, for fine work.</li>
            <li> The light is just right!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t look into a more expensive one as I might get hooked and spend more cash out of pocket when this mirror for me does a perfect job.</li>
            <li> Item was not in original packaging when received.  </li>
            <li> Seems well made and the light is bright enough to fill in shadows caused by overhead light.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for everyday makeup application!  </li>
            <li> A week early!!!!! I was so excited and happy to get to use it sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li> Functional, clean design.  </li>
            <li> I think the light is bright enough.  </li>
            <li> Nope..not bright enough for me.</li>
            <li> it is bright enough!</li>
            <li> The item itself is in my opinion and the person i got it for looks amazing so clear .The</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine it would be good for applying makeup even, what with the yellow cast it gives off.</li>
            <li> This mirror is good enough</li>
            <li> This was a good mirror for a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and when it came I was pleasantly surprised that it was as nice as ones that I&#x27;ve seen in stores for triple the price.</li>
            <li> But if I&#x27;m right up to it and have another overhead light on in my bedroom, it works.</li>
            <li> so light can be helpful in seeing things more clearly.  </li>
            <li> After that, a bigger mirror with more amplification is better.</li>
            <li> Shame on you guys for putting such a flimsy switch on such a great product!</li>
            <li> my sensational gelpolish LED lamp item was in the same box wen I paid Separate shipping and handling # smh.</li>
            <li> Perfect for low lit areas and the magnification is enough to make putting on make-up easier</li>
            <li> The magnification is great, but the illumination is somewhat dim compared to her old model.  </li>
            <li> so I just ordered my second one and am hoping for the same great mirror :)</li>
            <li> but the light bulb gets very hot quickly so it radiates too much heat onto my face.  </li>
            <li> (Maybe even too much!!</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t going to move the mirror at all, then it&#x27;s fine, but if you want to adjust it, not so much.</li>
            <li> And my daughter certainly leaves this light on a lot.</li>
            <li> Recieved it 2 days later very fast shipping very satisfied customer</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s bright enough but still gentle</li>
            <li> The light on the mirror seems more for decoration, than for actual use.</li>
            <li> I like my old Conair one better and will probably give this one to someone else.</li>
            <li> ; product thats slightly useful.</li>
            <li> I like have the two sides to work with - the magnetic side is useful, but it&#x27;s also nice to have the standard mirror.  </li>
            <li> Sure wish it was a brighter white light this would have made it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> You def need more natural type lighting and this is just too unflattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am really glad I checked on Amazon, was going to some local stores, this was so much simpler!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experience the bulb problem, but I&#x27;ll probably change it (see the other review) for another brighter light since the light is more &amp;#34;fashionable&amp;#34; rather than practical.</li>
            <li> We were a little worried that it&#x27;d be too small, but it&#x27;s just great and is a great price.</li>
            <li> ,price was right</li>
            <li> Could use a slightly brighter light at full setting, but OK</li>
            <li> I really like the oval shape and don&#x27;t see that available as much.</li>
            <li> This one was exactly the same, but much more economical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my very first REAL makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> This mirror is ok, but its more oval making it not wide enough .</li>
            <li> My problem is that the thing does not tilt very much.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a great mirror so far.</li>
            <li> Not bad the lighting has lasted but its cheaper looking and way smaller in person, if you looking for a high quality or elegant one</li>
            <li> It is a pretty mirror but</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> Price is so much better than buying the same one in a store.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this to replace the exact one that didn&#x27;t survive the drop test from the vanity.</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough, magnification is great, and the lighting is plenty for day or night.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted, it has two magnifying mirrors</li>
            <li> I DO love the mirror though and did not want to send it back</li>
            <li> I actually put a much better switch on the mirror than the one it came with (if you look through my reviews you will see the switch I used).  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> Having never had one, I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it was dim or cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> It does get a bit hot to the touch after a while.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> love it , that simple</li>
            <li> Makes plucking my eyebrows a whole lot easier!</li>
            <li> It gets really hot.</li>
            <li> I love that it has the double sides.</li>
            <li> but this one is more than enough power.</li>
            <li> Shipped exactly as promised with no damage.</li>
            <li> ;-)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I actually like this one better</li>
            <li> and it does not get too hot.</li>
            <li> purchased for my daughter in law who said it was exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one at target.</li>
            <li> Most stores, including bed bath and beyond want over $100 for a similar mirror.</li>
            <li> Like it better than the last Conair makeup mirror I had as it was a touch on and sometimes came on during a power surge.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought a larger one with more magnification also</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described and was an affordable price, shipped on time and was functional when we received it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Mfgs love to make things you have to throw out when a simple thing like a bulb burns out.</li>
            <li> The light on this mirror is too dim.</li>
            <li> However, if I had to pick between my old mirror and this one, this one would win hands down.</li>
            <li> Now older and wearing makeup of her own this is a more modern take on the past</li>
            <li> The mirrow is as big as i thought it would be, its not heavy, and i can do my make up with so better!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve grown accustom to it and now just see it as a romantic soft glow kind of lighting.</li>
            <li> I love the look of the mirror, but the light is a little much.  </li>
            <li> The light is bright, but perhaps a little too yellow of a tinge for a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> After about 5 seconds on being on, the whole mirror gets extremely hot.</li>
            <li> Most mirrors like this that light up are a lot more expensive.</li>
            <li> Light on the mirror is not bright enough to illuminate the task being performed, it is a very good supplement to regular bathroom lighting ( this seems to be true of all illuminated mirrors regardless of size).</li>
            <li> This one is just as nice for half the price.</li>
            <li> the light seems strong yet my face still seems to be a little bit in darkness.</li>
            <li> Also, light is more soft and not a crisp white light.</li>
            <li> I kind of wish it was a little bit brighter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine size, but definitely not any sort of &amp;#34;vanity&amp;#34; lighting or magnification any different than turning on the light in your bathroom and standing at the sink and using that mirror.</li>
            <li> It has enough light and it does not take much space on the table.  </li>
            <li> too much~</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> When you order a mirror that has a light, you assume, it will be bright enough to at least produce some sort of illumination. .</li>
            <li> I certainly expected more out of this product....</li>
            <li> I asked once to use it and she was very hesitant but she allowed me to use it.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> My daughter also loves it, so much that she ask me to get her one.</li>
            <li> I do like this mirror for the magnify/light -- works well for that specific task based activity requiring light and close up views.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror!</li>
            <li> Also, The light is yellow.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Putting makeup on has been so much easier since getting this mirror.</li>
            <li> Thank you I really like it</li>
            <li> and it not be ready.</li>
            <li> I see my whole face.</li>
            <li> my whole face not just one side.</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesnt fog up much when i take a shower, so i can use it after my shower.</li>
            <li> This mirror doesn&#x27;t provide enough light for my room.</li>
            <li> but too much that the reflection is distorted.</li>
            <li> I really like the finish and design.</li>
            <li> so much for being pithy.</li>
            <li> The light could be a bit brighter, but I just readjust the mirror to get the necessary brightness needed.</li>
            <li> I have never had a vanity mirror before and really wanted one to help with putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed mirror and stand.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used it that much, either.</li>
            <li> This is all I expected and more</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to keep this mirror.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> works as expected and makes it so much easier when plucking my brows :)</li>
            <li> The lighting is pretty good, not extremely bright</li>
            <li> It does get dirty easily, but it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It has one side that gets real up, close, and personal on areas of your face that may need more defining when applying makeup or even when in need of plucking out those extra hairs.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what he expected, but is able to use it just fine.  </li>
            <li> A large round mirror would be better suited for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> The mirror is decent size and the magification is on point.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product for the price</li>
            <li> Be sure to check measurements as you may want the actual mirror to be bigger.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the soft light from my lamp seemed to actually outshine this mirror.</li>
            <li> only thing is i would like the switch to be on the stand to be more convenient, not sure how important that is though...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this mirror to everyone.</li>
            <li> Conair used to be high quality and now their stuff is junk.  </li>
            <li> Priced well and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> However, the price is reasonable and the image is clear and not distorted.</li>
            <li> The lighting is soft &amp; gentle.</li>
            <li> so I can see my face up close or normal and</li>
            <li> Wish this had more mirror space, it is narrow.</li>
            <li> Only 1 con, it gets really hot, really fast.</li>
            <li> other times it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I will continue to look for a new mirror.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with my new mirror.</li>
            <li> The light around the edge illuminates my face so that I can actually see in the regular side of the mirror.</li>
            <li> Very clear.</li>
            <li> She says \\&quot;the mirror lights up my life\\&quot; and allows her to find all her imperfections that she then talks to me about ad nauseam, very early in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its too small Conair have a bigger size of the same model which is much more comfortable for make-up</li>
            <li> Back to my old Clairol light up mirror until I find its equal.</li>
            <li> Works as intended, but I wish the lights were a bit brighter and did not make the outside of the mirror scorching hot.</li>
            <li> Same exact one.</li>
            <li> The light is very dim and not adequate for applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> The guy spends like an hour in front of it everyday, and he is now able to clean every little pore on his face since it has a magnifying side and lights up.</li>
            <li> The other side gives you a full face view of how you look so far.</li>
            <li> Just be careful of the edges when it&#x27;s been in use for a while, it tends to get quite hot!</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this mirror five stars has to do with the fact that the light is not very bright and I have to get right in front of it to see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> Returned this item; it was so cheaply made and the light was totally useless</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my fourteen year old niece</li>
            <li> Have not had the mirror long enough to test the electric light, but I generally use natural daylight at a window when I work on my face.</li>
            <li> I use this mirror daily for getting ready for work in the morning.  </li>
            <li> But it does emmit heat and is dim.</li>
            <li> For a makeup mirror (my intended use) I would recommend a much rounder, wider, larger mirror.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is not touch sensitive.</li>
            <li> the only thing with the Marrow is it gets overheated too fast.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t touch it much when I&#x27;m doing my makeup so again, not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my wife for Christmas after her old make up mirror gave up the ghost.  </li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter uses this every day.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s size causes my wife to have to move around to see what her old mirror showed.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and can&#x27;t see up close as well</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, but both my daughter and wife love the mirror and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I am able to see pores and small stray facial hairs with ease.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re short on space or $, it&#x27;s a decent mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> It also takes a long time of using it before it starts to get really</li>
            <li> The light radiates heat, which I didn&#x27;t care for, and the oval shape is rather small.</li>
            <li> And heat build up in a mirror is never a good thing. :)</li>
            <li> If you are looking to do something like pull small hairs, this may not be the mirror for you as you will need stronger light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can upgrade to a stronger bulb or if I will have to use the bathroom ceiling lights along with the mirror light, but just a word of caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the light is not very bright.</li>
            <li> You can see deep into your pores and very clearly too.</li>
            <li> Both the regular and the magnifying sides are very clear mirror quality.  </li>
            <li> The other downside is how hot it can get</li>
            <li> Wish the mirror was a little bigger and the light a bit brighter but overall 5 stars..</li>
            <li> The light is dim &amp; yellow and the magnified side has a foggy film over it that makes it hard to see your reflection in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be returning it simply because my 50+ year old eyes need 1.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s off a faint warm glow.</li>
            <li> a little handheld round mirror couldn&#x27;t tweeze my eyebrows for the love of God..</li>
            <li> One side works as a regular mirror and the other side is a magnification mirror that really lets you see up close to your face for shaving or grooming.</li>
            <li> The light is not bright enough for me to rave about but not dark enough for me to return .</li>
            <li> light is not bright at all</li>
            <li> So hot, even, that touching it is painful.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is the light is not bright enough for me.</li>
            <li> The magnifying side also has a light and makes it easy to remove those annoying defects.</li>
            <li> The light is weak and has a yellow cast.</li>
            <li> Plenty large enough for all tasks but small enough so as not to take up the entire bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> And it was not that I was expecting it to incredibly powerful, given the price is not to expensive and proper lighting on these mirrors at a decent price seems to be nonexsistant.</li>
            <li> Its small enough to not take up too much room, but big enough to see your face.  </li>
            <li> The mirror was a little small and the light was too orange/yellow for her taste.</li>
            <li> That being said, it is dim, even with other lights on in the room.</li>
            <li> design however looks really bulky in person, unlike the picture where it looks small and sleek.</li>
            <li> Feels solid and has a long wire to connect.</li>
            <li> I would like it to be a little wider, and the light is not bright enough.</li>
            <li> There are other more expensive brands and types out there</li>
            <li> A lot of other makeup mirrors I was looking at (PB Teen etc) don&#x27;t have a cord which means you&#x27;d go through a lot of batteries when it gets left on.  </li>
            <li> This mirror light works well for limited use -- it is very narrow so hard to see entire face.  </li>
            <li> After chemo, my vision really took a hard hit.  </li>
            <li> Works well, smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected...</li>
            <li> I dont know how I went so long without it</li>
            <li> Very small mirror; light is not very bright.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it every single day to put on her make up &amp; to put on her eye lashes</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t miss a single thing on your face when using it.</li>
            <li> only and only bad thing we both agreed was the light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 5&#x27; 2&amp;#34; and I have to bend way down to see myself in it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would add to this mirror is a finish that repels steam which was a feature of the mirror I previously used.</li>
            <li> Not bright enough if using in a dim room</li>
            <li> a giant black hair growing out of chin.</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> I spent quite a bit of time trying to decide which mirror to buy to replace one I had had for years.  </li>
            <li> it appears to be just as I expected.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> Love it and hate it at the same time.</li>
            <li> However a decent replacement for the broken one and it gets used every day</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the light seemed to blind my vision and basically when I looked into the mirror, it was more difficult to see my reflection that using an unlighted magnifying mirror.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror because the description said it was brighter than other models.</li>
            <li> other than that it does its job</li>
            <li> I had been using a regular mirror with a small lamp.  </li>
            <li> this mirror does what I needed it to do for a fraction of the price of other lighted mirrors.</li>
            <li> This mirror is rather small, maybe 5-6&amp;#34; in height, but ultimately works.  </li>
            <li> the bulbs burned out EXTREMELY fast on this product, which i was disappointed in because that&#x27;s one of the main reasons you buy a makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> The only small drawback is that I would like for the mirror to be a little wider.</li>
            <li> (this is why I usually wait a LONG while to review products)</li>
            <li> I use the lighted mirror for makeup in a corner of the bedroom that is beside a window, but is still a fairly dark area.</li>
            <li> All the poor reviews, it&#x27;s too dim and</li>
            <li> get partial image, with the round 8.5</li>
            <li> The close up really helps with eyebrows and false lashes!</li>
            <li> He broke down one day and took a blackhead tool to his face.</li>
            <li> If you have it on a dresser or counter, and can sit down to look in it, that would work.</li>
            <li> The mirror is heavy and hard to swivel from magnifying to regular and the magnifying is just too,</li>
            <li> guess I was spoiled from my previous one.</li>
            <li> so I typically use it without lights.</li>
            <li> I owned this mirror for less than 2 years and the lights went out.</li>
            <li> However, I failed to notice there were 4 different options for the finish on the item, and each has a different price.  </li>
            <li> However, I was incredibly disappointed with the light.</li>
            <li> It seam to be a little under  lite.</li>
            <li> The lighting  in my opinion is a little on the dimmer side</li>
            <li> but mine had a turning switch (the little wheel you have to turn).</li>
            <li> When she was little she always sat in front of grandmas mirror playing makeup.  </li>
            <li> Not real thrilled with it, but it will have to do.</li>
            <li> The mirror appeared to be well made although width was a bit narrow.</li>
            <li> am using this everyday to apply make-up.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product everyday and loves it.</li>
            <li> you realize what you&#x27;ve been missing.  </li>
            <li> I suggest getting a round mirror.  </li>
            <li> Probably worse actually.</li>
            <li> Stop working after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> i even dropped it a few times on accident...</li>
            <li> I would also prefer if this model was a round mirror instead of oval.  </li>
            <li> I looked for a brighter bulb that would fit the small base but couldn&#x27;t find one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the small side</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a terrible situation, but it is a bit inconvenient as I have to lean over my counter top quite far due to the size of the cord in relation to the outlet.</li>
            <li> The lights heated up to an uncomfortable temp within just a few minutes and the mirror was much smaller than I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a hard time looking in the mirror in order to notice the little imperfections that come with age.</li>
            <li> I dislike the small &amp;#34;oval&amp;#34; shape and I dislike the lighting when I have to be so close to a small mirror.</li>
            <li> The magnification side is too small.</li>
            <li> It is quite small</li>
            <li> The lights are not very bright at all.  </li>
            <li> Husband is hard to please.</li>
            <li> Total disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am 49 and this has been a life saver because of my wonky eyesight now.</li>
            <li> (Late review).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with the beginning of cataracts and my sight is slowly deteriorating.</li>
            <li> I had been missing, yikes!!</li>
            <li> I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this product!</li>
            <li> Conair&#x27;s customer service was not good.  </li>
            <li> as I said big mistake  because I tried to replaced it for this bad ligthted, small and expensier one !!</li>
            <li> I bought another one (wall mount) with a smaller 5X magnification and was disappointed because I could not see well with this one.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife to replace her makeup mirror from Costco that had broken.  </li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s poor quality.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with the mirror.  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be to have the switch on the base versus the cord.</li>
            <li> I was looking over the other reviews and saw a lot of bad one</li>
            <li> but very disappointed that the bulb failed so fast.</li>
            <li> Makes it difficult to see your reflection and to use to apply makeup, which is what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> I use it for pulling hairs and sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to see the hair,</li>
            <li> The switch on this mirror has already broken!</li>
            <li> Mirror magification is useless with almost no difference between the two sides.</li>
            <li> this makes it uncomfortable after a while.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I put my mirror on the floor and stepped on my switch</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t blind her when she&#x27;s applying her make up.  </li>
            <li> But this was just plain awful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and for the price and shipping it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I was so shocked, so I started looking on amazon.</li>
            <li> Have used it everyday since I got it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing~</li>
            <li> I always hated pushing something</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this mirror!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is okay for a mirror. The light isn&#x27;t that great but it does the job. Mirror gets very warm after about 15-20 minutes of use so watch out.</li>
            <li> I dislike the small &amp;#34;oval&amp;#34; shape and I dislike the lighting when I have to be so close to a small mirror. A large round mirror would be better suited for applying makeup. It is a pretty mirror but over priced for its function.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing~ The light is very dim and not adequate for applying makeup.  The mirror is heavy and hard to swivel from magnifying to regular and the magnifying is just too, too much~ It is not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Functional, clean design.  Good value for money.</li>
            <li> I bought this lighted makeup mirror to aid me in seeing better to apply my makeup.  I have Macular Degeneration so light can be helpful in seeing things more clearly.  Unfortunately, the light seemed to blind my vision and basically when I looked into the mirror, it was more difficult to see my reflection that using an unlighted magnifying mirror.  The mirror appeared to be well made although width was a bit narrow.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as sturdy as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i wanted. I shopped locally and these were in the $90 range. This one was exactly the same, but much more economical.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite things that I own. After setting up a sit-down vanity we bought from Ikea and hanging a mirror on the wall in front of it, I realized that I wanted to have the option to see my face up-close while doing my makeup, too. The wall mirror was just too far away for checking to make sure that my application looked flawless from close up as well as from a distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the exact kind of style that I wanted, and it works incredibly well. It does get dirty easily, but it&#x27;s very easy to clean. It also takes a long time of using it before it starts to get really hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just really the perfect size and looks so cute sitting on my vanity. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this product! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, great light and workability. Just as seen on adv. Feels solid and has a long wire to connect.</li>
            <li> mirror is good and good magnification so I can see to put on makeup.  Price is so much better than buying the same one in a store.</li>
            <li> Good mirror, I love the two mirror options (magnified and regular). The lighting is pretty good, not extremely bright but it does the trick. I&#x27;ve had this mirror for over a year now and it has been great.</li>
            <li> am using this everyday to apply make-up. light is not bright at all so I have a desk lamp behind/beside it for more lighting</li>
            <li> My wife bought this to replace the exact one that didn&#x27;t survive the drop test from the vanity.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great.  The cord is long enough, magnification is great, and the lighting is plenty for day or night.</li>
            <li> My wife used it twice and the lite bulb burned out already. I am in the process of trying to return it. Looks nice. Convenient for the bathroom based on it&#x27;s size but very disappointed that the bulb failed so fast.</li>
            <li> A VERY NICE MIRROR WITH GREAT FEATURES!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife...loved it. She says it is the best one she has had, even compared to bigger and pricier models. Lighting is perfect at any angle.  Would recommend to everyone looking for a mirror..this is the model to go with. Recieved it 2 days later very fast shipping very satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I got the product on time as promised and also it works great.  It has enough light and it does not take much space on the table.  Overall %100 happy with it.</li>
            <li> Well lit, overall good makeup mirror!</li>
            <li> I really like this mirror. I want to give it five stars. It&#x27;s perfect in so many ways. There is just a HUGE problem with it that I can&#x27;t ignore. After about 5 seconds on being on, the whole mirror gets extremely hot. So hot, even, that touching it is painful. If you aren&#x27;t going to move the mirror at all, then it&#x27;s fine, but if you want to adjust it, not so much.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Really like it.</li>
            <li> This mirror gives off great lighting. You can adjust it how you like.</li>
            <li> works as expected and makes it so much easier when plucking my brows :)</li>
            <li> Wish the light was brighter.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great mirror. I bought it as a gift for my fourteen year old niece and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with the beginning of cataracts and my sight is slowly deteriorating. I had a hard time looking in the mirror in order to notice the little imperfections that come with age. I stayed at a hotel which had this mirror and I loved it. The light around the edge illuminates my face so that I can actually see in the regular side of the mirror. The magnifying side also has a light and makes it easy to remove those annoying defects. The only thing I would add to this mirror is a finish that repels steam which was a feature of the mirror I previously used. However, if I had to pick between my old mirror and this one, this one would win hands down.</li>
            <li> i love my mirror with light, I was looking this for a while .</li>
            <li> It seam to be a little under  lite.</li>
            <li> Nice Mirror.  Light is nice and bright.</li>
            <li> Not the best, not the worst. The light radiates heat, which I didn&#x27;t care for, and the oval shape is rather small. I&#x27;d recommend this mirror for someone who is not in need of getting a close up of every flaw. Like someone under 30. After that, a bigger mirror with more amplification is better. And heat build up in a mirror is never a good thing. :)</li>
            <li> Returned this item; it was so cheaply made and the light was totally useless so rather than keep something I&#x27;d never use, I returned it.  I LOVE that Amazon is so great about returns because it would have been a costly mistake, otherwise.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife to replace her makeup mirror from Costco that had broken.  The mirror was a little small and the light was too orange/yellow for her taste.</li>
            <li> I was in the store and was looking at some mirrors with 7x magnification which were fantastic and that&#x27;s why I went home, went online, and found this Conair. Conair says this mirror has 7x magnification but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good as the ones in the store. It&#x27;s nice to have the light on the mirror but I would recommend going to a store and buying one there that you like.</li>
            <li> Looks great. Love the thumb switch. The cord is even a great length as well. The only reason I did not give this mirror five stars has to do with the fact that the light is not very bright and I have to get right in front of it to see what I&#x27;m doing. This isn&#x27;t a terrible situation, but it is a bit inconvenient as I have to lean over my counter top quite far due to the size of the cord in relation to the outlet.</li>
            <li> Not bright enough if using in a dim room</li>
            <li> Smaller mirror and the lightening is not as ideal.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror as a gift and when it came in, I had to check it out. The stand is light, cheap, plastic-y feeling. The mirror is decent size and the magification is on point. However, I was incredibly disappointed with the light. When you order a mirror that has a light, you assume, it will be bright enough to at least produce some sort of illumination. . it was not. A nightlight would produce more light than this mirror. The light on the mirror seems more for decoration, than for actual use. And it was not that I was expecting it to incredibly powerful, given the price is not to expensive and proper lighting on these mirrors at a decent price seems to be nonexsistant. But this was just plain awful. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> Love it and hate it at the same time. LOL! I love the design and the magnification plus light, but now I&#x27;m shopping for a really good set of tweezers...Yikes.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this mirror has a light on the edges and reverses for a close up view. It is attractive on my dressing room table.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted, it has two magnifying mirrors so I can see my face up close or normal and it was a good price</li>
            <li> This mirror helps in doing makeup, but would have been much better if it was brighter.  It is better than nothing...</li>
            <li> Works well, smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I love the look of the mirror, but the light is a little much.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to illuminate my face, but rather obliterate it!  I like my old Conair one better and will probably give this one to someone else.</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I expected but by all means the mirror is wonderful. You can see deep into your pores and very clearly too. My wife loves it and uses it every day. Lighting is still better then a bathroom light but I would have liked it to be a bit more brighter.</li>
            <li> I certainly expected more out of this product....guess I was spoiled from my previous one. Very small,nit happy at all with it.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for the price. I gave it 4 stars because I wish it was a tad brighter. Otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li> She gets rid of hairs with it and thats ok with me</li>
            <li> The mirror is ok, but slightly smaller than I wanted &amp; the light isn&#x27;t very bright.  I do like the magnifier side.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my daughter for Christmas.. She loves it. It&#x27;s the perfect size and the lighting on it is amazing. My daughter uses it every single day to put on her make up &amp; to put on her eye lashes and she has no complaints about it. She told me that this mirror is the best mirror that she has ever used. It has 2 sides to it and the lighting is so very nice and perfect for putting on make up. She doesn&#x27;t like to let this mirror out of her sight and like to keep it at arms length. I asked once to use it and she was very hesitant but she allowed me to use it. I definitely recommend this mirror to anyone who is looking for a mirror to out on make up, do your hair or whatever else you see fit... Thank you Conair for making such a perfect mirror...</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my teenage daughter to use for applying make-up. She loves it. The light is bright and works very well for the &amp;#34;detail&amp;#34; work. Nice size mirror, too!</li>
            <li> Wish this had more mirror space, it is narrow. Also, light is more soft and not a crisp white light. Makes it difficult to see your reflection and to use to apply makeup, which is what I wanted it for. Not real thrilled with it, but it will have to do.</li>
            <li> This mirror does the job and for a great price! I have no complaints and would recommend this purchase to anyone!</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected...overall it gets the job done...the lights are really bright so I typically use it without lights. It&#x27;s a decent product for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad bit smaller than what I was looking for, but it&#x27;s perfect for any vanity. It looks super nice on vanity and I&#x27;m glad I got it!</li>
            <li> The light isn&#x27;t very bright, but what can you do.</li>
            <li> Update 1/17/16 - This light switch cracked and the light no longer works.&lt;br /&gt;-------&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice mirror. It&#x27;s not too tall for my counter top. The mirror swivels so you can look at 1x magnification and 7x magnification. The lights are soft and not overly bright. If you are looking to do something like pull small hairs, this may not be the mirror for you as you will need stronger light. I use it for pulling hairs and sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to see the hair, other times it&#x27;s fine. For the price - it&#x27;s a nice mirror. I wish the light were brighter for my needs.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Works well in my simple makeup area. Love the oval shape.</li>
            <li> I would like it to be a little wider, and the light is not bright enough. However, the price is reasonable and the image is clear and not distorted.</li>
            <li> What I like most about this mirror is the oval shape.  Most faces are oval, meaning taller than wider and the shape of this mirror better fits my face.  Both the regular and the magnifying sides are very clear mirror quality.  The price was reasonable.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  Have not had the mirror long enough to test the electric light, but I generally use natural daylight at a window when I work on my face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mirror! It is PERFECT for applying makeup doing my hair! The light is just right! Great! I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Okay here is an update. I must remove a star (this is why I usually wait a LONG while to review products) The switch on this mirror has already broken! I DO love the mirror though and did not want to send it back so I just changed the switch on it. I actually put a much better switch on the mirror than the one it came with (if you look through my reviews you will see the switch I used).  I DO like the mirror though. It is perfect for putting on my make-up. Shame on you guys for putting such a flimsy switch on such a great product!</li>
            <li> Mirror works great. The light isn&#x27;t too bright and illuminates the whole oval around the mirror, not just one spot. The mirror works well on both sides. One side works as a regular mirror and the other side is a magnification mirror that really lets you see up close to your face for shaving or grooming.</li>
            <li> Yes! Just what I wanted and for the price!  Amazing I used right away and I love it, about the light in my opinion it&#x27;s great in others idk but I think it was a good choice (:</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loved it. The oval shape lends character to it and the mirror is very powerful.  You won&#x27;t miss a single thing on your face when using it.</li>
            <li> I have bougth anotherone from costco for 19.99 and its has a white great light, loved it, By mistake I gave it away... as I said big mistake  because I tried to replaced it for this bad ligthted, small and expensier one !!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. It&#x27;s my very first REAL makeup mirror. Perfect zoom resolution and it&#x27;s very nice. Only 1 con, it gets really hot, really fast. So DO NOT leave this mirror unattended.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. It&#x27;s great to use for applying make-up, and for plucking. My daughter also loves it, so much that she ask me to get her one.</li>
            <li> I use this mirror daily for getting ready for work in the morning.  Love it.  I was replaced a lighted mirror that had 3 panel but this works just as well.  Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Love the way it looks with the chrome finish and light weight. But it does emmit heat and is dim. I haven&#x27;t experience the bulb problem, but I&#x27;ll probably change it (see the other review) for another brighter light since the light is more &amp;#34;fashionable&amp;#34; rather than practical. Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. It sits on my vanity, calling my name every morning. I love the magnified side as you can see EVERYTHING. I can pluck my eyebrows, even those pesky blonde hairs on my chin. My husband refused to look into it, as he didn&#x27;t want to see his pores. He broke down one day and took a blackhead tool to his face.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product everyday and loves it. Great gift idea.</li>
            <li> This mirror light works well for limited use -- it is very narrow so hard to see entire face.  For a makeup mirror (my intended use) I would recommend a much rounder, wider, larger mirror.  I do like this mirror for the magnify/light -- works well for that specific task based activity requiring light and close up views.</li>
            <li> i couldnt find this is any store. it is so great, really helps light up your face and makes it easy to see anything youre doing, and i love the magnified side to do my eyebrows</li>
            <li> My husband and I stayed at a hotel where this mirror was provided. I was amazed with the illumination as well as the magnification. The best mirror I have purchased. I am able to see pores and small stray facial hairs with ease. It is a big help in applying my eyeliner neatly. I bought replacement bulbs so I should be set for years. I highly recommend this mirror!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned one of these.  Purchased for my daughter for Xmas.  She recently moved out and took the mirror with her.  I&#x27;ve always used a little handheld round mirror couldn&#x27;t tweeze my eyebrows for the love of God.. All the poor reviews, it&#x27;s too dim and blah blah.. well if you never owned one and used this you realize what you&#x27;ve been missing.  Having never had one, I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it was dim or cheaply made.  Loved it, so just ordered one for myself.  I won&#x27;t look into a more expensive one as I might get hooked and spend more cash out of pocket when this mirror for me does a perfect job.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, arrived safe and on time. Simply isn&#x27;t as bright as I need, so I&#x27;ll have to return it. Let&#x27;s off a faint warm glow.</li>
            <li> The 7x magnification and the lighting are perfect for tweezing, make-up application and the like.  I am really enjoying using this mirror for accuracy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror because I thought it is cordless (just checking the picture), but it actually has a cord (which is written in the description, but who&#x27;s reading it). Anyways, that is my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design however looks really bulky in person, unlike the picture where it looks small and sleek.</li>
            <li> Nice make up mirror. It does get a bit hot to the touch after a while. I would still recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I have been needing a mirror like this for quit some time.  Once I received a giftcard for my birthday, I decided that now is the time to buy.  I debated on the size and color for a lot longer than I needed to, but ultimately settled on this one.  I am so happy I did. This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> So beautiful highly recommend . Just plug it in and your set!</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror for the price. I like that it has a cord to plug it into the wall. Most mirrors like this that light up are a lot more expensive. This one is a great price, but it&#x27;s not made cheaply though. The lighting is very bright and the magnification is just the right amount. I think that the oval shape is quite nice because it fits the shape of your head. Overall this is a great purchase if you are looking for a great makeup mirror</li>
            <li> Good size and quality</li>
            <li> Great product, bought for daughter for Christmas, she loves</li>
            <li> love it , that simple</li>
            <li> I needed a new mirror, this on fits my needs perfectly.  I am really glad I checked on Amazon, was going to some local stores, this was so much simpler!!!</li>
            <li> Love this mirror. Have used it everyday since I got it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this mirror. I think the light is bright enough.  Makes plucking my eyebrows a whole lot easier!</li>
            <li> This mirror has some great lighting and a good magnifying side.  I purchased this mirror, so that I could see better to put on my make-up and not have to wear my reading glasses.  It meets my need and works well. I have it sitting on the bathroom counter, so I do have the added light from the bathroom lights.</li>
            <li> Its small enough to not take up too much room, but big enough to see your face.  Magnification is perfect as well as the lighting!</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s poor quality. It gets really hot. I would have to preferred to go find one at bed bath and beyond.  Also, The light is yellow.</li>
            <li> Mirror was as described, for the 7x you can&#x27;t beat the price! Light is efficient! I can do my make-up in the morning now without turning lights on and waking my husband up in our bedroom! Good purchase!</li>
            <li> I kind of wish it was a little bit brighter but the size is perfect. I also like the finish and the height is good since I set it on a high desk.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed. I suggest getting a round mirror.  The magnification side is too small.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this mirror. I do not mind the switch is on the cord. The light works well and it is a good magnification for applying make up  or brow tweezing.</li>
            <li> Great quality. I would recamend this product</li>
            <li> I got this mirror because the one I had broke.  This one is better that the one I had. I like that it is not touch sensitive. I would buy this again and may have to for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my my husband and he loves it. The guy spends like an hour in front of it everyday, and he is now able to clean every little pore on his face since it has a magnifying side and lights up.</li>
            <li> Total disappointment. Made of cheap plastic that I&#x27;m sure would break if you accidentally dropped it. Mirror magification is useless with almost no difference between the two sides. The light is weak and has a yellow cast. It&#x27;s a fine size, but definitely not any sort of &amp;#34;vanity&amp;#34; lighting or magnification any different than turning on the light in your bathroom and standing at the sink and using that mirror. Probably worse actually. I can&#x27;t imagine it would be good for applying makeup even, what with the yellow cast it gives off. Save yourself some hassle, go with a more expensive model that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Stop working after a few months.  Conair&#x27;s customer service was not good.  I had to pay for return and send a check for the replacement shipment.  That was only after several phone calls.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. Putting makeup on has been so much easier since getting this mirror. I love that it has the double sides. The close up really helps with eyebrows and false lashes!</li>
            <li> I love this item. It took a while to find a good mirror with the right lighting. Love it on my vanity/make up table</li>
            <li> Husband is hard to please. Not exactly what he expected, but is able to use it just fine.  Did not want to return.</li>
            <li> This is not a bulky mirror.  Most magnifying mirrors I have seen will make your face look distorted.  This one is the perfect magnification!  I bought another one (wall mount) with a smaller 5X magnification and was disappointed because I could not see well with this one.</li>
            <li> Thank you I really like it</li>
            <li> Great mirror girlfriend loved it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mirror ever since I purchased it! It has one side that gets real up, close, and personal on areas of your face that may need more defining when applying makeup or even when in need of plucking out those extra hairs. The other side gives you a full face view of how you look so far. The lighting  in my opinion is a little on the dimmer side but I&#x27;ve grown accustom to it and now just see it as a romantic soft glow kind of lighting.</li>
            <li> I just kept saying to my husband, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s so good to see my eyelashes again&amp;#34;. I am 49 and this has been a life saver because of my wonky eyesight now. There are other more expensive brands and types out there but this one is more than enough power. I returned the $100 one my husband bought me and kept this one.</li>
            <li> but the light bulb gets very hot quickly so it radiates too much heat onto my face.  this makes it uncomfortable after a while.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror! The light is bright enough and the magnification side is perfect for eyebrow shaping!I would recommend this mirror to everyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror because the description said it was brighter than other models. Nope..not bright enough for me. Back to my old Clairol light up mirror until I find its equal. Had to return it.</li>
            <li> I should have bought it sooner as I can&#x27;t see to put on mascara without my glasses!  Works perfect for this.  Be sure to check measurements as you may want the actual mirror to be bigger.</li>
            <li> Light is not as bright as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I&#x27;d like and seems to run hot. But a very nice mirror anyways.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a friend that has difficulty when she is doing personal grooming. :) very pleased</li>
            <li> Fine mirror!  Just what we needed!  Shipped exactly as promised with no damage.</li>
            <li> This is great, I just bought a second one to give to my Mum for Christmas!</li>
            <li> This lamp is plug in, which I like. The color of the lamp is nice too, and it came well packaged. I was worried about the mirror dureing shipping but it got to me in one piece.</li>
            <li> the bulbs burned out EXTREMELY fast on this product, which i was disappointed in because that&#x27;s one of the main reasons you buy a makeup mirror. bummed, but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> Great mirror, smaller than I imagined but the light still running after 1 year! (Late review). ;-)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to not leave in the bathroom, a friend purchased the same but hers stopped working, I believe because of the humidity.</li>
            <li> I spent quite a bit of time trying to decide which mirror to buy to replace one I had had for years.  I actually like this one better</li>
            <li> great design (modern and minimalist) and the mirror is compact. i just wish this light was illuminating my face better. the light seems strong yet my face still seems to be a little bit in darkness. This mirror is good enough so I kept it.</li>
            <li> This was a good mirror for a short period of time. It is quite small but I managed to work with that. One day, however, I went to turn on the light to discover the switch had broke and the mirror is now unusable for me. I&#x27;m quite upset. Went to contact the seller for return to discover they have a very short return policy. Would&#x27;ve been better off going to target or walmart. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!!</li>
            <li> delivery was on time but when I open the box it had this double sided marrow n my sensational gelpolish LED lamp item was in the same box wen I paid Separate shipping and handling # smh. the only thing with the Marrow is it gets overheated too fast. other than that it does its job</li>
            <li> It met my expectation</li>
            <li> I love this mirror!  It was a perfect addition to my vanity.  Perfect lighting and it does not get too hot.</li>
            <li> perfect for makeup applications, persons with sight issues, etc.</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  I&#x27;ve been able to improve doing my makeup and tweezing my brows.  Highly recommend this mirror to everyone.</li>
            <li> No, I&#x27;m not talking about a person. I&#x27;m reviewing this lighted mirror. I really like the oval shape and don&#x27;t see that available as much. And I got it in chrome so it&#x27;s shiny and lovely. The light is not that bright. But if I&#x27;m right up to it and have another overhead light on in my bedroom, it works. I love the way it looks. It also feels solid and weighty. Just wished it was brighter.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking and appreciate the magnification more every year! The only small drawback is that I would like for the mirror to be a little wider.</li>
            <li> You can see EVERYTHING. My makeup looks flawless. I love it. Every woman needs a lighted mirror and this price is excellent.</li>
            <li> Best Mirror ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not bad the lighting has lasted but its cheaper looking and way smaller in person, if you looking for a high quality or elegant one this is not it. The magnification is pretty good though. Perfect to take out those pesky little hairs in chin and perfect to make eyeshadow on both eyes even. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Light quit working after 2 months.  Waste of money</li>
            <li> My daughter boards at prep school and loves this lighted mirror. It works great and is just the right size</li>
            <li> Good size for adult faces/heads.  The light is bright, but perhaps a little too yellow of a tinge for a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> purchased for my daughter in law who said it was exactly what she was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is the THIRD one I have purchased! My daughter has had two &amp;#34;mishaps&amp;#34; - one her fault, one not and it was such a great mirror, I bought it a THIRD time so that should tell you how awesome it is!!</li>
            <li> Conair used to be high quality and now their stuff is junk.  The lights are not very bright at all.  I owned this mirror for less than 2 years and the lights went out.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an illuminated mirror for awhile. I went to bed bath and beyond, and they were like 80.00-200.00 !!! I was so shocked, so I started looking on amazon. I read all the reviews and looked and decided on this one. It works so well !!! The magnified side is awesome it lets me see which pimples or get and which to not. I always hated pushing something and it not be ready. Great price!!!!  If your looking for a great mirror and price get this one !!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t light up well</li>
            <li> My preference is the 8.5inch diameter not the oval....with the oval&lt;br /&gt;I get partial image, with the round 8.5 I see my whole face. I spend&lt;br /&gt;a lot of time putting my makeup on in the morning, I want to&lt;br /&gt;see my whole face not just one side. For the price its a great&lt;br /&gt;mirror in that it illuminates well...great for a teenager, cabin,&lt;br /&gt;share room, or RV.</li>
            <li> Works as intended, but I wish the lights were a bit brighter and did not make the outside of the mirror scorching hot.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one at target. Same exact one. I believe it was on sale for $20 or $25. I loved it. It&#x27;s a little on the small side but I can deal with it. If I found the same one in a bigger size I would definitely purchase it. The other downside is how hot it can get but I don&#x27;t touch it much when I&#x27;m doing my makeup so again, not a big deal. My friend had the same one but hers had a simple on/off switch on the upper part of the cord but mine had a turning switch (the little wheel you have to turn). Unfortunately I put my mirror on the floor and stepped on my switch so I had to attempt to tape it together but it didnt work too well so I just ordered my second one and am hoping for the same great mirror :)</li>
            <li> Love it. Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Item was not in original packaging when received.  Was simply in Amazon shipping box surrounded by bubble wrap.  No Conair box or literature.  Gave me the impression that it was already returned.  I plugged the morror in and it did not work.  I immediately returned the item for a refund.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my wife for Christmas after her old make up mirror gave up the ghost.  She loves it.  It is well balanced and has good lighting. Bottom line, if my wife is happy with it, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Magnification is good.  Oval shap shows almost your entire face.  Only drawback is the light is not bright enough for me.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with this mirror. I love it! It seems to be well made and looks great on my vanity table.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror, the light works well i have had this mirror for almost a year now and the light still works. I also like that it doesnt fog up much when i take a shower, so i can use it after my shower.</li>
            <li> For the price you cannot beat it. Most stores, including bed bath and beyond want over $100 for a similar mirror. This one is just as nice for half the price.</li>
            <li> I use the lighted mirror for makeup in a corner of the bedroom that is beside a window, but is still a fairly dark area. This mirror doesn&#x27;t provide enough light for my room. Might be fine if your room is better lighted.</li>
            <li> 7x is good size for magnification. Close up view without distortion. Seems well made and the light is bright enough to fill in shadows caused by overhead light.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with the mirror.  I returned it the day after I got it.  The lights heated up to an uncomfortable temp within just a few minutes and the mirror was much smaller than I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me.  I will continue to look for a new mirror.  I would not recommend this; however, it may be just me.</li>
            <li> Perfect for low lit areas and the magnification is enough to make putting on make-up easier but too much that the reflection is distorted.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it.,price was right</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter uses this every day.  The light around the mirror is perfect because she can use it anywhere, even where the light might not be good enough to put on make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every girl needs one.</li>
            <li> Great product. Like it better than the last Conair makeup mirror I had as it was a touch on and sometimes came on during a power surge.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and when it came I was pleasantly surprised that it was as nice as ones that I&#x27;ve seen in stores for triple the price. Happy purchase...Victoria Seaward</li>
            <li> Great mirror  just not quite bright enough</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY WITH MY MAKEUP MIRROR.  WORKS GREAT!!</li>
            <li> The mirror is a good size.  The light is not bright enough for me to rave about but not dark enough for me to return . Kind of a &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; product thats slightly useful.</li>
            <li> smaller than anticipated and no Jimmy capability. Inadequate description I believe. However a decent replacement for the broken one and it gets used every day</li>
            <li> Very small mirror; light is not very bright.</li>
            <li> The mirror is smaller than it appears on Amazon. It works great but it&#x27;s size causes my wife to have to move around to see what her old mirror showed.</li>
            <li> Good quality and very useful</li>
            <li> I really like the finish and design. It shipped quickly and the price was nice. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the lack of brightness I was hoping for. Florescent light is the best for applying makeup (besides natural daylight). Other than that it&#x27;s a great mirror so far.</li>
            <li> Great makeup mirror, my daughter was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The light is dim &amp; yellow and the magnified side has a foggy film over it that makes it hard to see your reflection in it. I was hoping there was a protective film over the glass but I have tried and tried and nothing peels off. I think the glass itsel is just filmy. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> She says \\&quot;the mirror lights up my life\\&quot; and allows her to find all her imperfections that she then talks to me about ad nauseam, very early in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaged nicely; good cord length; magnifies both her face and my frustration perfectly.</li>
            <li> The light stopped working a month after I received it and I cannot return it because I am passed the thirty day mark on the return policy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son who just got contact lenses. It is perfect. The light is bright but not blinding. The magnification is amazing, and it really helps him put in and take out his lenses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll do for now. I am thinking that I might eventually get something brighter. The area that I use this in is not well lit so I depend on this mirror alot.</li>
            <li> This mirror is ok, but its more oval making it not wide enough . I wish I would have bought a larger one with more magnification also --but for the price it might be suitable for some..</li>
            <li> Its too small Conair have a bigger size of the same model which is much more comfortable for make-up</li>
            <li> Perfect! I was looking over the other reviews and saw a lot of bad one so, i was thinking over if to get it or.not! But, i did and its awsome perfect! Love it it is bright enough! The mirrow is as big as i thought it would be, its not heavy, and i can do my make up with so better! Love it</li>
            <li> It was a gift and she loves it</li>
            <li> I needed something to help in mustache grooming and it delivered both magnification and illumination. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like when looking at yourself.  This mirror also easier ap[plication of make-up and the two settings are what you&#x27;d expect.  Could use a slightly brighter light at full setting, but OK</li>
            <li> the light is a bonus, i use this every day. the magnification is great for make-up and it stands balanced, no wobbles.</li>
            <li> The magnification is okay, the light is great. My problem is that the thing does not tilt very much. If you have it on a dresser or counter, and can sit down to look in it, that would work. If you think you can put it on your bath countertop and use it while standing up, you can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m only 5&#x27; 2&amp;#34; and I have to bend way down to see myself in it. You can&#x27;t tilt the mirror up more than 1/4 inch. Buyer beware.  (I got this mirror at Target)</li>
            <li> We were a little worried that it&#x27;d be too small, but it&#x27;s just great and is a great price. One more word is required for the review. so much for being pithy.</li>
            <li> Works well. The light could be a bit brighter, but I just readjust the mirror to get the necessary brightness needed.</li>
            <li> I have never had a vanity mirror before and really wanted one to help with putting on makeup. I must say that I chose very wisely!!! This product is great. The light is really bright and the magnification is fantastic. (Maybe even too much!! lol)</li>
            <li> Good mirror and magnification!  Works well for eyebrow plucking and makeup touch ups.</li>
            <li> This is a great double sided mirror.  That being said, it is dim, even with other lights on in the room. I bought it for unseemly extractions, eyebrow plucking etc.  Unfortunately it is made more for a glamour affect.</li>
            <li> Very well constructed mirror and stand. Plenty large enough for all tasks but small enough so as not to take up the entire bathroom counter. Light on the mirror is not bright enough to illuminate the task being performed, it is a very good supplement to regular bathroom lighting ( this seems to be true of all illuminated mirrors regardless of size). Priced well and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this mirror.  I like have the two sides to work with - the magnetic side is useful, but it&#x27;s also nice to have the standard mirror.  The light works great.</li>
            <li> If you think you are perfectly groomed, check this out!!! I am 51 years old and can&#x27;t see up close as well as I once could. I was horrified to discover the hairs under my eyebrows I had been missing, yikes!! This is a must have for the over 50 crowd.</li>
            <li> Great mirror, but the light burned out in the first month???  I hadn&#x27;t used it that much, either.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect gift for my granddaughter.  When she was little she always sat in front of grandmas mirror playing makeup.  Now older and wearing makeup of her own this is a more modern take on the past and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this until 2 days later the light stopped working. I checked several outlets to make sure a fuse wasn&#x27;t blown or something weird, but it must have had fault wiring. I didn&#x27;t like how the light switch was on the wire either, I would have preferred it to be easier to access like on the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank Amazon for promptly exchanging it for a different model: BE47BR. I have not had any issues with my new mirror.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and for the price and shipping it wasn&#x27;t bad.The item itself is in my opinion and the person i got it for looks amazing so clear .The only and only bad thing we both agreed was the light.Sure wish it was a brighter white light this would have made it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The Misses just wishes it was bigger.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described and was an affordable price, shipped on time and was functional when we received it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror but returned it.  It was the perfect size and reflection, however I didn&#x27;t feel that the light source was bright enough.  I had been using a regular mirror with a small lamp.  I noticed that the soft light from my lamp seemed to actually outshine this mirror.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband he uses it to shave and likes it a lot</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Good value.</li>
            <li> it does what i want it to do, provide lighting for putting on make up and stuff. it&#x27;s almost been a year since i had it and it&#x27;s still great! i even dropped it a few times on accident... well still works :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is i would like the switch to be on the stand to be more convenient, not sure how important that is though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommend!</li>
            <li> Very good light, not heavy and finally I can see what I am applying on my face. Worth every penny! Great mirror</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the light is not very bright. That being said I did discover (horror!) a giant black hair growing out of chin. How does that even happen? I&#x27;ll be returning it simply because my 50+ year old eyes need 1. Something brighter and 2. Something bigger. If you&#x27;re short on space or $, it&#x27;s a decent mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> After seeing this item for sale at Target for $40, I checked Amazon and was pleased to see it for $29.53, so I promptly ordered it.  However, I failed to notice there were 4 different options for the finish on the item, and each has a different price.  If you get the polished chrome finish, rather than the default option of chrome, it&#x27;s only $21.77.  Oh well, next time, I won&#x27;t order on my iPhone while shopping at Target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item was shipped 4 days after I ordered it, and I received it the next day.  It has a good amount of magnification which is perfect for plucking eyebrows but I was unimpressed with the power of the light on the mirror.  I&#x27;m not sure if I can upgrade to a stronger bulb or if I will have to use the bathroom ceiling lights along with the mirror light, but just a word of caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice appearing item and gets the job done, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Love it!! If it goes out,  will buy again for this price. Fits good on my vanity. Thinking of getting another and putting it in my bathroom also.</li>
            <li> The light isnt the best for doing make up which is why i have it.. You def need more natural type lighting and this is just too unflattering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it without the light</li>
            <li> This is all I expected and more</li>
            <li> I like the lighting, magnification and convenience.  Attractive and stable along with being easy to move.  Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bright and perfect for my little vanity  I can see clearly on both sides to do my make up love it !!</li>
            <li> After chemo, my vision really took a hard hit.  This mirror is perfect for everyday makeup application!  And it looks great with it&#x27;s classic style on the bathroom vanity too!</li>
            <li> Great mirror for a good price.</li>
            <li> great product. just wish the light was brighter</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, but both my daughter and wife love the mirror and use it daily. Good even light, and a magnified mirror on the back, for fine work.</li>
            <li> this mirror does what I needed it to do for a fraction of the price of other lighted mirrors. happy</li>
            <li> Just got it and it appears to be just as I expected. Wish the mirror was a little bigger and the light a bit brighter but overall 5 stars..</li>
            <li> This mirror is rather small, maybe 5-6&amp;#34; in height, but ultimately works.  The magnification is great, but the illumination is somewhat dim compared to her old model.  It works well for a backup mirror but she says she doesn&#x27;t think she&#x27;d want to use it full-time.</li>
            <li> great mirror, everything was as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this mirror!!! Great lighting, chic and smooth, and the highest magnification I&#x27;ve seen for such a great price. The ONLY drawback, is that it is not taller, and so I have to put a couple books underneath it so it&#x27;s at my eye level. But I don&#x27;t care. I saved like $50. ALSO, AWESOME DELIVERY! I ORDERED IT ON SATURDAY, AND IT CAME MONDAYYYYY!!! A week early!!!!! I was so excited and happy to get to use it sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li> I dont know how I went so long without it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I am so very happy with this mirror. I&#x27;ve had many makeup mirrors over the years and this is the best one, without a doubt. Nice and bright and the shape of the mirror (oval) is perfect. I also love the fact that you CAN replace the bulbs. Mfgs love to make things you have to throw out when a simple thing like a bulb burns out. That&#x27;s what happened with the last mirror. Kudos to Conair for being green!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the mirrors is excellent. Very clear. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This would be a good lighted makeup mirror if it was bright enough, it&#x27;s just okay.  I would also prefer if this model was a round mirror instead of oval.  Both sides of the mirror are not distorted.</li>
            <li> The light on this mirror is too dim. It has one 20W incandescent bulb. Otherwise the mirror is very nice. It is the perfect size for makeup and provides distortion free magnification. I really wanted to keep this mirror. I looked for a brighter bulb that would fit the small base but couldn&#x27;t find one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this regularly for a bit now and would definitely recommend- lightweight, well made, and is as described.</li>
            <li> would have liked it to be a taller mirror but thats my own fault for not buying one</li>
            <li> Love this mirror! It has two magnifications, both lighted. It may not be as fancy as the touch ones with different settings but I don&#x27;t need all that and can&#x27;t spend that kind of money. The mirror does get a bit warm after a while but that&#x27;s expected. My only suggestion would be to have the switch on the base versus the cord.</li>
            <li> This mirror is wonderfully bright and it&#x27;s huge! Just be careful of the edges when it&#x27;s been in use for a while, it tends to get quite hot!</li>
            <li> great product, quick shipping! Thank you !</li>
            <li> The Wife likes it. Says it&#x27;s bright enough but still gentle so it doesn&#x27;t blind her when she&#x27;s applying her make up.  She&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a well made mirror, the light works well, the magnification is terrific. I recommend this mirror, it is a good value. John</li>
            <li> Works really good, good size too. My girl loved it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter for Christmas.  It is a nice design and the lighting is great.  The best thing is that it includes a cord to plug it in.  A lot of other makeup mirrors I was looking at (PB Teen etc) don&#x27;t have a cord which means you&#x27;d go through a lot of batteries when it gets left on.  And my daughter certainly leaves this light on a lot.</li>
            <li> The hubbs bought this for me since my belly is getting to big to get close to our mirror in the bathroom to apply my contacts &amp; make up. The lighting is soft &amp; gentle. Shipment was fast &amp; arrived perfectly unharmed.</li>
            <li> Love it, no complains! ! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> great for applying make up and threading eyebrows!</li>
