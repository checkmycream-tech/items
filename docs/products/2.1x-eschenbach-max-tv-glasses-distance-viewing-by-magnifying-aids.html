    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>A great find!</li>
            <li>The customer service department at Eschenbach is excellent with advice and information.  </li>
            <li>MaxTV glasses from Eschenbach are the best of three sets of TV glasses I bought.</li>
            <li>Excellent for people macular.  </li>
            <li>Very good product and value through Amazon.</li>
            <li>They are great glasses...</li>
            <li>They would work great for her if the area for viewing was wider, as she uses her peripheral vision.</li>
            <li>gave it four stars because I didn&#x27;t want to change the good rating.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While not everything we had hoped for, any improvement is good when it comes to vision, and we will accept that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t own them yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Come in a nice case and well packaged.</li>
            <li>They have a nice, futuristic design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>His vision had deteriorated even more when he fell and hit his head.  </li>
            <li>I believe that&#x27;s more a function of his vision than the quality of the glasses.</li>
            <li>I can see so much better with this to perform my work.</li>
            <li>my work done with greater precision.</li>
            <li>But they worked, and she has been able to adjust and wear them, and they have provided substantial TV viewing improvement.  </li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t even mind the goofy look, telling me, \\&quot;My</li>
            <li>Shipping was swift and sure.</li>
            <li>But overall very happy with it.</li>
            <li>These are much better because they are lighter and more comfortable to wear than the Maxiaids were.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The glasses are well made and easy to adjust, even by a child of 8 years (</li>
            <li>She easily adjusted the focus herself, and they have transformed her hours from frustration to pleasure.</li>
            <li>They are also easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>Glasses were as advertised and are working out fine for my father-in-law suffering with macular degeneration.</li>
            <li>I had guarded expectations when ordering this product.....  </li>
            <li>I took off my own glasses and readily adjusted them to suit me as well.</li>
            <li>More than worth the price.</li>
            <li>it works great, especially when need to read the text in some movies.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy return.</li>
            <li>Better than most TV viewing aids but adjustment wheels become loose and the lens slips in /out of its own accord causing unsteady focus.  </li>
            <li>The quality of these glasses are very good, and if the company could design them with the wider viewing area I think they would be able to sell alot more to people with limited central vision.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of this product is good, generally speaking.....expensive, but worth it when it comes to sight.  </li>
            <li>I really want a pair, but I&#x27;ll keep waiting for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s essential to realize that most are not precision-engineered optics made in Germany by a top of the line specialist like Eschenbach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not shown here on the product photo but each stem has a little rubber adjustment piece that keeps the glasses from sliding forward and is used to set a good fit on the bridge of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>the practical side, while the FOV (field of view) is very limited, my son was indeed able to take them to school and see the blackboard much better.</li>
            <li>for the \\&quot;funny glasses\\&quot; factor, since luckily he was always wearing the contacts at school, he was never stigmatized as he would probably have been with the super-thick eyeglasses that he has for when his eyes need a break.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful thing that he is now able to watch TV and actually see almost everything on the screen (small print not so much).</li>
            <li>the lightly printed high shipping cost.</li>
            <li>My husband, with the adjustable distance magnifying aids, is now able to see more detail while viewing tv, (i.e., faces), and can read large print  on distant screens.</li>
            <li>If you or someone you know and love has a visual impairment these might be one of the more simple - and useful - products out there.</li>
            <li>some of his little friends even thought it was kind of cool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To start with, his pediatric ophtalmologist had never seen this product since it was mostly available in Europe at the time, so he gave them a thorough professional inspection before allowing their use.</li>
            <li>his age when he got the first pair).</li>
            <li>And while they are fairly sturdy, he ended up needing new pairs every once in a while, which is to be expected when a child is using a precision instrument by himself in a school environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Please be aware of this in case you turn to some other glasses of this kind.</li>
            <li>- work very well for many forms of visual impairment.&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use -</li>
            <li>I found the Eschenbach Max TV glasses in 2008 during one of my trips to Europe and immediately thought that they might help my son who was born with congenital cataracts (operated, wearing special contact lenses since he&#x27;s 2 months old).</li>
            <li>really help me see the TV.</li>
            <li>going price for these is around $180, so you might think $133 is a real deal if you don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;notice</li>
            <li>He says these really help him focus in on the television.  </li>
            <li>thank you so much, the screen is so close</li>
            <li>But as I added more games to her system and watched her struggle to play them, I ordered them myself and gave them to her as an early Christmas present.</li>
            <li>I bought these glasses for a friend who lost most of his vision due to M.S.  </li>
            <li>But her other favorite pastime is playing computer games.</li>
            <li>they were simply too powerful at first.</li>
            <li>He also used them at home occasionally to watch movies, even if I always made sure to have the largest possible screen for him.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s loved for the last few years</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I give them 5 stars despite the high cost because, to my knowledge, there is nothing out there that combines all these benefits, no matter the price.</li>
            <li>persons with regular vision such as myself will likely find them overly powerful unless you are like our favorite brother in law who borrows them to stare at the girls while on the beach without appearing obtuse</li>
            <li>price is high for what it is.</li>
            <li>They are for discerning details that are normally beyond your range.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When kids are really little, close up vision is the most important but later, as they move up in school grades, they need to see with clarity things that are further away than arm&#x27;s length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first, Task-Vision TV Glasses, were a lot cheeper, but I found out after I got them that their design was low quality.</li>
            <li>Of course, these are not for playing sports or other physical activities where distance vision is needed (catching a ball or such).</li>
            <li>She has mild cataracts and can watch TV well-enough using closed captions and a 32-inch HDTV.</li>
            <li>Can you see through clear plastics.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work for my 95 year old Mother with macular degeneration.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 91 year old Father.  </li>
            <li>While the glasses for near did not improve his reading ability beyond that provided by 4 readers, and were returned, the tv glasses for distance viewing beyond 10 feet did help some.  </li>
            <li>My 84 year old mother is on hospice care and bed-bound.</li>
            <li>My 95 year old mother has AMD - macular degeneration - in both eyes.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these for my 84 year old mother.</li>
            <li>she is 89 years old with macular degeneration</li>
            <li>I bought them for my dad who is 74 years old, but has the promenda macula degeneration of old age, the spend watching TV, despite having a 60 &amp;#34;screen</li>
            <li>They are expensive, but they do a good job.</li>
            <li>Each eyepiece can be tweaked individually, which is also very important since each eye has a slightly different correction, even if it made it a little harder for him at first.</li>
            <li>Nothing high tech about them but rather a simple adjustment that allows you to \\&quot;zoom in\\&quot; or enlarge items.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these to anyone with low vision.</li>
            <li>she came to live with me last summer, I found the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>We bought glasses as a last resort, and at the recommendation of one of his doctors, decided to try both the near and far magnifying aids ....</li>
            <li>hoping they would help my husband, who is very near sighted and has central vision issues in one eye.  </li>
            <li>My Dad has advanced macular degeneration and was having a difficult time watching his large screen TV.  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t think she would live long enough!</li>
            <li>We have hooked her TV up to her computer so that she has a large display, but the Hidden Object and Match 3 games</li>

            <li> We have hooked her TV up to her computer so that she has a large display, but the Hidden Object and Match 3 games</li>
            <li> Only recommend if you really have trouble seeing the TV distantly away</li>
            <li> so she has limited central vision.</li>
            <li> Had to return, did not help my father, magnification not high enough.</li>
            <li> I needed these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I then bought a pair of binocular glasses, but their field of view wasn&#x27;t wide enough for my TV, and they fell apart within three days.</li>
            <li> These glasses permit her to improve her limited viewing of TV; while not a cure, they work quite well.  </li>
            <li> Of course they are expensive but for me they are worth it.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t want my boy&#x27;s already minimal vision damaged by a second-rate product.</li>
            <li> were getting harder and harder for her to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, when you adjust one eye&#x27;e lense, it changed the focus on the other eye&#x27;s lense.</li>
            <li> Glasses took a couple months to get, which I thought was a little bit of a wait.  </li>
            <li> If it  helps a  little bit, I would have kept it.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to make others aware of that very expensive</li>
            <li> He had a stroke in one eye a couple years ago and has trouble watching television.  </li>
            <li> Also, they were so heavy that she could not wear them any longer than to discover that she could not get them focused.</li>
            <li> My daughter has Stargardts (which is Juvenile Macular Degeneration)</li>
            <li> It was for a 97 year old with severe macular degeneration and arthritis, and the glasses appeared difficult to adjust, cumbersome to wear and of questionable efficacy.  </li>
            <li> So to say the least, I AM NOT IMPRESSED!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am still waiting for my refund.</li>
            <li> This product has poor quality .  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However it is an expensive product, though novel, maybe you can get it cheaper</li>
            <li> She suffers with agerelated macular degeneration and I had hoped they would enhance her TV viewing.</li>
            <li> They were very difficult to adjust.</li>
            <li> So when he started bringing these to school, no one gave him grief and</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought these to replace a pair I had bought from Maxiaids which broke.  These are much better because they are lighter and more comfortable to wear than the Maxiaids were.  They also have a much larger field of view, allowing me to see the entire TV screen.  Of course they are expensive but for me they are worth it.</li>
            <li> My Dad has advanced macular degeneration and was having a difficult time watching his large screen TV.  His vision had deteriorated even more when he fell and hit his head.  We ordered these glasses hoping it would help him.  He reports that the glasses help some days and not others.  I believe that&#x27;s more a function of his vision than the quality of the glasses.</li>
            <li> really help me see the TV.</li>
            <li> Glasses took a couple months to get, which I thought was a little bit of a wait.  They are great glasses... but didn&#x27;t work for what we needed.  My daughter has Stargardts (which is Juvenile Macular Degeneration) so she has limited central vision. They would work great for her if the area for viewing was wider, as she uses her peripheral vision. The quality of these glasses are very good, and if the company could design them with the wider viewing area I think they would be able to sell alot more to people with limited central vision.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my 95 year old Mother with macular degeneration.</li>
            <li> I bought these glasses for a friend who lost most of his vision due to M.S.  It&#x27;s a wonderful thing that he is now able to watch TV and actually see almost everything on the screen (small print not so much).</li>
            <li> Just wanted to make others aware of that very expensive shipping.&lt;br /&gt;The going price for these is around $180, so you might think $133 is a real deal if you don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;notice the lightly printed high shipping cost. I almost clicked.&lt;br /&gt;Even if it is coming from Germany, that seems high.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found where they ship from, anyone see it?&lt;br /&gt; I really want a pair, but I&#x27;ll keep waiting for a better price.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because I didn&#x27;t want to change the good rating.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t own them yet.&lt;br /&gt;  Mike</li>
            <li> Bought for my 91 year old Father.  He had a stroke in one eye a couple years ago and has trouble watching television.  He says these really help him focus in on the television.  They&#x27;re pricey, but they work.  Come in a nice case and well packaged.</li>
            <li> I can see so much better with this to perform my work. As an esthetician this helps me&lt;br /&gt;get my work done with greater precision.</li>
            <li> I found the Eschenbach Max TV glasses in 2008 during one of my trips to Europe and immediately thought that they might help my son who was born with congenital cataracts (operated, wearing special contact lenses since he&#x27;s 2 months old). When kids are really little, close up vision is the most important but later, as they move up in school grades, they need to see with clarity things that are further away than arm&#x27;s length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with, his pediatric ophtalmologist had never seen this product since it was mostly available in Europe at the time, so he gave them a thorough professional inspection before allowing their use. We didn&#x27;t want my boy&#x27;s already minimal vision damaged by a second-rate product. Please be aware of this in case you turn to some other glasses of this kind. It&#x27;s essential to realize that most are not precision-engineered optics made in Germany by a top of the line specialist like Eschenbach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the practical side, while the FOV (field of view) is very limited, my son was indeed able to take them to school and see the blackboard much better. He also used them at home occasionally to watch movies, even if I always made sure to have the largest possible screen for him. Of course, these are not for playing sports or other physical activities where distance vision is needed (catching a ball or such). They are for discerning details that are normally beyond your range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glasses are well made and easy to adjust, even by a child of 8 years (his age when he got the first pair). Each eyepiece can be tweaked individually, which is also very important since each eye has a slightly different correction, even if it made it a little harder for him at first. It&#x27;s not shown here on the product photo but each stem has a little rubber adjustment piece that keeps the glasses from sliding forward and is used to set a good fit on the bridge of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;They come with a semi-rigid zippered carrying case for transport. And while they are fairly sturdy, he ended up needing new pairs every once in a while, which is to be expected when a child is using a precision instrument by himself in a school environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the \\&quot;funny glasses\\&quot; factor, since luckily he was always wearing the contacts at school, he was never stigmatized as he would probably have been with the super-thick eyeglasses that he has for when his eyes need a break. So when he started bringing these to school, no one gave him grief and some of his little friends even thought it was kind of cool. They have a nice, futuristic design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give them 5 stars despite the high cost because, to my knowledge, there is nothing out there that combines all these benefits, no matter the price.</li>
            <li> Glasses were as advertised and are working out fine for my father-in-law suffering with macular degeneration.</li>
            <li> If you or someone you know and love has a visual impairment these might be one of the more simple - and useful - products out there. Nothing high tech about them but rather a simple adjustment that allows you to \\&quot;zoom in\\&quot; or enlarge items. Allows some people with a visual impairment to watch television or see things at a distance...persons with regular vision such as myself will likely find them overly powerful unless you are like our favorite brother in law who borrows them to stare at the girls while on the beach without appearing obtuse (which he is but that&#x27;s another story entirely!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s - work very well for many forms of visual impairment.&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use - just put on and adjust to your desire.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to take along anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s - try to find a pair before buying. These did NOT work for my spouse until much later as vision deteriorated...they were simply too powerful at first. They also don&#x27;t work for all forms of vision loss.&lt;br /&gt;Tend to get scratched.&lt;br /&gt;Price. Like a lot of specialized items for the visually impaired, one gets the feelng these should cost a tiny fraction of what they sell for.</li>
            <li> I had guarded expectations when ordering this product.....  It was for a 97 year old with severe macular degeneration and arthritis, and the glasses appeared difficult to adjust, cumbersome to wear and of questionable efficacy.  But they worked, and she has been able to adjust and wear them, and they have provided substantial TV viewing improvement.  I would rate it 5 stars, but for the caution that the manipulation of the adjustments by arthritic, vision-impaired user is a concern.</li>
            <li> I just can not use it. If it is my eye or else, I just can not see anything with it. Can you see through clear plastics. Yes you can but why. If it  helps a  little bit, I would have kept it. But I was despair for anything that can help with low vision.  And a return policy of 15 or 25% is ridicules.</li>
            <li> We bought glasses as a last resort, and at the recommendation of one of his doctors, decided to try both the near and far magnifying aids ....hoping they would help my husband, who is very near sighted and has central vision issues in one eye.  While the glasses for near did not improve his reading ability beyond that provided by 4 readers, and were returned, the tv glasses for distance viewing beyond 10 feet did help some.  My husband, with the adjustable distance magnifying aids, is now able to see more detail while viewing tv, (i.e., faces), and can read large print  on distant screens. While not everything we had hoped for, any improvement is good when it comes to vision, and we will accept that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this product is good, generally speaking.....expensive, but worth it when it comes to sight.  The communications regarding the purchase were timely, and delivery of product within time commitment given.</li>
            <li> Had to return, did not help my father, magnification not high enough. Quick and easy return.</li>
            <li> My 84 year old mother is on hospice care and bed-bound. She has mild cataracts and can watch TV well-enough using closed captions and a 32-inch HDTV. But her other favorite pastime is playing computer games. We have hooked her TV up to her computer so that she has a large display, but the Hidden Object and Match 3 games she&#x27;s loved for the last few years were getting harder and harder for her to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she came to live with me last summer, I found the [[ASIN:B001DD07RY 2.1X Eschenbach Max TV Glasses Distance Viewing]] online and tried to convince her to order a pair. She didn&#x27;t think she would live long enough! But as I added more games to her system and watched her struggle to play them, I ordered them myself and gave them to her as an early Christmas present. To my astonishment and delight, she LOVES them! She easily adjusted the focus herself, and they have transformed her hours from frustration to pleasure. She doesn&#x27;t even mind the goofy look, telling me, \\&quot;My friends all call me &#x27;six-eyes&#x27;!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these to anyone with low vision. I took off my own glasses and readily adjusted them to suit me as well. Shipping was swift and sure. A great find!</li>
            <li> I needed these a long time ago. thank you so much, the screen is so close I feel I can touch it but I can&#x27;t ha ha</li>
            <li> Better than most TV viewing aids but adjustment wheels become loose and the lens slips in /out of its own accord causing unsteady focus.  Can this be tightened? price is high for what it is.</li>
            <li> This product has poor quality .  Sales person liar</li>
            <li> My 95 year old mother has AMD - macular degeneration - in both eyes.  These glasses permit her to improve her limited viewing of TV; while not a cure, they work quite well.  The customer service department at Eschenbach is excellent with advice and information.  I know these are recommended by optometrists and ophthalmologists in USA .  Very good product and value through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my 84 year old mother. She suffers with agerelated macular degeneration and I had hoped they would enhance her TV viewing. Well they did not!! Also, they were so heavy that she could not wear them any longer than to discover that she could not get them focused. I have returned them and the postage to do so cost me $45.00. So to say the least, I AM NOT IMPRESSED!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am still waiting for my refund.</li>
            <li> MaxTV glasses from Eschenbach are the best of three sets of TV glasses I bought. I first, Task-Vision TV Glasses, were a lot cheeper, but I found out after I got them that their design was low quality. Those glasses distorted the scene so that only 20% of the screen was in focus with each adjustment. They were very difficult to adjust. Also, when you adjust one eye&#x27;e lense, it changed the focus on the other eye&#x27;s lense. It required a lot of back and forth adjustments that could only produce a distorted view. I then bought a pair of binocular glasses, but their field of view wasn&#x27;t wide enough for my TV, and they fell apart within three days. Finally I bought a pair of MaxTV glasses from Eschenbach. They are expensive, but they do a good job. The field of view is big enough to cover my TV and there is no distortion. They are also easy to adjust. From looking at the glasses, I&#x27;d think that they could be sold for a lot lower price. But I could not find a lower priced dealer or alternative design.</li>
            <li> Excellent for people macular.  Now I can watch tv, read the guide and play video golf with my husband again.  More than worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom-in law for macular degeneration. She saw improvement while watching tv but not the clarity she wanted. But overall very happy with it.</li>
            <li> purchased for my mother and she seems to like them she is 89 years old with macular degeneration</li>
            <li> I bought them for my dad who is 74 years old, but has the promenda macula degeneration of old age, the spend watching TV, despite having a 60 &amp;#34;screen it works great, especially when need to read the text in some movies. every lens can focus depending on the need of each eye. comes with a convenient carrying case to protect it from damage when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it is an expensive product, though novel, maybe you can get it cheaper somewhere clinic vision problems but do not have the same quality. Only recommend if you really have trouble seeing the TV distantly away</li>
