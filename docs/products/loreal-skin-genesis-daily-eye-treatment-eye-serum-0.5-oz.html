            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, but it&#x27;s not as great as I&#x27;d hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>I trust the most.  </li>
            <li>I am going to throw it away for sure.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>So glad to find it at Amazon as it is discontinued by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I have really enJOYed this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for years but the latest formation does not make lines disappear as well as before.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine, practically as good as the high end ones.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Being a huge fan of the Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum, I decided to give Olay&#x27;s competitor a try.</li>
            <li>Also, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge reduction in my puffiness, which I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews I thought this would be a fantastic product</li>
            <li>This eye cream is light and smooth and has not irritated my eyes at all.  </li>
            <li>No annoying fragrance or uncomfy eye-watering ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>so it works like a cheap product.</li>
            <li>Really...it does help with smooth out some of the lines beneath your eyes and leaves your skin glowing.</li>
            <li>But it felt good when applied and made the skin soft and look moist for a while,</li>
            <li>My skin feels good and is soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and scent free and soaks into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>but after a month of using it I do not see a significant difference with my under eye area.</li>
            <li>Although after time I see results it is surely not the best out there.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure companies do not place expired coupons in there packages.</li>
            <li>Well, now my chin is bright red and peeling.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly tell if this product did anything for me (50 yr old).</li>
            <li>Most irritate my eye so much my eye starts tearing up.</li>
            <li>It is thick and feels wonderful under the eye.</li>
            <li>Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>is it OK to use this product if it is old?</li>
            <li>This is also good to wear at night as one might expect, but unlike other eye serums, this does not \\&quot;travel\\&quot; into my eyes.</li>
            <li>I needed eye cream &amp; was glad to find something decent for a decent price at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>However for the price and value considering my frequent use this is definitely the best option for me right now since I&#x27;m only pushing 25.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on super smoothly and everything looks brighter in general.</li>
            <li>I awake to beautifully smooth, soft eye skin</li>
            <li>The added moisture does make my under eye more moisturized for a short period of time.</li>
            <li>After the first 2-3 days, I started to notice a stinging around the eye area at night when I used the cream.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it!</li>
            <li>I ordered several bottles and plan to order more.</li>
            <li>its the same product i get in the store but more convienent</li>
            <li>Just started using this for the first time.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time i&#x27;ve used it exactly as the directions say so</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy it again when I run out; but since you don&#x27;t need much, it&#x27;ll be a while before I have to buy more.  </li>
            <li>I certainly hope it isn&#x27;t being discontinued.  </li>
            <li>(like i read in a certain magazine)but</li>
            <li>I have become a fan of the whole Skin Genesis line and was dying to compare the two eye serums.</li>
            <li>and I really can see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>Works all-over the face, really.</li>
            <li>after a week you can really see a diference.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU  FOR HAVING IT AND SENDING IT SO FAST.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million.</li>
            <li>and i enjoy buying online not only do i save money but</li>
            <li>A lot goes a long way so the value is fantastic as well.  </li>
            <li>It was like it never absorbed into my skin - it just stayed on top.  </li>
            <li>My eyes crave this serum it always soothes and moisturizes and is better than most expensive serums.</li>
            <li>It is not true that you have a better eyezone in just 4 hours</li>
            <li>Sadly, it wasn&#x27;t as great as I&#x27;d imagined it would be.</li>
            <li>Really good product works wonders on tired eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my eyes have honestly gotten any better, but they don&#x27;t appear to have gotten any worse (like some other products I&#x27;ve tried).  </li>
            <li>I am almost 30 years old and most eye creams i tried burned and itched a little.</li>
            <li>I was having to use eye drops several times a day just to relieve the intense itching.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have developed redness and swell after using product.  </li>
            <li>but I thought to test it on my chin to see if my eye area was just too sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks now and so far there is no difference..</li>
            <li>and I really think I look younger using it.</li>
            <li>Shouldn&#x27;t there be something to prevent selling a cosmetic product that is 5 yrs old?</li>
            <li>Works better for me than any other eye cream I&#x27;ve used, plain and simple.</li>
            <li>I tried other products but couldn&#x27;t find one that helped as much as this one.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I received the items in a very timely matter.</li>
            <li>As someone obsessed with skin care I am enjoying this product so far.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny amount to cover the whole eye area and I usually apply some to my lids, makes my eye makeup go on much smoother.</li>

            <li> What I did notice was that for 4 weeks my eyes were unbearably itchy all day long.  </li>
            <li> After a week of use, my eye area looks and feels smoother and is a bit less crepy if that&#x27;s possible after only a week.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to those dry skin types because it helps.</li>
            <li> For one thing, there&#x27;s not very much in the container.</li>
            <li> i have used it every single day for almost 5 months now end NO RESULT!</li>
            <li> but I am definitely starting to see a difference with the dark circles under my eyes!</li>
            <li> After a lot of money and time spent researching Loreal has come to be the brand</li>
            <li> For some reason I started having trouble finding it in my local stores.  </li>
            <li> The other thing I didn&#x27;t like about the product was when I would wash my face the morning after applying it before bed, I could still feel the slipperiness of the product once the water hit it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not tacky or greasy like other eye creams</li>
            <li> Still puffy, lines are not any less visible.</li>
            <li> I know this next part sounds dumb...</li>
            <li> I dare say i even feel my fingerprints a little smoother in the fingers i use to put it on.</li>
            <li> I would say don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> But was rather disappointed when I received them only to realize that they are very old.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll repurchase, but I&#x27;ll consider it if nothing else catches my eye.</li>
            <li> This makes eye makeup application sloppy.</li>
            <li> Five days ago I switched to a different eye cream (Origins Eye Doctor) and the horrible itching has subsided.  </li>
            <li> so DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this for about 4 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my fine lines around my eyes.  What I did notice was that for 4 weeks my eyes were unbearably itchy all day long.  I was having to use eye drops several times a day just to relieve the intense itching.  Five days ago I switched to a different eye cream (Origins Eye Doctor) and the horrible itching has subsided.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with sensitive eyes.  The other thing I didn&#x27;t like about the product was when I would wash my face the morning after applying it before bed, I could still feel the slipperiness of the product once the water hit it.  It was like it never absorbed into my skin - it just stayed on top.  There must be a lot of silicone in the product.</li>
            <li> Being a huge fan of the Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum, I decided to give Olay&#x27;s competitor a try. I have become a fan of the whole Skin Genesis line and was dying to compare the two eye serums. This serum is fragrance-free and a bit heavier than the Olay version. You only need a tiny amount to cover the whole eye area and I usually apply some to my lids, makes my eye makeup go on much smoother. After a week of use, my eye area looks and feels smoother and is a bit less crepy if that&#x27;s possible after only a week. My makeup goes on super smoothly and everything looks brighter in general. This is also good to wear at night as one might expect, but unlike other eye serums, this does not \\&quot;travel\\&quot; into my eyes. I awake to beautifully smooth, soft eye skin and I am very happy with the results. I think it is safe to say that this is one of the best eye creams I have ever used.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews of this product, I was really impressed and decided to try it. Sadly, it wasn&#x27;t as great as I&#x27;d imagined it would be. For one thing, there&#x27;s not very much in the container. Also, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge reduction in my puffiness, which I was hoping for. It&#x27;s not a bad product, but it&#x27;s not as great as I&#x27;d hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I thought this would be a fantastic product but after a month of using it I do not see a significant difference with my under eye area. Still puffy, lines are not any less visible. The added moisture does make my under eye more moisturized for a short period of time. I would say don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> As someone obsessed with skin care I am enjoying this product so far. I am a big fan of the Skin Genesis line and use their night cream as my daily moisturizer and have now upgraded to using their serum and eye cream daily as well.  After a lot of money and time spent researching Loreal has come to be the brand I trust the most.  This eye cream is light and smooth and has not irritated my eyes at all.  A lot goes a long way so the value is fantastic as well.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have used other eyes creams that show instant results and this one does not.  Although after time I see results it is surely not the best out there.  However for the price and value considering my frequent use this is definitely the best option for me right now since I&#x27;m only pushing 25.</li>
            <li> When I firsted made my search with a keyword \\&quot;Eye Cream,\\&quot; this product appeared as if it was produced in AUG 2011.  However, after I received the product and checked its manufactured date through its \\&quot;batch code\\&quot; and i got a result saying that it was produced in Nov 2007.  Hope the seller has something to say about it.   By the way, i&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I would definite not buy this again!  I have developed redness and swell after using product.  I bought it from Amazon thought it might be from another seller.  I am going to throw it away for sure.</li>
            <li> Works better for me than any other eye cream I&#x27;ve used, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> have used this product for years and I love it. Very good feel on the eye area. So glad to find it at Amazon as it is discontinued by L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> After the first 2-3 days, I started to notice a stinging around the eye area at night when I used the cream.  After 1 week, the entire eye area looks irritated  and peeling.  I know this next part sounds dumb...but I thought to test it on my chin to see if my eye area was just too sensitive.  Well, now my chin is bright red and peeling.  Stay away from this cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 weeks now and so far there is no difference.. The only change I see is increased moisture for a short time and then ...well, nothing.  Maybe it&#x27;s too soon to tell, but I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for quite a while. I&#x27;m 66 and I really can see and feel a difference. It&#x27;s not tacky or greasy like other eye creams and I really think I look younger using it. For some reason, I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore on the shelves in my area. In a panic, I went online and received it in time for my Europe trip. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it. Really think this product is wonderful. Thanks L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eye cream that targets eye bag problem. I have seen an improvement with my eye area after two weeks of use. I would recommend it as an age-prevention product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly tell if this product did anything for me (50 yr old). But it felt good when applied and made the skin soft and look moist for a while,</li>
            <li> I have tried several eye creams and serums. Most irritate my eye so much my eye starts tearing up. My eyes crave this serum it always soothes and moisturizes and is better than most expensive serums. I really recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite some time with good results.  For some reason I started having trouble finding it in my local stores.  I certainly hope it isn&#x27;t being discontinued.  I tried other products but couldn&#x27;t find one that helped as much as this one.  I was so glad to find it here on Amazon.  I ordered several bottles and plan to order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of different eyecreams and this one compares favorably.  It&#x27;s light and scent free and soaks into the skin quickly.  It appears to wear well under make-up.  I don&#x27;t think my eyes have honestly gotten any better, but they don&#x27;t appear to have gotten any worse (like some other products I&#x27;ve tried).  I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months now, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll repurchase, but I&#x27;ll consider it if nothing else catches my eye.</li>
            <li> This eye serum worked without making my skin feel too \\&quot;tight\\&quot;.  Works all-over the face, really. I would definitely would but this again.</li>
            <li> Really good product works wonders on tired eyes.</li>
            <li> I needed eye cream &amp; was glad to find something decent for a decent price at Amazon.  It works just fine, practically as good as the high end ones.</li>
            <li> I am almost 30 years old and most eye creams i tried burned and itched a little.This eyecream doesnt make your eyes burn. It is not true that you have a better eyezone in just 4 hours (like i read in a certain magazine)but after a week you can really see a diference. I dare say i even feel my fingerprints a little smoother in the fingers i use to put it on.</li>
            <li> I purchased several of these online when I found them. But was rather disappointed when I received them only to realize that they are very old.  They had coupons in each package that expired in 2009. Pretty sure companies do not place expired coupons in there packages. Other than that, I received the items in a very timely matter.</li>
            <li> I AM SOOOOOO HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS NOT IN STORES AND I LOVE IT. THANK YOU  FOR HAVING IT AND SENDING IT SO FAST. YEA YEA!!!!</li>
            <li> I have really enJOYed this eye cream.  No annoying fragrance or uncomfy eye-watering ingredients.  My skin feels good and is soft.</li>
            <li> Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described. Thanks a million.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this. It is thick and feels wonderful under the eye. Just a tiny dot under each eye covers the area well and it does decrease the wrinkles.  I will definitely buy it again when I run out; but since you don&#x27;t need much, it&#x27;ll be a while before I have to buy more.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have used it every single day for almost 5 months now end NO RESULT! so DISAPPOINTED!!! It&#x27;s cheap so it works like a cheap product.</li>
            <li> Really...it does help with smooth out some of the lines beneath your eyes and leaves your skin glowing. I would recommend this to those dry skin types because it helps.</li>
            <li> If I put this on before makeup, it takes an hour to fully absorb into my skin as it leave a greasy residue. This makes eye makeup application sloppy. I like to use this before bed.</li>
            <li> they make wonderful products for the price and i enjoy buying online not only do i save money but its the same product i get in the store but more convienent</li>
            <li> Works great, take her word for it  lol</li>
            <li> Like any lightener it takes a while to take effect but I am definitely starting to see a difference with the dark circles under my eyes! Great product, always a fan of L&#x27;Oréal!</li>
            <li> is it OK to use this product if it is old? I bought it online and the coupon in the box expires in 2009!! Shouldn&#x27;t there be something to prevent selling a cosmetic product that is 5 yrs old?</li>
            <li> good price. a lot cheaper than the store.</li>
            <li> Just started using this for the first time.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing I have found to keep my lower eyelids moisturized.  I wish they hadn&#x27;t taken it off the market.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time i&#x27;ve used it exactly as the directions say so but it hasnt worked for me! Wouldnt recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years but the latest formation does not make lines disappear as well as before.  In addition, the eye area felt smoother and tighter before as well.</li>
