            <li>I find that it is one of the best oils for balancing combination skin.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin e is, of course, wonderful for the skin and helps preserve the oil (although I still keep in the fridge) but does feel heavier.  </li>
            <li>Rosewood is wonderful for combination skin--or for any skin type for that matter; however it is especially effective at balancing the skin.  </li>
            <li>The weeks I used this kukui oil as a replacement for my face lotions I had some of my best skin.</li>

            <li>Love adding it to my concoctions.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is not a cure for psoriasis, nor can I say that it stopped the itching, but I do believe it is probably safe to use; it has not burned or seemed to have caused more itching.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Compared to coconut oil, it&#x27;s literally 1,000x better in this regard.</li>
            <li>oh my god coconut oil is the most overrated product</li>
            <li>I shopped around before purchasing and couldn&#x27;t find a better deal.</li>
            <li>The smell, which is not bad at all in my opinion but very natural, dissipates quickly, so it is excellent for those who don&#x27;t want carry around an aroma.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff, apply after you shave and your legs will be so smooth.</li>
            <li>Great product, i&#x27;m new to this product, but so far I&#x27;m loving it!......</li>
            <li>It absorbs into your skin quickly and feels nice and light.</li>
            <li>The popular tourist brand worked pretty well</li>
            <li>Even though the oil works perfect; the bottle I got was a little off smell.</li>
            <li>Very mild on the skin...not as rich as jojoba oil...</li>
            <li>Really this is a nice oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to not clog pores but still soften and smooth .</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin so smooth all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: Great product that delivers, will definitely buy again.nd it offensive at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: Great product that delivers, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>With prime, shipping is free.</li>
            <li>I buy this brand precisely because it has no added perfumes.</li>
            <li>very nice lux ooil that I add as a extra bonus in some of my beauty products</li>
            <li>i used it straight on my face and it was pretty good</li>
            <li>Sad over this because I have purchased great products from Life-Flo before, like their rosehip oil which was great.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day, just when I am more dry than normal  after being in the suWorks better after a warm showe, it seems to absorb better.</li>
            <li>Will tell my friends about it and such a good price.</li>
            <li>So far the oil has been nice.  </li>
            <li>no bad smells.</li>
            <li>would think, something pure as oil, would have a natural pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>It has no scent and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin so supple that I can see wrinkles not forming as quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It absolved fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It does go away quickly, so I would just go ahead and try it.</li>

            <li>At first I thought they had accidentally sent me spoiled bottle, but the expiration date was well from now!</li>
            <li>I bought this oil to use as a carrier oil for my essential oils when I make my own blends.</li>
            <li>so I have to hold up to the light to make sure I keep an eye on when its getting low.</li>
            <li>(companies rarely bother to claim that theirs is sustainable anymore, as that has sort of been debunked; I&#x27;ll be looking for a substitute).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different type of floral, but personally I kind of like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different type of floral, but personally I kind of like it.</li>
            <li>love this oil, I mix it with my Vit E oil and put it in a pump use it every night before bed my hands are soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>Again, I guess I have the more sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>It was neither dry nor oily, but felt more elastic, and it even seemed like some of the fine lines around my eyes where disappearing.</li>
            <li>To see if I like a product, I like to use it for a week then use my previous product for a week for good comparison.</li>
            <li>this is my first time trying kukui nut oil of and brand</li>
            <li>if you are really wanting kukui oil just try it and find out for yourself if its worth it.</li>
            <li>but when I bought some pure kukui oil from a different company, I found that it was 10x better.</li>
            <li>I love this product I use it everyday, it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>(it required a heavy dose of powder, though, to keep the eye makeup from running), but for best results I waited about 30+ minutes and didn&#x27;t see any more makeup smudging than my old products (which isn&#x27;t to say there is no smudging, just not more).</li>
            <li>I like every other woman my age am looking for the latest exotic oil which will turn back the clock.</li>
            <li>I saw results after the first night but after the second night I was smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I used it to clear a skin issue and it worked quickly.</li>
            <li>so I have really dry skin that does not fully respond to lotions and creams, which are mostly water.</li>
            <li>It was a nice glass bottle with a tight-fitting lid, so I feel like if I travelled with it, it would not make a mess of my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really* wanted to</li>
            <li>/&gt;Kukui oil has the smallest molecular size of any oil, so it absorbs into the skin really well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much and 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Have not seen any real difference with my skin or hair since I&#x27;ve been using it on my body/hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the product  </li>
            <li>Very greasy</li>
            <li>, I liked it equally well alone or mixed with avocado oil.</li>
            <li>Short and sweet...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Havent got to use it as much as I plan, but I do like it so far.</li>
            <li>I do think the bottle could use a drop spout top to avoid waste.</li>
            <li>The oil is thick and rich, a little goes a long way, , very nice. ..</li>
            <li>Could not due without it!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have a sensitive sniffer and this is offensive to me.  </li>
            <li>This is an incredibly delicate, silky oil, which I totally love.</li>
            <li>Mature skin persons may wish to add lavender, palmarosa, frankincense, carrot seed, etc.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted something that would stop future damage.</li>
            <li>I have an autoimmune disease that zaps my ability to make natural skin oils</li>
            <li>I kept it, thinking it&#x27;s just my sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>This oil will make your skin so soft and your feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s main purpose is to prevent future wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I smooth a few drops of this alone on my face at night for two nights and the next thing I knew</li>
            <li>With the addition of just the right essential oils (at 0.5%-1% concentration, so a mere 2-5 drops per ounce), kukui easily adjusts to mature or oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I used avocado oil in the morning with the kukui oil because it naturally has SPF, and it&#x27;s equally lightweight and nourishing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure it would work well if I actually used it, but to be honest, I simply cannot get passed the horrible smell!!!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>It looks this good?&amp;#34; and that feeling didn&#x27;t rub off until I switched back to my old products (day and night creams for dry skin).</li>
            <li>It smells a little fishy but does really improve my skin&#x27;s appearance and texture.</li>

            <li> The oil is thick and rich, a little goes a long way, , very nice. ..</li>
            <li> Could not due without it!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have a sensitive sniffer and this is offensive to me.  </li>
            <li> This is an incredibly delicate, silky oil, which I totally love.</li>
            <li> Mature skin persons may wish to add lavender, palmarosa, frankincense, carrot seed, etc.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted something that would stop future damage.</li>
            <li> I have an autoimmune disease that zaps my ability to make natural skin oils</li>
            <li> I kept it, thinking it&#x27;s just my sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> This oil will make your skin so soft and your feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s main purpose is to prevent future wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I smooth a few drops of this alone on my face at night for two nights and the next thing I knew</li>
            <li> With the addition of just the right essential oils (at 0.5%-1% concentration, so a mere 2-5 drops per ounce), kukui easily adjusts to mature or oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I used avocado oil in the morning with the kukui oil because it naturally has SPF, and it&#x27;s equally lightweight and nourishing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it would work well if I actually used it, but to be honest, I simply cannot get passed the horrible smell!!!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> It looks this good?&amp;#34; and that feeling didn&#x27;t rub off until I switched back to my old products (day and night creams for dry skin).</li>
            <li> It smells a little fishy but does really improve my skin&#x27;s appearance and texture.</li>
            <li> It has a slight nutty smell, not sweet but definitely not unpleasant .</li>
            <li> I am a 20-something with fairly dry skin (even in the summer months) with occasional acne.</li>
            <li> Mixed with other oils for a pre-shave.</li>

            <li> As far as past wrinkles.....</li>
            <li> and then i mixed it with raw coco nut oil, coco butter and a few essential oils (heating them just enough to melt</li>
            <li> It evened out the spots that threatened to get dark from the dry patches and my skin glows.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is increasingly hard to find truly ethical rosewood essential oil as it has simply been over-harvested</li>
            <li> I keep it in the fridge since it seems to have a shorter shelf-life than some of the other oils.  </li>
            <li> It has not real scent I can detect or anyone else, the bottle is dark</li>
            <li> The other 60% don&#x27;t smell anything.</li>

            <li> so very little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good, but it wasn&#x27;t awful.</li>
            <li> so i dont break them down.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this product previously.  </li>
            <li> the dry patches were gone, my face didn&#x27;t have that dull look to it and</li>
            <li> It smells a little like rosehip oil if you&#x27;ve ever smelled that.</li>
            <li> I gave up on coconut oil because it just took hours for it to absorb all the way, and meanwhile any hair that touched my face would just get greasy and messy and</li>
            <li> Note that some essential oils can be irritating to the skin</li>
            <li> Someone complained about the smell, i dont think they know what vitamin e smells like kukui does not really smell like anything.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It has very little scent</li>
            <li> Once in a while I will mix with my moisturizer for daytime use but usually at night is all I need.  </li>
            <li> I have been experiencing very dry skin and dry patches from this brutal winter</li>
            <li> but it no great shakes.</li>
            <li> This kook oil even contains a small percentage of preservative, so i am sad it smells rancid and bad even though it contains preservative.</li>

            <li> ) Sorry life-flo, if this</li>
            <li> I use i in desperate times of sunburns or if a friend needs it for exzima.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that my skin was bad, it just wasn&#x27;t ...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with purchase.</li>
            <li> packaging, but a horrible smell of Kukui oil!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s awful smelling...</li>
            <li> This product Smells horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really this is a nice oil. It has no scent and absorbs quickly into the skin. The bottle is only 4 oz. Wish it was bigger.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Havent got to use it as much as I plan, but I do like it so far.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I was concerned that it would have a smell but it doesn&#x27;t. Will tell my friends about it and such a good price. Happy</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE oil out of all of them. Wish I could find *Organic* Kukui Nut Oil in bulk</li>
            <li> Mixed with other oils for a pre-shave. Hard to tell individual characteristics.</li>
            <li> The oil is thick and rich, a little goes a long way, , very nice. ..</li>
            <li> Short and sweet...&lt;br /&gt;Pretty packaging, but a horrible smell of Kukui oil!&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on this product and its effectiveness with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it would work well if I actually used it, but to be honest, I simply cannot get passed the horrible smell!!!&lt;br /&gt;One would think, something pure as oil, would have a natural pleasant scent.  Not Kukui Oil- I&#x27;ve had my patients even smell it, and not one would agree to allow me to use it with them.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could return it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my Vitamin E oil!&lt;br /&gt;~lin</li>
            <li> It smells like cod liver oil.  My mom just purchased this and it&#x27;s awful smelling... I don&#x27;t even have a sensitive sniffer and this is offensive to me.  Do not buy if you plan to go in public and use this as a moisturizer. Yuck</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff, apply after you shave and your legs will be so smooth.</li>
            <li> This is an incredibly delicate, silky oil, which I totally love. I keep it in the fridge since it seems to have a shorter shelf-life than some of the other oils.  Love adding it to my concoctions.</li>
            <li> smells rancid.  Sad over this because I have purchased great products from Life-Flo before, like their rosehip oil which was great.  This kook oil even contains a small percentage of preservative, so i am sad it smells rancid and bad even though it contains preservative.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to use as a carrier oil for my essential oils when I make my own blends. It has very little scent and I like any product made in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I had not tried this oil before but heard very good reviews about it&#x27;s ability to nourish the skin. It smells a little fishy but does really improve my skin&#x27;s appearance and texture. The four oz bottle will last for months. I use it on my face at night because it is a bit oily.</li>
            <li> Others complained about the smell, but I didn&#x27;t think it was bad. It doesn&#x27;t smell good, but it wasn&#x27;t awful. And the smell seemed to dissipate after a while. I don&#x27;t use it every day, just when I am more dry than normal  after being in the suWorks better after a warm showe, it seems to absorb better.</li>
            <li> Looooove this stuff.  I have been experiencing very dry skin and dry patches from this brutal winter (that seems never ending).  I smooth a few drops of this alone on my face at night for two nights and the next thing I knew the dry patches were gone, my face didn&#x27;t have that dull look to it and my pores were smaller.  It evened out the spots that threatened to get dark from the dry patches and my skin glows.  I saw results after the first night but after the second night I was smooth and hydrated.  This is going to be a staple for me.  Once in a while I will mix with my moisturizer for daytime use but usually at night is all I need.  The oil is light weight and very potent so very little goes a long way.  It has not real scent I can detect or anyone else, the bottle is dark so I have to hold up to the light to make sure I keep an eye on when its getting low.</li>
            <li> So far the oil has been nice.  There is no smell to it. Unsure if it is doing any wonders on my skin so I guess I will have to use it longer to see any results.</li>
            <li> Could not due without it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it every night as a moisturizer, I put it on and go to sleep and it&#x27;s gone by morning. It&#x27;s also very effective for sunburn, which is how I first learned about it. And it&#x27;s a good makeup remover. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this product previously.  It is not a cure for psoriasis, nor can I say that it stopped the itching, but I do believe it is probably safe to use; it has not burned or seemed to have caused more itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would keep it away from my eyes, as it is too burning when it gets in your eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased kukui oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and sometimes my hair.  I find that it is one of the best oils for balancing combination skin.  With the addition of just the right essential oils (at 0.5%-1% concentration, so a mere 2-5 drops per ounce), kukui easily adjusts to mature or oily skin.  I will say that I notice the vitamin e in this brand.  That is both a pro and a con.  Vitamin e is, of course, wonderful for the skin and helps preserve the oil (although I still keep in the fridge) but does feel heavier.  I might blend in some camellia oil next time I am making up a face serum with it.  That said, I expect this is the brand I will continue to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per my statement that essential oils help the kukui adjust to all skin types: Oily persons may wish to add lemon, plai or tea tree, and juniper.  Rosewood is wonderful for combination skin--or for any skin type for that matter; however it is especially effective at balancing the skin.  Unfortunately it is increasingly hard to find truly ethical rosewood essential oil as it has simply been over-harvested (companies rarely bother to claim that theirs is sustainable anymore, as that has sort of been debunked; I&#x27;ll be looking for a substitute).  Lavender is great for any skin type. Mature skin persons may wish to add lavender, palmarosa, frankincense, carrot seed, etc.  Sea buckthorn CO2 extract is an invaluable addition.  HTH!</li>
            <li> I love this product I use it everyday, it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying kukui nut oil of and brand and I&#x27;m really pleased !! It has a slight nutty smell, not sweet but definitely not unpleasant . It smells a little like rosehip oil if you&#x27;ve ever smelled that. Seems lightweight too. I bought this to use on my face . It&#x27;s supposed to not clog pores but still soften and smooth . So far so good! I recommend this for sure!</li>
            <li> It smells nice and has done wonders for my skin. I used it to clear a skin issue and it worked quickly. I also use it as an after shower oil and it keeps my skin so smooth all day.</li>
            <li> I think after using this product - it&#x27;s main purpose is to prevent future wrinkles.  It makes the skin so supple that I can see wrinkles not forming as quickly.  As far as past wrinkles.....maybe some repair, but no overnight miracles.  I still like this and give it 5 stars.  I really wanted something that would stop future damage.</li>
            <li> I am a 20-something with fairly dry skin (even in the summer months) with occasional acne. To see if I like a product, I like to use it for a week then use my previous product for a week for good comparison. The weeks I used this kukui oil as a replacement for my face lotions I had some of my best skin. It was neither dry nor oily, but felt more elastic, and it even seemed like some of the fine lines around my eyes where disappearing. I would look at my skin in the morning and go, &amp;#34;Seriously? It looks this good?&amp;#34; and that feeling didn&#x27;t rub off until I switched back to my old products (day and night creams for dry skin). It wasn&#x27;t that my skin was bad, it just wasn&#x27;t ... great, like it was with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a replacement for a night cream, I liked it equally well alone or mixed with avocado oil. I used avocado oil in the morning with the kukui oil because it naturally has SPF, and it&#x27;s equally lightweight and nourishing. (4/5 review about to go up for NOW Foods http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B007XA49O8/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absolved fairly quickly. I *could* put makeup on immediately afterwords if I *really* wanted to (it required a heavy dose of powder, though, to keep the eye makeup from running), but for best results I waited about 30+ minutes and didn&#x27;t see any more makeup smudging than my old products (which isn&#x27;t to say there is no smudging, just not more). Compared to coconut oil, it&#x27;s literally 1,000x better in this regard. I gave up on coconut oil because it just took hours for it to absorb all the way, and meanwhile any hair that touched my face would just get greasy and messy and oh my god coconut oil is the most overrated product ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really liked the bottle that it came in. It was a nice glass bottle with a tight-fitting lid, so I feel like if I travelled with it, it would not make a mess of my luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people commented on its smell. I personally don&#x27;t find it offensive at all. It&#x27;s a different type of floral, but personally I kind of like it. It does go away quickly, so I would just go ahead and try it. Even if it smelled like garbage, I would still use it anyway because it really is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Great product that delivers, will definitely buy again.nd it offensive at all.

            <li> I have an autoimmune disease that zaps my ability to make natural skin oils so I have really dry skin that does not fully respond to lotions and creams, which are mostly water. I discovered kukui nut oil in Hawai&#x27;i. The popular tourist brand worked pretty well but when I bought some pure kukui oil from a different company, I found that it was 10x better. I now buy my kukui oil from Amazon.com and this is a good brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kukui oil has the smallest molecular size of any oil, so it absorbs into the skin really well. It doesn&#x27;t take much and 4 oz. bottle lasts for 1-2 months. It is hypoallergenic. (I often add a few drops of an essential oil for a little fragrance. Note that some essential oils can be irritating to the skin so do some research before adding any oil to any type of skin product.)</li>
            <li> love this oil, I mix it with my Vit E oil and put it in a pump use it every night before bed my hands are soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any real difference with my skin or hair since I&#x27;ve been using it on my body/hair.</li>
            <li> My skin and scalp have improved immensely since using this oil. It is not greasy. I will share the benefits of using this oil with family and friends.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED! Awesome stuff I will be reordering soon!!</li>
            <li> Someone complained about the smell, i dont think they know what vitamin e smells like kukui does not really smell like anything. i used it straight on my face and it was pretty good and then i mixed it with raw coco nut oil, coco butter and a few essential oils (heating them just enough to melt so i dont break them down.) and it makes i really nice face cream  no bad smells. for organic kukui oil you cant beat this price. if you are really wanting kukui oil just try it and find out for yourself if its worth it.</li>
            <li> Very mild on the skin...not as rich as jojoba oil...i love adding drops of these to my baths!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with purchase. Smells like cod liver fish oil, Cannot use it because of smell.</li>
            <li> Loved it...bought three more. I use it daily and bought some for a friend. She was over the top happy with it. I do think the bottle could use a drop spout top to avoid waste.</li>
            <li> This oil is a good quality oil. The price is a good price for this Kukui oil. I shopped around before purchasing and couldn&#x27;t find a better deal. With prime, shipping is free. This arrived quickly and is a described.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Joyful Girl Naturals</li>
            <li> I love kakui nut oil!! Even though the oil works perfect; the bottle I got was a little off smell. At first I thought they had accidentally sent me spoiled bottle, but the expiration date was well from now! I kept it, thinking it&#x27;s just my sensitive nose. I use i in desperate times of sunburns or if a friend needs it for exzima. I&#x27;m actually about the 40% that smells it out of all of us. The other 60% don&#x27;t smell anything. Again, I guess I have the more sensitive nose. Works as it should though, so the product is good in that:) Sorry life-flo, if this whatnot&#x27;s your ratings; but as good as the product may be, I&#x27;ll go elsewhere for my refill because of the smell of mine. But everyone else..., it still does work as well as it should!</li>
            <li> Interesting oil, but the smell is questionable. I use it with several other oils 2 X daily. I think it has some healing property but it no great shakes. I like every other woman my age am looking for the latest exotic oil which will turn back the clock. This isn&#x27;t it, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt either</li>
            <li> Great product, i&#x27;m new to this product, but so far I&#x27;m loving it!......great on the skin and scalp!</li>
            <li> This oil will make your skin so soft and your feet.&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I would like to use it more often.</li>
            <li> I really like the product  - it&#x27;s great for every part and is not greasy overly perfumed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product -</li>
            <li> This product Smells horrible! I Can&#x27;t even use it in any of my lotions bc the smell is so awful. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> very nice lux ooil that I add as a extra bonus in some of my beauty products</li>
            <li> Looooove this oil! Makes my face and body skin glow. Not oily at all. It absorbs into your skin quickly and feels nice and light. I know a lot of celebs use this oil as well</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Very greasy</li>
            <li> This is making a difference on my face wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Prevents sunburn in my case and good oil  for after being in the sun. I have ordered this now for the second time!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer and after-sun conditioner for both men and women. That&#x27;s how the Hawaiians have always used it and where the kukui nut originates. I buy this brand precisely because it has no added perfumes. The smell, which is not bad at all in my opinion but very natural, dissipates quickly, so it is excellent for those who don&#x27;t want carry around an aroma.</li>
            <li> Used it and loved it , great price and fast delivery . Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Highly recommend</li>
