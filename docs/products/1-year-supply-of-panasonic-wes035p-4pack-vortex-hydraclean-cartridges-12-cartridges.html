    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>These are perfect and having then on hand is great.</li>
            <li>they work good too !</li>
            <li>A great complement to the Panasonic shaver system indeed.</li>
            <li>A pleasant smelling cleanser impregnated in some sort of fiber weave that traps particulates and filters them before returning the soap water to the razor.</li>
            <li>Easy to change and always having one on hand is perfect.</li>
            <li>Good for 1 month.</li>
            <li>These cartridges do a fairly good job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the shaver and cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li>Handy.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if Panasonic came out with a lemon scented cartridge though.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly works great , love the deal when u buy this quantity !</li>
            <li>They get it out right away, and at a great price.</li>
            <li>I love it.   </li>
            <li>Also priced better than my Braun system cartridges.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the product, especially since it is not trying to bankrupt you!</li>
            <li>As a magician, I can do magic, but not miracles.</li>
            <li>[update:  getting more time out of them, more like 27 days.  </li>
            <li>These are very much worth the cost!!</li>
            <li>Great product / refill to keep your shaver running like new.  </li>
            <li>Plus they need to be changed monthly, but are relatively cheap to replace and this 1-year supply package makes great economic sense and is convenient.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer the cleaning system on the Braun machines, seems more complete and smells wonderfully lemony fresh, but I like the Panasonic shaver better, so you use what you have.</li>
            <li>She said it is just the status light.</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s shaver (please see my review of the Panasonic ES-LV81 for that information) is not only superior, the cleaning system is better as well.</li>
            <li>SO FAR THE PRODUCT GIVES A VERY CLOSE SHAVE, WORKS GREAT USING IT IN OR OUT OF THE SHOWER</li>
            <li>This results in a better clean, a more complete clean.</li>
            <li>I was a user of a shaver (made by a certain German company) for many years and was very pleased with their product.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t beat the price, and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Normally that is okay, as I can leave it alone, but when I want to take it with me or pack it away to go somewhere</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy finding these locally and was very glad could get these at such a great price-thanks!</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>There is a red light on the receptacle titled &amp;#34;Status.&amp;#34; All the booklet tells me is that this is the status light.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what its supposed to - great value if you use your shaver regularly and keep it clean and sharp.</li>
            <li>They clean the shaver well, and capture all the beard cuttings, but I only get 3 weeks of use before the \\&quot;status\\&quot; light comes on and locks-out the cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve only been able to get from thirteen to fifteen cleanings per cartridge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more when I need them in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They will probably last more than a year.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was needed.  </li>
            <li>until now these do exactly what they are meant to do.</li>
            <li>I use this good product everyday.</li>
            <li>Cleans razor really well.</li>
            <li>AND THE SHIPPING WAS FAST</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s still no way I could ever have one cartridge last for one month if I were to clean it once a day as they recommend.</li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced, perform as  indicated, and are high quality.</li>
            <li>Keeps shaver like new!</li>
            <li>The product cleans the razor very well, but it takes about 1 1/2 hours to clean and dry.  </li>
            <li>Price is too high.  </li>
            <li>next problem is the the blue light that shines from the razor when it is in the receptacle keeps us up at night.</li>
            <li>The alcohol-based solution never really dried completely between shaves and that alcohol smell could, on occasion, be off-putting.</li>
            <li>It also smells better and the drying system in the shaver cradle works terrifically with the cleanser to dry and leave a faint, pleasant, mild, non-alcohol scent behind.</li>
            <li>For once, I believe you get your monies worth from these cleaning cartridges(unlike other brands).</li>
            <li>Lasts long and cleans the razor very well.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t hard to clean their shavers but you had to invest a little effort to \\&quot;really\\&quot; clean them.</li>
            <li>Small and more convenient than those of other brands.  </li>
            <li>Other brands are costly to the point that they cost more than the shaver after a few months(something like printer cartridges) !!</li>
            <li>The cost is about half of what the dept store wants</li>
            <li>The cartridges are so small they take up very little room under your sink and are inert and safe to store.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Got here quickly works great , love the deal when u buy this quantity ! Also got replacement blade &amp; foil they work good too !</li>
            <li> Shipped and received as stated.</li>
            <li> Great product / refill to keep your shaver running like new.  I actually prefer the cleaning system on the Braun machines, seems more complete and smells wonderfully lemony fresh, but I like the Panasonic shaver better, so you use what you have.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Cleans razor really well. Handy. Good for 1 month. I love it.   Scott</li>
            <li> SO FAR THE PRODUCT GIVES A VERY CLOSE SHAVE, WORKS GREAT USING IT IN OR OUT OF THE SHOWER AND THE SHIPPING WAS FAST AS WELL.</li>
            <li> Price is too high.  If I had purchased as 3 months item I would pay. $39.96 for four boxes of 3 cartridges; but instead I paid $46.07 for the same.  Can a credit be made?  Ron Deering</li>
            <li> I only wish that the film weren&#x27;t so fragile, but I guess they wouldn&#x27;t work as well if they were thicker.</li>
            <li> Works like it say it does. Lasts long and cleans the razor very well. These are very much worth the cost!!</li>
            <li> Small and more convenient than those of other brands.  Also priced better than my Braun system cartridges.  Cleans the shaver just like it is supposed to.  And, since I receive shipments in Mexico, the small size really is a plus.  Would be nice if Panasonic came out with a lemon scented cartridge though.</li>
            <li> These are perfect and having then on hand is great. Easy to change and always having one on hand is perfect. The cost is about half of what the dept store wants</li>
            <li> I use this good product everyday. Thanks</li>
            <li> My husband likes the package bundle values getting them this way! They serve the purpose for what he needs them for</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before. They get it out right away, and at a great price. This says it all.</li>
            <li> For once, I believe you get your monies worth from these cleaning cartridges(unlike other brands). They are reasonably priced, perform as  indicated, and are high quality. Very happy with the product, especially since it is not trying to bankrupt you! Other brands are costly to the point that they cost more than the shaver after a few months(something like printer cartridges) !! Very pleased with the shaver and cleaning cartridges.</li>
            <li> Continue to keep my razor up to par!</li>
            <li> The product cleans the razor very well, but it takes about 1 1/2 hours to clean and dry.  Normally that is okay, as I can leave it alone, but when I want to take it with me or pack it away to go somewhere that amount of time is too long.</li>
            <li> These cartridges do a fairly good job of cleaning.  Mine leave a bit of a musty smell at times and don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> The product works well, but I&#x27;d have to say that advertising each cartridge as lasting for one month is a bit off. I&#x27;ve gone through cartridges like crazy. They recommend cleaning it every day but I tried to make it last longer than one per month by cleaning it every other day. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve only been able to get from thirteen to fifteen cleanings per cartridge. That makes it even more expensive if you&#x27;re talking a years&#x27; supply. In other words, I&#x27;m going to run out way before a year is up and that&#x27;s using it half the time. Hmmm! I may have to re-think about re-ordering when this \\&quot;years&#x27; supply\\&quot; of carts runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 7/17/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did wind up ordering another year&#x27;s supply. I like the product but the only way I can get the twelve cartridges to last a year is by only cleaning the razor once every three or four days. There&#x27;s still no way I could ever have one cartridge last for one month if I were to clean it once a day as they recommend. As a magician, I can do magic, but not miracles.</li>
            <li> I was a user of a shaver (made by a certain German company) for many years and was very pleased with their product. When they introduced their cleaning system it was terrific. It wasn&#x27;t hard to clean their shavers but you had to invest a little effort to \\&quot;really\\&quot; clean them. The only problem I had with the self-cleaning system was the cleaning solution and cartridges. The alcohol-based solution never really dried completely between shaves and that alcohol smell could, on occasion, be off-putting. Additionally the cost of cartridges and the frequency of changing them could get a bit pricy/onerous if you cleaned the razor daily (which I did).&lt;br /&gt;  Panasonic&#x27;s shaver (please see my review of the Panasonic ES-LV81 for that information) is not only superior, the cleaning system is better as well. The cartridges are dry. A pleasant smelling cleanser impregnated in some sort of fiber weave that traps particulates and filters them before returning the soap water to the razor. This results in a better clean, a more complete clean. It also smells better and the drying system in the shaver cradle works terrifically with the cleanser to dry and leave a faint, pleasant, mild, non-alcohol scent behind. Plus they need to be changed monthly, but are relatively cheap to replace and this 1-year supply package makes great economic sense and is convenient. The cartridges are so small they take up very little room under your sink and are inert and safe to store.&lt;br /&gt;  A great complement to the Panasonic shaver system indeed.</li>
            <li> Keeps shaver like new!</li>
            <li> [update:  getting more time out of them, more like 27 days.  Added a star.] They clean the shaver well, and capture all the beard cuttings, but I only get 3 weeks of use before the \\&quot;status\\&quot; light comes on and locks-out the cleaner.  I have a med-thick beard, I think.  I extend the change interval by manually cleaning the shaver on weekends, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that, right?  Stop touting intervals of \\&quot;about a month\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Purchased these replacement cleaning cartridges for my Panasonic razor at same time that I purchased the Panasonic razor. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price, and delivery was quick. Thanks. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more when I need them in the future.</li>
            <li> There are some small problems. There is a red light on the receptacle titled &amp;#34;Status.&amp;#34; All the booklet tells me is that this is the status light. I called Panasonic to ask and the girl told me &amp;#34;that is the status light.&amp;#34; I asked her, status of what. She said it is just the status light. I asked  to talk to her supervisor and she said she didn&#x27;t have one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next problem is the the blue light that shines from the razor when it is in the receptacle keeps us up at night. I tried turning it to the wall, but the reflection off the wall made it even worse.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend. These cartridges will save a lot of money over the Braun cleaning cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;They will probably last more than a year.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed.  It&#x27;s not easy finding these locally and was very glad could get these at such a great price-thanks!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its supposed to - great value if you use your shaver regularly and keep it clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my ES-La93K Panasonic shaver&lt;br /&gt;and until now these do exactly what they are meant to do.</li>
