    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>If using it before make up application, use a lightweight moisturizer at best underneath because you already have oil control since you&#x27;ve used the prodcut.</li>
            <li>and she a butter are wonderful.</li>
            <li>Wonderful</li>

            <li>Now for those of us who do have oily skin, its a great product for controlling oil.</li>
            <li>It has a powder inside of the toner, so it works great for an oily complexion.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product after I had heard a lot of great things about using tea tree for your skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, but my acne did not heal quicker.</li>

            <li>All-in-all, I absolutely am in love with this toner, I will be repurchasing and recommending!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Most of the time my skin looks flawless.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant scent to it and it doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin</li>
            <li>The products for your face are good and the body wash cocoa butter</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of this.</li>
            <li>and my dermatologist recommended a good toner.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already noticed a good difference on my skin..</li>
            <li>And also, the scent is so good.</li>
            <li>It dries out your face, but if you use moisturizer after it creates a good mixture.</li>
            <li>but I combined with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use a cotton square to apply this and my face feels so good after.</li>
            <li>I continued to use it, wanting to give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to go all psycho on me every time there&#x27;s a significant weather change, and I have an ongoing battle with clogged pores/blackheads, but this toner is awesome!</li>
            <li>Very refreshing toner with good results.</li>
            <li>I am very confident recommending this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing and tingly.  </li>
            <li>The best thing to even happen to my face worth the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;cant submit without more words-even when there is nothing more to say!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this company !</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and love it!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li>I love just about anything with tea tree in it and this product is no exception!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice matt finish on your skin after using, doesn&#x27;t burn, and did wonders for clearing up blemishes.</li>
            <li>It has this nice soothing, tingling sensation after wiping my face with a cotten square pad.</li>
            <li>Excellent and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Good thing it was cheap!</li>
            <li>It is nice.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell though.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin tone look really nice.</li>
            <li>She ended up tossing it after two months and switched to Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Which Hazel alcohol-free toner.</li>
            <li>i am so in love with this great facial toner the best there is&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also reduces acne breakouts by about 90% and is way more effective than over the counter acne medications.</li>
            <li>This product does tend to dry out skin a bit, so it is best to use this product in tandem with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I make sure I&#x27;m stocked up on this stuff at all times, and being able to subscribe makes the price even better!</li>
            <li>The scent is strong !</li>
            <li>The product does smell great, and is great for a traditional toner, but not for a &#x27;skin clearing&#x27; toner.</li>
            <li>It is more suitable for oily skin type .</li>
            <li>Since i already put a lot on my face to prevent and treat breakouts, this is a  PERFECT product to add to my skin regimen that does not dry out my skin or sting when I put on.  </li>
            <li>However, it is very refreshing and my skin feels clean after using.</li>
            <li>I added this toner into my care routine and see a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m probably satisfied with the results</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I use this just before the lotion, and love the combination of the two.</li>
            <li>Probably would work better for someone with oil skin.</li>
            <li>It definitely should say something about not using more than twice a day and to pair it with a tea trea oil wash for best results.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of the tea tree also..  </li>
            <li>It also helps that he is drinking more water &amp; staying away from sugary drinks.  </li>
            <li>I love this toner</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay is all I can say about this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you shake well before using it so that you can mix it up.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my pores look better, so it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m okay now used to with it.</li>
            <li>You will get more confidence while working.</li>
            <li>My skin has been doing a lot better since I&#x27;ve started using this toner.</li>
            <li>I love the Body Shop products.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and recommend it for anyone who wants to combat acne and oily-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I love this clearing toner.</li>
            <li>For some reason I just love the smell of this toner..</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, when i start to break out</li>
            <li>I found this toner on Amazon and absolutely love it..</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love the toner, the moisturizer, and the scrub.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toner.</li>
            <li>This skin clearing toner is awesome, it has calmed the red bumpy blemishes on my cheeks and minimized the size of my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you like tea tree shampoo or anything, you will love this.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to mix it up well before applying it.</li>
            <li>but this is safe to use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toner</li>
            <li>is important, people!</li>
            <li>I have used The Body Shop products for many years.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>I have been using this toner for 3 or more weeks now</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>but I think it just made me break out more.</li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>not the first time, good</li>
            <li>For this price, it is worth the try!!</li>
            <li>i actually love this stuff, but stay away if you don&#x27;t like a strong tingly sensation.</li>
            <li>The Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, I find it very refreshing and love the tingly (some may say burning) sensation that lasts for the first 5 seconds after putting on the product.</li>
            <li>This is ideal for people who have moderately to severely oily skin.</li>
            <li>I loved how my face didn&#x27;t shine as much after using this.</li>
            <li>thank you so much this product is so great, it leaves my face feeling so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>of course, anyone who knows tea Tree, knows it has a strong smell</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t smelled tea tree oil and not a fan of strong smells, I wouldn&#x27;t get this toner.</li>
            <li>This one is strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>Strong product</li>
            <li>and now my skin is fine.</li>
            <li>I love that the face wash and the rest of the line has done away with my breakouts and evened my skin tone out so quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost certain there is mild lemon in the product, which is good for lightening scars/</li>
            <li>It does not break me out, cleans better than the lush toner, calms the redness, and it is also a better price!</li>
            <li>But overall this product did help clear my skin up which is awesome :)</li>
            <li>only give it four stars because the bottle/packaging doesn&#x27;t come with great instructions.</li>
            <li>Great for a daily cleanser...</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t see too much about the product but for my own mistake</li>
            <li>I love the fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>You just have to get use the the smell...but overall its great.</li>
            <li>i dont use the wash with it, but as a toner itself, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>This toner has a great scent but it requires a lot of shaking prior to each use.  </li>
            <li>Its a great disinfectant; wound cleaner and overall skin cleaner.  </li>
            <li>But this is a really good product for sensitive skin people like me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve known tea tree oil is good for sensitive skin and has antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li>which is pretty hardcore if i say so myself, but this product did absolutely nothing good for my skin, except made it smell strongly of tea tree fragrance and stripped it of all its moisture.</li>
            <li>very harbal-ish smell, great product, leaves my skin very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Definitely gets the job done, smells great, and helps give me the peace of mind that my skin is definitely clean...</li>
            <li>: Immediately noticed an increase in breakouts, particularly along my forehead, an area I haven&#x27;t had acne issues with in many, many months.</li>
            <li>Feel Fresh and cool after use :)</li>
            <li>My breakouts have reduced significantly since I started using it.</li>
            <li>Right after using this product your skin just feels clean!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The product seems pretty good, but I could never use this more than one day at a time due to the strong smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but when I combine this with the rest of my regimen, it has done a good job of keeping my skin pretty clear.</li>
            <li>I simply use a mattifying pomegranite (which is good for oil control) primer on my t-zone</li>
            <li>My skin feels super clean after I wash it and use this.  </li>
            <li>Great product, natural way to clean and clear your face.</li>
            <li>I just started using this toner, but it feels so fresh and clean when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>If you can get past the smell then it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>I got the quickest non-automated response and found out the problem quickly.</li>
            <li>i love this product this is ten times better than any harsh&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has made a tremendous difference for her.</li>
            <li>It has a sediment that settles quickly after shaken then has to be shaken again.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I use from the Body Shop -- and it is exactly what I want in a toner -- cool and refreshing both to start the day, or at the end before bed!</li>
            <li>It helps my skin more clear and reduces acne.</li>
            <li>Effective and the tea tree scent is present.</li>
            <li>It smells and feels really fresh.</li>
            <li>It can be very quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>However, the toner helped to clear my face as well as provide a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>When I started using this in my evening routine, I noticed a difference almost right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell, but served the purpose for my teenage step-daughter&#x27;s acne issues.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a nice and fresh feel without making my skin dry.  </li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s my first toner, I can immediately tell how fresh it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>It helps with blemishes only midly, but used in combination with the face scrub, it is greatly improved.</li>
            <li>feels really good on my skin, slight tingle.</li>
            <li>; Tea tree oil does have a strong natural odor</li>
            <li>I use it daily and enjoy the scent and how clean it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Several of them are full of powerful ingredients that are designed to leave your skin feeling completely fresh and clean and ready to absorb any serum and moisturizer you choose to apply.  </li>
            <li>First off, tea tree oil is not for everyone.</li>
            <li>My son has been using this product along with the facial wash for about two weeks &amp; his acne does appear to be much better.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>i like the smell and it works pretty well, looking forward to trying the seaweed cleansers, still having problems with oily skin</li>
            <li>This is actually my first product that I have ordered from the body shop.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a toner that felt refreshing only astringents did that.</li>
            <li>First bought a travel size kit with cleanser etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Acne Stress Control scrub but bought the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash after falling in love with this..</li>
            <li>I like it well enough to keep trying it until I find something better.</li>
            <li>but I will most likely not be buying this again.</li>
            <li>I have seen a noticeable difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>this is the first toner I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>It appears to be very old and didn&#x27;t clean my skin.  </li>
            <li>and my face usually never feels clean.</li>
            <li>The whole tea tree line from the Body Shop gets right in and cleans your pores, without causing any irritation at all.</li>
            <li>The price is perfect for how much you get, since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just saying it because other cosmetic put a lot of nice smell</li>
            <li>i was originally using it as a quick temporary replacement while i found something else, but i always came back to this product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t pinpoint chin blame on this product as that is my trouble zone, but forehead continues to blossom and more importantly, continued use of this &amp;#34;skin clearing&amp;#34</li>
            <li>smell is quite strong but did not particularly bother me, I found it dissipated rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Firstly it has to be shaken very well because of sediment at the bottom.</li>
            <li>I do love that this product doesn&#x27;t dry out your face while feeling refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>eSCAN with really large pores</li>
            <li>Keeps me from breaking out, and really tightens my pores and skin.  </li>
            <li>However, it really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Then you are ready to rock.</li>
            <li>It was drying and stung my whole face.</li>
            <li>Dries out skin if used too often but combats acne very well</li>
            <li>But this product feels very lightweight and even calming.</li>
            <li>so I just can&#x27;t wash my face this much.</li>
            <li>but I might have used too much as I never get that anymore.</li>
            <li>but I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>has really helped reduce outbreaks.</li>
            <li>This toner is intense.  </li>
            <li>This line has helped so much.  </li>
            <li>Arrive fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cooling and does what it&#x27;s supposed to without over drying my skin.</li>
            <li>This toner works really well.</li>
            <li>It is gentle but really works.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this toner!</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and leaves my face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily and very problematic, so if something does not work for my skin I will find out within a day or so.</li>
            <li>I had read many feedbacks on the body shop website carefully before I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>Disinfects gently.</li>
            <li>I have really oil</li>
            <li>This is an effective toner without being harsh.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;m not sure if this toner would work well for someone with more severe acne, as it may be too mild.</li>
            <li>The other day I woke up with a red patches on my face, and I tried treating them with Eucerin lotion (usually good at soothing reddened skin, but didn&#x27;t do much this time), and Prosacea (no effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>It was okay, I probably will not buy it again as I didn&#x27;t really notice that much of a difference with my skin one way or the other.</li>
            <li>i always break out the tea tree toner, and i clear right up in a day or two.</li>
            <li>It has more of the active ingredients in it than regular toners (which are primarily alcohol), and it helps to heal your skin instead of just disinfecting it.</li>
            <li>i love this toner, It seem to work very well with my other Desert Tea Tree face wash.</li>
            <li>Okay, so now I&#x27;m assuming this is what tea tree must do, not having used any other tea tree products before, despite all</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used enough of it to decide if I like it enough to buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I turned a few friends on to tea tree oil products and they love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more products from the body shop in the future!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different products in my life and have finally found something I will not change from.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations from this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for acne or oily skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I only had occasional acne to begin with, but this product has helped to prevent new acne from forming, and in combination with the lotion, my skin looks smoother and more evened out.</li>
            <li>so i shake it and the toner foams up a little at the top.</li>
            <li>clean well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry</li>
            <li>Even normal skin will experience drying and redness.</li>
            <li>At first, it definitely cleared up my skin, but now it doesn&#x27;t seem to do that much.</li>
            <li>First of all, my pimples cures apparently after I use it after one night.</li>
            <li>I kept using it thought and after a few weeks, my complexion does seem more even.</li>
            <li>Late-Twenties | Acne Prone | Normal (</li>
            <li>I like how the product feels on my face, it feels more like my face absorbs it over other toners I&#x27;ve used, but I really wish it came with a safety seal, the issue with no safety seal is that there is a small amount of yellowish/white material sitting at the bottom of the container, and I cannot fully enjoy the product not knowing if this is a bacteria</li>
            <li>all natural witch hazel is better, less astringent and foul.</li>
            <li>Luckily I have been around the block with tea tree oil and other facial products to be able to figure out proper usage.</li>
            <li>The first time, I assumed I hadn&#x27;t properly shook the ingredients together and was getting too much of something directly onto the skin</li>
            <li>New pimples recurring</li>
            <li>I had super dry skin for months</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shut down your oil glands (which is a good thing), but it turns them down.</li>
            <li>However, this light green liquid that contains the fresh scent of tea tree oil is leaps and bound above the competition.  </li>
            <li>This skin toner has continued to help me fight adult acne!  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 3 years now, and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I developed adult onset acne and now have very acne prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin still breaks out even though I&#x27;m decades past my teens, and I find this to be both clearing but also refreshing.  </li>
            <li>It did help my acne, but that&#x27;s because it removed the entire first layer of skin.</li>
            <li>and I had no idea what to do because I&#x27;m naturally combination/oily, after using this it went straight back to normal.</li>
            <li>I use it every night before using the Tea Tree Blemish Fade Night Lotion, and I have seen a significant difference in the amount of blemishes and dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>shaked the bottle for several minutes, but yet this odd sediment would not &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; into the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle came without a safety seal on it .....and was cracked on top.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this toner to anyone with occasional zits or mild acne.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a menthol type scent and a strong feel but does not leave skin feeling sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li>there is not a strong tea tree smell, very mild.</li>
            <li>only complaint I have is that I feel like there should be more to each bottle!</li>
            <li>Use it after you wash your face, this will help clear up acne in just a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin became irratated and didn&#x27;t clear anything up.</li>
            <li>smell is really dependant on your personal preference.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have no problems with it.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t really made my pores smaller, but it does help with shine.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with adult horomonal acne since I was taken off HRT.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it is natural leaf smell but</li>
            <li>but this one is just natural.</li>
            <li>In about 15 minutes they were nearly gone.</li>
            <li>I frequently suffer from oily acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, I was hesitant to use this product.  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, Using this toner in the morning before make up has totally helped absorb and control oil, and breakouts.</li>
            <li>my skin soft and not oily at all in 3 weeks &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin and helps keep my oily skin from getting out of control during the day.</li>
            <li>Before my skin changed, I was completely reliant on this line from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t consider myself a person who has sensitive skin -</li>
            <li>Did not work on my adult acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now &amp; really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural &amp; there is a bit of a moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Every time I use this it refreshes and completely takes the dirt out of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;Debra Anthony</li>
            <li>Olive Tone | Sensitive |</li>
            <li>I think that toners are meant to be used to restore your skin to its natural pH balance or something like that?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this product to who have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>that is all natural though.</li>
            <li>No other new products were used in this time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was previously using the lush tea tree toner and, when I ran out, I quickly wanted to find something that did the job but cheaper.</li>
            <li>Some people might get a little bit of tingling sensation near the eye area, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very dry, when I apply on my face, I feel hot like my face is burnt, I dont know does it have alcohol or not</li>
            <li>So far I love it, but be careful not to use it on days that you have exfoliated because it can be harsh on already sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really help my skin and dry up all the acne!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural guide line for your skin care is STEP BY STEP  1 facial foam ( make up remover / soft / scrub ..</li>
            <li>I will be going back to Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel as my primary toner and the Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner 1-2x/week for helping to slough off dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My problem area is the chin/mouth area and generally hormonal.&lt;br /&gt;Week 2</li>
            <li>When you use a cotton pad to wipe it across your face, you feel a slight tingling sensation that assures you it is working  deep into your skin to clean it and refresh it and prepare it for the next step in your skin care routine.  </li>
            <li>I still have to wash religiously to keep clear.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re going to add the face mask next and see if we can get her skin totally clear.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am allergic to a number of different ingredients often used in beaut products, but did not have a problem with this product.</li>
            <li>I started using this when i was a teenage year old boy.</li>
            <li>I wrote my every own address wrong.</li>
            <li>Consistent use with this and other products have resulted in smaller pores around my nose and chin.</li>
            <li>but after using about three bottles of this stuff, I&#x27;m ready to try other toners.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this product I was using Mario Badescu&#x27;s Glycolic Acid Toner &amp; Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel and prior to that Clean&amp;Clear Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li>The one thing that he does say about the toner is that it does have a little sting when first apply but after a couple of uses you get use to it.</li>
            <li>I felt a little burn sensation on first application</li>
            <li>have fairly sensitive combination skin (dry on the cheeks, but oily on the T-zone) and have to be weary of skin care products.</li>
            <li>The smell is not so good, in fact it smell bad.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> If using it before make up application, use a lightweight moisturizer at best underneath because you already have oil control since you&#x27;ve used the prodcut.</li>
            <li> and she a butter are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Wonderful</li>
            <li> , it is smelly since tea tree oil isn&#x27;t the best smelling.</li>
            <li> it cleans but it does not irritate my skin , body shop products are the best .</li>

            <li> What it also works great on is razor burns.  </li>
            <li> Now for those of us who do have oily skin, its a great product for controlling oil.</li>
            <li> It has a powder inside of the toner, so it works great for an oily complexion.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product after I had heard a lot of great things about using tea tree for your skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, but my acne did not heal quicker.</li>

            <li> This is a great toner for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t order again because it&#x27;s not that great</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hype as great for acne-prone</li>
            <li> It does a great job cleaning out dirt and make up.</li>

            <li> All-in-all, I absolutely am in love with this toner, I will be repurchasing and recommending!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Most of the time my skin looks flawless.</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant scent to it and it doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin</li>
            <li> The products for your face are good and the body wash cocoa butter</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this.</li>
            <li> and my dermatologist recommended a good toner.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already noticed a good difference on my skin..</li>
            <li> And also, the scent is so good.</li>
            <li> It dries out your face, but if you use moisturizer after it creates a good mixture.</li>
            <li> but I combined with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use a cotton square to apply this and my face feels so good after.</li>
            <li> I continued to use it, wanting to give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to go all psycho on me every time there&#x27;s a significant weather change, and I have an ongoing battle with clogged pores/blackheads, but this toner is awesome!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing toner with good results.</li>
            <li> I am very confident recommending this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing and tingly.  </li>
            <li> The best thing to even happen to my face worth the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;cant submit without more words-even when there is nothing more to say!!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this company !</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and love it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> I love just about anything with tea tree in it and this product is no exception!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice matt finish on your skin after using, doesn&#x27;t burn, and did wonders for clearing up blemishes.</li>
            <li> It has this nice soothing, tingling sensation after wiping my face with a cotten square pad.</li>
            <li> Excellent and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good thing it was cheap!</li>
            <li> It is nice.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell though.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin tone look really nice.</li>
            <li> She ended up tossing it after two months and switched to Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Which Hazel alcohol-free toner.</li>
            <li> i am so in love with this great facial toner the best there is&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also reduces acne breakouts by about 90% and is way more effective than over the counter acne medications.</li>
            <li> This product does tend to dry out skin a bit, so it is best to use this product in tandem with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I make sure I&#x27;m stocked up on this stuff at all times, and being able to subscribe makes the price even better!</li>
            <li> The scent is strong !</li>
            <li> The product does smell great, and is great for a traditional toner, but not for a &#x27;skin clearing&#x27; toner.</li>
            <li> It is more suitable for oily skin type .</li>
            <li> Since i already put a lot on my face to prevent and treat breakouts, this is a  PERFECT product to add to my skin regimen that does not dry out my skin or sting when I put on.  </li>
            <li> However, it is very refreshing and my skin feels clean after using.</li>
            <li> I added this toner into my care routine and see a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;m probably satisfied with the results</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I use this just before the lotion, and love the combination of the two.</li>
            <li> Probably would work better for someone with oil skin.</li>
            <li> It definitely should say something about not using more than twice a day and to pair it with a tea trea oil wash for best results.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of the tea tree also..  </li>
            <li> It also helps that he is drinking more water &amp; staying away from sugary drinks.  </li>
            <li> I love this toner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay is all I can say about this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you shake well before using it so that you can mix it up.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my pores look better, so it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m okay now used to with it.</li>
            <li> You will get more confidence while working.</li>
            <li> My skin has been doing a lot better since I&#x27;ve started using this toner.</li>
            <li> I love the Body Shop products.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and recommend it for anyone who wants to combat acne and oily-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I love this clearing toner.</li>
            <li> For some reason I just love the smell of this toner..</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, when i start to break out</li>
            <li> I found this toner on Amazon and absolutely love it..</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> I love the toner, the moisturizer, and the scrub.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner.</li>
            <li> This skin clearing toner is awesome, it has calmed the red bumpy blemishes on my cheeks and minimized the size of my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you like tea tree shampoo or anything, you will love this.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to mix it up well before applying it.</li>
            <li> but this is safe to use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toner</li>
            <li> is important, people!</li>
            <li> I have used The Body Shop products for many years.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for 3 or more weeks now</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> but I think it just made me break out more.</li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> not the first time, good</li>
            <li> For this price, it is worth the try!!</li>
            <li> i actually love this stuff, but stay away if you don&#x27;t like a strong tingly sensation.</li>
            <li> The Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, I find it very refreshing and love the tingly (some may say burning) sensation that lasts for the first 5 seconds after putting on the product.</li>
            <li> This is ideal for people who have moderately to severely oily skin.</li>
            <li> I loved how my face didn&#x27;t shine as much after using this.</li>
            <li> thank you so much this product is so great, it leaves my face feeling so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> of course, anyone who knows tea Tree, knows it has a strong smell</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t smelled tea tree oil and not a fan of strong smells, I wouldn&#x27;t get this toner.</li>
            <li> This one is strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> Strong product</li>
            <li> and now my skin is fine.</li>
            <li> I love that the face wash and the rest of the line has done away with my breakouts and evened my skin tone out so quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost certain there is mild lemon in the product, which is good for lightening scars/</li>
            <li> It does not break me out, cleans better than the lush toner, calms the redness, and it is also a better price!</li>
            <li> But overall this product did help clear my skin up which is awesome :)</li>
            <li> only give it four stars because the bottle/packaging doesn&#x27;t come with great instructions.</li>
            <li> Great for a daily cleanser...</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t see too much about the product but for my own mistake</li>
            <li> I love the fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> You just have to get use the the smell...but overall its great.</li>
            <li> i dont use the wash with it, but as a toner itself, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> This toner has a great scent but it requires a lot of shaking prior to each use.  </li>
            <li> Its a great disinfectant; wound cleaner and overall skin cleaner.  </li>
            <li> But this is a really good product for sensitive skin people like me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known tea tree oil is good for sensitive skin and has antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li> which is pretty hardcore if i say so myself, but this product did absolutely nothing good for my skin, except made it smell strongly of tea tree fragrance and stripped it of all its moisture.</li>
            <li> very harbal-ish smell, great product, leaves my skin very clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Definitely gets the job done, smells great, and helps give me the peace of mind that my skin is definitely clean...</li>
            <li> : Immediately noticed an increase in breakouts, particularly along my forehead, an area I haven&#x27;t had acne issues with in many, many months.</li>
            <li> Feel Fresh and cool after use :)</li>
            <li> My breakouts have reduced significantly since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Right after using this product your skin just feels clean!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> The product seems pretty good, but I could never use this more than one day at a time due to the strong smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but when I combine this with the rest of my regimen, it has done a good job of keeping my skin pretty clear.</li>
            <li> I simply use a mattifying pomegranite (which is good for oil control) primer on my t-zone</li>
            <li> My skin feels super clean after I wash it and use this.  </li>
            <li> Great product, natural way to clean and clear your face.</li>
            <li> I just started using this toner, but it feels so fresh and clean when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell then it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I got the quickest non-automated response and found out the problem quickly.</li>
            <li> i love this product this is ten times better than any harsh&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has made a tremendous difference for her.</li>
            <li> It has a sediment that settles quickly after shaken then has to be shaken again.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I use from the Body Shop -- and it is exactly what I want in a toner -- cool and refreshing both to start the day, or at the end before bed!</li>
            <li> It helps my skin more clear and reduces acne.</li>
            <li> Effective and the tea tree scent is present.</li>
            <li> It smells and feels really fresh.</li>
            <li> It can be very quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> However, the toner helped to clear my face as well as provide a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> When I started using this in my evening routine, I noticed a difference almost right away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell, but served the purpose for my teenage step-daughter&#x27;s acne issues.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a nice and fresh feel without making my skin dry.  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s my first toner, I can immediately tell how fresh it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It helps with blemishes only midly, but used in combination with the face scrub, it is greatly improved.</li>
            <li> feels really good on my skin, slight tingle.</li>
            <li> ; Tea tree oil does have a strong natural odor</li>
            <li> I use it daily and enjoy the scent and how clean it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Several of them are full of powerful ingredients that are designed to leave your skin feeling completely fresh and clean and ready to absorb any serum and moisturizer you choose to apply.  </li>
            <li> First off, tea tree oil is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this product along with the facial wash for about two weeks &amp; his acne does appear to be much better.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> i like the smell and it works pretty well, looking forward to trying the seaweed cleansers, still having problems with oily skin</li>
            <li> This is actually my first product that I have ordered from the body shop.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a toner that felt refreshing only astringents did that.</li>
            <li> First bought a travel size kit with cleanser etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Acne Stress Control scrub but bought the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash after falling in love with this..</li>
            <li> I like it well enough to keep trying it until I find something better.</li>
            <li> but I will most likely not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have seen a noticeable difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> this is the first toner I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> It appears to be very old and didn&#x27;t clean my skin.  </li>
            <li> and my face usually never feels clean.</li>
            <li> The whole tea tree line from the Body Shop gets right in and cleans your pores, without causing any irritation at all.</li>
            <li> The price is perfect for how much you get, since a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just saying it because other cosmetic put a lot of nice smell</li>
            <li> i was originally using it as a quick temporary replacement while i found something else, but i always came back to this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t pinpoint chin blame on this product as that is my trouble zone, but forehead continues to blossom and more importantly, continued use of this &amp;#34;skin clearing&amp;#34</li>
            <li> smell is quite strong but did not particularly bother me, I found it dissipated rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Firstly it has to be shaken very well because of sediment at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I do love that this product doesn&#x27;t dry out your face while feeling refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> eSCAN with really large pores</li>
            <li> Keeps me from breaking out, and really tightens my pores and skin.  </li>
            <li> However, it really helped with my acne.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Then you are ready to rock.</li>
            <li> It was drying and stung my whole face.</li>
            <li> Dries out skin if used too often but combats acne very well</li>
            <li> But this product feels very lightweight and even calming.</li>
            <li> so I just can&#x27;t wash my face this much.</li>
            <li> but I might have used too much as I never get that anymore.</li>
            <li> but I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> has really helped reduce outbreaks.</li>
            <li> This toner is intense.  </li>
            <li> This line has helped so much.  </li>
            <li> Arrive fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cooling and does what it&#x27;s supposed to without over drying my skin.</li>
            <li> This toner works really well.</li>
            <li> It is gentle but really works.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this toner!</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and leaves my face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily and very problematic, so if something does not work for my skin I will find out within a day or so.</li>
            <li> I had read many feedbacks on the body shop website carefully before I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> Disinfects gently.</li>
            <li> I have really oil</li>
            <li> This is an effective toner without being harsh.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;m not sure if this toner would work well for someone with more severe acne, as it may be too mild.</li>
            <li> The other day I woke up with a red patches on my face, and I tried treating them with Eucerin lotion (usually good at soothing reddened skin, but didn&#x27;t do much this time), and Prosacea (no effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> It was okay, I probably will not buy it again as I didn&#x27;t really notice that much of a difference with my skin one way or the other.</li>
            <li> i always break out the tea tree toner, and i clear right up in a day or two.</li>
            <li> It has more of the active ingredients in it than regular toners (which are primarily alcohol), and it helps to heal your skin instead of just disinfecting it.</li>
            <li> i love this toner, It seem to work very well with my other Desert Tea Tree face wash.</li>
            <li> Okay, so now I&#x27;m assuming this is what tea tree must do, not having used any other tea tree products before, despite all</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used enough of it to decide if I like it enough to buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I turned a few friends on to tea tree oil products and they love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more products from the body shop in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different products in my life and have finally found something I will not change from.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations from this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for acne or oily skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I only had occasional acne to begin with, but this product has helped to prevent new acne from forming, and in combination with the lotion, my skin looks smoother and more evened out.</li>
            <li> so i shake it and the toner foams up a little at the top.</li>
            <li> clean well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry</li>
            <li> Even normal skin will experience drying and redness.</li>
            <li> At first, it definitely cleared up my skin, but now it doesn&#x27;t seem to do that much.</li>
            <li> First of all, my pimples cures apparently after I use it after one night.</li>
            <li> I kept using it thought and after a few weeks, my complexion does seem more even.</li>
            <li> Late-Twenties | Acne Prone | Normal (</li>
            <li> I like how the product feels on my face, it feels more like my face absorbs it over other toners I&#x27;ve used, but I really wish it came with a safety seal, the issue with no safety seal is that there is a small amount of yellowish/white material sitting at the bottom of the container, and I cannot fully enjoy the product not knowing if this is a bacteria</li>
            <li> all natural witch hazel is better, less astringent and foul.</li>
            <li> Luckily I have been around the block with tea tree oil and other facial products to be able to figure out proper usage.</li>
            <li> The first time, I assumed I hadn&#x27;t properly shook the ingredients together and was getting too much of something directly onto the skin</li>
            <li> New pimples recurring</li>
            <li> I had super dry skin for months</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shut down your oil glands (which is a good thing), but it turns them down.</li>
            <li> However, this light green liquid that contains the fresh scent of tea tree oil is leaps and bound above the competition.  </li>
            <li> This skin toner has continued to help me fight adult acne!  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 3 years now, and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I developed adult onset acne and now have very acne prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin still breaks out even though I&#x27;m decades past my teens, and I find this to be both clearing but also refreshing.  </li>
            <li> It did help my acne, but that&#x27;s because it removed the entire first layer of skin.</li>
            <li> and I had no idea what to do because I&#x27;m naturally combination/oily, after using this it went straight back to normal.</li>
            <li> I use it every night before using the Tea Tree Blemish Fade Night Lotion, and I have seen a significant difference in the amount of blemishes and dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> shaked the bottle for several minutes, but yet this odd sediment would not &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; into the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle came without a safety seal on it .....and was cracked on top.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this toner to anyone with occasional zits or mild acne.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a menthol type scent and a strong feel but does not leave skin feeling sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> there is not a strong tea tree smell, very mild.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that I feel like there should be more to each bottle!</li>
            <li> Use it after you wash your face, this will help clear up acne in just a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin became irratated and didn&#x27;t clear anything up.</li>
            <li> smell is really dependant on your personal preference.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have no problems with it.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t really made my pores smaller, but it does help with shine.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with adult horomonal acne since I was taken off HRT.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it is natural leaf smell but</li>
            <li> but this one is just natural.</li>
            <li> In about 15 minutes they were nearly gone.</li>
            <li> I frequently suffer from oily acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, I was hesitant to use this product.  </li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, Using this toner in the morning before make up has totally helped absorb and control oil, and breakouts.</li>
            <li> my skin soft and not oily at all in 3 weeks &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin and helps keep my oily skin from getting out of control during the day.</li>
            <li> Before my skin changed, I was completely reliant on this line from The Body Shop.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t consider myself a person who has sensitive skin -</li>
            <li> Did not work on my adult acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now &amp; really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural &amp; there is a bit of a moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Every time I use this it refreshes and completely takes the dirt out of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;Debra Anthony</li>
            <li> Olive Tone | Sensitive |</li>
            <li> I think that toners are meant to be used to restore your skin to its natural pH balance or something like that?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product to who have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> that is all natural though.</li>
            <li> No other new products were used in this time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was previously using the lush tea tree toner and, when I ran out, I quickly wanted to find something that did the job but cheaper.</li>
            <li> Some people might get a little bit of tingling sensation near the eye area, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin very dry, when I apply on my face, I feel hot like my face is burnt, I dont know does it have alcohol or not</li>
            <li> So far I love it, but be careful not to use it on days that you have exfoliated because it can be harsh on already sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really help my skin and dry up all the acne!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural guide line for your skin care is STEP BY STEP  1 facial foam ( make up remover / soft / scrub ..</li>
            <li> I will be going back to Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel as my primary toner and the Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner 1-2x/week for helping to slough off dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My problem area is the chin/mouth area and generally hormonal.&lt;br /&gt;Week 2</li>
            <li> When you use a cotton pad to wipe it across your face, you feel a slight tingling sensation that assures you it is working  deep into your skin to clean it and refresh it and prepare it for the next step in your skin care routine.  </li>
            <li> I still have to wash religiously to keep clear.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re going to add the face mask next and see if we can get her skin totally clear.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am allergic to a number of different ingredients often used in beaut products, but did not have a problem with this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this when i was a teenage year old boy.</li>
            <li> I wrote my every own address wrong.</li>
            <li> Consistent use with this and other products have resulted in smaller pores around my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> but after using about three bottles of this stuff, I&#x27;m ready to try other toners.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product I was using Mario Badescu&#x27;s Glycolic Acid Toner &amp; Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel and prior to that Clean&amp;Clear Sensitive Skin</li>
            <li> The one thing that he does say about the toner is that it does have a little sting when first apply but after a couple of uses you get use to it.</li>
            <li> I felt a little burn sensation on first application</li>
            <li> have fairly sensitive combination skin (dry on the cheeks, but oily on the T-zone) and have to be weary of skin care products.</li>
            <li> The smell is not so good, in fact it smell bad.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday after washing my makeup off and sometimes it burned a little, but keeps my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrified of using new products as I usually end up with a major breakout after trying it.</li>
            <li> Second smell is kinda strange to me , I thought smell shouldn&#x27;t be like leaf medication smell</li>
            <li> Until a few weeks ago when my face apparently decided it was done falling under the &amp;#34;dry skin&amp;#34; category and became super oily (for me at least)..</li>
            <li> Whenever my facial skin feels itchy (usually a sign of a flare-up), I dab this toner on and it calms right down.</li>
            <li> I would say if you have sensitive skin, this may be too harsh for you especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I try not to use it daily because it will dry out your skin!</li>
            <li> My skin is a little sensitive</li>
            <li> It is usually a clear emerald green tone.</li>
            <li> Way too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so if you are sensitive to this you may not enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit strange but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing, cooling, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a astringent user anymore because how extremely dry it made my face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch or dry.</li>
            <li> neither oily nor dry)</li>
            <li> my makeup would cake in dry patches of my skin</li>
            <li> Very harsh. would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like it and probably won&#x27;t switch back to any other brand that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I just dab a little on a cotton ball and my legs get instant relief.</li>
            <li> but I am starting to see a little clearing of my skin already.  </li>
            <li> No new breakouts, but areas that sprouted in weeks 1&amp;2 have not susbsided any faster than when using other toners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my only complaint is there was white stuff at the bottom of the bottle</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a few days</li>
            <li> So the next time I vigorously shook and shook, applied some to my cotton round, but again, it stung.</li>
            <li> No heavy scent left behind after using.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> don;t know if it&#x27;s the packaging problem(putting this bottle in a box instead of bubble envelop, which by the way, was how my other orders from the say day were)or the seller problem, but now I have to make a makeshift bottle cap with plastic wrap and rubber band.</li>
            <li> Be careful with packaging!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t recommend trying any other Tea Tree Oil products either.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff, and remember to shake it before each use!</li>
            <li> but it works just like any other toner.</li>
            <li> It basically dries out the pimples just like other products.</li>
            <li> I had to use it every other day until my face got used to it.</li>
            <li> I tried using this like a I do with every other toner I have</li>
            <li> Left with a small travel size sample pack which included this, the cleanser, a moisturizer, and a small vial of actual tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> | Photosensitive | Chemical Sunscreen Allergic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this toner for 3 weeks consistently and am not impressed.</li>
            <li> This toner works hard to penetrate deep to combat any signs of blemish prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it ever since for flare-ups and it hasn&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
            <li> She is not brushing her hair down to hide her face anymore.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my previous toner ran out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells like chemicals and has this odd sediment on the bottom of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and healthier now.</li>
            <li> Start using this recommended by my little sister who has been using this.</li>
            <li> in desperation I dabbed on a little of this Tea Tree toner...</li>
            <li> Sometimes I break out a little after using it, but I think it is because it cleaned my skin so well</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was a little bit confused about the writing on the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;it was arabic, it seems that it is a version for the middle east not the us!</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin which in turn made me break out</li>
            <li> I got this product this week, and I&#x27;m surprised to find out that it came in a broken bottle cap!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think my skin was sensitive, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> This time it was a milky, foggy green color.</li>
            <li> a waste.</li>
            <li> Since using, I have way less breakouts, my skin is smoother and in combo with the nightly fade cream, fewer scars!</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out pretty bad and broke me out.</li>
            <li> I myself purchased this product to deal with my very slightly blemish-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks, just not sure what, if anything, it is doing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I recently cut my use down to about once a week and the dry skin isn&#x27;t as bad anymore</li>
            <li> My skin was raw.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from occasional outbreaks of rosacea - and they&#x27;re bad breakouts, red bumps, acne, etc.</li>
            <li> As a result I anxiously contacted seller as I didn&#x27;t receive anything after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is very harsh, I ended up with what looked like/felt like a sunburn and</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, Trust me I tried.</li>
            <li> I was astonished to say the least.</li>
            <li> My skin reaction negative toward the product</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has started to slowly even out (:</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m fairly certain i broke out worse from it too :(</li>
            <li> At first I hated this stuff.</li>
            <li> BUT I am 28 and have had serious acne since I was 12.</li>
            <li> This toner has a bad smell,,it&#x27;s not really helping with my acne..</li>
            <li> The product by itself however, removes dirt that even washing your face leaves behind.</li>
            <li> takes away shine, and i can see all the dirt it removes that stays behind on the cotton ball.</li>
            <li> anyone base on what last you ware on your face )</li>
            <li> I am definitely addicted to this toner after buying it 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to make my skin worse though.</li>
            <li> Tea tree is irritating to some people&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> She noticed Thayer&#x27;s decreased redness and imroved her complexsion (almost no breakouts anymore).</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I had nothing to worry about.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin that just started randomly breaking out again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible at remembering to do something daily, so whenever I break out I wash my face and apply this with a cotton ball</li>
            <li> It smells weird, and it burns a lot when I apply it on my face.</li>
            <li> I may be wrong</li>
            <li> weird,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried really expensive prescriptions and everything otc.</li>
            <li> However, I am prone to cystic acne and after less than a week of using this I had two very ugly acne cysts.</li>
            <li> For $10, this was quite a disappointment.</li>
            <li> and it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> but if you (like my daughter) are completely frustrated, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I usually hate toners cuz they feel like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> and i hated it, now it looks even.</li>
            <li> But, it is very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the smell is terrible ,,like really terrible.!!</li>
            <li> It smells awful and it seemed to make me break out?</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like how the product feels on my face, it feels more like my face absorbs it over other toners I&#x27;ve used, but I really wish it came with a safety seal, the issue with no safety seal is that there is a small amount of yellowish/white material sitting at the bottom of the container, and I cannot fully enjoy the product not knowing if this is a bacteria or if it&#x27;s just some material that fell to the bottom. I would almost argue it&#x27;s against the law to sell something like this without a seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is really dependant on your personal preference. If i had to describe the smell it would be the smell of a humid forest mixed with lemon. I&#x27;m almost certain there is mild lemon in the product, which is good for lightening scars/sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not used enough to know the results, but if this review isn&#x27;t changed after april 9th 2015 then I&#x27;m probably satisfied with the results</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin which in turn made me break out</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It leaves a nice matt finish on your skin after using, doesn&#x27;t burn, and did wonders for clearing up blemishes. I would recommend this product to anyone with acne OR normal/ regular skin. Be warned some people don&#x27;t like the smell of tea tree oil, if you don&#x27;t you wouldn&#x27;t like this product...But overall this product did help clear my skin up which is awesome :)</li>
            <li> This is an effective toner without being harsh.  I have sensitive skin and have no problems with it.  What it also works great on is razor burns.  I just dab a little on a cotton ball and my legs get instant relief.</li>
            <li> It helps my skin more clear and reduces acne. It smells like tea, so I feel \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; while using it. Love it!</li>
            <li> Keeps me from breaking out, and really tightens my pores and skin.  I use this just before the lotion, and love the combination of the two.</li>
            <li> Way too harsh for my sensitive skin. Dried my skin out pretty bad and broke me out. Probably would work better for someone with oil skin.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell then it&#x27;s pretty awesome. My Hubby uses it for aftershave sometimes and he seems to like it. It hasn&#x27;t really made my pores smaller, but it does help with shine.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, Trust me I tried. But this is a really good product for sensitive skin people like me.</li>
            <li> I got this product this week, and I&#x27;m surprised to find out that it came in a broken bottle cap! I don;t know if it&#x27;s the packaging problem(putting this bottle in a box instead of bubble envelop, which by the way, was how my other orders from the say day were)or the seller problem, but now I have to make a makeshift bottle cap with plastic wrap and rubber band. Be careful with packaging!</li>
            <li> First off, tea tree oil is not for everyone. I noticed when reading some of the reviews that some people had issues with it drying their skin out or making them red etc... if it does this, then this is not the product for you and I don&#x27;t recommend trying any other Tea Tree Oil products either. This is ideal for people who have moderately to severely oily skin. Even normal skin will experience drying and redness. Now for those of us who do have oily skin, its a great product for controlling oil. It helps with blemishes only midly, but used in combination with the face scrub, it is greatly improved. The product by itself however, removes dirt that even washing your face leaves behind. It doesn&#x27;t shut down your oil glands (which is a good thing), but it turns them down. I was tempted to use this multiple times a day, but I had to resist the urge because it will make your skin over compensate on the oil and then it makes using the product moot. 1-2 times a day is plenty, or just before you apply make up. If using it before make up application, use a lightweight moisturizer at best underneath because you already have oil control since you&#x27;ve used the prodcut. I simply use a mattifying pomegranite (which is good for oil control) primer on my t-zone and I don&#x27;t have issues with needing to remove oil midday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only give it four stars because the bottle/packaging doesn&#x27;t come with great instructions. Luckily I have been around the block with tea tree oil and other facial products to be able to figure out proper usage. It definitely should say something about not using more than twice a day and to pair it with a tea trea oil wash for best results.</li>
            <li> Feel Fresh and cool after use :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Gives me a nice and fresh feel without making my skin dry.  Love the smell of the tea tree also..  I have mine on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this product along with the facial wash for about two weeks &amp; his acne does appear to be much better. It also helps that he is drinking more water &amp; staying away from sugary drinks.  The one thing that he does say about the toner is that it does have a little sting when first apply but after a couple of uses you get use to it.</li>
            <li> Great for a daily cleanser...</li>
            <li> I love this toner and I know it works for me, since I&#x27;ve also used serum from this set. It has this nice soothing, tingling sensation after wiping my face with a cotten square pad. I would use 2 to 3 droplets of the toner for my entire face. It also has a pleasant scent to it and it doesn&#x27;t smell like medicine.</li>
            <li> of course, anyone who knows tea Tree, knows it has a strong smell but i dont mind it at all. very harbal-ish smell, great product, leaves my skin very clean and soft. takes away shine, and i can see all the dirt it removes that stays behind on the cotton ball. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay is all I can say about this stuff.  I haven&#x27;t used enough of it to decide if I like it enough to buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> New pimples recurring</li>
            <li> I actually ordered this tones by mistake instead of a skin wash by the same brand. However, it really helped with my acne. My breakouts have reduced significantly since I started using it. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a few days but, can already see a difference in my skin clearing up.  I have had problems with adult horomonal acne since I was taken off HRT.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> i like it as a toner. Make sure you shake well before using it so that you can mix it up.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin and I like that there is not a strong tea tree smell, very mild.</li>
            <li> I used this product about 4 times a week after cleansing/scrubbing with Burt&#x27;s Bees products that I use every night. This product dries my skin out a lot (it may be because I use it after citrus products, although I&#x27;ve never had drying out issues when using only Burt&#x27;s Bees).    I have noticed that my pores look better, so it does it&#x27;s job. I recently cut my use down to about once a week and the dry skin isn&#x27;t as bad anymore and I still see some results.    I would say if you have sensitive skin, this may be too harsh for you especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> Start using this recommended by my little sister who has been using this. Firstly it has to be shaken very well because of sediment at the bottom. Second smell is kinda strange to me , I thought smell shouldn&#x27;t be like leaf medication smell but I&#x27;m okay now used to with it. I feel like it is natural leaf smell but smell won&#x27;t bother you trust. I&#x27;m just saying it because other cosmetic put a lot of nice smell but this one is just natural. It is more suitable for oily skin type . Remember any toner has to be used after washing face . Natural guide line for your skin care is STEP BY STEP  1 facial foam ( make up remover / soft / scrub .. anyone base on what last you ware on your face ) 2 Toner . 3 Milk lotion ( I use tonymoly emulsion ) . 4 Moisturizer ( skin care anti aging moisturizer / make up moisturizer ) . 5 Make up ( anyone you prefer, I just ware a bit of mineral make up to be smoother face ) . 6 Translucent powder ( only if you want ) . Then you are ready to rock. So you don&#x27;t need to worry about sun or wind or snow or anything. You have already wore skin care and sun protection. You will get more confidence while working.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t see too much about the product but for my own mistake I wrote my every own address wrong. As a result I anxiously contacted seller as I didn&#x27;t receive anything after 3 weeks. I got the quickest non-automated response and found out the problem quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Effective and the tea tree scent is present. I love the fresh feeling. If you are currently breaking out you will feel a tingle or a stinging feeling but it heals those breakouts. I am very confident recommending this product.</li>
            <li> Use it after you wash your face, this will help clear up acne in just a couple of days.  I turned a few friends on to tea tree oil products and they love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Love this company ! No complaints.</li>
            <li> I suffer from occasional outbreaks of rosacea - and they&#x27;re bad breakouts, red bumps, acne, etc. The other day I woke up with a red patches on my face, and I tried treating them with Eucerin lotion (usually good at soothing reddened skin, but didn&#x27;t do much this time), and Prosacea (no effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then in desperation I dabbed on a little of this Tea Tree toner...and I am not exaggerating...the red spots started to fade almost instantly. In about 15 minutes they were nearly gone. I was astonished to say the least. This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since for flare-ups and it hasn&#x27;t let me down yet. Whenever my facial skin feels itchy (usually a sign of a flare-up), I dab this toner on and it calms right down. I cannot recommend this toner strongly enough. It is a miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> It was drying and stung my whole face. I don&#x27;t have any popped pimples or any open wounds, which is why I don&#x27;t know why it would feel like that.</li>
            <li> thank you so much this product is so great, it leaves my face feeling so clean and smooth. i have been teeling everyone about this!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s astringent enough that it shrinks pores.  It&#x27;s very refreshing and tingly.  I would recommend it to anyone of any age that has oily skin and enlarged pores.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff, and remember to shake it before each use! My skin has been doing a lot better since I&#x27;ve started using this toner. It has more of the active ingredients in it than regular toners (which are primarily alcohol), and it helps to heal your skin instead of just disinfecting it. I used to use the night lotion, which was a miracle in itself, but I&#x27;d like to see how they work together.</li>
            <li> i like the smell and it works pretty well, looking forward to trying the seaweed cleansers, still having problems with oily skin</li>
            <li> Dries out skin if used too often but combats acne very well</li>
            <li> I love the Body Shop products. The products for your face are good and the body wash cocoa butter and she a butter are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this. I loved how my face didn&#x27;t shine as much after using this. However, I am prone to cystic acne and after less than a week of using this I had two very ugly acne cysts. I discontinued its use.</li>
            <li> The smell is not so good, in fact it smell bad. My skin reaction negative toward the product so I already stop using it</li>
            <li> It has a powder inside of the toner, so it works great for an oily complexion.  I like this product.</li>
            <li> I am definitely addicted to this toner after buying it 3 months ago. I use it every night before using the Tea Tree Blemish Fade Night Lotion, and I have seen a significant difference in the amount of blemishes and dark spots on my face. I only had occasional acne to begin with, but this product has helped to prevent new acne from forming, and in combination with the lotion, my skin looks smoother and more evened out. I have recommended this to a number of friends because of how well it worked for me. I have sensitive skin and am allergic to a number of different ingredients often used in beaut products, but did not have a problem with this product. That being said, I&#x27;m not sure if this toner would work well for someone with more severe acne, as it may be too mild. The price is perfect for how much you get, since a little goes a long way. I use it every night all over my face, and have had the same bottle for over 3 months.</li>
            <li> I just started using this toner, but it feels so fresh and clean when you put it on.  It&#x27;s only been a week but I am starting to see a little clearing of my skin already.  Hopefully it lasts.</li>
            <li> This is actually my first product that I have ordered from the body shop. I think I&#x27;ve passed by the store but never went in. Well I was doing myself a disservice!! I usually hate toners cuz they feel like rubbing alcohol. But this product feels very lightweight and even calming. I frequently suffer from oily acne prone skin.  In fact, I take medication for it.  But medication alone was not working and my dermatologist recommended a good toner.  Since i already put a lot on my face to prevent and treat breakouts, this is a  PERFECT product to add to my skin regimen that does not dry out my skin or sting when I put on.  It helps with the redness and swelling as well. I will definitely be buying more products from the body shop in the future! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The product seems pretty good, but I could never use this more than one day at a time due to the strong smell. I tried just using it at night but the smell lingered til the next morning so it needed to be washed off. I have rosacea and sensitive skin so I just can&#x27;t wash my face this much. It didn&#x27;t seem to make my skin worse though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after I had heard a lot of great things about using tea tree for your skin. Right after using this product your skin just feels clean! Sometimes I break out a little after using it, but I think it is because it cleaned my skin so well that is brought all the dirt out. Most of the time my skin looks flawless. I try not to use it daily because it will dry out your skin!</li>
            <li> My skin tends to go all psycho on me every time there&#x27;s a significant weather change, and I have an ongoing battle with clogged pores/blackheads, but this toner is awesome! The whole tea tree line from the Body Shop gets right in and cleans your pores, without causing any irritation at all. I make sure I&#x27;m stocked up on this stuff at all times, and being able to subscribe makes the price even better! (I have to drive 45+ minutes to get to the nearest Body Shop store- Amazon saves me a ton of money on this stuff)</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s my first toner, I can immediately tell how fresh it makes my skin feel. I felt a little burn sensation on first application but I might have used too much as I never get that anymore. I use it in my routine and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to clear up my skin. Did not happen whatsoever. The product does smell great, and is great for a traditional toner, but not for a &#x27;skin clearing&#x27; toner. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> The best thing to even happen to my face worth the price</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves a gross soapy residue on your face and it doesn&#x27;t help AT ALL with acne</li>
            <li> I had high expectations from this product. I thought I would see a drastic difference but it works just like any other toner. The smell is great, but my acne did not heal quicker. It basically dries out the pimples just like other products. After I&#x27;m done with this bottle I&#x27;m switching back to witch hazel which works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Best toner i have ever used, think it&#x27;s a very fair price as well. Wonderful scent.&lt;br /&gt;cant submit without more words-even when there is nothing more to say!!</li>
            <li> I have been faithful to the Tea Tree line for years. I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> feels really good on my skin, slight tingle. not drying to my skin at all but I have very oily skin. has really helped reduce outbreaks.</li>
            <li> Since being reintroduced to the wonders of toner, I have tried and tested several different brands.  Several of them are full of powerful ingredients that are designed to leave your skin feeling completely fresh and clean and ready to absorb any serum and moisturizer you choose to apply.  However, this light green liquid that contains the fresh scent of tea tree oil is leaps and bound above the competition.  When you use a cotton pad to wipe it across your face, you feel a slight tingling sensation that assures you it is working  deep into your skin to clean it and refresh it and prepare it for the next step in your skin care routine.  Beings I have extremely sensitive skin, I was hesitant to use this product.  Needless to say, I had nothing to worry about.  My face has never been clearer.  This toner works hard to penetrate deep to combat any signs of blemish prone skin.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and recommend it for anyone who wants to combat acne and oily-prone skin.</li>
            <li> This toner is intense.  My skin was raw.  I had to use it every other day until my face got used to it.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first week and I&#x27;ve already noticed a good difference on my skin..works wonder. You just have to get use the the smell...but overall its great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but when I combine this with the rest of my regimen, it has done a good job of keeping my skin pretty clear.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that just started randomly breaking out again.  This line has helped so much.  I use the body wash for any body breakouts.  I love that the face wash and the rest of the line has done away with my breakouts and evened my skin tone out so quickly.</li>
            <li> I like this toner, it is smelly since tea tree oil isn&#x27;t the best smelling. However, it is very refreshing and my skin feels clean after using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing, cooling, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Some people might get a little bit of tingling sensation near the eye area, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a toner that felt refreshing only astringents did that. I&#x27;m not a astringent user anymore because how extremely dry it made my face. I do love that this product doesn&#x27;t dry out your face while feeling refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall to this toner is that the lotion or whatever cream like ingredient gets stuck on the bottom so I have to shake it and bang it on the counter in order for it to blend. Other than that, I like it and probably won&#x27;t switch back to any other brand that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Now that I have bought this toner, I won&#x27;t get anything else for my face.  It smells and feels really fresh.</li>
            <li> I am a Tea tree &amp;#34;anything&amp;#34; freak.  The smell of this is not overpowering.  I have been using it for a few weeks, just not sure what, if anything, it is doing for my skin.</li>
            <li> great product for my skin it cleans but it does not irritate my skin , body shop products are the best . Arrive fast</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, Using this toner in the morning before make up has totally helped absorb and control oil, and breakouts. Not to mention the smell is great. I would totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> Causes my skin to breakout when I use it.  I didn&#x27;t think my skin was sensitive, but I was wrong.  I stopped use it and now my skin is fine.</li>
            <li> The tea separates in the bottle.  It appears to be very old and didn&#x27;t clean my skin.  Don&#x27;t bother buying it.</li>
            <li> This skin toner has continued to help me fight adult acne!  Best toner!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and love it! It&#x27;s very cooling and does what it&#x27;s supposed to without over drying my skin. I&#x27;ve used so many different products in my life and have finally found something I will not change from.</li>
            <li> I love this clearing toner. I feel it has improved my faces blemishes over time and always feel cleaner after use.</li>
            <li> I actually bought it for its smell. For some reason I just love the smell of this toner..</li>
            <li> Bought this because my previous toner ran out. Excellent and fast shipping. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has started to slowly even out (:</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 3 years now, and i absolutely love it. i was originally using it as a quick temporary replacement while i found something else, but i always came back to this product. i dont use the wash with it, but as a toner itself, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> i am so in love with this great facial toner the best there is&lt;br /&gt;and i love this product this is ten times better than any harsh&lt;br /&gt;chemical toners there is and its great for my combination/sensitive&lt;br /&gt;skin.</li>
            <li> Great toner. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch or dry.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, when i start to break out i always break out the tea tree toner, and i clear right up in a day or two.</li>
            <li> This is one of the Best toners I have ever used. First bought a travel size kit with cleanser etc. This toner works really well. I did notice brown spots diminish. It is gentle but really works.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really help my skin and dry up all the acne!&lt;br /&gt;left my skin soft and not oily at all in 3 weeks &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was a little bit confused about the writing on the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;it was arabic, it seems that it is a version for the middle east not the us!</li>
            <li> i actually love this stuff, but stay away if you don&#x27;t like a strong tingly sensation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with acne.. Ever.. Until a few weeks ago when my face apparently decided it was done falling under the &amp;#34;dry skin&amp;#34; category and became super oily (for me at least).. I started breaking out on my forehead and along my jawline and I decided to do something about it.. I found this toner on Amazon and absolutely love it.. I&#x27;m terrible at remembering to do something daily, so whenever I break out I wash my face and apply this with a cotton ball and I kid you not my blemishes reduce in size and redness immediately... I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Acne Stress Control scrub but bought the Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash after falling in love with this.. I&#x27;ll write a review on that after I&#x27;ve used it for a while!</li>
            <li> I tried using this like a I do with every other toner I have and my skin became irratated and didn&#x27;t clear anything up. And I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin. Good thing it was cheap!</li>
            <li> One of the best toners I&#x27;ve used! I developed adult onset acne and now have very acne prone, sensitive skin. I&#x27;m terrified of using new products as I usually end up with a major breakout after trying it. I&#x27;ve known tea tree oil is good for sensitive skin and has antibacterial properties. If you haven&#x27;t smelled tea tree oil and not a fan of strong smells, I wouldn&#x27;t get this toner. Since using, I have way less breakouts, my skin is smoother and in combo with the nightly fade cream, fewer scars! I couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> It smells weird, and it burns a lot when I apply it on my face. Not suitable for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell, but served the purpose for my teenage step-daughter&#x27;s acne issues.  Highly recommended for acne or oily skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely gets the job done, smells great, and helps give me the peace of mind that my skin is definitely clean... but after using about three bottles of this stuff, I&#x27;m ready to try other toners. At first, it definitely cleared up my skin, but now it doesn&#x27;t seem to do that much. I like it well enough to keep trying it until I find something better.</li>
            <li> This one is strongly recommended. First of all, my pimples cures apparently after I use it after one night. The blemish skin is released. My skin feels tight and healthier now. It can be very quickly absorbed. And also, the scent is so good. I even wanted to drink when I use it. I just love it. And it is a big bottle. It is nice.</li>
            <li> This toner has a bad smell,,it&#x27;s not really helping with my acne..it seems to sit at the bottom and when i shake it.. it doesn&#x27;t seem to blend..im going to finish ut off but I will most likely not be buying this again. the smell is terrible ,,like really terrible.!!</li>
            <li> Its Tea tree. Ofcourse its awesome. I started using this when i was a teenage year old boy. My parents bought me it</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> All of the products are great. I love the toner, the moisturizer, and the scrub. Haven&#x27;t tried the non scrub cleaner yet but I want to.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that used to break out something fierce when I was younger. I still have to wash religiously to keep clear. When I started using this in my evening routine, I noticed a difference almost right away. Consistent use with this and other products have resulted in smaller pores around my nose and chin. Skin looks great. This is not something I go without.</li>
            <li> I myself purchased this product to deal with my very slightly blemish-prone skin. This product does tend to dry out skin a bit, so it is best to use this product in tandem with a good moisturizer. However, the toner helped to clear my face as well as provide a refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin and helps keep my oily skin from getting out of control during the day.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner for oily skin. It has a bit of a menthol type scent and a strong feel but does not leave skin feeling sticky or stiff. Very refreshing toner with good results. You must shake it before each use, as the ingredients separate. She uses this toner, the facial wash and the moisturizer. We&#x27;re going to add the face mask next and see if we can get her skin totally clear. She is not brushing her hair down to hide her face anymore. Really very happy with this product. A little bit goes a long way as well. Everyone&#x27;s skin responds differently to products but if you (like my daughter) are completely frustrated, give it a shot. It has made a tremendous difference for her.</li>
            <li> clean well and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry</li>
            <li> Before my skin changed, I was completely reliant on this line from The Body Shop. It worked wonderfully for my oily, acne prone skin without irritation or over drying. I do recommend that people get a sample from their local shop, if possible, before ordering this. Tea tree is irritating to some people&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Had a think sediment at bottom</li>
            <li> Went into the actual store looking for something to help my acne prone skin.  Left with a small travel size sample pack which included this, the cleanser, a moisturizer, and a small vial of actual tea tree oil.  So far I love it, but be careful not to use it on days that you have exfoliated because it can be harsh on already sensitive skin.  I trade off between the blemish fade night cream and the skin clearing lotion for my moisturizer after using this and the results have been amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note; Tea tree oil does have a strong natural odor so if you are sensitive to this you may not enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this toner to anyone with occasional zits or mild acne. It dries out your face, but if you use moisturizer after it creates a good mixture. I used it everyday after washing my makeup off and sometimes it burned a little, but keeps my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t consider myself a person who has sensitive skin - in fact, i use benzoyl peroxide 10% face wash daily which is pretty hardcore if i say so myself, but this product did absolutely nothing good for my skin, except made it smell strongly of tea tree fragrance and stripped it of all its moisture. i&#x27;m fairly certain i broke out worse from it too :( personally i would not recommend this. all natural witch hazel is better, less astringent and foul.</li>
            <li> I love just about anything with tea tree in it and this product is no exception! I would highly recommend this toner!</li>
            <li> At first I hated this stuff. It smells awful and it seemed to make me break out? I kept using it thought and after a few weeks, my complexion does seem more even. I probably won&#x27;t order again because it&#x27;s not that great and it smells so bad.</li>
            <li> This toner has a great scent but it requires a lot of shaking prior to each use.  It has a sediment that settles quickly after shaken then has to be shaken again.  It&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li> On our second bottle!😃👍🏻</li>
            <li> I received this item today. When I opened the package I noticed the color of the liquid appeared different this time. It is usually a clear emerald green tone. This time it was a milky, foggy green color. Upon closer inspection I discovered it has a clump of yellow matter about the size of an egg sitting in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Strong product but I combined with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this! I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Did not work on my adult acne. Has a nice smell though. Maybe my acne needs prescription strength help, though.</li>
            <li> I apply this after I get out of the shower. It makes my skin tone look really nice. It also reduces acne breakouts by about 90% and is way more effective than over the counter acne medications.</li>
            <li> This skin clearing toner is awesome, it has calmed the red bumpy blemishes on my cheeks and minimized the size of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly sensitive combination skin (dry on the cheeks, but oily on the T-zone) and have to be weary of skin care products. The Tea Tree Skin Clearing Toner doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, I find it very refreshing and love the tingly (some may say burning) sensation that lasts for the first 5 seconds after putting on the product. I have seen a noticeable difference in my skin after the first use. If you like tea tree shampoo or anything, you will love this. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> i love this toner, It seem to work very well with my other Desert Tea Tree face wash. I use a cotton square to apply this and my face feels so good after. Remember to apply facial lotion after!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that I feel like there should be more to each bottle!</li>
            <li> I use this product every day, morning and night. It helps with acne, although it doesn&#x27;t make it go away. It is very soothing and leaves my face feeling refreshed. I would recommend any tea tree product by the body shop.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use from the Body Shop -- and it is exactly what I want in a toner -- cool and refreshing both to start the day, or at the end before bed!</li>
            <li> Its a great disinfectant; wound cleaner and overall skin cleaner.  I use it daily and enjoy the scent and how clean it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now &amp; really enjoy it. It&#x27;s all natural &amp; there is a bit of a moisturizing effect. Just make sure to mix it up well before applying it.</li>
            <li> Great product, natural way to clean and clear your face. I have sensitive skin but this is safe to use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toner is important, people! It helps refresh and prep your skin to max-absorb your moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This product is meant for oily skin, i wish i would have known that before I bought this. The scent is strong ! It breaks me out and dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful I have used it to brighten and cleanse skin. Every time I use this it refreshes and completely takes the dirt out of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;Debra Anthony</li>
            <li> I may have found my long-term toner.  My skin still breaks out even though I&#x27;m decades past my teens, and I find this to be both clearing but also refreshing.  My skin feels super clean after I wash it and use this.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used The Body Shop products for many years.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I never purchased this toner before.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like chemicals and has this odd sediment on the bottom of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I shaked the bottle for several minutes, but yet this odd sediment would not &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; into the liquid.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle came without a safety seal on it .....and was cracked on top. Lots of red flags!&lt;br /&gt;I threw this out without use!!!!&lt;br /&gt;What a waste.</li>
            <li> My Skin : Olive Tone | Sensitive | Late-Twenties | Acne Prone | Normal (neither oily nor dry) | Photosensitive | Chemical Sunscreen Allergic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this toner for 3 weeks consistently and am not impressed. Prior to using this product I was using Mario Badescu&#x27;s Glycolic Acid Toner &amp; Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel and prior to that Clean&amp;Clear Sensitive Skin Toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is quite strong but did not particularly bother me, I found it dissipated rather quickly. What *did* bother me was that this product STINGS upon application. The first time, I assumed I hadn&#x27;t properly shook the ingredients together and was getting too much of something directly onto the skin without it&#x27;s needed &#x27;mixer&#x27;. So the next time I vigorously shook and shook, applied some to my cotton round, but again, it stung. Okay, so now I&#x27;m assuming this is what tea tree must do, not having used any other tea tree products before, despite all it&#x27;s hype as great for acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I continued to use it, wanting to give it a fair chance. No other new products were used in this time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1: Immediately noticed an increase in breakouts, particularly along my forehead, an area I haven&#x27;t had acne issues with in many, many months. My problem area is the chin/mouth area and generally hormonal.&lt;br /&gt;Week 2: Breakout continues on forehead, expands to chin area. Can&#x27;t pinpoint chin blame on this product as that is my trouble zone, but forehead continues to blossom and more importantly, continued use of this &amp;#34;skin clearing&amp;#34; toner DOES NOT help the forehead at all.&lt;br /&gt;Week 3: No new breakouts, but areas that sprouted in weeks 1&amp;2 have not susbsided any faster than when using other toners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT: Wouldn&#x27;t Purchase Again. For $10, this was quite a disappointment. I will be going back to Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel as my primary toner and the Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner 1-2x/week for helping to slough off dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, willow bark extract is in this product and another supposedly &amp;#34;blemish clearing&amp;#34; product I tried from Boots, the Expert Blemish Clearing Serum. That also caused increased breakouts during 2.5 weeks of use. Perhaps this ingredient isn&#x27;t as anti-acne as touted? Others noted in reviews similar problems with that product.restingly, willow bark extract is in this product and another supposedly &amp;#34;blemish clearing&amp;#34; product I tried from Boots, the Expert Blemish Clearing Serum.

            <li> I love this stuff! It does a great job cleaning out dirt and make up. I&#x27;m a fan of Body Shop products and this one is great.</li>
            <li> this is the first toner I&#x27;ve ever used so i wish i had something to compare it to. I think that toners are meant to be used to restore your skin to its natural pH balance or something like that? I may be wrong but If that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re suppose to do then this WORKS. I had super dry skin for months and I had no idea what to do because I&#x27;m naturally combination/oily, after using this it went straight back to normal. most people would be sad if their skin was oily probably, but for me it&#x27;s a miracle. my makeup would cake in dry patches of my skin and i hated it, now it looks even. this stuff is awesome. my only complaint is there was white stuff at the bottom of the bottle so i shake it and the toner foams up a little at the top. i got some of the white stuff on my finger and it felt like clay. weird, but, i don&#x27;t think it effected how the toner works or anything. just a warning.</li>
            <li> It was okay, I probably will not buy it again as I didn&#x27;t really notice that much of a difference with my skin one way or the other.</li>
            <li> Stick with an alcohol-free toner instead of this. My wife bought this for her combination/oily skin hoping it would help improve her skin by decreasing breakouts but it didn&#x27;t improve anything. She ended up tossing it after two months and switched to Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Which Hazel alcohol-free toner. She noticed Thayer&#x27;s decreased redness and imroved her complexsion (almost no breakouts anymore). I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was previously using the lush tea tree toner and, when I ran out, I quickly wanted to find something that did the job but cheaper. My skin is oily and very problematic, so if something does not work for my skin I will find out within a day or so. Coming across this body shop tea tree toner, I was sort of hesitant because I&#x27;ve never purchased anything from this brand, but decided to take a chance anyway because of the reviews. I have been using this toner for 3 or more weeks now and I absolutely love it. It does not break me out, cleans better than the lush toner, calms the redness, and it is also a better price! The fragrance is a bit strange but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. All-in-all, I absolutely am in love with this toner, I will be repurchasing and recommending!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product to who have sensitive skin like me. I had read many feedbacks on the body shop website carefully before I decided to buy it. But, it is very disappointed. It makes your skin very dry, when I apply on my face, I feel hot like my face is burnt, I dont know does it have alcohol or not but I stop using this product after that</li>
            <li> AMAZZING. Disinfects gently. My skin is a little sensitive and I had no problems. No heavy scent left behind after using. Leaves skin feeling clean. Evens skin tone.</li>
            <li> I read rave reviews about this online but I think it just made me break out more. I do like that is all natural though.</li>
            <li> I just received my toner, it was just in the box and not even bubble wrapped pr packaged properly and no instructions, when I opened it up their wasn&#x27;t even foil or anything on the cap, which makes me think they diluted it. im feeling some type of way now! never again.</li>
            <li> This is very harsh, I ended up with what looked like/felt like a sunburn and my skin peeled off, that was only with once daily use for a couple days. It did help my acne, but that&#x27;s because it removed the entire first layer of skin.</li>
            <li> Skin products are different for everyone BUT I am 28 and have had serious acne since I was 12. I&#x27;ve tried really expensive prescriptions and everything otc. I added this toner into my care routine and see a HUGE difference! It smells great and works great! For this price, it is worth the try!!</li>
            <li> The scent of Teatree wakes up my nose! I love the way this stuff makes my skin feel. Clean and refreshed. I have really oil eSCAN with really large pores and my face usually never feels clean. That is not the case when using this product.</li>
            <li> not the first time, good</li>
            <li> This tonic its so perfect. Theirs ingredients realy work. My face its cleany and cleary</li>
            <li> Very harsh. would not recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
