            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>One of my favorite body washes.</li>
            <li>I think I was just expecting more, but I didn&#x27;t find this to be overly moisturizing or age defying.</li>
            <li>Great and cleans really well.</li>
            <li>I realized that not only did it have a good rating but also priced attractively.</li>
            <li>you can save more money.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin looks healthy</li>
            <li>love the product.</li>
            <li>Got this as a promotional item, but I love all of the Oil of Olay products, so I will probably keep on getting it.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate that I can buy it online but wish it were a better price.</li>
            <li>What more could I want?</li>

            <li>glad</li>
            <li>/&gt;With stacking a coupon + subscribe and save, I was able to try Olay Age Defying body wash for just under two bucks.</li>
            <li>I love Olay</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Olay - please don&#x27;t ever stop making this. :)</li>
            <li>So I started using them, and I love the Age Defying products</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t do without this product and most of the Oil of Olay line</li>
            <li>I love this body wash.</li>
            <li>Olay has always been my favorite go to brand.</li>
            <li>and i love that its age defying.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this body wash I have seen improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>.. love this scent.</li>
            <li>Awesome body wash for dry skin.</li>
            <li>(perhaps too clean!)</li>
            <li>Perfect for winter dry skin!</li>
            <li>I love these products clean clean clean!!&#x27;</li>
            <li>lovely fragrance but not overpowering, and this body wash leaves skin silky smooth</li>
            <li>Nice Fresh, creamy soapy lather</li>
            <li>This wash feels so good, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Very nice and soft on my skin</li>
            <li>It does lather nicely and I felt clean after using it, but I don&#x27;t think any of the &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; claims are remotely true.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves skin feeling so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>, they have a great scent, leave my skin silky soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance and rinses off without leaving residue.</li>
            <li>, thought  I would try this out to see how it smelt and if I would enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this body wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap for the product you get.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this for several years now and she is happy with it.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth and refreashing.</li>
            <li>Also important is the fact that it delivers on its moisturizing promises!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fabulous body wash.  </li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful and it washes off easily, no greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li>I am already familiar with this product.</li>
            <li>The low price of this wash was a great incentive, but ultimately the mid-range rating on Good Guide (dot com) of 5.8 made me want to try this product.</li>
            <li>skin feels good after first use...but the fragrance is like the handsoap that sat in grandma&#x27;s second bathroom never used.... and is too strong!.</li>
            <li>You do feel clean and pampered after using this body wash, though.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>and it does a great job moisturizing, which is super important to me because my skin is so dry.  </li>
            <li>Great for my dry skin!</li>
            <li>Overall a good price for the size of the body wash.</li>
            <li>Overall good wash</li>
            <li>These days I&#x27;m big on what goes in and ON my body, so the fact that the ingredients in this creamy soap are for the most part safe is extremely important.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good body wash</li>
            <li>The claim of softer and smooth skin proves to be true in my case.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best body wash!</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean, fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I normally love Olay products, but this particular item did not work well for me.  </li>
            <li>The Age Defying version doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; which I think fools people into thinking it&#x27;s not as good, but it is the best I have ever used in my late 30s dry skin.</li>
            <li>quick shippping</li>
            <li>Good for dry winter skin .</li>
            <li>Love the smell and how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li>I want a powerful soap that has a lingering smell.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite body wash of all time.</li>
            <li>It does feel refreshing and has a nice scent although not sure exactly what it is!</li>
            <li>have since switched to Aveeno and my skin is so super soft, smooth and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>dont know if really does any age defying, but my skin is soft after use so maybe doing it&#x27;s magic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years and this size is good to have and is about half size of the norm.</li>
            <li>I like the texture and fragrance of this body wash very much.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating!</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>But check nearby stores first.</li>
            <li>This body wash smells so god and makes your skin feel soft as you wash and silky when rinsed,  A truly fabulous body wash.</li>
            <li>Pretty run of the mill body wash.</li>
            <li>Even the skin on my neck is soft and smooth after using this for two or three days.</li>
            <li>My favorite bodywash, Oil  of Olay, just wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>is a great product and in reality one needs only a little as the liquid is rich and creamy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels nice on the body instead of using some other body washes I have used.</li>
            <li>The Amazon bottle MAY be a good value if you do NOT have a similar local source.</li>
            <li>Pretty gentle.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves your body soft feeling all day long</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and far from overpowering.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for my very dry winter skin, but I am not sure how much it does for age defying.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying this at the grocery store because I had a large coupon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good price for this online but with the subscribe and save and a coupon and can work out if you&#x27;re ordering anyway.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really does moisturizes your body while it also cleans well.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin much softer and smells nicer.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price and bottle size.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for quite some time, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I think what sold me is the age defying title, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for your skin.</li>
            <li>Once I step out, I can&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
            <li>But, I use body mist/ perfume/ lotion, so I don&#x27;t really care about the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is nice and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have tried two other brands, and I like this the most.</li>
            <li>But nope, smells to much like a older ladies body soap.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a big bottle one, overall, love the feeling after shower.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth that cost, as this is a small bottle (in fact, the smaller 13.5 oz size is a good thing as no wash goes to waste AND the bottle easily fits in the shower).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The product is something I will continue to buy and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Better than using a harsh soap and a separate moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>If you can use a product only one time and tell a difference it may just be worth the money.</li>
            <li>I enjoy other Olay products</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin super moisturized, but doesn&#x27;t leave It dry either.</li>
            <li>My skin actually felt somewhat dry after using, which really surprised me, as I generally love Olay products.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again although not on a regular basis, in order to try other products that might  improve skin quality more..</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend trying a small bottle from a local store first to make sure it works for you before buying it on Amazon - that way</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why Olay Shea Butter Body Wash had better reviews..</li>
            <li>I usually use dove and this seems to moisturize better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff as usual.  </li>
            <li>skin is now more supple and needs much less lotion during the course of the day, and my back</li>
            <li>I made a HUGE mistake and bought of few of these without noticing (slap forehead) that they were 13.5 oz and NOT 23.5 oz.</li>
            <li>Helps keep this old skins from cracking and bleeding even in the summer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get a feel of extra moisture or anything with this stuff.</li>
            <li>makes my skin always soft and silk.</li>
            <li>and my husband always says my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have old skin (in my 20s), so I cannot comment on that part.</li>
            <li>not necessarily perfume-y like most heavily scented body washes on the market.</li>
            <li>: use a few drops on a loofa, then repeat if necessary for more bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend the product from your local HEB or whatever grocery store is near you but not this seller.</li>
            <li>However the truth is that as I got older my skin has started to lose its natural moisture which developed a dry flaky texture.&lt;br /&gt;After researching this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this product manages to dry out my skin when it&#x27;s got a whole jar of moisturizer inside (per the package), but it does.</li>
            <li>I did not really notice a difference in my skin as far as looks, but, it lathers well, and it is gentle to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not crazy about the smell, I prefer less perfume smell to my soaps.</li>
            <li>No other product can come close.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry skin especially if you live in a cold, unforgiving climate.</li>
            <li>I tolerate the scent only because it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Both Wal-Mart and Kroger near me sell the 23.5oz bottles for $4.99 and $5.49 respectively.</li>
            <li>Yes, as the body wash formula includes Olay facial moisturizer, this smells like goopy \\&quot;old lady soap.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I can confirm that using this Olay body wash daily has really prevented dry skin this winter.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling hydrated but it&#x27;s better than other drying washes/ soap bars I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I still use a little lotion afterwards but do not use no where near as much lotion afterwards as what I was using before this product.</li>
            <li>to love Olay products in the past but this body wash totally dried out my skin</li>
            <li>I do have fairly dry skin naturally, but this is the only body wash I&#x27;ve ever used that sends me running for lotion as soon as I towel off.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I like most Olay products which is one reason I ordered it.</li>
            <li> is a problem for many people.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> One of my favorite body washes.</li>
            <li> I think I was just expecting more, but I didn&#x27;t find this to be overly moisturizing or age defying.</li>
            <li> Great and cleans really well.</li>
            <li> I realized that not only did it have a good rating but also priced attractively.</li>
            <li> you can save more money.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin looks healthy</li>
            <li> love the product.</li>
            <li> Got this as a promotional item, but I love all of the Oil of Olay products, so I will probably keep on getting it.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that I can buy it online but wish it were a better price.</li>
            <li> What more could I want?</li>
            <li> love this product..</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my skin.</li>

            <li> Love this body wash .</li>
            <li> Should have researched it better based on oz.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> glad</li>
            <li> /&gt;With stacking a coupon + subscribe and save, I was able to try Olay Age Defying body wash for just under two bucks.</li>
            <li> I love Olay</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Olay - please don&#x27;t ever stop making this. :)</li>
            <li> So I started using them, and I love the Age Defying products</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t do without this product and most of the Oil of Olay line</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> Olay has always been my favorite go to brand.</li>
            <li> and i love that its age defying.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body wash I have seen improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> .. love this scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome body wash for dry skin.</li>
            <li> (perhaps too clean!)</li>
            <li> Perfect for winter dry skin!</li>
            <li> I love these products clean clean clean!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> lovely fragrance but not overpowering, and this body wash leaves skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> Nice Fresh, creamy soapy lather</li>
            <li> This wash feels so good, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very nice and soft on my skin</li>
            <li> It does lather nicely and I felt clean after using it, but I don&#x27;t think any of the &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; claims are remotely true.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves skin feeling so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> , they have a great scent, leave my skin silky soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance and rinses off without leaving residue.</li>
            <li> , thought  I would try this out to see how it smelt and if I would enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this body wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap for the product you get.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for several years now and she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth and refreashing.</li>
            <li> Also important is the fact that it delivers on its moisturizing promises!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fabulous body wash.  </li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful and it washes off easily, no greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> I am already familiar with this product.</li>
            <li> The low price of this wash was a great incentive, but ultimately the mid-range rating on Good Guide (dot com) of 5.8 made me want to try this product.</li>
            <li> skin feels good after first use...but the fragrance is like the handsoap that sat in grandma&#x27;s second bathroom never used.... and is too strong!.</li>
            <li> You do feel clean and pampered after using this body wash, though.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> and it does a great job moisturizing, which is super important to me because my skin is so dry.  </li>
            <li> Great for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> Overall a good price for the size of the body wash.</li>
            <li> Overall good wash</li>
            <li> These days I&#x27;m big on what goes in and ON my body, so the fact that the ingredients in this creamy soap are for the most part safe is extremely important.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good body wash</li>
            <li> The claim of softer and smooth skin proves to be true in my case.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best body wash!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean, fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I normally love Olay products, but this particular item did not work well for me.  </li>
            <li> The Age Defying version doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; which I think fools people into thinking it&#x27;s not as good, but it is the best I have ever used in my late 30s dry skin.</li>
            <li> quick shippping</li>
            <li> Good for dry winter skin .</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li> I want a powerful soap that has a lingering smell.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite body wash of all time.</li>
            <li> It does feel refreshing and has a nice scent although not sure exactly what it is!</li>
            <li> have since switched to Aveeno and my skin is so super soft, smooth and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dont know if really does any age defying, but my skin is soft after use so maybe doing it&#x27;s magic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years and this size is good to have and is about half size of the norm.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and fragrance of this body wash very much.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> But check nearby stores first.</li>
            <li> This body wash smells so god and makes your skin feel soft as you wash and silky when rinsed,  A truly fabulous body wash.</li>
            <li> Pretty run of the mill body wash.</li>
            <li> Even the skin on my neck is soft and smooth after using this for two or three days.</li>
            <li> My favorite bodywash, Oil  of Olay, just wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> is a great product and in reality one needs only a little as the liquid is rich and creamy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels nice on the body instead of using some other body washes I have used.</li>
            <li> The Amazon bottle MAY be a good value if you do NOT have a similar local source.</li>
            <li> Pretty gentle.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and leaves your body soft feeling all day long</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and far from overpowering.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for my very dry winter skin, but I am not sure how much it does for age defying.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this at the grocery store because I had a large coupon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good price for this online but with the subscribe and save and a coupon and can work out if you&#x27;re ordering anyway.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It really does moisturizes your body while it also cleans well.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin much softer and smells nicer.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and bottle size.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite some time, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I think what sold me is the age defying title, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for your skin.</li>
            <li> Once I step out, I can&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
            <li> But, I use body mist/ perfume/ lotion, so I don&#x27;t really care about the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is nice and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have tried two other brands, and I like this the most.</li>
            <li> But nope, smells to much like a older ladies body soap.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a big bottle one, overall, love the feeling after shower.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth that cost, as this is a small bottle (in fact, the smaller 13.5 oz size is a good thing as no wash goes to waste AND the bottle easily fits in the shower).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product is something I will continue to buy and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Better than using a harsh soap and a separate moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> If you can use a product only one time and tell a difference it may just be worth the money.</li>
            <li> I enjoy other Olay products</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin super moisturized, but doesn&#x27;t leave It dry either.</li>
            <li> My skin actually felt somewhat dry after using, which really surprised me, as I generally love Olay products.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again although not on a regular basis, in order to try other products that might  improve skin quality more..</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend trying a small bottle from a local store first to make sure it works for you before buying it on Amazon - that way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why Olay Shea Butter Body Wash had better reviews..</li>
            <li> I usually use dove and this seems to moisturize better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff as usual.  </li>
            <li> skin is now more supple and needs much less lotion during the course of the day, and my back</li>
            <li> I made a HUGE mistake and bought of few of these without noticing (slap forehead) that they were 13.5 oz and NOT 23.5 oz.</li>
            <li> Helps keep this old skins from cracking and bleeding even in the summer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get a feel of extra moisture or anything with this stuff.</li>
            <li> makes my skin always soft and silk.</li>
            <li> and my husband always says my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have old skin (in my 20s), so I cannot comment on that part.</li>
            <li> not necessarily perfume-y like most heavily scented body washes on the market.</li>
            <li> : use a few drops on a loofa, then repeat if necessary for more bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend the product from your local HEB or whatever grocery store is near you but not this seller.</li>
            <li> However the truth is that as I got older my skin has started to lose its natural moisture which developed a dry flaky texture.&lt;br /&gt;After researching this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product manages to dry out my skin when it&#x27;s got a whole jar of moisturizer inside (per the package), but it does.</li>
            <li> I did not really notice a difference in my skin as far as looks, but, it lathers well, and it is gentle to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not crazy about the smell, I prefer less perfume smell to my soaps.</li>
            <li> No other product can come close.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry skin especially if you live in a cold, unforgiving climate.</li>
            <li> I tolerate the scent only because it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Both Wal-Mart and Kroger near me sell the 23.5oz bottles for $4.99 and $5.49 respectively.</li>
            <li> Yes, as the body wash formula includes Olay facial moisturizer, this smells like goopy \\&quot;old lady soap.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I can confirm that using this Olay body wash daily has really prevented dry skin this winter.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling hydrated but it&#x27;s better than other drying washes/ soap bars I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I still use a little lotion afterwards but do not use no where near as much lotion afterwards as what I was using before this product.</li>
            <li> to love Olay products in the past but this body wash totally dried out my skin</li>
            <li> I do have fairly dry skin naturally, but this is the only body wash I&#x27;ve ever used that sends me running for lotion as soon as I towel off.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t even feel that soft after showers... works just like any other lower priced shower wash</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a little pampering and indulgence.</li>
            <li> This variety of Body Wash is becoming difficult to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> My S-I-L&#x27;s mother once stated ( a long time ago) that she only uses Oil of Olay products-</li>
            <li> the second I towel off my skin is extremely dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for the age defying properties, but definitely helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My 30-something year old skin has developed serious dryness issues, especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s older</li>
            <li> It actually helps my dry skin long after ther shower!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong, I&#x27;m just sensitive to it, would prefer they don&#x27;t add any perfume at all.</li>
            <li> I use other Olay products and really like them, so I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is.</li>
            <li> This winter I did not have a problem with dry skin while using this product.</li>
            <li> As for improving skin, I don&#x27;t see any differences, but it&#x27;s winter and dry skin  </li>
            <li> Winters are the biggest reasons for dry skin-</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have dry</li>
            <li> (like I was), or have eczema or extremely dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Smells a little strong and the liquid is a little thin.</li>
            <li> I realized the other day, after using OADMBW for a few months, I didn&#x27;t need that gadget because my feet were not dry and skin was softer.</li>
            <li> Was as I expected</li>
            <li> Any moisturizing soap can take care of average dry skin, but when your heels feel like leather</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, subtle and well hydrated.</li>
            <li> (you know the spot I&#x27;m talking about) is much less dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> She will to use any other body soap.</li>
            <li> I have only used Dove for the longest time but for past 5 months I have been using this</li>
            <li> I got this due to having no way to stores as often as I would like.</li>
            <li> Not exactly \\&quot;age defying,\\</li>
            <li> the extra long showers and the dry chilly air make the skin extra flaky and dry.</li>
            <li> common ingredient in personal care products, sodium lauryl sulfate, or SLS, is an additive that allows cleansing products to foam.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said they found it for 2-something, and at the time of this review the price is 12-something, so I guess it can be a good deal or a really terrible one, depending on what price you catch it at.</li>
            <li> I purchased thinking the bottle would be the typical size sold in nearby stores, but it was much smaller, so it was not a good value for me.</li>
            <li> This product definitely moisturizes.only bad thing is it is very think and hard to rinse.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, but it is heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and unfortunately after about two weeks of use I had to discontinue using the product.</li>
            <li> Very little needed to get alot of soap.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry to rate this item so low</li>
            <li> I periodically consider getting one of those pedi- something or others -- you know that gadget that takes hard skin off your feet?</li>
            <li> I hardly use lotions.</li>
            <li> too thick.</li>
            <li> The smell is not a good</li>
            <li> Not really a good deal.</li>
            <li> Consider something less artificial ...herbal and earthy.</li>
            <li> I hate to take time to use body lotion in the winter, but my skin always gets so dry.</li>
            <li> I work in the cold which dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> Buy it you will NOT be disappointed!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes the tub gritty!  Best to use in shower only.</li>
            <li> Product itself is okay. Moisturizing, but it is heavily perfumed. I tolerate the scent only because it makes my skin soft.

            <li> Wonderful product for my very dry winter skin, but I am not sure how much it does for age defying. Overall a good price for the size of the body wash.</li>
            <li> Leave skin very smooth</li>
            <li> too thick. cap does not work well.</li>
            <li> im still using it i bought this a while ago..</li>
            <li> Has sodium lauryl sulfate as an ingredient. If Olay would remove it I would probably try it again.  \\&quot;A common ingredient in personal care products, sodium lauryl sulfate, or SLS, is an additive that allows cleansing products to foam. According to the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetic Safety Database, SLS is a \\&quot;moderate hazard\\&quot; that has been linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, organ toxicity, skin irritation and endocrine disruption.\\&quot;  [...]</li>
            <li> My collage student buys this all the time and swears by it.  She will to use any other body soap.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how soft it makes my skin. Much better than most body washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it. I did not really notice a difference in my skin as far as looks, but, it lathers well, and it is gentle to use.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash. Leaves your skin so smooth and soft.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great scent and foams up nicely.</li>
            <li> Really worked well softens skin, smells great!</li>
            <li> Helps keep this old skins from cracking and bleeding even in the summer.</li>
            <li> Im a male, thought  I would try this out to see how it smelt and if I would enjoy it. But nope, smells to much like a older ladies body soap.</li>
            <li> Love my Olay - auto ship, loving it!</li>
            <li> very good. Was as I expected</li>
            <li> I made a HUGE mistake and bought of few of these without noticing (slap forehead) that they were 13.5 oz and NOT 23.5 oz. Both Wal-Mart and Kroger near me sell the 23.5oz bottles for $4.99 and $5.49 respectively. So I paid almost double what I should have. The Amazon bottle MAY be a good value if you do NOT have a similar local source. But check nearby stores first.</li>
            <li> works very good.  thought the bottle would be bigger though.</li>
            <li> I love the lather and the moisturizing effect it has on the skin. I&#x27;m just not crazy about the smell, I prefer less perfume smell to my soaps. It&#x27;s not strong, I&#x27;m just sensitive to it, would prefer they don&#x27;t add any perfume at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I work in the cold which dries my skin out. This winter I did not have a problem with dry skin while using this product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this body wash. I like most Olay products which is one reason I ordered it. It does feel refreshing and has a nice scent although not sure exactly what it is! As for improving skin, I don&#x27;t see any differences, but it&#x27;s winter and dry skin  is a problem for many people. You do feel clean and pampered after using this body wash, though. I would buy it again although not on a regular basis, in order to try other products that might  improve skin quality more..</li>
            <li> What can I add to Olay products.  This body wash smells so god and makes your skin feel soft as you wash and silky when rinsed,  A truly fabulous body wash.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It adds moisture to my skin without feeling as though I cant rinse it off. It smell wonderful and the scent stays with me all day. I Would and have recomended this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This body wash is great.It smells amazing and leaves your body soft feeling all day long</li>
            <li> Works well third time purchased</li>
            <li> Body soap is very good and my skin was smooth and soft and also smell good. Great day to you and amazon are doing good job to sent it out on time.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Leaves my skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li> This body wash truly is the best one I&#x27;ve used so far.  It really does moisturizes your body while it also cleans well.  I have only used Dove for the longest time but for past 5 months I have been using this and I don&#x27;t see myself ever going back to Dove.</li>
            <li> I am already familiar with this product. I decided to start ordering from you. All Olay products are great.. Toni</li>
            <li> Smells great! Love it</li>
            <li> Pretty run of the mill body wash. I didn&#x27;t really get a feel of extra moisture or anything with this stuff. It does lather nicely and I felt clean after using it, but I don&#x27;t think any of the &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; claims are remotely true. If you get a good deal on it though, it works just fine. Just don&#x27;t expect any miracles. Use lotion or oil if you need extra moisture in your skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice and soft on my skin</li>
            <li> My wife and I purchased several items. Easier for her to explain what she thought so here she is.  Ok.  I would definitely purchase this again without hesitation. The scent is wonderful and it washes off easily, no greasy feel to it. My skin feels softer and silky.  I still use a little lotion afterwards but do not use no where near as much lotion afterwards as what I was using before this product. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a little pampering and indulgence.</li>
            <li> Pretty gentle. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin super moisturized, but doesn&#x27;t leave It dry either. Good product for the price. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Bought for a promotional price of $2.82 on 9/23/14. No comment about the actual product, seems like pretty ordinary body wash (no qualms with it) but for the price it was great!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite body washes. It leaves my skin much softer and smells nicer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Olay&#x27;s body wash, this smells so good and keeps my skin from drying out! I buy this one and the regulary yellow looking bottle. they are both great with one jar of lotion in each one, can defiantly tell its in there.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I just wish they had more scents. I want a powerful soap that has a lingering smell. This is not that but if you are looking for moisture this rocks..</li>
            <li> Larger bottle for same price at stores cheaper than this. I got this due to having no way to stores as often as I would like.</li>
            <li> Smells great dont know if really does any age defying, but my skin is soft after use so maybe doing it&#x27;s magic</li>
            <li> I think I was just expecting more, but I didn&#x27;t find this to be overly moisturizing or age defying. My skin actually felt somewhat dry after using, which really surprised me, as I generally love Olay products. This one just missed the mark for me.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and fragrance of this body wash very much. I enjoy other Olay products so I believe I will also use this and buy it again.Can&#x27;t tell yet how age-defying it is! Reasonable price and bottle size.</li>
            <li> it was on sale , so I gave it a try. Feels like I&#x27;m bathing in lotion rather than a lighter body wash.</li>
            <li> Overall good wash but it&#x27;s not like the one I purchased at the grocery store.  The smell is not a good and it&#x27;s not as think.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s older and that&#x27;s the issue but I&#x27;ll purchase this at the grocery store from now on to get the fresher smell and thickness.  The one I purchased at the grocery store was EXCELLENT.  I got many compliments about how good I smelled when I used it and it does a great job moisturizing, which is super important to me because my skin is so dry.  I&#x27;d HIGHLY recommend the product from your local HEB or whatever grocery store is near you but not this seller.</li>
            <li> Great and cleans really well. Cannot describe how happy my wife was with this product. It&#x27;s cheap for the product you get.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product manages to dry out my skin when it&#x27;s got a whole jar of moisturizer inside (per the package), but it does. This wash works well and feels good in the shower but the second I towel off my skin is extremely dry and itchy. I do have fairly dry skin naturally, but this is the only body wash I&#x27;ve ever used that sends me running for lotion as soon as I towel off.  Otherwise my skin starts burning and feeling like it&#x27;s going to crack. I use other Olay products and really like them, so I&#x27;m not sure what the issue is. I still gave it two stars because the smell is pleasant and it does get me clean (perhaps too clean!) so it might be an allergy or sensitivity issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If possible I&#x27;d recommend trying a small bottle from a local store first to make sure it works for you before buying it on Amazon - that way you can price it out, as well.  If you can&#x27;t get it locally I&#x27;d try one bottle from Amazon before stocking up, just in case.</li>
            <li> I normally love Olay products, but this particular item did not work well for me.  I have sensitive skin and unfortunately after about two weeks of use I had to discontinue using the product. Next time I will have to look into their line that caters to that skin type.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling clean and moisturized.  Better than using a harsh soap and a separate moisturizer.  Definitely will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Winters are the biggest reasons for dry skin- the extra long showers and the dry chilly air make the skin extra flaky and dry. However the truth is that as I got older my skin has started to lose its natural moisture which developed a dry flaky texture.&lt;br /&gt;After researching this I realized that not only did it have a good rating but also priced attractively. I purchased this product for $ 2.39 cents for 13.5 oz  which comes up to 17 cents an ounce.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and in reality one needs only a little as the liquid is rich and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;If you can stack subscribe and save - you can save more money.</li>
            <li> I periodically consider getting one of those pedi- something or others -- you know that gadget that takes hard skin off your feet? I realized the other day, after using OADMBW for a few months, I didn&#x27;t need that gadget because my feet were not dry and skin was softer. Any moisturizing soap can take care of average dry skin, but when your heels feel like leather and then they don&#x27;t -- that&#x27;s some good stuff. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best body wash! Smells amazing. Get out of the shower feeling like you have already applied your daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for several years now and she is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin looks healthy</li>
            <li> I am sorry to rate this item so low but it caused me to break out in a rash all over every time I used it. It took me a while to decide what was causing the rash but when I quit using the product I have cleared up.</li>
            <li> was charged 13.49 for one bottle.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth and refreashing.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite body wash of all time. I&#x27;m not sure why Olay Shea Butter Body Wash had better reviews.. The Age Defying version doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; which I think fools people into thinking it&#x27;s not as good, but it is the best I have ever used in my late 30s dry skin. No other product can come close.  Even the skin on my neck is soft and smooth after using this for two or three days.</li>
            <li> My favorite bodywash, Oil  of Olay, just wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing body wash and the scent is nice without being overpowering.  Perfect for winter dry skin!</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised and on time.</li>
            <li> it makes ur skin feel amazing</li>
            <li> Awesome body wash for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling silky.</li>
            <li> Nice Fresh, creamy soapy lather</li>
            <li> great body wash. makes my skin always soft and silk.</li>
            <li> love the product. I usually use dove and this seems to moisturize better.</li>
            <li> Easily the best body wash that I have ever used. I don&#x27;t even need to use lotion and my husband always says my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Got this as a promotional item, but I love all of the Oil of Olay products, so I will probably keep on getting it.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite some time, and I really like it. The scent is pleasing, too. I have tried two other brands, and I like this the most. It works well! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The smell of lavender and roses, oh what a smell, simply wonderful. I love smelling good and this body wash is perfect, perfect moisturizers, rich and silky lathering and leaves my skin ever-so-soft. I hardly use lotions. I am forever a customer of OLAY AGE DEFYING BODY WASH</li>
            <li> THIS BODY WASH IS AMAZING!! If you can use a product only one time and tell a difference it may just be worth the money. My skin is soft, subtle and well hydrated. I can even use it to shave with. The scent is mild and far from overpowering. Buy it you will NOT be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Feels nice on the body instead of using some other body washes I have used.</li>
            <li> This variety of Body Wash is becoming difficult to find in the stores.  I appreciate that I can buy it online but wish it were a better price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Leaves my skin clean, fresh and moisturized. Amazon has great prices. What more could I want?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for sometime now and like the results.  The claim of softer and smooth skin proves to be true in my case.</li>
            <li> Overpowering fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels good after first use...but the fragrance is like the handsoap that sat in grandma&#x27;s second bathroom never used.... and is too strong!. Consider something less artificial ...herbal and earthy. ..Olay. Scent too dated.</li>
            <li> love this product.. so silky feeling..</li>
            <li> Great product, Try this for your skin, it will love you for it!!</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash.  Love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> got for Christmas stocking stuffer.  I am sure it will be great.</li>
            <li> This is a nice body wash. Doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance and rinses off without leaving residue.</li>
            <li> Not upto the expectation</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I love the moisturizing effect &amp; the scent is sooo nice!</li>
            <li> Love this body wash . Fragrance is very nice and lingers well after you step out of the shower . Good for dry winter skin .</li>
            <li> I hate to take time to use body lotion in the winter, but my skin always gets so dry. I thought I would try a moisturizing body wash instead. I can confirm that using this Olay body wash daily has really prevented dry skin this winter. I can&#x27;t vouch for the age defying properties, but definitely helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the &amp;#34;larger&amp;#34; bottle based on price. Should have researched it better based on oz. The value is the same price as the larger bottle purchased locally. Not really a good deal.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.  Smells a little strong and the liquid is a little thin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get home to take a shower with this one</li>
            <li> Love this stuff as usual.  Came on time.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The body wash is great. I&#x27;ve used it for years and this size is good to have and is about half size of the norm. It&#x27;s hard to find a good price for this online but with the subscribe and save and a coupon and can work out if you&#x27;re ordering anyway. The product is something I will continue to buy and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this body wash. It makes your skin feel very soft and the smell is so amazing!!</li>
            <li> This wash feels so good, very moisturizing. Fragrance is nice and not too heavy.  Would buy again, and will. Great product.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying this at the grocery store because I had a large coupon and it was a larger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used to love Olay products in the past but this body wash totally dried out my skin and I don&#x27;t even have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since switched to Aveeno and my skin is so super soft, smooth and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad, I stopped using this because with each use; I was developing drier and drier skin.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a big bottle one, overall, love the feeling after shower.</li>
            <li> No complaints here...</li>
            <li> My 30-something year old skin has developed serious dryness issues, especially during the winter months. The low price of this wash was a great incentive, but ultimately the mid-range rating on Good Guide (dot com) of 5.8 made me want to try this product. These days I&#x27;m big on what goes in and ON my body, so the fact that the ingredients in this creamy soap are for the most part safe is extremely important. Also important is the fact that it delivers on its moisturizing promises!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is now more supple and needs much less lotion during the course of the day, and my back (you know the spot I&#x27;m talking about) is much less dry and itchy. This also works great as a shaving cream. Yes, as the body wash formula includes Olay facial moisturizer, this smells like goopy \\&quot;old lady soap.\\&quot;  Meaning it smells formulaic, but not necessarily perfume-y like most heavily scented body washes on the market. The lather is so-so: use a few drops on a loofa, then repeat if necessary for more bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With stacking a coupon + subscribe and save, I was able to try Olay Age Defying body wash for just under two bucks. Definitely worth that cost, as this is a small bottle (in fact, the smaller 13.5 oz size is a good thing as no wash goes to waste AND the bottle easily fits in the shower). Not exactly \\&quot;age defying,\\&quot; but it cleans and moisturizes wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I love Olay they are always awesome!</li>
            <li> I think what sold me is the age defying title, but it doesn&#x27;t do much for your skin. My skin doesn&#x27;t even feel that soft after showers... works just like any other lower priced shower wash</li>
            <li> Everyone should like this. A jar of moisturizer in each container they claim. Probably not but feels like it. No soapy residue - feels like washing with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Was expecting a bigger bottle.  Not big enough to last a month. Good product otherwise.</li>
            <li> smells good.  My wife likes the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love these products clean clean clean!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have tried a LOT of body washes &amp; this one has impressed me a lot. It says it has 1 jar of moisturizer added to it. I think it&#x27;s true. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling hydrated but it&#x27;s better than other drying washes/ soap bars I have used in the past. Even if I forget to use the moisterizer after using this body wash, my skin doesn&#x27;t start drying/ flaking/ itching atleast for the next 6-8hrs. Yes, I DO have to apply the moisturizer  or else my skin will start troubling me. The fragrance is nice but I can only smell it as I am showering. Once I step out, I can&#x27;t really smell it. But, I use body mist/ perfume/ lotion, so I don&#x27;t really care about the fragrance. I don&#x27;t have old skin (in my 20s), so I cannot comment on that part. Overall, it&#x27;s a good body wash but I won&#x27;t recommend it if you are only looking for a body wash with hydration powers only (like I was), or have eczema or extremely dry, flaky skin. 😊</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. It actually helps my dry skin long after ther shower!!</li>
            <li> Fabulous body wash.  Very little needed to get alot of soap.  Smells great and leaves skin feeling so soft and smooth.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> This body wash smells like my last Jamaican vacation - I will never buy another kind. It&#x27;s just silky delightful-smelling bliss in a bottle. Olay - please don&#x27;t ever stop making this. :)</li>
            <li> Good body wash.  Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> My S-I-L&#x27;s mother once stated ( a long time ago) that she only uses Oil of Olay products- and she had beautiful skin, IMO.  So I started using them, and I love the Age Defying products, they have a great scent, leave my skin silky soft and smooth.  I won&#x27;t do without this product and most of the Oil of Olay line</li>
            <li> I like it, not too drying.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. My skin doesnt itch anymore. Even in the winter.</li>
            <li> Olay has always been my favorite go to brand. This body wash foams up well and i love that its age defying. It smells good and washes it off easily.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for your skin</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body wash I have seen improvement in my skin. Softer, and smoother.</li>
            <li> Great for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> This product definitely moisturizes.only bad thing is it is very think and hard to rinse.</li>
            <li> lovely fragrance but not overpowering, and this body wash leaves skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> quick shippping.. love this scent.</li>
            <li> I felt to oily afterwards made me break out</li>
    </ol>
