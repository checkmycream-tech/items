            <li> As the name implies they are compact (small</li>
            <li> If you are a Waterpic fan, you know these are not easy to find, at least here in Texas.  </li>
            <li> Very small head, but the picture is a regluar head.</li>
            <li> I  bought a Waterpik Complete system  and found it very difficult to replace the brush element until I found them on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> i find reviews here are unfair</li>
            <li> My husband and i have been using this toothbrush for about 2 years and do not miss our Sonicare with its expensive replacement brush heads!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> They look like perfect replacements for our Waterpik Complete Care Water Flosser and Sonic Toothbrush</li>
            <li> Came quickly, just as described. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t understand &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; which means 1/2 tooth at a time and it takes forever to brush my teeth. My two minute brush has turned into 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> worked great thank you.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted. Super fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. I was looking for the Compact Brush Head Refill for my Waterpik electric toothbrush. That is what I got. It is the same as the brush the unit came with. These smaller heads make brushing my teeth a much more pleasant experience. Price was good. Shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. Very small head, but the picture is a regluar head. Takes much longer to brush . This may be my mistake, but the should tell you the have more the one size head.</li>
            <li> I wanted and require the larger ones.  Could you send me the correct number to order them for all of my future orders?</li>
            <li> Gets very well behind my wisdom teeth. This brush lasts a very long time, I soak the head once a week in rubbing alcohol over night and rinse it after with hot water.</li>
            <li> I got the water system, is better than my stand alone Oral-B electric toothbrush. I can really recommend it .</li>
            <li> Have used Waterpik toothbrush in place of Soniccare for a couple years now.  Better pricing but same results.</li>
            <li> i find reviews here are unfair&lt;br /&gt;it is written that it is compact n there is the stander size&lt;br /&gt;its size similar to a child&#x27;s brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;n I am an adult  n love it&lt;br /&gt;i got it with my complete care waterpik&lt;br /&gt;it had this n the stander one&lt;br /&gt;at the beginning i used the stander daily&lt;br /&gt;but then i felt i cant reach  all my tooth  especially my wisdoms&#x27; ones ( which i am keeping )&lt;br /&gt;my dentist recommend that i try a kid toothbrush to reach them&lt;br /&gt;so i remembered that i had this one  n i tried  it&lt;br /&gt;n since then i didnt go back to the stander&lt;br /&gt;its much easier n more comfortable for me ( i may have a small mouth idk )&lt;br /&gt;n i dont see my self needing to use it for a longer time as some reviews stated here&lt;br /&gt;2 mins is  enough&lt;br /&gt;n i just had a dentist checkup last week  after 3 months of using it&lt;br /&gt;n my dentist was happy with my teeth  n told me there was no need for my visit!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i am  sticking with it n ordering more from the same size&lt;br /&gt;n would recommend it to anyone  who find it uncomfortable to brush his back teeth</li>
            <li> I ordered these at the same time as I ordered the machine. Got these in three days- a week before the machine! exactly as Ii expected</li>
            <li> it just was as my expect.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would, toothbrush is great and the flossing is easy to use and effective, glad we got it</li>
            <li> Happy to own a Waterpik, will recommend this item to family and friends. Dentist is very happy with the way dental checkups.</li>
            <li> As the name implies they are compact (small heads).&lt;br /&gt;I bought them my mistake.  I thought they were the same size as I was currently using.  Turns out that I like the smaller size better.  I have some teeth that are crooked and the compact head seems to clean better where the teeth overlap.  Also fit behind my back teeth easier.</li>
            <li> should of read more carefully its the small heads&lt;br /&gt;still good just should read the &amp;#34;Compact &amp;#34; for more understanding</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes, great service.</li>
            <li> Improved dental check-ups!</li>
            <li> these work very nicely. Give you a deep clean and feels like your getting a massage for your mouth. Truely work the money.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for compact brush heads this is your item.  I ordered them and they fit perfectly and was shipped fast.  I would like to find the regular size heads as well but have not been able to locate. I would buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for the small head brush that is kind of hard to find locally. Long lasting and like the small size as it seems to get in tight places towards the back of the teeth easier.</li>
            <li> good job, but only last about eight weeks</li>
            <li> Love it!  Compact head gets everywhere.  Perfect fit on the two-speed handle.</li>
            <li> Set of replacement heads just  to replace the worn out that came with the brush kit ..</li>
            <li> These fit my waterpik sonic brush.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a result of Consumer review magazine rating. VERY happy with our dental check-ups since switching. My husband and i have been using this toothbrush for about 2 years and do not miss our Sonicare with its expensive replacement brush heads!</li>
            <li> I  bought a Waterpik Complete system  and found it very difficult to replace the brush element until I found them on Amazon!

            <li> I was a little skeptical at first in ordering this because its been a lot of reviews about it was just one brush in the package however this is perfect. I also like the compact size because it gets way back in your mouth. when the time comes I will order from this company again</li>
