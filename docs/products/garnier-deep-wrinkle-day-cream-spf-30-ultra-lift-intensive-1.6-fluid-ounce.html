    <ol>
            <li>this was one of their best products.</li>
            <li>Received quickly - very happy.  </li>
            <li>Great company and I look forward to doing business with them again!</li>
            <li>Good Job !</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer with the SPF I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It is actually an amazing product!  </li>
            <li>What was even more impressive is that it was at my door in a couple days!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good with that.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Happy to have found it stores seems not to carry any more</li>
            <li>Most work great over and around the eye and don&#x27;t sting your eyes.</li>
            <li>Okay, let me just tell you that this stuff works!  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin looking great and virtually wrinkle free at age 67.</li>
            <li>but this is NOT a product I would recommend for anyones face based on my own experience.</li>
            <li>How I wish there were more good, unscented moisturizers out there!&lt;br</li>
            <li>- this one makes my skin really smooth and works better on the wrinkles and is great under my make-up.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is fantastic quality and if nothing else will give good hydration and the recommended SPF 30.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Most of my life I have used Olay products, but when I hit my forties, I needed something more.  </li>
            <li>Most people guess me to be around 36.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things I don&#x27;t love about this product:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things I love about this product:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Am I ordering more?</li>
            <li>so you should be able to apply makeup over top of it</li>
            <li>Glad I don&#x27;t have to use another SPF protection product.  </li>
            <li>and I break out with so many products, even in my 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My skin does look better after using this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>Hope I can keep getting it because I like it better than anything I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizing cream I have found for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It contains retinol and I feel confident that this cream will make some changes in the fine lines I have.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably been a year since I&#x27;ve used any Garnier products, (too many quality control/customer service issues!), but if I remember right</li>
            <li>More importantly I have seen no change in my skin.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel soft while providing great SPF protection.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy and blends easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Garnier products for their effectiveness and their easy on the budget cost.</li>
            <li>I am 48 years old with fair skin, which we all know tends to be more prone to wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Love this product just such a refreshing smell and a feel good feeling.</li>
            <li>that long)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use it on my neck and chest (and arms) and it seemed to work fine as a moisturizer there --</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, love this product.</li>
            <li>I am not saying this product replaces the effective protection of a beard, but you can certainly benefit from the 30 SPF.   </li>
            <li>Enjoy the savings and compliments.</li>
            <li>Use this item daily, works great.  </li>
            <li>cream is smooth and goes on silky.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but I may be too far gone.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;d rather focus on loving myself as I am than buy into our culture&#x27;s Cult of Youth, hating myself for the sin of getting older and spending a lot of time and money trying to counteract</li>
            <li>It imparts a strong shine to one&#x27;s skin - a quick blot with a tissue</li>
            <li>This cream is very light and it penetrates very well.</li>
            <li>and I do break out pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>(lucky you)</li>
            <li>Love that it has a high SPF.</li>
            <li>I really love this face cream and its high SPF</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several months and find it very satisfying.  </li>
            <li>helps it look more like a natural \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I smiled inside, knowing that I was actually three years older than her!  </li>
            <li>I have noticed great improvements in the reduction of wrinkles, some deep and some not so deep.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more likely to give you breakouts than anything else.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time worrying about my aging skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for several years.</li>
            <li>but my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying due to the sunscreen which is very very very important.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin, but my skin felt like it was burning when I used this.  </li>
            <li>This cream is very smooth going on and a nice bonus is the SPF factor, usually creams with SPF added are super greasy or heavy, I don&#x27;t find that this is.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 and still get oily in the T-zone, but I have wrinkles to fill and my face absolutely needs a lift</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her my real age.  </li>
            <li>If you have somewhat drier skin this will hydrate it and make it smoother and the sunscreen (SPF 30) is not irritating to my skin as others can be.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my 30-something, combination skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I have used this cream for years and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I rarely have a break out issue and all I do to my face is wash it with body soap in the shower and put lotion on it when I get out.</li>
            <li>long ago started using similar products by &amp;#34;Yalmeh&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Era Organics&amp;#34;, great products, terrific people,</li>
            <li>Can no longer find this particular cream in stores.  </li>
            <li>Highly perfumed.</li>
            <li>The high SPF.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>product feels more like a heavy night cream.</li>
            <li>I like this one much better than the one in the green container</li>
            <li>I live in south-Florida and the air has been a bit drier this winter.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this in store where I live (Midwest)</li>
            <li>I wanted a higher SPF and figured I could combat wrinkles at the same time with this.</li>
            <li>I had very immediate and positive results which compelled me to further pursue rebuilding my  damaged, aging 60 year old male</li>
            <li>Good sunscreen but heavy and a little greasey feeling</li>
            <li>I asked her how old she was.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a wrinkly 55-year-old - my aunt claims it&#x27;s in our genes, and looking at old family photos</li>
            <li>far as the ULTRA-LIFT, this did not \\&quot;tighten\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin as well and sometimes get itchy reactions, but so far this has not bothered me.</li>
            <li>People have guessed my age the highest so far 32, but I am 44.</li>
            <li>After a month of using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed obvious improvements in my skin texture and the lines around my eyes are becoming less visible.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who has deep wrinkle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and find it as effective as more expensive potions I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>A discerning friend asked yesterday whether I had a new facial regimen, going on at some length  about how glowing and youthful</li>
            <li>This product has clogged my pores, irritated my eyes and has a stench like no other.</li>
            <li>Smooth with hardly any wrinkles and almost no dark spots.  </li>
            <li>I wear makeup religiously and it clearly helps the makeup go on smoother if you give it a couple minutes to absorb.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made a tiny difference in my skin so far as wrinkles are concerned.</li>
            <li>, I barely slept because of drinking 3 glasses of wine.</li>
            <li>How pleasantly surprised I was that I not only found it online</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, this product does not make my face breakout or turn red.  </li>
            <li>When I wear it alone on a clean face it doesn&#x27;t feel too bad at first, but within an hour if I touch my face it feels very greasy - even in the non T-zone areas.</li>
            <li>The seeming lack of a single, natural ingredient kinda creeps me out.&lt;br /</li>

            <li> (maybe that comes only after a long period of daily use -</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> This is much less expensive than some of the other moisturizers and works as well or better.</li>
            <li> The only thing odd is that it makes my lips tingle whenever I apply it on them by mistake</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy but is thick enough that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it two weeks and now have a giant zit on my face and lots of little pimples, it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  been using this product for just a few weeks, and not even daily at that.</li>
            <li> Still have to be careful and not put on forehead as if you sweat and it runs into your eyes it still can sting.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but the cost is very reasonable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this product because it makes my eyes water....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably been a year since I&#x27;ve used any Garnier products, (too many quality control/customer service issues!), but if I remember right this was one of their best products. I had very immediate and positive results which compelled me to further pursue rebuilding my  damaged, aging 60 year old male face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I long ago started using similar products by &amp;#34;Yalmeh&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Era Organics&amp;#34;, great products, terrific people, my anger/aggravation/grief factor reduced to zero. Heads up, just sayin&#x27;...</li>
            <li> Great Product. I am unable to find in the store now so purchased on Amazon.  Received quickly - very happy.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Can no longer find this particular cream in stores.  This is the best moisturizing cream I have found for dry skin.  Not greasy and blends easily.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This cream is very smooth going on and a nice bonus is the SPF factor, usually creams with SPF added are super greasy or heavy, I don&#x27;t find that this is. It&#x27;s made a tiny difference in my skin so far as wrinkles are concerned. Over all I would purchace this again.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my sun damaged legs and arms.  I couple this product with Garnier 2 in 1 Ultra lift cream for my face.  I dilute everything with water before putting it on my face to prevent clogging my pores.  I have not had any trouble and I do break out pretty easily.  I have noticed great improvements in the reduction of wrinkles, some deep and some not so deep.  Around my eyes, above my upper lip, wrists, elbows and knees.  It is actually an amazing product!  I have used it for over a year.</li>
            <li> An oldie but a goodies for concealing tiny lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen but heavy and a little greasey feeling</li>
            <li> This cream just works for me.  I don&#x27;t know about the lifting part since my skin is not sagging at this time but it improves the texture.  I have tried expensive creams from Bancome, Elizabeth Larden, and Cliquenique (I don&#x27;t want to use actual brand names here, but use your infinite knowledge to guess which ones I am referring to).  I know those expensive products work really well for some, but they didn&#x27;t do squat for me.  This Garnier cream makes me look like I drank 8 glasses of water and got 8 hours of sleep when actually, I barely slept because of drinking 3 glasses of wine. It&#x27;s worth trying due to the sunscreen which is very very very important.  I am going off subject here, but I never appreciated the ugly effects of sun on the face until my husband grew a beard last summer.  He kept the beard on for 3 months and I was shocked at how much younger his skin looked after he shaved it off.  Smooth with hardly any wrinkles and almost no dark spots.  I am not saying this product replaces the effective protection of a beard, but you can certainly benefit from the 30 SPF.   I recommend putting the cream on in the morning, rub it in well, go do something else while it absorbs, like make your bed or pick up those clothes you threw on the floor, and then put on your make up.  If you don&#x27;t wear make up (lucky you) no need to wait a few minutes for it to absorb.  Buy it.  Love it.  Enjoy the savings and compliments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 and still get oily in the T-zone, but I have wrinkles to fill and my face absolutely needs a lift so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product feels more like a heavy night cream. I wouldn&#x27;t dare wear it under makeup. When I wear it alone on a clean face it doesn&#x27;t feel too bad at first, but within an hour if I touch my face it feels very greasy - even in the non T-zone areas. I didn&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;lifting\\&quot; of any deep wrinkles either (maybe that comes only after a long period of daily use - but I wasn&#x27;t about to try it on my face that long)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use it on my neck and chest (and arms) and it seemed to work fine as a moisturizer there -- but this is NOT a product I would recommend for anyones face based on my own experience. It&#x27;s more likely to give you breakouts than anything else.</li>
            <li> Use this item daily, works great.  Love that it has a high SPF.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason I cannot find this cream in the stores anymore. How pleasantly surprised I was that I not only found it online but it was cheaper than in the store. What was even more impressive is that it was at my door in a couple days! Great company and I look forward to doing business with them again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin, but my skin felt like it was burning when I used this.  Had to throw out</li>
            <li> Happy to have found it stores seems not to carry any more</li>
            <li> And I have tried a lot!  Most of my life I have used Olay products, but when I hit my forties, I needed something more.  I tried Expensive to less expensive products.  I am 48 years old with fair skin, which we all know tends to be more prone to wrinkles.  My skin has slight sagging around the jaw line and lines around my eyes including &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34;.  So I started using Garnier Ultra Lift Deep wrinkle day cream and combined it with the deep wrinkle night cream.  Both products together cost less than some of the other ones I tried.  Okay, let me just tell you that this stuff works!  My skin is smoother and brighter.  After a month of using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed obvious improvements in my skin texture and the lines around my eyes are becoming less visible.  The other day at work another woman was complaining about her age and all the woes of it.  She looked at me and said, &amp;#34;just wait till you get to be my age, you&#x27;l understand&amp;#34;.  I asked her how old she was.  She said 45.  I smiled inside, knowing that I was actually three years older than her!  I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her my real age.  Most people guess me to be around 36.  I&#x27;&#x27;m not telling.</li>
            <li> This is the item that I wanted.  Good Job !</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but Garnier isn&#x27;t making it anymore :(</li>
            <li> First off, let me say I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time worrying about my aging skin. I&#x27;m a wrinkly 55-year-old - my aunt claims it&#x27;s in our genes, and looking at old family photos I see her point - and I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;d rather focus on loving myself as I am than buy into our culture&#x27;s Cult of Youth, hating myself for the sin of getting older and spending a lot of time and money trying to counteract it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But vanity-less I am not, and since I use sunscreens and moisturizers anyway, I figure why not try to find a modestly-priced product that throws in a bit of Wrinkle-Not, to boot?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may just have found my Trickle of Youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;  Highly perfumed. How I wish there were more good, unscented moisturizers out there!&lt;br /&gt;  The seeming lack of a single, natural ingredient kinda creeps me out.&lt;br /&gt;  It imparts a strong shine to one&#x27;s skin - a quick blot with a tissue helps it look more like a natural \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;  The high SPF.&lt;br /&gt;  Not too spendy.&lt;br /&gt;  The results. I&#x27;ve  been using this product for just a few weeks, and not even daily at that. A discerning friend asked yesterday whether I had a new facial regimen, going on at some length  about how glowing and youthful I looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She had me at \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;. Am I ordering more? Heck yeah!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and find it as effective as more expensive potions I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> This product is very greasy on the skin and almost impossible to wear makeup over it no matter how long you wait. It&#x27;s an AM cream so you should be able to apply makeup over top of it but it looks awful and feels awful (shine x&#x27;s 10 no matter what you do) and it feels very heavy under your makeup. More importantly I have seen no change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for some time.  Makes your skin feel soft while providing great SPF protection.  Glad I don&#x27;t have to use another SPF protection product.  I wear makeup religiously and it clearly helps the makeup go on smoother if you give it a couple minutes to absorb.  Never feels greasy and I break out with so many products, even in my 50&#x27;s.  This ones I didn&#x27;t.  My skin does look better after using this product.  I still have my very deep wrinkles but no product is miraculous.</li>
            <li> This cream is not the heaviest cream I have used-but it&#x27;s not lightweight either, that&#x27;s why they call it a \\&quot;CREAM\\&quot;!  If you are looking for a lotion don&#x27;t use this product.  If you have somewhat drier skin this will hydrate it and make it smoother and the sunscreen (SPF 30) is not irritating to my skin as others can be. I can&#x27;t say whether it will give the results it promises since I have just started using it.  I really like the way it makes my 30-something, combination skin feel.  I live in south-Florida and the air has been a bit drier this winter.  I decided to try a cream to combat the tightness.  I got this cream at Target on a whim since it was on sale. It contains retinol and I feel confident that this cream will make some changes in the fine lines I have.  I will update with results as time goes by.  Don&#x27;t be put off by the other reviews.  I think this product is fantastic quality and if nothing else will give good hydration and the recommended SPF 30.</li>
            <li> I really love this face cream and its high SPF</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years and it works very well.  I have also used the night cream.  This is much less expensive than some of the other moisturizers and works as well or better.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for several years. It keeps my skin looking great and virtually wrinkle free at age 67. I don&#x27;t know if it can reduce the look of wrinkles, but it has kept mine to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Works great. My skin looks better.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but I may be too far gone.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer with the SPF I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I needed a face cream that would keep my skin moist, help soften wrinkles, and protect from the sun, this is the only one I have found on the market that I have tried that works for me.  I also have sensitive skin, this product does not make my face breakout or turn red.  Just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.  Unfortunately, I have not been able to find it in the stores around me anymore, so I went to Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product clogged the pores on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I used it in the morning before work. When I got home I had pimples on my face.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the ULTRA-LIFT, this did not \\&quot;tighten\\&quot; my skin in anyway.&lt;br /&gt;It was a waste of 12 bucks to me.&lt;br /&gt;JUST DIDN&#x27;T WORK. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I hoped it wouldn&#x27;t burn my eyes. Still have to be careful and not put on forehead as if you sweat and it runs into your eyes it still can sting. So I&#x27;ll continue to use my lip sticks to protect my eyes. Most work great over and around the eye and don&#x27;t sting your eyes. Lasts a long time too. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand because the other Garnier lotion I was using before didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I wanted a higher SPF and figured I could combat wrinkles at the same time with this. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I rarely have a break out issue and all I do to my face is wash it with body soap in the shower and put lotion on it when I get out. This product has clogged my pores, irritated my eyes and has a stench like no other. I&#x27;ve given it two weeks and now have a giant zit on my face and lots of little pimples, it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in store where I live (Midwest) so am wondering if they have discontinued t.  I like this one much better than the one in the green container - this one makes my skin really smooth and works better on the wrinkles and is great under my make-up.  Hope I can keep getting it because I like it better than anything I have tried.  I have sensitive skin as well and sometimes get itchy reactions, but so far this has not bothered me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months and find it very satisfying.  I use it as my morning and night moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t know if my wrinkles/lines are less visible but my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this product just such a refreshing smell and a feel good feeling.</li>
            <li> This cream works for me on my forehead and around my cheek.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who has deep wrinkle.  This cream is very light and it penetrates very well.</li>
            <li> I like this cream because it moisturizes and protects against the sun without being too greasy.  The only thing odd is that it makes my lips tingle whenever I apply it on them by mistake - maybe it&#x27;s the SPF part of it, I dunno.</li>
            <li> For the money, this product reduces appearance of wrinkles with continued use. Not perfect, but the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. People have guessed my age the highest so far 32, but I am 44. I&#x27;m good with that.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer.  I use it along with the Garnier deep wrinkle roller (red bottle) or the Garnier Renew Awakening face roller (green bottle).  However, I do prefer to combine this with the renew awakening face roller in the AM because it leaves my skin feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is smooth and goes on silky. It&#x27;s not heavy but is thick enough that a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m a fan of Garnier products for their effectiveness and their easy on the budget cost. I do see imrpovement in my skin complexion, the size of my pores and the tone of my skin when using this line.  The only deep wrinkles I have are in my forehead and they are almost gone when I use this product regularly.</li>
