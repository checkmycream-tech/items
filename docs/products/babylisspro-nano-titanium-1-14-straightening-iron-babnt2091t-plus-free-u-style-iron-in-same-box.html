            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great flatiron</li>
            <li>But, on the lowest setting (300)my hair looks great &amp; no frizz.</li>
            <li>Great purchase.</li>
            <li>She said she heard this was a great brand also.  </li>
            <li>The price is great</li>
            <li>I got the 2 for one pack for under $100 which is a great buy.  </li>
            <li>It was a great deal for the two.</li>
            <li>lol..</li>
            <li>The Babyliss works great.  </li>
            <li>It is very nice and does a great job.</li>
            <li>amazing!</li>
            <li>I have&#x27;t used the straightener yet, but I am sure that it is just as wonderful!</li>
            <li>I do not test them but looks perfect, this is for a Christmas gift, I hope that everiting works fine.</li>
            <li>It works really good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating the product 5 stars because the iron is good, but I should say that there was no U-Style iron included.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE BABYLISS!</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and curls your hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Love the U-curl!  </li>
            <li>Although the free \\&quot;u-style\\&quot; iron does work and is great, it was not why the purchase was made.</li>
            <li>Also the U-Styler is really nice, I tested it out</li>
            <li>I have a LOT of very fine hair that frizzes very easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>I thought this product was too good to be true, but when it arrived i fount out</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I just assumed more heat was better.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it curled my hair.</li>
            <li>If you go up to 375 or more</li>
            <li>I just recevied the babylisspro and i love it.</li>
            <li>and i love the diffrent temps.</li>
            <li>And I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love this straightening iron.</li>
            <li>I like the u styler, but it would be better if it had plates on both sides</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Overall a very good value getting both stylers for the price.</li>
            <li>So just be careful with the heat setting otherwise - awesome product....</li>
            <li>The best $90 I have ever spent</li>
            <li>I do find that using the titanium plates dries out my hair, but as long as you use a very good conditioner and product with your iron when using it, you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>I have really fine hair, so I don&#x27;t need to have it at the highest setting, which is a feature I like.  </li>
            <li>It was heavier &amp; didn&#x27;t go through my hair as smooth as my chi</li>
            <li>Both the Straightening Iron and the U-Style iron are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to EVERYONE!!!</li>
            <li>This flat iron is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;U\\&quot; styler is great for flat iron curls.  </li>
            <li>This was a great &#x27;2 for 1&#x27; the U-Style iron that came with the package can be used just like a flat iron.</li>
            <li>but they are both great flat irons.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy that I purchased this flat iron and would tell anyone to get it!</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and glides smoothly through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and is a slim, light style.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>They supersede a Chi by a mile, they&#x27;re so gentle, no snags, and many heat settings to choose from.</li>
            <li>is ok but it makes my hair really frizzy</li>
            <li>But other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>and I would borrow hers because it works so well and so quickly.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair straight and really smooth.</li>
            <li>Not only do you get two products for the price of one, but both products are amazing.  </li>
            <li>curls hair very easily - and you can also use it to straighten your hair - so if you are traveling - you need only the one iron.  </li>
            <li>The U-Style Iron is a great bonus and works very well to add a little curl.</li>
            <li>I love the different heat settings.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this iron at first.</li>
            <li>it was the real deal!</li>
            <li>so it would actually curl your hair better.</li>
            <li>Shiny and straight was better with my generic Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply iron.  </li>
            <li>they heat up in like 5 sec&#x27;s and even better than that with only two swipes its really straight!!!!</li>
            <li>Straightening Iron - BABNT2091T- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - PLUS FREE U-Style Iron in same box]]  </li>
            <li>I ordered the BabylissPro Nano Titanium 1 1 / 4 \\&quot;straighten iron - BABNT2091T - - - - - - - - - - - - - - PLUS FREE U-Style Plate in the same box, and instead of that came</li>
            <li>After much research I decided on the BabylissPro.</li>
            <li>It takes me a fraction of the time to style my hair and my hair stays straight.  </li>
            <li>She has very curly hair.</li>
            <li>i said i like it straight</li>
            <li>my hair was so straight ..</li>
            <li>I have finally found an AMAZING flat iron.  </li>
            <li>So excited to get this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My daughter said this is much better than the Chi she previously owned.</li>
            <li>I was a loyal Chi user for the last 10 years.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in the end result as far as my hair goes.  </li>
            <li>Brand new</li>
            <li>I have very curly, thick hair and this leaves my hair feeling smooth, soft, and manageable in no time!</li>
            <li>I find the U styler a little diffcult to use and have burnt myself a few times, but I&#x27;ve never been good at fixing hair, so its probably me.  </li>
            <li>Also didn&#x27;t work as well as my old one.  </li>
            <li>This unit arrived completely inoperable.</li>
            <li>but i never get it straight enough</li>
            <li>so shiny ans soft</li>
            <li>It works really well and the curls actually last.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product four stars instead of five because the flat iron does not have an indicator letting you know when it is ready.  </li>
            <li>you get to for the price of one the U-styler I use to get my edges since I am a natural haired African American Lady.</li>
            <li>I have been transitioning from relaxed to natural for the last year and having this flat iron at home has helped me get through appointments.  </li>
            <li>cause no flat iron worked well in my hair..</li>
            <li>I try not to use it more than once a week though because having too much heat on your hair is bad.</li>

            <li> The 1 1/4 flat</li>
            <li> Seems to be the flat irons aren&#x27;t on correctly</li>
            <li> I have longer thicker hair and my stylist always uses a flat iron on my hair when I get it done.  </li>
            <li> I did my research and wanted to purchase a flat iron for under $100.</li>
            <li> she used this flat iron and OMG</li>
            <li> My goal was to purchase the flat iron, which I got, but the seller should not advertise that there will be another item in there if they&#x27;re not going to put it in there.</li>
            <li> My only warning would be to be careful regarding the heat setting.  </li>
            <li> It needs a little stand so it doesn&#x27;t lay flat and a shut off timer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other types of straighteners, and nothing else works as well as this straightener.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s half the time</li>
            <li> After years of going through Chi&#x27;s and being so disappointed after they all short out only a year later...</li>
            <li> Both products heat up in no time and I am done with my hair in 15 minutes; I have very thick medium length Asian hair.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace an identical iron that has lasted a number of years of heavy use.</li>
            <li> I received ONLY the 1\\&quot; ultra thin.  </li>
            <li> I was giddy just waiting to get these, I mean 2 of them for half the price of one..</li>
            <li> I am bi-racial and have thick &amp; curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and this straightens my hair in one pass.  </li>
            <li> - I do section it off, however, to get at the lower layers as it is so thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few days now but even the difference in my hair is crazy!  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, wiry hair.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY!</li>
            <li> I Did not get what I ordered and am very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great flatiron I suggest to always go for BaByliss brands. They supersede a Chi by a mile, they&#x27;re so gentle, no snags, and many heat settings to choose from. I was giddy just waiting to get these, I mean 2 of them for half the price of one.. amazing! I paid $130 for just one!! Love them.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great. I love the different heat settings. I have a LOT of very fine hair that frizzes very easily. I automatically turned the iron up to the highest (450) heat setting &amp; frizz! But, on the lowest setting (300)my hair looks great &amp; no frizz. I just assumed more heat was better. I was wrong. I didn&#x27;t like this iron at first. It was heavier &amp; didn&#x27;t go through my hair as smooth as my chi (I loved!!)that broke after 5 years. But, once I found out how to use this iron properly... I won&#x27;t go back!!</li>
            <li> Tore my hair!  Both irons!  The \\&quot;curling\\&quot; one actually plucked hairs out!  The 1 1/4 flat I could hear the tearing. Seems to be the flat irons aren&#x27;t on correctly and there are gaps where the hair gets caught.  Also didn&#x27;t work as well as my old one.  Shiny and straight was better with my generic Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply iron.  They are going back tomorrow!</li>
            <li> I LOVE BABYLISS! This is an awesome deal, I would suggest this product to anyone. I used Babyliss on and off for about 3 years, my friend had one that I would always use and I finally decided to purchase for myself. I am bi-racial and have thick &amp; curly hair. Babyliss always gets the job done, I think I even prefer it over my CHI. It leaves my hair straight and really smooth. You can&#x27;t beat the price either! Also the U-Styler is really nice, I tested it out and I love the way it curled my hair. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I have longer thicker hair and my stylist always uses a flat iron on my hair when I get it done.  I asked her what she recommended and she uses the Chi brand.  She said she heard this was a great brand also.  So after reading numerous reviews by several people regarding different brands of straighteners I decided on this one. It is very nice and does a great job. My only warning would be to be careful regarding the heat setting.  If you go up to 375 or more sometimes it does leave a burning smell to your hair that you need to cover up with body spray/perfume.  So just be careful with the heat setting otherwise - awesome product....</li>
            <li> I just recevied the babylisspro and i love it. It works really good. My hair is very fine and i love the diffrent temps. The price is great you get 2 for the price of one.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron.  It heats quickly and glides smoothly through my hair.  I find the U styler a little diffcult to use and have burnt myself a few times, but I&#x27;ve never been good at fixing hair, so its probably me.  I gave this product four stars instead of five because the flat iron does not have an indicator letting you know when it is ready.  Overall a very good value getting both stylers for the price.</li>
            <li> I got the 2 for one pack for under $100 which is a great buy.  I used the 1 1/4 inch iron and it only took me 15min. to straighten my hair! That&#x27;s half the time and I didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same section.  The \\&quot;U\\&quot; styler is great for flat iron curls.  I would recommend these both to my coworkers and friends!  And I love the color.</li>
            <li> Not only do you get two products for the price of one, but both products are amazing.  This is by far the best flat iron I have ever owned. I have very curly, thick hair and this leaves my hair feeling smooth, soft, and manageable in no time! I am so happy that I purchased this flat iron and would tell anyone to get it!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0042TVA90 BabylissPro Nano Titanium 1 1/4\\&quot; Straightening Iron - BABNT2091T- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - PLUS FREE U-Style Iron in same box]]  I ordered the BabylissPro Nano Titanium 1 1 / 4 \\&quot;straighten iron - BABNT2091T - - - - - - - - - - - - - - PLUS FREE U-Style Plate in the same box, and instead of that came BabylissPro Nano Titanium 1 \\&quot;ultra-thin, I wish I solved, and asked what I did not properly sent and received does not satisfyme, I expect a prompt response from the seller.</li>
            <li> I had a Maximus Flat iron for 5+ years before it finally died on me. I did my research and wanted to purchase a flat iron for under $100. After much research I decided on the BabylissPro. The best $90 I have ever spent plus it came with the U-styler. Both products heat up in no time and I am done with my hair in 15 minutes; I have very thick medium length Asian hair. I would highly recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li> I do not test them but looks perfect, this is for a Christmas gift, I hope that everiting works fine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. It gets really hot and curls your hair wonderfully. My beautician used one so I got one as well.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was too good to be true, but when it arrived i fount out it was the real deal! Brand new you get to for the price of one the U-styler I use to get my edges since I am a natural haired African American Lady. they heat up in like 5 sec&#x27;s and even better than that with only two swipes its really straight!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this straightening iron. I have thick wavy hair and this straightens my hair in one pass.  It takes me a fraction of the time to style my hair and my hair stays straight.  The U-Style Iron is a great bonus and works very well to add a little curl.</li>
            <li> This item is INCREDIBLE!!  After years of going through Chi&#x27;s and being so disappointed after they all short out only a year later...I have finally found an AMAZING flat iron.  I&#x27;ve only had it a few days now but even the difference in my hair is crazy!  My hair straightens within maybe 5 mins as opposed to about 20 with the Chi.  Not only is it faster, it actually makes my hair look and feel silkier and shinier than the Chi ever did!  I would absolutely recommend this product to EVERYONE!!!</li>
            <li> This was a great &#x27;2 for 1&#x27; the U-Style iron that came with the package can be used just like a flat iron. Heats up quickly and is a slim, light style.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace an identical iron that has lasted a number of years of heavy use. This unit arrived completely inoperable. Although the free \\&quot;u-style\\&quot; iron does work and is great, it was not why the purchase was made. Therefore, this can only receive 1 star.</li>
            <li> So excited to get this flat iron.  This is the same one my hairdresser uses.  I found that I don&#x27;t use the U-Style one so I gave it to my mom but they are both great flat irons.  I have been transitioning from relaxed to natural for the last year and having this flat iron at home has helped me get through appointments.  I try not to use it more than once a week though because having too much heat on your hair is bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter on a recommendation from her hairdresser. Her hairdresser has been using the same Babyliss Straightener on her customers for 4 years. My daughter said this is much better than the Chi she previously owned. She has very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had. It was a great deal for the two. I like the u styler, but it would be better if it had plates on both sides so it would actually curl your hair better. It only has a plate on one side and it just gives your hair a wave when you try and curl it. It needs a little stand so it doesn&#x27;t lay flat and a shut off timer. I left it on by mistake and it burnt my bathroom sink. But other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> Went to a local salon for a haircut and the girl asked me how i want my hair stiled after that..i said i like it straight but i never get it straight enough cause no flat iron worked well in my hair..she used this flat iron and OMG my hair was so straight ..so shiny ans soft..went home and my bf couldnt stop looking at my hair..took like 100 pics..lol..i love it</li>
            <li> Love the U-curl!  It works really well and the curls actually last.  I have&#x27;t used the straightener yet, but I am sure that it is just as wonderful!</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter has had this type of straightener for 4 years.  My younger daughter and I would borrow hers because it works so well and so quickly.  I ended up purchasing one for my younger daughter so that we wouldn&#x27;t fight over it.  Recently, my oldest decided to take the iron with her (she&#x27;s in the Peace Corps in Paraguay) after being reminded of how well it smooths her hair. Now I was left with none, since the younger daughter is away on student exchange.  I&#x27;ve tried two other types of straighteners, and nothing else works as well as this straightener.</li>
            <li> I Did not get what I ordered and am very disappointed. I received ONLY the 1\\&quot; ultra thin.  I bought this for the deal of two for one price. NOT HAPPY!</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I have ever owned!!The curling iron is ok but it makes my hair really frizzy</li>
            <li> I was a loyal Chi user for the last 10 years.  They served me well, but the last one I had was malfunctioning, and I decided to try something else.  The Babyliss works great.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in the end result as far as my hair goes.  It straightens my hair in no time, and doesn&#x27;t require me to go over it again and again.  I have really fine hair, so I don&#x27;t need to have it at the highest setting, which is a feature I like.  I&#x27;m rating the product 5 stars because the iron is good, but I should say that there was no U-Style iron included.  My goal was to purchase the flat iron, which I got, but the seller should not advertise that there will be another item in there if they&#x27;re not going to put it in there.</li>
            <li> Both the Straightening Iron and the U-Style iron are fantastic.  I have very thick, wiry hair.  The straightening iron straightens my hair in a matter of minutes - I do section it off, however, to get at the lower layers as it is so thick.  The U-style iron (a bonus in this box!) curls hair very easily - and you can also use it to straighten your hair - so if you are traveling - you need only the one iron.  I do find that using the titanium plates dries out my hair, but as long as you use a very good conditioner and product with your iron when using it, you should be fine.  Overall, this brand is what my hair stylist recommends and uses and I am hooked.</li>
            <li> worth every penny !!!!!!!</li>
