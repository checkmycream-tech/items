            <li> My hair has never looked better and easy to style. Will be purchasing again</li>
            <li> Best product for curly hair ever!</li>
            <li> Best product for my hair. If you have straight and fine hair, this will help you volumize and provide a great look. I partner it with a little hairspray to keep it in place once I set it and I can go all day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Holds my curls all day long.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever</li>
            <li> LOVE this with my pixie cut!</li>
            <li> My stylist gave me a half bottle of this because she could no longer use it at the salon. It has been the best stuff I have used to texture my hair. It last a long time. I have heavy straight hair and I keep it short. This stuff keeps my hair from laying flat on my head and it works well with my head full of hair. It only takes a little dab to do the trick!!!!</li>
            <li> I went to this beauty shop and they used this on my hair, so I bought some at the salon, then came home and checked the internet.  As you know, I found it.</li>
            <li> If you like &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; in your short hair style this is the only product to use.  I live in Houston where the humidity can defeat any hair product but not this one.  I&#x27;ve used It&#x27;s a 10 for a couple of years now and I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I used too much the first time and it left a film.  You only need a tiny dab.  I can see where short hair styles could benefit from this more…but I like it for certain times…I have shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work upon arrival had to return for refund</li>
            <li> Good product! Helps in making your hair fluffy looking, or if your  looking for a messy look this does the trick.</li>
            <li> This is the best styling product I have ever used.  It lasts and it&#x27;s not overly expensive.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> I have pretty think hair and I wear it short...with this product, I have spike it out and it gives it body....love it.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this stuff makes my new short (female) haircut not look like a fur-helmet. I can put some texture into it and it looks vastly better. My hairdresser sells something similar but it is horribly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Don&#x27;t use a lot. Start with a tiny amount and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Great product, works wonders on staight flat hair.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I have short hair.  Apply to it damn and blow dry it and sometimes add a little more.  Adds texture and movement.  Don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried em all, and this works great on my fine but thick hair to provide volume, shine and definition. It can save any bad hair day for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product. A little goes a long way. It does not feel sticky or tacky in my hair and holds the style well.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair.  Have difficult hair to work with and this works the best of all the products I have tried.</li>
            <li> As always this product deserves a 10!</li>
