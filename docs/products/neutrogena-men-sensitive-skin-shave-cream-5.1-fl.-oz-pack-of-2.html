            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Use I just love it its the best after shave</li>
            <li>found that for shaving with wet/dry electric razors this cream is the best option because it lets me see the surface of the skin just being shaved, which lets me make sure</li>
            <li>This was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>good razor burn protection.</li>
            <li>Good product to use with electric shaver</li>
            <li>I have used canned foams and gels for may years and find this to be a superior product.</li>
            <li>there is one good thing</li>
            <li>Good lubrication.</li>
            <li>This works great, has a very nice fragrance and does not require a lot of product for adequate coverage.</li>
            <li>I gave it a four because I think it could still be improved to give a smoother and more pleasant feeling shave.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I had to re-apply it about 5 times to make it effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a better shave than I did with the product I used before (a good brand of gel)</li>
            <li>Im sure its good for others but this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li>By golly, he was right, so I ordered this pack of 2 and have been very happy. :)</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and makes his face very soft.</li>
            <li>I will say that it does leave my face very smooth though.  </li>
            <li>Provides a very smooth glide for the razor and prevents irritation and shaving bumps.  </li>
            <li>The cream is very smooth on the face.  </li>
            <li>shave immediately after showering and, being familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of this shave cream, am very pleased with the closeness I can achieve using it with my Panasonic wet/dry electric razor.</li>
            <li>It does seem to work better.  </li>
            <li>I like the gel better than the aerosol products.</li>
            <li>I find it better than any others.</li>
            <li>My favorite shave cream/gel.  </li>
            <li>may try it next time in combination of my brut foam ( that is the best canned foam ever</li>
            <li>I have had better shaves in my life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;shave lubricant&amp;#34; than a &amp;#34;shave cream&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Its okay to shave with.  </li>
            <li>, lathers okay.  </li>
            <li>I wish this stuff lathered more.</li>
            <li>My favorite shaving cream, works well with no nicks or irritation.  </li>
            <li>and he said we just ordered more didn&#x27;t we.</li>
            <li>It is impressive how creams/oils differ from traditional shave soaps this way.</li>
            <li>Better than the Clinique I was using and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have to use more of it to get through a shave.</li>
            <li>lubrication visually reassuring (and impressive!)</li>
            <li>, what stayed on my face was okay, but most of it ended up in the sink before I could shave.</li>
            <li>It somehow has the perfect consistency, allowing the razor blade to glide over the skin and still get close enough to the beard.</li>
            <li>I have tried most gels, foams and others like Cremo.</li>
            <li>I already use their age defying mens face moisturizer and love it.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY shave cream we buy as it is the best out there.  </li>
            <li>Love it for its close shave and how it makes my face feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I paid more for one tube than what it sells here for a 2-pack.</li>
            <li>Top notch product.</li>
            <li>Works way better than any shaving foam or gel that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This is the only shave cream my hubby will use and here on Amazon, its the best price when you buy 2.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li>Wayyy better than anything ive ever used.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting more razor burn and bumps from using this product.  </li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t use it more than 2 times and throw it away.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and very  clean.</li>
            <li>Wetting your face before applying this product helps the razor or shaver glide more easily during my shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that it goes on clear so that I can better see my face/facial hair as I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li>However, it works great for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells delightful but not overwhelmingly so - very manly scent.  </li>
            <li>I am a frequent traveler and this works great in my travel kit.</li>
            <li>I also think it does a pretty good job preventing cuts, nicks, razor burn, and acne, and it washes off cleanly without a lingering odor.</li>
            <li>The original is a much better product..</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m very happy with the product in all other respects.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with a Panasonic electric shaver and can say unequivocally that my razor burn days have passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is easy.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of years now and its hands down the best shave cream on the market.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Enjoy</li>
            <li>Great for daily use after shaving.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the quality and comfort of the shave I get using this product.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena should just make this in fragrance free.... instead of using some cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>Cheap price and cheap quality</li>
            <li>Overall, Neutrogena makes great products</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and I&#x27;ve noticed a good reduction in razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Pass  Shaving Butter from DSC FAR SUPERIOR.</li>
            <li>No mess and good for the environment.  </li>
            <li>The original is a far superior product to the &amp;#34;New&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>original is at the Amazon link below..  </li>
            <li>While it does keep my skin from irritation, I am not sure it provides the best experience with the razor I use.</li>
            <li>My cousin shared me the remainder of his bottle many months ago and told me that this is better than the Old Spice stuff I was using.</li>
            <li>The cream does a much better job than the old cheapo shaving foams and gels I had been using, and seems to be better for my skin (although your results may vary from mine on that, of course).</li>
            <li>and (a) my skin looks and feels better afterwards; and (b) it&#x27;s easier to clean my razor and the basin because there isn&#x27;t so much excess lather to clean up.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this made my face feel amazing</li>
            <li>You can tell from the prior reasons that this stuff doesn&#x27;t stay in place or do a good job, so to make up for it</li>
            <li>Love this so much we have a subscription for it.  </li>
            <li>If you want a true cream, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It takes me a good solid minute of rinsing with scalding-hot water to remove everything.</li>
            <li>Shaves pretty good and smooth if you apply multiple times during</li>
            <li>it also dries quickly when shaving with it..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides that, the reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it clogs the razor quickly and doesn&#x27;t was off it</li>
            <li>Excellent base for close shave and leaves my skin feeling great.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and other products I have used caused irritation and break outs, this comes off flawlessly and causes no redness at all.  </li>
            <li>but it really disappears very quickly..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34;, which makes it run of the skin too easily.</li>
            <li>How much can you say about shaving cream that is inexpensive, easy on the skin, travels well and doesn&#x27;t use propellants?</li>
            <li>I believe this product works better for those who have fine facial hair</li>
            <li>I was using another brand of cream that I didn&#x27;t enjoy as much.  </li>
            <li>nice overall \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent..</li>
            <li>My husband has used this product for several years and loves how nice it is to shave with</li>
            <li>Edge Gel for Sensitive skin does much better than this shave cream.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but to save my husband&#x27;s sensitive skin, I would pay even more.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like using the electric shaver without anything - tried using regular gel cream that I used to use, but the Nutrogena spoiled me - just so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is really great compared to the foam creams i used previously!</li>
            <li>this runs right off.</li>
            <li>I am not convince about this one, maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right</li>
            <li>But this is not a negative comment, as it is smooth and just the right thickness to lubricate yet not jam up razor.</li>
            <li>would Highly recommend getting the original Neutrogena Face Clearing Shave Cream instead..  </li>
            <li>It is adequate, but I much prefer an expanding gel foam.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years with electric wet/dry shavers and am very happy overall.</li>
            <li>I strongly advise against the Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Shave Cream.  </li>
            <li>Easy on my somewhat sensitive skin and not too greasy.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is not.  </li>
            <li>I like the Neutrogena shave cream a lot better than foam shave creams because I can actually see through it and tell what I&#x27;m shaving off and what I&#x27;m keeping.</li>
            <li>Works okay, but definitely not a fave.</li>
            <li>His face is soft and smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li>I definitely have more to do.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I was concerned by</li>
            <li>Like most such items, it seems overpriced...</li>
            <li>You could not ask for a better mens facial product.</li>
            <li>I assumed at first maybe the hot water was contributing to the lack luster results of this product.  </li>
            <li>This shave cream is very &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; and thus requires a lot more &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; to properly cover your face.</li>
            <li>He tried pretty much all the shaving creams out there to no avail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tube lasts a really long time if you&#x27;re shaving every day, so a pack of 2 is good for several months in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Neutrogena smells better--kind of like Irish Spring--but the perfume is much too strong.</li>
            <li>This helps make shaving much easier.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li>cant get it to create much lather, but softens my beard very well.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and enjoy the way it works during the shave as well as how it leaves my skin feeling after the shave.</li>
            <li>very runny formula</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t go through the tube as fast as you think you would.  </li>
            <li>I really recommended your skin will appreciate it</li>
            <li>Well, this stuff does very well on my face.</li>
            <li>Even at the sink it didn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li>My favorite shave cream is Wilkinson Aloe Vera Shaving Cream, which I bought in Germany and haven&#x27;t yet been able to find on Amazon or elsewhere in the USA alas.</li>
            <li>It seems thin when you are applying it to your face, but it does provide a lubricant that makes shaving very easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin, especially my face, with an aversion to strong chemicals and fragrances in body care products.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s pretty hard to read with these sort of things as I just asked if he liked it</li>
            <li>This product does a great job of creating a slick shaving surface on your face while moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very fast.  </li>
            <li>have to run max hot water on it at the highest flow to clear the razor.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few other similar products, including the non-sensitive skin version, and was never that impressed.</li>
            <li>Its better than anything that Jack Black, Zirh, Lab Series and even Art of Shaving has to offer and</li>
            <li>I then attempted to use outside of the shower, but it still gave the same results causing more irritation on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll never go back to any other kind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never loved it because it does not soften my whiskers enough to get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I switched to this Neutrogena shave cream from normal shave cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a few years now and still love it.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is thin and you have to use a lot to get good coverage.  </li>
            <li>Keep looking elsewhere until Neutrogena comes up with an new, improved formula.</li>
            <li>the shave cause it gets dry extremely quick.  </li>
            <li>others have noted, while this is called a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;, it is more like a liquid soap viscosity and, in fact, should be applied as such: working into a minimal lather in conservative amounts.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I spent a lot of time trying to clear it under running hot water and in hot still water.</li>
            <li>It felt especially astringent when he first put it</li>
            <li>it also dried VERY quickly..</li>
            <li>Of the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; that actually makes it to my face/neck, most runs down my neck before I can shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If fragrances give you problems, your first reaction to any fragrance is &amp;#34;Oh oh.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, from the product description here at Amazon:  &amp;#34;Enjoy a thick, rich lather with new Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Shave</li>
            <li>It is nearly clear, so you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;ve shaved.</li>
            <li>This lotion runs all over and is almost clear</li>
            <li>it started to clear up.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be like the Gillette Complete Care shave gel they used to make but discontinued.  </li>
            <li>sensitive skin version..</li>
            <li>As far as acne users are concerned i don&#x27;t think it either helps or hurts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Share Cream for years.</li>
            <li>Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s All Natural Shaving Cream has this one beat six ways from Sunday.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this after the Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel became unavailable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That is misleading, there is no thick, rich lather, I haven&#x27;t noticed a lather at all, much less a rich and thick one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that due to the thin layer and slickness I get a closer shave (in part because it&#x27;s easier to see what I&#x27;m doing, in part because it makes the razor glide very nicely over my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So while this shave cream isn&#x27;t fragrance-free, I find the smell to be mild on initial application and nearly imperceptible after rinsing--especially since I typically follow shaving with Neutrogena Triple Protect SPF 20 Face Lotion for Men (http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Triple-Protect-Lotion-Ounce/dp/B003NSPOF2) which has an equally mild fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product smells very nice--subtle but manly, but it is not nearly creamy enough.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried Nivea sensitive skin cream for a week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy it again, but I&#x27;ll also keep my eyes open for a replacement to the Gillette Complete Care.</li>
            <li>I ordered a &amp;#34;two-pack&amp;#34; of this Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin shaving cream - but only received one with my order.</li>
            <li>My husband apparently likes this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: avoid this unless you have a baby face and barely need to shave.</li>
            <li>Male in his 40&#x27;s with semi sensitive skin here...</li>
            <li>Slows the shaving process considerably and wastes a lot of hot water.</li>
            <li>After this long of ongoing use, and without having conducted any concerted empirical comparison, I&#x27;ve found the price to performance to be such that I rarely consider other options</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, but I should have heeded the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>This cream seems odd at first because it does not create a foam as regular shaving creams do.</li>
            <li>First given that it is for &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t think it would be so fragrance heavy.  </li>
            <li>have a pretty heavy beard and use a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>So unless the batch I got is atypical, don&#x27;t look for a rich, thick lather.  </li>
            <li>it does yield a CLOSE shave, but an irritating one because it doesn&#x27;t protect the skin too well.. to be honest, for the price, I&#x27;d buy any of the other 100s of tube creams out there..</li>
            <li>Most believed that I was getting regular \\&quot;hickies\\&quot; which, believe me, felt really masculine and weird at the same time.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Best shaving decision I ever made.</li>
            <li> Very good shave cream.  </li>
            <li> Shaving performance is very good.</li>
            <li> Feels great, shaves great, and leave skin feeling great.  </li>
            <li> Great bargain.</li>
            <li> Would assume it&#x27;d be great on legs too.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream works great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m buying it here at this great price.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s a happy camper</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that I found it here and at a wonderful price.  </li>
            <li> This product provides a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> Use I just love it its the best after shave</li>
            <li> found that for shaving with wet/dry electric razors this cream is the best option because it lets me see the surface of the skin just being shaved, which lets me make sure</li>
            <li> This was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> good razor burn protection.</li>
            <li> Good product to use with electric shaver</li>
            <li> I have used canned foams and gels for may years and find this to be a superior product.</li>
            <li> there is one good thing</li>
            <li> Good lubrication.</li>
            <li> This works great, has a very nice fragrance and does not require a lot of product for adequate coverage.</li>
            <li> I gave it a four because I think it could still be improved to give a smoother and more pleasant feeling shave.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I had to re-apply it about 5 times to make it effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a better shave than I did with the product I used before (a good brand of gel)</li>
            <li> Im sure its good for others but this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> By golly, he was right, so I ordered this pack of 2 and have been very happy. :)</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and makes his face very soft.</li>
            <li> I will say that it does leave my face very smooth though.  </li>
            <li> Provides a very smooth glide for the razor and prevents irritation and shaving bumps.  </li>
            <li> The cream is very smooth on the face.  </li>
            <li> shave immediately after showering and, being familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of this shave cream, am very pleased with the closeness I can achieve using it with my Panasonic wet/dry electric razor.</li>
            <li> It does seem to work better.  </li>
            <li> I like the gel better than the aerosol products.</li>
            <li> I find it better than any others.</li>
            <li> My favorite shave cream/gel.  </li>
            <li> may try it next time in combination of my brut foam ( that is the best canned foam ever</li>
            <li> I have had better shaves in my life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;shave lubricant&amp;#34; than a &amp;#34;shave cream&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Its okay to shave with.  </li>
            <li> , lathers okay.  </li>
            <li> I wish this stuff lathered more.</li>
            <li> My favorite shaving cream, works well with no nicks or irritation.  </li>
            <li> and he said we just ordered more didn&#x27;t we.</li>
            <li> It is impressive how creams/oils differ from traditional shave soaps this way.</li>
            <li> Better than the Clinique I was using and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have to use more of it to get through a shave.</li>
            <li> lubrication visually reassuring (and impressive!)</li>
            <li> , what stayed on my face was okay, but most of it ended up in the sink before I could shave.</li>
            <li> It somehow has the perfect consistency, allowing the razor blade to glide over the skin and still get close enough to the beard.</li>
            <li> I have tried most gels, foams and others like Cremo.</li>
            <li> I already use their age defying mens face moisturizer and love it.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY shave cream we buy as it is the best out there.  </li>
            <li> Love it for its close shave and how it makes my face feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I paid more for one tube than what it sells here for a 2-pack.</li>
            <li> Top notch product.</li>
            <li> Works way better than any shaving foam or gel that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> This is the only shave cream my hubby will use and here on Amazon, its the best price when you buy 2.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li> Wayyy better than anything ive ever used.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting more razor burn and bumps from using this product.  </li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t use it more than 2 times and throw it away.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and very  clean.</li>
            <li> Wetting your face before applying this product helps the razor or shaver glide more easily during my shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that it goes on clear so that I can better see my face/facial hair as I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> However, it works great for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells delightful but not overwhelmingly so - very manly scent.  </li>
            <li> I am a frequent traveler and this works great in my travel kit.</li>
            <li> I also think it does a pretty good job preventing cuts, nicks, razor burn, and acne, and it washes off cleanly without a lingering odor.</li>
            <li> The original is a much better product..</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m very happy with the product in all other respects.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with a Panasonic electric shaver and can say unequivocally that my razor burn days have passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is easy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now and its hands down the best shave cream on the market.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Enjoy</li>
            <li> Great for daily use after shaving.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the quality and comfort of the shave I get using this product.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena should just make this in fragrance free.... instead of using some cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> Cheap price and cheap quality</li>
            <li> Overall, Neutrogena makes great products</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and I&#x27;ve noticed a good reduction in razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Pass  Shaving Butter from DSC FAR SUPERIOR.</li>
            <li> No mess and good for the environment.  </li>
            <li> The original is a far superior product to the &amp;#34;New&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> original is at the Amazon link below..  </li>
            <li> While it does keep my skin from irritation, I am not sure it provides the best experience with the razor I use.</li>
            <li> My cousin shared me the remainder of his bottle many months ago and told me that this is better than the Old Spice stuff I was using.</li>
            <li> The cream does a much better job than the old cheapo shaving foams and gels I had been using, and seems to be better for my skin (although your results may vary from mine on that, of course).</li>
            <li> and (a) my skin looks and feels better afterwards; and (b) it&#x27;s easier to clean my razor and the basin because there isn&#x27;t so much excess lather to clean up.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this made my face feel amazing</li>
            <li> You can tell from the prior reasons that this stuff doesn&#x27;t stay in place or do a good job, so to make up for it</li>
            <li> Love this so much we have a subscription for it.  </li>
            <li> If you want a true cream, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It takes me a good solid minute of rinsing with scalding-hot water to remove everything.</li>
            <li> Shaves pretty good and smooth if you apply multiple times during</li>
            <li> it also dries quickly when shaving with it..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides that, the reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it clogs the razor quickly and doesn&#x27;t was off it</li>
            <li> Excellent base for close shave and leaves my skin feeling great.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and other products I have used caused irritation and break outs, this comes off flawlessly and causes no redness at all.  </li>
            <li> but it really disappears very quickly..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34;, which makes it run of the skin too easily.</li>
            <li> How much can you say about shaving cream that is inexpensive, easy on the skin, travels well and doesn&#x27;t use propellants?</li>
            <li> I believe this product works better for those who have fine facial hair</li>
            <li> I was using another brand of cream that I didn&#x27;t enjoy as much.  </li>
            <li> nice overall \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent..</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for several years and loves how nice it is to shave with</li>
            <li> Edge Gel for Sensitive skin does much better than this shave cream.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey but to save my husband&#x27;s sensitive skin, I would pay even more.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using the electric shaver without anything - tried using regular gel cream that I used to use, but the Nutrogena spoiled me - just so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is really great compared to the foam creams i used previously!</li>
            <li> this runs right off.</li>
            <li> I am not convince about this one, maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right</li>
            <li> But this is not a negative comment, as it is smooth and just the right thickness to lubricate yet not jam up razor.</li>
            <li> would Highly recommend getting the original Neutrogena Face Clearing Shave Cream instead..  </li>
            <li> It is adequate, but I much prefer an expanding gel foam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years with electric wet/dry shavers and am very happy overall.</li>
            <li> I strongly advise against the Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Shave Cream.  </li>
            <li> Easy on my somewhat sensitive skin and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not.  </li>
            <li> I like the Neutrogena shave cream a lot better than foam shave creams because I can actually see through it and tell what I&#x27;m shaving off and what I&#x27;m keeping.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but definitely not a fave.</li>
            <li> His face is soft and smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li> I definitely have more to do.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I was concerned by</li>
            <li> Like most such items, it seems overpriced...</li>
            <li> You could not ask for a better mens facial product.</li>
            <li> I assumed at first maybe the hot water was contributing to the lack luster results of this product.  </li>
            <li> This shave cream is very &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; and thus requires a lot more &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; to properly cover your face.</li>
            <li> He tried pretty much all the shaving creams out there to no avail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tube lasts a really long time if you&#x27;re shaving every day, so a pack of 2 is good for several months in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Neutrogena smells better--kind of like Irish Spring--but the perfume is much too strong.</li>
            <li> This helps make shaving much easier.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> cant get it to create much lather, but softens my beard very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and enjoy the way it works during the shave as well as how it leaves my skin feeling after the shave.</li>
            <li> very runny formula</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t go through the tube as fast as you think you would.  </li>
            <li> I really recommended your skin will appreciate it</li>
            <li> Well, this stuff does very well on my face.</li>
            <li> Even at the sink it didn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li> My favorite shave cream is Wilkinson Aloe Vera Shaving Cream, which I bought in Germany and haven&#x27;t yet been able to find on Amazon or elsewhere in the USA alas.</li>
            <li> It seems thin when you are applying it to your face, but it does provide a lubricant that makes shaving very easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin, especially my face, with an aversion to strong chemicals and fragrances in body care products.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s pretty hard to read with these sort of things as I just asked if he liked it</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of creating a slick shaving surface on your face while moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very fast.  </li>
            <li> have to run max hot water on it at the highest flow to clear the razor.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other similar products, including the non-sensitive skin version, and was never that impressed.</li>
            <li> Its better than anything that Jack Black, Zirh, Lab Series and even Art of Shaving has to offer and</li>
            <li> I then attempted to use outside of the shower, but it still gave the same results causing more irritation on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll never go back to any other kind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never loved it because it does not soften my whiskers enough to get a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I switched to this Neutrogena shave cream from normal shave cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years now and still love it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is thin and you have to use a lot to get good coverage.  </li>
            <li> Keep looking elsewhere until Neutrogena comes up with an new, improved formula.</li>
            <li> the shave cause it gets dry extremely quick.  </li>
            <li> others have noted, while this is called a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;, it is more like a liquid soap viscosity and, in fact, should be applied as such: working into a minimal lather in conservative amounts.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time trying to clear it under running hot water and in hot still water.</li>
            <li> It felt especially astringent when he first put it</li>
            <li> it also dried VERY quickly..</li>
            <li> Of the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; that actually makes it to my face/neck, most runs down my neck before I can shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If fragrances give you problems, your first reaction to any fragrance is &amp;#34;Oh oh.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, from the product description here at Amazon:  &amp;#34;Enjoy a thick, rich lather with new Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Shave</li>
            <li> It is nearly clear, so you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;ve shaved.</li>
            <li> This lotion runs all over and is almost clear</li>
            <li> it started to clear up.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be like the Gillette Complete Care shave gel they used to make but discontinued.  </li>
            <li> sensitive skin version..</li>
            <li> As far as acne users are concerned i don&#x27;t think it either helps or hurts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Share Cream for years.</li>
            <li> Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s All Natural Shaving Cream has this one beat six ways from Sunday.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after the Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel became unavailable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That is misleading, there is no thick, rich lather, I haven&#x27;t noticed a lather at all, much less a rich and thick one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that due to the thin layer and slickness I get a closer shave (in part because it&#x27;s easier to see what I&#x27;m doing, in part because it makes the razor glide very nicely over my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So while this shave cream isn&#x27;t fragrance-free, I find the smell to be mild on initial application and nearly imperceptible after rinsing--especially since I typically follow shaving with Neutrogena Triple Protect SPF 20 Face Lotion for Men (http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Triple-Protect-Lotion-Ounce/dp/B003NSPOF2) which has an equally mild fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product smells very nice--subtle but manly, but it is not nearly creamy enough.  </li>
            <li> I recently tried Nivea sensitive skin cream for a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy it again, but I&#x27;ll also keep my eyes open for a replacement to the Gillette Complete Care.</li>
            <li> I ordered a &amp;#34;two-pack&amp;#34; of this Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin shaving cream - but only received one with my order.</li>
            <li> My husband apparently likes this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: avoid this unless you have a baby face and barely need to shave.</li>
            <li> Male in his 40&#x27;s with semi sensitive skin here...</li>
            <li> Slows the shaving process considerably and wastes a lot of hot water.</li>
            <li> After this long of ongoing use, and without having conducted any concerted empirical comparison, I&#x27;ve found the price to performance to be such that I rarely consider other options</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but I should have heeded the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> This cream seems odd at first because it does not create a foam as regular shaving creams do.</li>
            <li> First given that it is for &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t think it would be so fragrance heavy.  </li>
            <li> have a pretty heavy beard and use a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> So unless the batch I got is atypical, don&#x27;t look for a rich, thick lather.  </li>
            <li> it does yield a CLOSE shave, but an irritating one because it doesn&#x27;t protect the skin too well.. to be honest, for the price, I&#x27;d buy any of the other 100s of tube creams out there..</li>
            <li> Most believed that I was getting regular \\&quot;hickies\\&quot; which, believe me, felt really masculine and weird at the same time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is certainly unlike the expanding canned gels and does not provide the same lasting (if excessive?)</li>
            <li> Not hard to rinse off, but it makes a mess.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time, and it is the only thing that works for me.</li>
            <li> so the tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The shave cream rinses off with soap and water with no apparent residue.</li>
            <li> whiskers are pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> The sensitive skin version really does help with electric razor irritation; it&#x27;s hard to explain, but my face is a bit less red afterward</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it can really leave a lot of residue on my electric razor.</li>
            <li> every single spot is properly shaved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with facial hair due to meds I take.</li>
            <li> This actually helps me when trimming around my other facial hair since I can see.</li>
            <li> I just happened to stumble across it in a store and picked me up some.</li>
            <li> He found Neutrogena harder to use than Barbasol, and it left his skin feeling &amp;#34;stretched.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I generally like Neutrogena products, but this was a let down for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an actual cream, there is other stuff out there.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena produces other emollients for the after-shave party, but I haven&#x27;t found them necessary.</li>
            <li> This product says that you only need a thin layer, but I&#x27;m still getting a little razor burn even with a fresh razor blade.</li>
            <li> consistency of this cream is pretty thick and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Does not rinse off easily from my razor and leaves things dirty.</li>
            <li> This is my experience with the product everyone is different when it comes to the subject of shaving.  </li>
            <li> This seems to do a much better job cutting down on the irritation on my neck.</li>
            <li> This is difficult to find in the stores near where I live.  </li>
            <li> Only need a little per shave.</li>
            <li> One tube lasts a long time because I only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li> and it was still not gentle as they say because I had a eczema reaction to using this</li>
            <li> I started to wet shave with a de razor and bought proraso products after no luck with this.</li>
            <li> It works for me because I don&#x27;t have that thick of facial hair, but I don&#x27;t think I would try it any thicker hair, especially if your pores aren&#x27;t opened up out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never certainly use this to shave a beard..</li>
            <li> a thick, rich lather...\\&quot; is completely false.</li>
            <li> I got this shave cream for my husband, because he said his skin felt dry after shaving, but he turns thumbs down on it after one use.  </li>
            <li> This is the first Neutrogena product I&#x27;ve ever purchased that turned out to be a total disappointment.  </li>
            <li> had a lot of nicks and cuts and a little does NOT go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit of the cream goes a long way on your face</li>
            <li> and I never cut myself, but my head was extremely irritated after..</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t wash off as quickly as other cream and leaves the scent, which is rather artificial/chemical.</li>
            <li> Maybe they changed the formula, but this stuff is very thin and does not really form much of a lubricating layer on your face.</li>
            <li> My son has a heavy beard for a 16 yr old and because he still has young sensitive skin, he is prone to almost severe, annoying and itchy razor bumps.</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Shave Cream is a frustrating exception.  </li>
            <li> The razor with all its blades used to tug and pull and leave my skin chafed and subject to dreaded razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> I typically shave in the shower, so</li>
            <li> There was as much of a mess on my hands as opposed to what was on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I like the way this comes off during the shave rather than leaving a slick feeling of film on my face like some other products have.</li>
            <li> I found their other product to work well, but this is not much better than plain soap.</li>
            <li> Cream is too thin, I got several razor burns when I used this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried this product recently, just after trying Shave Secret.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years.</li>
            <li> I have used for a few years now</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with shave bumps, try this cream...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now</li>
            <li> Neutrogena costs a fraction of the price compared to those heavy hitters.  </li>
            <li> I buy this to use with the 4-blade razors: it is not as thick as other shaving creams (when applied to the face).</li>
            <li> very little odor, not greasy/oily like SS.</li>
            <li> He says it feels oily, rather than creamy, the way his usual Barbasol Beard Buster feels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thin to stay in place if your skin is the slightest bit wet.</li>
            <li> I usually like neutrogena products, but this was a letdown.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is usually lower than in the supermarket.</li>
            <li> A small price to pay</li>
            <li> Package arrived damaged - and very messy.  </li>
            <li> and I never get any nicks and cuts using that) for addes protection.&lt;br /&gt;it was also very messy and runny.</li>
            <li> It is not very good ..  </li>
            <li> My experience is that the product goes on very thin (opposite of thick).  </li>
            <li> Then runs off the blade and down my face or neck, leaving a trail of shaved stubble behind.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too watery and not so dry that it would clog the razor as do some fancy expensive creams.</li>
            <li> so it is hard to tell where I&#x27;ve shaved</li>
            <li> My skin no longer is irritated with &amp;#34;tells&amp;#34; other that either I shave or there&#x27;s something wrong with my face.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT A GOOD SHAVE CREAM.  </li>
            <li> My tube of Neutrogena shave cream goes on as a relatively thin, very slick coating on my face.  </li>
            <li> real slick stuff.</li>
            <li> (CVS?)..a bit expensive for a small tube</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy about that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin, runny and has zero lather.  </li>
            <li> The biggest issue I had here was that it clogged my razor (E. Jagger) way worse that even SS did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin lotion</li>
            <li> It is too thin to hold onto the shaved stubble.</li>
            <li> As I shave, the thin lotion gathers along the edge of the blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thin</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin consistency</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to have a bad scent, if any scent, I cannot smell anything after he shaves like with some other products.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong.  </li>
            <li> Although it works, distributing the cream over my face is difficult as it seems to want to clump in patches and after the shave, the cream will stick between the blades.  </li>
            <li> Since my skin is very thin, this is a must-have.</li>
            <li> but was I desperate for him to stop the suffering.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it met my expectations</li>
            <li> I switched to this Neutrogena shave cream from normal shave cream.  It does seem to work better.  I gave it a four because I think it could still be improved to give a smoother and more pleasant feeling shave.  It is like a recipe that still needs something.</li>
            <li> Package arrived damaged - and very messy.  I&#x27;m not happy about that.</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME!  I put it on with my electric wet/dry razor.  The razor with all its blades used to tug and pull and leave my skin chafed and subject to dreaded razor bumps.  Not so with the addition of the Neutrogena Shave Cream!  My skin is soft and I&#x27;ve noticed a good reduction in razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time, and it is the only thing that works for me. I have sensitive skin, but my hair doesn&#x27;t grow very fast.  I recently tried Nivea sensitive skin cream for a week and I&#x27;ve had several nicks, cuts and bumps already, so I&#x27;m switching back to this.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be like the Gillette Complete Care shave gel they used to make but discontinued.  Unfortunately it is not.  This stuff is thin and you have to use a lot to get good coverage.  It works for me because I don&#x27;t have that thick of facial hair, but I don&#x27;t think I would try it any thicker hair, especially if your pores aren&#x27;t opened up out of the shower.  I will say that it does leave my face very smooth though.  I&#x27;ll buy it again, but I&#x27;ll also keep my eyes open for a replacement to the Gillette Complete Care.</li>
            <li> Used it 3 times, once in the shower.  Cream is too thin, I got several razor burns when I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is not very good ..  This &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; stuff is going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would Highly recommend getting the original Neutrogena Face Clearing Shave Cream instead..  The original is a far superior product to the &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; sensitive skin version..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original is at the Amazon link below..  The original is a much better product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Clearing-Shave-Cream-Ounce/dp/B00596VEP0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1424268099&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;neutrogena+shave+cream+men</li>
            <li> Got this because it was recommended to use under an electric body razor.  It seems to do the job without leaving any redness or bumpiness.  I like the gel better than the aerosol products.</li>
            <li> Practically unusable.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like putting on watered-down lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Most of it runs through my fingers when applied. Of the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; that actually makes it to my face/neck, most runs down my neck before I can shave.&lt;br /&gt;I wont buy this again.</li>
            <li> This helps make shaving much easier.  I find it better than any others.</li>
            <li> My cousin shared me the remainder of his bottle many months ago and told me that this is better than the Old Spice stuff I was using. By golly, he was right, so I ordered this pack of 2 and have been very happy. :)</li>
            <li> My favorite shave cream/gel.  I&#x27;ve used this for a few years now and still love it.  Feels great, shaves great, and leave skin feeling great.  Great bargain.</li>
            <li> I like to keep some facial hair, but I have to shave off the parts I don&#x27;t want every morning. I like the Neutrogena shave cream a lot better than foam shave creams because I can actually see through it and tell what I&#x27;m shaving off and what I&#x27;m keeping. I also think it does a pretty good job preventing cuts, nicks, razor burn, and acne, and it washes off cleanly without a lingering odor.</li>
            <li> not too impressed. had a lot of nicks and cuts and a little does NOT go a long way. I had to re-apply it about 5 times to make it effective. Was using it with a fatboy DE razor with multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;I may try it next time in combination of my brut foam ( that is the best canned foam ever and I never get any nicks and cuts using that) for addes protection.&lt;br /&gt;it was also very messy and runny.</li>
            <li> I have had better shaves in my life. This one seems pricey for what you get. My favorite shave cream is Wilkinson Aloe Vera Shaving Cream, which I bought in Germany and haven&#x27;t yet been able to find on Amazon or elsewhere in the USA alas.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but I should have heeded the other reviews.  The product smells very nice--subtle but manly, but it is not nearly creamy enough.  Keep looking elsewhere until Neutrogena comes up with an new, improved formula.</li>
            <li> This is the first Neutrogena product I&#x27;ve ever purchased that turned out to be a total disappointment.  THIS IS NOT A GOOD SHAVE CREAM.  It&#x27;s thin, runny and has zero lather.  I will not make the mistake of buying it a second time.</li>
            <li> I ordered a &amp;#34;two-pack&amp;#34; of this Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin shaving cream - but only received one with my order.</li>
            <li> First given that it is for &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t think it would be so fragrance heavy.  Turns out the fragrance doesn&#x27;t trigger an allergic reaction but I could still do without it.  If fragrances give you problems, your first reaction to any fragrance is &amp;#34;Oh oh.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, from the product description here at Amazon:  &amp;#34;Enjoy a thick, rich lather with new Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Shave Cream.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is misleading, there is no thick, rich lather, I haven&#x27;t noticed a lather at all, much less a rich and thick one.  My experience is that the product goes on very thin (opposite of thick).  So unless the batch I got is atypical, don&#x27;t look for a rich, thick lather.  Whoever wrote that copy hadn&#x27;t tried the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it:  My tube of Neutrogena shave cream goes on as a relatively thin, very slick coating on my face.  It&#x27;s almost a liquid.  I&#x27;ve found that due to the thin layer and slickness I get a closer shave (in part because it&#x27;s easier to see what I&#x27;m doing, in part because it makes the razor glide very nicely over my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a pretty heavy beard and use a safety razor.  I&#x27;m getting a better shave than I did with the product I used before (a good brand of gel) and (a) my skin looks and feels better afterwards; and (b) it&#x27;s easier to clean my razor and the basin because there isn&#x27;t so much excess lather to clean up.  It&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;shave lubricant&amp;#34; than a &amp;#34;shave cream&amp;#34; imo, and I like the results.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is I would prefer it without the fragrance.  But I&#x27;m very happy with the product in all other respects.</li>
            <li> best shave cream ever used</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ve missed the mark on this shave cream.. it doesn&#x27;t lather.. yes, it&#x27;s a tube of gel.. but it really disappears very quickly.. it also dries quickly when shaving with it.. it does yield a CLOSE shave, but an irritating one because it doesn&#x27;t protect the skin too well.. to be honest, for the price, I&#x27;d buy any of the other 100s of tube creams out there.. even Aveeno&#x27;s.. just my $.02.. I tried to use this to shave my head and I never cut myself, but my head was extremely irritated after.. it also dried VERY quickly.. I&#x27;d never certainly use this to shave a beard.. nice overall \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent..</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I have very sensitive skin and it was still not gentle as they say because I had a eczema reaction to using this .. Looks like I&#x27;m gonna have to try the Vanicream shave cream ..</li>
            <li> Its okay to shave with.  I give the three stars because it applies well, lathers okay.  Shaves pretty good and smooth if you apply multiple times during the shave cause it gets dry extremely quick.  As far as acne users are concerned i don&#x27;t think it either helps or hurts.</li>
            <li> I wish this stuff lathered more. It&#x27;s very &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34;, which makes it run of the skin too easily. Works okay, but definitely not a fave. I&#x27;ll try something else before buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with facial hair due to meds I take. This is a wonderful product. Best I&#x27;ve found. My skin no longer is irritated with &amp;#34;tells&amp;#34; other that either I shave or there&#x27;s something wrong with my face. If you&#x27;re a female having problems like I do, look into men&#x27;s products for shaving. Would assume it&#x27;d be great on legs too.</li>
            <li> My favorite shaving cream, works well with no nicks or irritation.  The cream does a much better job than the old cheapo shaving foams and gels I had been using, and seems to be better for my skin (although your results may vary from mine on that, of course).</li>
            <li> My husband apparently likes this. It doesn&#x27;t appear to have a bad scent, if any scent, I cannot smell anything after he shaves like with some other products. His shave appears to be close and with no irritation. His face is soft and smooth after shaving. And he just reordered the two pack, so this is a definite thumbs up by his standards. He&#x27;s pretty hard to read with these sort of things as I just asked if he liked it and he said we just ordered more didn&#x27;t we. A wealth of information there.</li>
            <li> Tried this product recently, just after trying Shave Secret. Differences....very little odor, not greasy/oily like SS. Like SS, I had NO nicks or cuts. It is impressive how creams/oils differ from traditional shave soaps this way. The biggest issue I had here was that it clogged my razor (E. Jagger) way worse that even SS did. I spent a lot of time trying to clear it under running hot water and in hot still water. I really didn&#x27;t like that. I paid just under $8.00 at CVS. I&#x27;ll use it periodically.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few years. It&#x27;s great that it goes on clear so that I can better see my face/facial hair as I&#x27;m shaving.</li>
            <li> Great product. No residual smells.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream works great. It seems thin when you are applying it to your face, but it does provide a lubricant that makes shaving very easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I just happened to stumble across it in a store and picked me up some. It only takes about the size of a quarter so the tube will last a long time. I have sensitive skin and this made my face feel amazing</li>
            <li> real slick stuff. good razor burn protection. cant get it to create much lather, but softens my beard very well.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for several years and loves how nice it is to shave with and he does not break out.</li>
            <li> I got this shave cream for my husband, because he said his skin felt dry after shaving, but he turns thumbs down on it after one use.  He says it feels oily, rather than creamy, the way his usual Barbasol Beard Buster feels.  He found Neutrogena harder to use than Barbasol, and it left his skin feeling &amp;#34;stretched.&amp;#34;  It felt especially astringent when he first put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I had another reason for getting him to try Neutrogena.  I don&#x27;t like the smell of Barbasol.  Neutrogena smells better--kind of like Irish Spring--but the perfume is much too strong.</li>
            <li> This product says that you only need a thin layer, but I&#x27;m still getting a little razor burn even with a fresh razor blade. I prefer the HeadBlade shaving cream over this, the HeadBlade cream is thicker and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Better than the Clinique I was using and a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a traveling shaving cream.  I&#x27;ve never loved it because it does not soften my whiskers enough to get a great shave.  It is adequate, but I much prefer an expanding gel foam.</li>
            <li> I have never cared for the foamy type of shaving cream as I don&#x27;t feel it works that well. I have been using this product for several years and enjoy the way it works during the shave as well as how it leaves my skin feeling after the shave. I would highly recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Tried this for a week.  About same level in quality as Gillette Comfort Advantage 3in1.  Edge Gel for Sensitive skin does much better than this shave cream.  Saw it on sale at a local drug store and grabbed it.   Pass  Shaving Butter from DSC FAR SUPERIOR.</li>
            <li> The product came with a shaver I purchased&lt;br /&gt;Neutropenia was included in the razor package as well as the after shave</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I have used for a few years now and it continues to be the best shaving cream I have tried.</li>
            <li> The best shaving cream I ever used. Being bald I definitely have more to do.</li>
            <li> I have a number of problems with this shaving \\&quot;cream\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s not a cream. It&#x27;s a thin lotion the consistency of dog drool. I tried to think of something else to describe it, but that&#x27;s what it reminds me of.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s too thin to stay in place if your skin is the slightest bit wet. I like to shave after I shower and with damp skin this runs right off. It doesn&#x27;t lather at all, or even stay put.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is nearly clear, so you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;ve shaved. I find a benefit to a foam or gel is that I can actually see where I&#x27;ve shaved already. This lotion runs all over and is almost clear so it is hard to tell where I&#x27;ve shaved already.&lt;br /&gt;4. It is too thin to hold onto the shaved stubble. As I shave, the thin lotion gathers along the edge of the blade. Then runs off the blade and down my face or neck, leaving a trail of shaved stubble behind. Not hard to rinse off, but it makes a mess.  A gel or foam or thicker lotion allows the stubble to gather and be pulled off with the razor on each pass.&lt;br /&gt;5. It&#x27;s so thin I have to use more of it to get through a shave. You can tell from the prior reasons that this stuff doesn&#x27;t stay in place or do a good job, so to make up for it I have to use more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: avoid this unless you have a baby face and barely need to shave. Do NOT believe the product description here at Amazon. \\&quot;Enjoy a thick, rich lather...\\&quot; is completely false. There is no lather with this product.</li>
            <li> I switched to this from regular shaving cream.  This seems to do a much better job cutting down on the irritation on my neck.</li>
            <li> I buy this to use with the 4-blade razors: it is not as thick as other shaving creams (when applied to the face). But this is not a negative comment, as it is smooth and just the right thickness to lubricate yet not jam up razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years with electric wet/dry shavers and am very happy overall. After this long of ongoing use, and without having conducted any concerted empirical comparison, I&#x27;ve found the price to performance to be such that I rarely consider other options any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, especially my face, with an aversion to strong chemicals and fragrances in body care products. So while this shave cream isn&#x27;t fragrance-free, I find the smell to be mild on initial application and nearly imperceptible after rinsing--especially since I typically follow shaving with Neutrogena Triple Protect SPF 20 Face Lotion for Men (http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Triple-Protect-Lotion-Ounce/dp/B003NSPOF2) which has an equally mild fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, while this is called a &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34;, it is more like a liquid soap viscosity and, in fact, should be applied as such: working into a minimal lather in conservative amounts. It is certainly unlike the expanding canned gels and does not provide the same lasting (if excessive?) lubrication visually reassuring (and impressive!) foamy lather of those type of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave immediately after showering and, being familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of this shave cream, am very pleased with the closeness I can achieve using it with my Panasonic wet/dry electric razor.</li>
            <li> Best shave cream ever!  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Maybe they changed the formula, but this stuff is very thin and does not really form much of a lubricating layer on your face. I found their other product to work well, but this is not much better than plain soap.</li>
            <li> very runny formula, what stayed on my face was okay, but most of it ended up in the sink before I could shave.</li>
            <li> I am not convince about this one, maybe I didn&#x27;t use it right or maybe is just a peace of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No convence este producto, quizás no lo use bien o tal vez es sólo un pedazo de basura.</li>
            <li> Great for daily use after shaving.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the quality and comfort of the shave I get using this product.  I was using another brand of cream that I didn&#x27;t enjoy as much.  I like the way this comes off during the shave rather than leaving a slick feeling of film on my face like some other products have.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I was concerned by it&#x27;s thin consistency but after one shave I have not looked back.  A little bit of the cream goes a long way on your face and you don&#x27;t go through the tube as fast as you think you would.  My skin is sensitive and other products I have used caused irritation and break outs, this comes off flawlessly and causes no redness at all.  I will never use another shave cream.</li>
            <li> Use I just love it its the best after shave I had use I really recommended your skin will appreciate it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Share Cream for years. Works perfectly, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and works well for shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> The only shaving cream my skin will tolerate. It somehow has the perfect consistency, allowing the razor blade to glide over the skin and still get close enough to the beard. It&#x27;s not too watery and not so dry that it would clog the razor as do some fancy expensive creams.</li>
            <li> This is really great compared to the foam creams i used previously! Like most such items, it seems overpriced...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, the reason i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it clogs the razor quickly and doesn&#x27;t was off it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to run max hot water on it at the highest flow to clear the razor. Slows the shaving process considerably and wastes a lot of hot water.</li>
            <li> I usually like neutrogena products, but this was a letdown. Does not rinse off easily from my razor and leaves things dirty.</li>
            <li> Good product to use with electric shaver</li>
            <li> This cream seems odd at first because it does not create a foam as regular shaving creams do. However, it works great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that for shaving with wet/dry electric razors this cream is the best option because it lets me see the surface of the skin just being shaved, which lets me make sure every single spot is properly shaved. This way, the shave is just as close as with regular razor blades, without the cuts.</li>
            <li> Male in his 40&#x27;s with semi sensitive skin here... I have tried most gels, foams and others like Cremo. They were all the same and just did not help my face. While at a our local Walmart I saw this and said what the heck. I already use their age defying mens face moisturizer and love it. Well, this stuff does very well on my face. It does not lather up like others but it is not supposed to. This actually helps me when trimming around my other facial hair since I can see. This will be my go to shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The best I have tried</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY shave cream we buy as it is the best out there.  It does not foam up (no foam needed) your razor just glides over your skin! It smells delightful but not overwhelmingly so - very manly scent.  It is a bit pricey but to save my husband&#x27;s sensitive skin, I would pay even more.  Love this so much we have a subscription for it.  If you have trouble with shave bumps, try this cream...it may just be your solution.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Only need a little per shave. Prevents razor &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; and does not stick in between blades on razor head. I have used canned foams and gels for may years and find this to be a superior product.</li>
            <li> How much can you say about shaving cream that is inexpensive, easy on the skin, travels well and doesn&#x27;t use propellants?</li>
            <li> Meh.  Too runny to do the job. Too big for TSA.  Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s All Natural Shaving Cream has this one beat six ways from Sunday.</li>
            <li> I generally like Neutrogena products, but this was a let down for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My whiskers are pretty thick.  I tried this \\&quot;Cream\\&quot;, and it was just too runny.  Don&#x27;t try this in the shower.  Even at the sink it didn&#x27;t help much.  There was as much of a mess on my hands as opposed to what was on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now don&#x27;t get me wrong.  This is my experience with the product everyone is different when it comes to the subject of shaving.  If you are someone who prefers shaving lotion over foams and gels, then I&#x27;d recommend this.  If you&#x27;re looking for an actual cream, there is other stuff out there.  Creamo Cream for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is one good thing, it&#x27;s affordable...  I believe this product works better for those who have fine facial hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena should&#x27;ve called this \\&quot;Shaving Lotion\\&quot; rather than cream.</li>
            <li> Love it for its close shave and how it makes my face feel nice and smooth. You could not ask for a better mens facial product.</li>
            <li> My son has a heavy beard for a 16 yr old and because he still has young sensitive skin, he is prone to almost severe, annoying and itchy razor bumps. He tried pretty much all the shaving creams out there to no avail. I came across this at a local drugstore (CVS?)..a bit expensive for a small tube but was I desperate for him to stop the suffering.  Well finally, something works! In a matter of 1 week, (he shaves every 2-3 days) it started to clear up. He swears by it and it is all he uses.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff never goes on sale at the drugstores. I paid more for one tube than what it sells here for a 2-pack. He ran out of this stuff so I&#x27;m buying it here at this great price.</li>
            <li> Excellent base for close shave and leaves my skin feeling great.  No mess and good for the environment.  Top notch product.</li>
            <li> Crema regula no produce demasiada espuma</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  Works way better than any shaving foam or gel that I&#x27;ve used.  One tube lasts a long time because I only need a small amount.  Provides a very smooth glide for the razor and prevents irritation and shaving bumps.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and I&#x27;ll never go back to any other kind.</li>
            <li> I have recently started shaving with a double-edged safety razor, and thought I would try this product. While it does keep my skin from irritation, I am not sure it provides the best experience with the razor I use. It could be because of my inexperience with the blade, but I do not feel this has the lift to give me a close shave.</li>
            <li> I switched to a Norelco electric shaver about a year ago after being traditional blade user forever.  The Nutrogena came with it, and it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve been buying since.  I don&#x27;t like using the electric shaver without anything - tried using regular gel cream that I used to use, but the Nutrogena spoiled me - just so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Walgreens on a lark. Best shaving decision I ever made. This product has helped me avoid razor burn which has plagued me for years. The red marks under my chin and on my neck used to impress men and women alike. Most believed that I was getting regular \\&quot;hickies\\&quot; which, believe me, felt really masculine and weird at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this cream is pretty thick and a little bit goes a long way. Wetting your face before applying this product helps the razor or shaver glide more easily during my shave. I use this in conjunction with a Panasonic electric shaver and can say unequivocally that my razor burn days have passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is easy. The shave cream rinses off with soap and water with no apparent residue. Neutrogena produces other emollients for the after-shave party, but I haven&#x27;t found them necessary. This product does a great job of creating a slick shaving surface on your face while moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li> This is the only shave cream my hubby will use and here on Amazon, its the best price when you buy 2.&lt;br /&gt;He used to have a problem with bumps after shaving no matter what he used, but he doesn&#x27;t with this.&lt;br /&gt;Glad he&#x27;s a happy camper</li>
            <li> This shave cream is very &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; and thus requires a lot more &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; to properly cover your face. I compare it to Harrys which I&#x27;ve also use and there is no comparison. You get what you pay for. If you want a true cream, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after the Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel became unavailable.  I strongly advise against the Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Shave Cream.  Although it works, distributing the cream over my face is difficult as it seems to want to clump in patches and after the shave, the cream will stick between the blades.  I have never had any difficulty washing hair and shaving lubricant from between the blades of my razors.  This Neutrogena Men Sensitive Skin Shave Cream is a frustrating exception.  Please look elsewhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:...it works...&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it does not want to distribute evenly over face&lt;br /&gt;  it gets stuck between the blades!</li>
            <li> Very good shave cream.  Amazon&#x27;s price is usually lower than in the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Im sure its good for others but this product did not work for me. I started to wet shave with a de razor and bought proraso products after no luck with this. Wayyy better than anything ive ever used.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and very  clean. I like it a lot. Since my skin is very thin, this is a must-have.</li>
            <li> A \\&quot;thin\\&quot; layer, as the directions describe, is simply not enough to shave with.  I ended up getting more razor burn and bumps from using this product.  I typically shave in the shower, so I assumed at first maybe the hot water was contributing to the lack luster results of this product.  I then attempted to use outside of the shower, but it still gave the same results causing more irritation on my skin.</li>
            <li> Shaving performance is very good. but it doesn&#x27;t wash off as quickly as other cream and leaves the scent, which is rather artificial/chemical. Neutrogena should just make this in fragrance free.... instead of using some cheap perfume. I just couldn&#x27;t use it more than 2 times and throw it away. Cheap price and cheap quality</li>
            <li> This is difficult to find in the stores near where I live.  Wal-mart is ALWAYS out of it.  I am thrilled that I found it here and at a wonderful price.  I stocked up and bought 3 packs of 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves this, it is the only thing he will use.  It smells wonderful and makes his face very soft.</li>
            <li> My go to shave cream. Good lubrication. Easy on my somewhat sensitive skin and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent traveler and this works great in my travel kit.</li>
            <li> This was a pleasant surprise. I have tried a few other similar products, including the non-sensitive skin version, and was never that impressed. The sensitive skin version really does help with electric razor irritation; it&#x27;s hard to explain, but my face is a bit less red afterward now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube lasts a really long time if you&#x27;re shaving every day, so a pack of 2 is good for several months in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it can really leave a lot of residue on my electric razor. It takes me a good solid minute of rinsing with scalding-hot water to remove everything. A small price to pay, I guess.</li>
            <li> This product provides a great shave.  The cream is very smooth on the face.  I do not get razor burn when using this product.</li>
            <li> I shave my entire head daily. This works great, has a very nice fragrance and does not require a lot of product for adequate coverage. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years now and its hands down the best shave cream on the market.  Its better than anything that Jack Black, Zirh, Lab Series and even Art of Shaving has to offer and Neutrogena costs a fraction of the price compared to those heavy hitters.  Overall, Neutrogena makes great products but this is a stand out and a must have for men.</li>
