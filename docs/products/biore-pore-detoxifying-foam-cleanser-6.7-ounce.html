            <li>works and feels great</li>
            <li>This product is great</li>
            <li>It is very effective at cleaning the face, even the oily areas.  </li>
            <li>On the bright side, the scent is relaxing and the foamy suds wash off cleanly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got it for a good price.</li>
            <li>It also makes my T-zone look good, and shrinks my pores in that area.</li>
            <li>Though I felt tingling (from menthol in the cleanser), my skin felt good after using this.</li>
            <li>I also got it at a good price, with an online coupon.</li>
            <li>She loved the product and would buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this did feel like a good product.</li>

            <li>The appearance of the bottle is attractive and is suitable for use by both genders and by all ages.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice menthol-y and pleasant aroma and it makes my skin feel invigorated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing and the smell is relaxing.</li>
            <li>Just because it didn&#x27;t work out for me, it might still work for you, so give it a try since Biore has a good reputation for making well-received and effective products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a Neutrogena fan than a Biore fan, but the performance of this face wash has got me thinking of switching brands - it&#x27;s a very nice product</li>
            <li>I love this facewash!</li>
            <li>When my girlfriend, Tammy, came to visit, I had to let her sniff the foam; she also liked it.  </li>

            <li>Biore detoxifying cleanser felt nice on.</li>

            <li>like this because it&#x27;s very gentle and it has a nice, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was left feeling like it worked fine and was pleasant and priced fairly, and I&#x27;d use it as a \\&quot;back-up\\&quot; to my favored product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it cleans my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the way it cleans my skin and detoxsify</li>
            <li>You would love the cleaning feeling it gave you to the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of Biore products over the years and have found that most tend to be geared towards oily or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been impressed with every cleanser by Biore I&#x27;ve tried, and have tried several now.</li>
            <li>I decided I love this.  </li>
            <li>and so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very neutral scent, which is neither attractive nor repulsive.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite biore product.  </li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and hope it never goes away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite cleanser</li>
            <li>This cleanser is a foaming cleaser, which I love.</li>
            <li>Now that I know better, I&#x27;d rather make safer choices.</li>
            <li>This is indeed a refreshing face</li>
            <li>This has a nice, very light scent that I originally assumed was from the plant extracts in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice pleasant fragrance with just a hint of a chemical smell to it, but overall, was nice.</li>
            <li>This rinses away very easily and cleanly, but I can&#x27;t stop touching my face after I use this.  </li>
            <li>It has a heady, intoxicating smell that is very pleasant and addictive.  </li>
            <li>It has a heady, intoxicating smell that is very pleasant and addictive.  </li>
            <li>Your face will literally feel so fresh after using this!!</li>
            <li>Love the foaming wash because it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>The foundation I wear is a strong color-stay version, and between it and all the mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, etc, I need something with a bit more texture to it to help scrub it all off.</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing to the skin and is easily rinsed off with a splash of water.</li>
            <li>I particularly enjoyed the light herbal</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it has not broken me out, burned, chapped, or made my face itch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the lightweight foam this dispenses, the lack of any scent, and best of all, my skin looks and feels super smooth, firm and amazing without any dryness.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and oil-free, and the foaming quality makes it refreshing.</li>
            <li>Foamy and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>It takes off makeup easily too.</li>
            <li>I found it to be a bit too strong for over 45+</li>
            <li>The self foaming product makes the cleaning more true like.</li>
            <li>design of the pump is pretty nice, but I don&#x27;t like the lid.</li>
            <li>Given the price of face cleaners, being able to stretch the amount used is never a bad thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has a light foam that goes on easily and cleans off easily.  </li>
            <li>I have not used this yet, but combined with the coupon that was offered, I got a super deal on it!</li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]]).  </li>
            <li>However, I always apply a light layer of Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion</li>
            <li>I experienced a sudden increase in acne</li>
            <li>Detoxifying Cleanser is one of the most exciting products I&#x27;ve tried this year.  </li>
            <li>I experienced a sudden increase in acne</li>
            <li>Detoxifying Cleanser is one of the most exciting products I&#x27;ve tried this year.  </li>
            <li>foaming formula feels as light to wash with as the powder is that it washes off.</li>
            <li>Still a nice product and one pump does your whole face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I gave myself a great facial mask that tightened and smoothed.  </li>
            <li>in all, this is a great product if you want to give your face a deep cleanse.</li>
            <li>This foam smells and feels nice enough, but I can&#x27;t say that I find it all that effective.</li>
            <li>It leave skin feeling clean but not dry love it!!</li>
            <li>Very economical.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling very fresh and refreshed without over drying.  </li>
            <li>cleanser foams which makes it lather well for quick and easy distribution, scrubbing, and then rinsing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought this was a mild foamy face wash that was easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice foamy cleanser that left my face refreshingly clean and tingling.</li>
            <li>So I use my MAC Cleansing oil on my face first, and use the Biore on top to remove everything.</li>
            <li>However, it does seem to do what soap does and it can be applied more simply and is more enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>It works well to clean my skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and neutral  </li>
            <li>It would clean your face, if it did not have make-up on it.</li>
            <li>I like how clean this makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li>It rinsed of cleanly.</li>
            <li>face felt really clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Skin does feel clean -- some minor irritations that cleared quickly but not overly happy with product.  </li>
            <li>This has been the best face wash for me, which took me a while to come across since I tried many other products, it does not dry out my skin or cause acne.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, because of the Amazon Vine Program, I discovered the Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser, which is unisexual in appearance and intention and is fun to use.  </li>
            <li>I just think there is something so cool about pumps that aerate things and make them all foamy.</li>
            <li>So I was surprised that I liked the Biore 4 i4n 1 Detoxifying cleanser.</li>
            <li>While I am not at all sure that my face needs to be detoxed (it doesn&#x27;t get out much)</li>
            <li>Just to be sure, I used a blemish pad after washing my face; it came off white and clean :)</li>
            <li>It has a neutral smell and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I love the foam and how it makes my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It has no fragrance, rinses away cleanly, foams gently, and leaves my skin smooth and glowing, with no residue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent amount of foam and it glides across the skin easily and rinses off cleanly.</li>
            <li>However many days I don&#x27;t wear any makeup, or just a light layer of Bare Mineral powder foundation and some eye liner and mascara.</li>
            <li>it did a good job of cleansing my skin and did not leave it dry or irritated.</li>
            <li>It feels fresh, and gave you a \\&quot;\\&quot;detox\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li>I love the foaming action of the Biore 4 in 1.  </li>
            <li>I love the foaming action of the Biore 4 in 1.  </li>
            <li>This is surprising as I expected a tighter foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was curious how good their cleanser would be.</li>
            <li>I find that Biore products are targeted most to young people, who often have issues with oily skin and acne.  </li>
            <li>It left my face clean and very smooth to the touch, but was drying.</li>
            <li>I really like how fresh and clean it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>Money saving right there.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is very light, which is generally the case with foaming products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much for my skin to feel tight and tortured with cleansing products, but surprisingly this light and foamy cleanser just made my skin feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>Both times, I felt it has a slight medicinal/chemical smell to it-- not disgusting, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love LOVE this product, but it it not really available anymore-</li>
            <li>it works very very well for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Biore has created another decent product for oily skin, and if the price is right and you have issues with oil, I think it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>I like most of Biore&#x27;s facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different facewashes</li>
            <li>I find washing my face with this an effortless task, so I&#x27;m much more likely to wash my face before going to bed when I don&#x27;t wear makeup using this, rather than just skipping it and going to bed with the day&#x27;s oils still on my skin.</li>
            <li>Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser is my favorite among all of my skin care producs for daily use.</li>
            <li>This is a big plus for me as most of the scents in skin care products drive me</li>
            <li>maybe because I&#x27;m used to a different foaming cleanser that strips away oils even more.</li>
            <li>There are too many known irritants here, and potential</li>
            <li>The 4 in 1 detoxifying  foam is my favorite facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The foam is convenient to apply and it gives skin a nice tingle and left my face feeling good, but no different than using other cleansers.</li>
            <li>It was soft and clean without being too squeaky and didn&#x27;t feel stripped.</li>
            <li>think this works fine, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth the added cost relative to a good bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy this versus a different cleanser, because I haven&#x27;t found something extra-special about this product, but it&#x27;s a good solid cleanser all around.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t consider this until recently, so I was more concerned with eating organic than worrying about things like shampoos and face washes, which I figured couldn&#x27;t do me much harm.</li>
            <li>The former felt very much like menthol, which was confirmed when I checked the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>; bring back this product for the loyal people who love and use it for a price like you had last year!</li>
            <li>and it is reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>I once had an oily complexion that was out of control until I learned to exfoliate my facial skin with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I feel like the foaming cleanswer is really helping.</li>
            <li>It gently cleans and leaves my face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I know the foam doesn&#x27;t REALLY help in the cleansing process</li>
            <li>This cleanser seemed extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>As for stimulates - as it says on the bottle, it is way too gentle for me to be considered</li>
            <li>For me, it works very well.</li>
            <li>so even if you don&#x27;t care all that much for it, you won&#x27;t be smelling it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin - stripped just a bit too much.  </li>
            <li>It cleans the face very well&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this.</li>
            <li>I really like this Biore Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s foams gently.</li>
            <li>very difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It was not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]].</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used MANY different face washes and this by far takes the cake.</li>
            <li>I would love to try other products made by Biore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would love to try other products made by Biore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels cleaner and refreshed after use without the drying that I have with many other face products.</li>
            <li>The product comes out as a rather loose foam that is easy to rub on your face.</li>
            <li>and if you suffer from back acne head and shoulder classic clean has done wonders compared to everything else that does not even work well for me anyways</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and fresh and the wash was slightly invigorating.</li>
            <li>And I was absolutely surprised at how smooth it left my skin.  </li>
            <li>This one in particular feels like it&#x27;s drying out my skin every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>perhaps a teenager with high oil could use this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Foamy face wash is nice to use, but I recommend sticking with the other Biore cleansers, such as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pass this up for myself as a summer cleanser if I found a bargain, but with my very dry areas it wouldn&#x27;t be something I could use comfortably all year.</li>
            <li>As it turns out, it will clean your face, but then leave it a bit dry, requiring the addition of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It has no particular smell and seems mild and gentle.  </li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s not quite as fun as the steam activated Biore face cleanser, it is a close second.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, but my only reaction was lightly burning eyes and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed clearer, softer skin with less noticeable fine lines since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not happy with how soap handles your face, this is probably going to be a little better, but this also will cost more and creates more material waste with the plastic dispenser.</li>
            <li>But tightening effect was so strong in comparison to other cleanser I&#x27;ve used in the past that I think it actually did stripped all the moisture and there was some kind of film left afterwards (from one of the ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clear while not overdrying.</li>
            <li>, it is oil free, but I really do not see the deep cleansing that it claims and do not quite understand what the 4 in 1 is.</li>
            <li>I like this product and so does my 12 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>One pump is enough for the whole</li>
            <li>But for my daughter&#x27;s younger skin, it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend Simple products if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference is skin healthiness between this and the many other over the counter cleansers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Because of my oily complexion, I normally choose one that has tiny scrub granules inside the gel or lotion.  </li>
            <li>I tend to be a little heavy handed when I&#x27;m dishing out products, so foaming cleansers are great for me, because you are less likely to use too much.</li>
            <li>&quot;  If you wish to remain young looking for as long as you can, do not do TOO MUCH of the following because they will rob your skin of its elasticity and vital nutrients:  Sunbath, smoke, and drink alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I actually cleaned my face so much with this that I used the entire bottle.  </li>
            <li>I expected that this product would be stripping or drying to my combination/dry mature skin, but it really wasn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It rinses thoroughly and leaves the skin feeling fresh and taut and even a little tingly for a minute or two.  </li>
            <li>definitely deep cleans and would recommend especially for young</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and large pores in my T-zone and this shrinks them down to nothing.  </li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of foaming face cleaners (or any cleaning treatment).  </li>
            <li>But this time I decided to read just a little further because her review interested me.</li>
            <li>and it did not irritate my dry old lady skin or my cause</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and a little \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; after use (with the latter due, I image, to the menthol in the soap).</li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> works and feels great</li>
            <li> This product is great</li>
            <li> It is very effective at cleaning the face, even the oily areas.  </li>
            <li> On the bright side, the scent is relaxing and the foamy suds wash off cleanly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got it for a good price.</li>
            <li> It also makes my T-zone look good, and shrinks my pores in that area.</li>
            <li> Though I felt tingling (from menthol in the cleanser), my skin felt good after using this.</li>
            <li> I also got it at a good price, with an online coupon.</li>
            <li> She loved the product and would buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this did feel like a good product.</li>
            <li> The name Biore has a good  reputation</li>
            <li> It does a good job and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling too</li>
            <li> Good product and</li>
            <li> The appearance of the bottle is attractive and is suitable for use by both genders and by all ages.  </li>
            <li> The appearance of the bottle is attractive and is suitable for use by both genders and by all ages.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice menthol-y and pleasant aroma and it makes my skin feel invigorated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing and the smell is relaxing.</li>
            <li> Just because it didn&#x27;t work out for me, it might still work for you, so give it a try since Biore has a good reputation for making well-received and effective products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a Neutrogena fan than a Biore fan, but the performance of this face wash has got me thinking of switching brands - it&#x27;s a very nice product</li>
            <li> I love this facewash!</li>
            <li> When my girlfriend, Tammy, came to visit, I had to let her sniff the foam; she also liked it.  </li>

            <li> Biore detoxifying cleanser felt nice on.</li>
            <li> It really does not feel very good.  </li>
            <li> Foams nicely, cleans okay.</li>
            <li> This product has been by far the best wash I have evey used</li>
            <li> The foaming cleanser leave your face feeling fresh and your pores happy.</li>
            <li> like this because it&#x27;s very gentle and it has a nice, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was left feeling like it worked fine and was pleasant and priced fairly, and I&#x27;d use it as a \\&quot;back-up\\&quot; to my favored product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it cleans my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way it cleans my skin and detoxsify</li>
            <li> You would love the cleaning feeling it gave you to the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of Biore products over the years and have found that most tend to be geared towards oily or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed with every cleanser by Biore I&#x27;ve tried, and have tried several now.</li>
            <li> I decided I love this.  </li>
            <li> and so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very neutral scent, which is neither attractive nor repulsive.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite biore product.  </li>
            <li> but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and hope it never goes away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite cleanser</li>
            <li> This cleanser is a foaming cleaser, which I love.</li>
            <li> Now that I know better, I&#x27;d rather make safer choices.</li>
            <li> This is indeed a refreshing face</li>
            <li> This has a nice, very light scent that I originally assumed was from the plant extracts in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice pleasant fragrance with just a hint of a chemical smell to it, but overall, was nice.</li>
            <li> This rinses away very easily and cleanly, but I can&#x27;t stop touching my face after I use this.  </li>
            <li> It has a heady, intoxicating smell that is very pleasant and addictive.  </li>
            <li> It has a heady, intoxicating smell that is very pleasant and addictive.  </li>
            <li> Your face will literally feel so fresh after using this!!</li>
            <li> Love the foaming wash because it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> The foundation I wear is a strong color-stay version, and between it and all the mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, etc, I need something with a bit more texture to it to help scrub it all off.</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing to the skin and is easily rinsed off with a splash of water.</li>
            <li> I particularly enjoyed the light herbal</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it has not broken me out, burned, chapped, or made my face itch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the lightweight foam this dispenses, the lack of any scent, and best of all, my skin looks and feels super smooth, firm and amazing without any dryness.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean and oil-free, and the foaming quality makes it refreshing.</li>
            <li> Foamy and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> It takes off makeup easily too.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a bit too strong for over 45+</li>
            <li> The self foaming product makes the cleaning more true like.</li>
            <li> design of the pump is pretty nice, but I don&#x27;t like the lid.</li>
            <li> Given the price of face cleaners, being able to stretch the amount used is never a bad thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a light foam that goes on easily and cleans off easily.  </li>
            <li> I have not used this yet, but combined with the coupon that was offered, I got a super deal on it!</li>

            <li> However, I always apply a light layer of Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion</li>
            <li> I experienced a sudden increase in acne</li>
            <li> Detoxifying Cleanser is one of the most exciting products I&#x27;ve tried this year.  </li>
            <li> I experienced a sudden increase in acne</li>
            <li> Detoxifying Cleanser is one of the most exciting products I&#x27;ve tried this year.  </li>
            <li> foaming formula feels as light to wash with as the powder is that it washes off.</li>
            <li> Still a nice product and one pump does your whole face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I gave myself a great facial mask that tightened and smoothed.  </li>
            <li> in all, this is a great product if you want to give your face a deep cleanse.</li>
            <li> This foam smells and feels nice enough, but I can&#x27;t say that I find it all that effective.</li>
            <li> It leave skin feeling clean but not dry love it!!</li>
            <li> Very economical.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling very fresh and refreshed without over drying.  </li>
            <li> cleanser foams which makes it lather well for quick and easy distribution, scrubbing, and then rinsing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought this was a mild foamy face wash that was easy to rinse off.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice foamy cleanser that left my face refreshingly clean and tingling.</li>
            <li> So I use my MAC Cleansing oil on my face first, and use the Biore on top to remove everything.</li>
            <li> However, it does seem to do what soap does and it can be applied more simply and is more enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> It works well to clean my skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and neutral  </li>
            <li> It would clean your face, if it did not have make-up on it.</li>
            <li> I like how clean this makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li> It rinsed of cleanly.</li>
            <li> face felt really clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Skin does feel clean -- some minor irritations that cleared quickly but not overly happy with product.  </li>
            <li> This has been the best face wash for me, which took me a while to come across since I tried many other products, it does not dry out my skin or cause acne.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, because of the Amazon Vine Program, I discovered the Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser, which is unisexual in appearance and intention and is fun to use.  </li>
            <li> I just think there is something so cool about pumps that aerate things and make them all foamy.</li>
            <li> So I was surprised that I liked the Biore 4 i4n 1 Detoxifying cleanser.</li>
            <li> While I am not at all sure that my face needs to be detoxed (it doesn&#x27;t get out much)</li>
            <li> Just to be sure, I used a blemish pad after washing my face; it came off white and clean :)</li>
            <li> It has a neutral smell and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I love the foam and how it makes my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It has no fragrance, rinses away cleanly, foams gently, and leaves my skin smooth and glowing, with no residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent amount of foam and it glides across the skin easily and rinses off cleanly.</li>
            <li> However many days I don&#x27;t wear any makeup, or just a light layer of Bare Mineral powder foundation and some eye liner and mascara.</li>
            <li> it did a good job of cleansing my skin and did not leave it dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> It feels fresh, and gave you a \\&quot;\\&quot;detox\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li> I love the foaming action of the Biore 4 in 1.  </li>
            <li> I love the foaming action of the Biore 4 in 1.  </li>
            <li> This is surprising as I expected a tighter foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was curious how good their cleanser would be.</li>
            <li> I find that Biore products are targeted most to young people, who often have issues with oily skin and acne.  </li>
            <li> It left my face clean and very smooth to the touch, but was drying.</li>
            <li> I really like how fresh and clean it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> Money saving right there.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is very light, which is generally the case with foaming products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much for my skin to feel tight and tortured with cleansing products, but surprisingly this light and foamy cleanser just made my skin feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Both times, I felt it has a slight medicinal/chemical smell to it-- not disgusting, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love LOVE this product, but it it not really available anymore-</li>
            <li> it works very very well for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Biore has created another decent product for oily skin, and if the price is right and you have issues with oil, I think it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I like most of Biore&#x27;s facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different facewashes</li>
            <li> I find washing my face with this an effortless task, so I&#x27;m much more likely to wash my face before going to bed when I don&#x27;t wear makeup using this, rather than just skipping it and going to bed with the day&#x27;s oils still on my skin.</li>
            <li> Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser is my favorite among all of my skin care producs for daily use.</li>
            <li> This is a big plus for me as most of the scents in skin care products drive me</li>
            <li> maybe because I&#x27;m used to a different foaming cleanser that strips away oils even more.</li>
            <li> There are too many known irritants here, and potential</li>
            <li> The 4 in 1 detoxifying  foam is my favorite facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> The foam is convenient to apply and it gives skin a nice tingle and left my face feeling good, but no different than using other cleansers.</li>
            <li> It was soft and clean without being too squeaky and didn&#x27;t feel stripped.</li>
            <li> think this works fine, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth the added cost relative to a good bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy this versus a different cleanser, because I haven&#x27;t found something extra-special about this product, but it&#x27;s a good solid cleanser all around.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t consider this until recently, so I was more concerned with eating organic than worrying about things like shampoos and face washes, which I figured couldn&#x27;t do me much harm.</li>
            <li> The former felt very much like menthol, which was confirmed when I checked the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> ; bring back this product for the loyal people who love and use it for a price like you had last year!</li>
            <li> and it is reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> I once had an oily complexion that was out of control until I learned to exfoliate my facial skin with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I feel like the foaming cleanswer is really helping.</li>
            <li> It gently cleans and leaves my face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I know the foam doesn&#x27;t REALLY help in the cleansing process</li>
            <li> This cleanser seemed extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> As for stimulates - as it says on the bottle, it is way too gentle for me to be considered</li>
            <li> For me, it works very well.</li>
            <li> so even if you don&#x27;t care all that much for it, you won&#x27;t be smelling it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin - stripped just a bit too much.  </li>
            <li> It cleans the face very well&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this.</li>
            <li> I really like this Biore Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s foams gently.</li>
            <li> very difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It was not irritating at all.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used MANY different face washes and this by far takes the cake.</li>
            <li> I would love to try other products made by Biore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would love to try other products made by Biore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face feels cleaner and refreshed after use without the drying that I have with many other face products.</li>
            <li> The product comes out as a rather loose foam that is easy to rub on your face.</li>
            <li> and if you suffer from back acne head and shoulder classic clean has done wonders compared to everything else that does not even work well for me anyways</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and fresh and the wash was slightly invigorating.</li>
            <li> And I was absolutely surprised at how smooth it left my skin.  </li>
            <li> This one in particular feels like it&#x27;s drying out my skin every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> perhaps a teenager with high oil could use this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Foamy face wash is nice to use, but I recommend sticking with the other Biore cleansers, such as the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pass this up for myself as a summer cleanser if I found a bargain, but with my very dry areas it wouldn&#x27;t be something I could use comfortably all year.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, it will clean your face, but then leave it a bit dry, requiring the addition of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It has no particular smell and seems mild and gentle.  </li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s not quite as fun as the steam activated Biore face cleanser, it is a close second.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, but my only reaction was lightly burning eyes and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed clearer, softer skin with less noticeable fine lines since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not happy with how soap handles your face, this is probably going to be a little better, but this also will cost more and creates more material waste with the plastic dispenser.</li>
            <li> But tightening effect was so strong in comparison to other cleanser I&#x27;ve used in the past that I think it actually did stripped all the moisture and there was some kind of film left afterwards (from one of the ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clear while not overdrying.</li>
            <li> , it is oil free, but I really do not see the deep cleansing that it claims and do not quite understand what the 4 in 1 is.</li>
            <li> I like this product and so does my 12 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> One pump is enough for the whole</li>
            <li> But for my daughter&#x27;s younger skin, it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend Simple products if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference is skin healthiness between this and the many other over the counter cleansers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Because of my oily complexion, I normally choose one that has tiny scrub granules inside the gel or lotion.  </li>
            <li> I tend to be a little heavy handed when I&#x27;m dishing out products, so foaming cleansers are great for me, because you are less likely to use too much.</li>
            <li> &quot;  If you wish to remain young looking for as long as you can, do not do TOO MUCH of the following because they will rob your skin of its elasticity and vital nutrients:  Sunbath, smoke, and drink alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I actually cleaned my face so much with this that I used the entire bottle.  </li>
            <li> I expected that this product would be stripping or drying to my combination/dry mature skin, but it really wasn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It rinses thoroughly and leaves the skin feeling fresh and taut and even a little tingly for a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> definitely deep cleans and would recommend especially for young</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and large pores in my T-zone and this shrinks them down to nothing.  </li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of foaming face cleaners (or any cleaning treatment).  </li>
            <li> But this time I decided to read just a little further because her review interested me.</li>
            <li> and it did not irritate my dry old lady skin or my cause</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and a little \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; after use (with the latter due, I image, to the menthol in the soap).</li>
            <li> The effects seem to last well throughout the day, too -- with other products, I have sometimes felt greasy by early afternoon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave it on because it&#x27;s fair impossible to get the lid off with wet hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only need one pump to cover the whole entire face that mean your product would last months and months.</li>
            <li> The detoxifying angle of this seems to be tied up to some extent in green tea extract, but I&#x27;m not sure what makes this special as a facial cleanser beyond that point.</li>
            <li> They cleansers last for a long time, and I wash my face 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> This is normal and should disappear in a few days.  </li>
            <li> This is normal and should disappear in a few days.  </li>
            <li> After numerous uses this did dry my skin, recommend for oily complexions.</li>
            <li> I like the foaming action because it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> That being said, I didn&#x27;t feel that I was getting the same level of deep cleaning that I get from the other Biore products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> the same time skin wasn&#x27;t very dry, and I had a feeling that cleanser didn&#x27;t stripped the moisture.</li>
            <li> I will occasionally use a facial scrub to remove any dead skin/buildup that might accumulate, but overall this item is a must for me.</li>
            <li> I would update my review considering mosterizing and healthfull improvment in long term use.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this product was far to harsh for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally sensitive to skin-care products</li>
            <li> As long as Biore keeps making this, I&#x27;ll keep using it.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Interestingly, using dangerous products on your skin or hair may be MORE dangerous than eating the products because your digestive tract has enzymes to break down chemicals and excrete them from your body fairly quickly, whereas when your skin absorbs them, they can get into your bloodstream and stay there for a long time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> It works well to clean my skin. Got it for a good price. I like most of Biore&#x27;s facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now and it works great!  It is the best thing I have found on the market and it is reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> This has been the best face wash for me, which took me a while to come across since I tried many other products, it does not dry out my skin or cause acne. I love the foam and how it makes my face soft and clean. I ordered 4 of these, since they hardly can keep it in stock in the stores. They cleansers last for a long time, and I wash my face 2 times a day. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love LOVE this product, but it it not really available anymore- it now costs over $20 for this size on Amazon, and last year was around $5-7.  Biore appears to not be making it for the market and is pushing their black charcoal product instead- which is absolutely HORRIBLE.  Please Biore--&amp;#62; bring back this product for the loyal people who love and use it for a price like you had last year!</li>
            <li> Works great at cleaning up my oily skin.  I also used the Biore strip on my skin.  I actually cleaned my face so much with this that I used the entire bottle.  Love the foaming wash because it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> As someone who has always had oily skin and occasional breakouts, this has been my go-to product for years. It leaves my skin feeling clean and oil-free, and the foaming quality makes it refreshing. The effects seem to last well throughout the day, too -- with other products, I have sometimes felt greasy by early afternoon. I will occasionally use a facial scrub to remove any dead skin/buildup that might accumulate, but overall this item is a must for me.</li>
            <li> Best. Face wash. EVER! Your face will literally feel so fresh after using this!! It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve used MANY different face washes and this by far takes the cake.</li>
            <li> Foamy and easy to wash off. Gentle on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this facewash! I&#x27;ve tried so many different facewashes and they all make my face breakout. Except for this one and other Biore facewashes.</li>
            <li> Hard to find.  Works great</li>
            <li> I have a mix of dry/oily skin. I love the way it cleans my skin. It feels fresh, and gave you a \\&quot;\\&quot;detox\\&quot; feeling. It gives you a slighlty tingling feeling thats makes you face feels refresh. The self foaming product makes the cleaning more true like. I love the way it cleans my skin and detoxsify , You only need a liitle of product so it last. You would love the cleaning feeling it gave you to the skin. I would update my review considering mosterizing and healthfull improvment in long term use.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clear while not overdrying. At 67 with oily skin, this is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve found. Gets makeup off and never stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> Bior&amp;eacute; 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser is a thin foam with a moderate scent of eucalyptus.  It is very effective at cleaning the face, even the oily areas.  It rinses thoroughly and leaves the skin feeling fresh and taut and even a little tingly for a minute or two.  It&#x27;s very refreshing and the smell is relaxing.</li>
            <li> I once had an oily complexion that was out of control until I learned to exfoliate my facial skin with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System ([[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz]]).  I use the battery-operated cleansing brush at least twice a day.  However, I vary the face scrub.  There are a million types of face scrub on the market.  Because of my oily complexion, I normally choose one that has tiny scrub granules inside the gel or lotion.  Recently, I tried the Axe Oily Skin Face Scrub, Controil ([[ASIN:B00A0J088U Axe Oily Skin Face Scrub, Controil, 5 Ounce]]), which does an excellent job of exfoliating my face.  However, it is designed for men and using it every day can become monotonous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Fortunately, because of the Amazon Vine Program, I discovered the Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser, which is unisexual in appearance and intention and is fun to use.  It foams, reminding me of the foaming anti-bacterial soap that is sold at Bath &amp; Body Works.  I&#x27;ve used the Biore 4 in 1 on my hands and face.  I wash my face with it at least twice, sometimes three times, a day.  It hasn&#x27;t dried out my face.  However, I always apply a light layer of Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion [[[ASIN:B001ECQ55M Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion , 20.3Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)]]] on my face after I shower in the morning and before I go to bed at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  A few months ago, I was telling my friend, Kathy, that I was approaching fifty.  Her teenage daughter, Savannah, asked me, \\&quot;Where are your wrinkles?\\&quot;  If you wish to remain young looking for as long as you can, do not do TOO MUCH of the following because they will rob your skin of its elasticity and vital nutrients:  Sunbath, smoke, and drink alcohol.  However, do drink plenty of water, use a hypoallergenic face lotion, and exfoliate your skin in order to rid it of impurities.  The Biore 4 in 1 detoxifies ones skin.  During the detoxification process, one may experience a sudden increasing or flaring of acne.  This is normal and should disappear in a few days.  This happened to me when I was younger and was using a topical form of antibiotic in order to control my acne.  I experienced a sudden increase in acne but it soon disappeared.  I recommend that an inexpensive face lotion be used in conjunction with the Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser in order to prevent dry, irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I love the foaming action of the Biore 4 in 1.  One squirt provides enough foam to cover my entire face.  Any excess can be spread on my chest and shoulders.  After all, my complexion doesn&#x27;t end with my neck.  The scent is heavenly.  It has a heady, intoxicating smell that is very pleasant and addictive.  When my girlfriend, Tammy, came to visit, I had to let her sniff the foam; she also liked it.  The appearance of the bottle is attractive and is suitable for use by both genders and by all ages.  The Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser is one of the most exciting products I&#x27;ve tried this year.  I recommended that my teenage nephew, Jacob, use it because, like me when I was his age, he has a slight case of acne.  His grandmother said she&#x27;d buy him a bottle.  I would love to try other products made by Biore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyosasing or flaring of acne.  This is normal and should disappear in a few days.

            <li> I had never tried the detoxifying cleaner but because of the coupon that was offered I decided to try it it works wonderfully and smells great.</li>
            <li> On days when I wear makeup, I need something with an exfoliant in it to help scrub it all off. The foundation I wear is a strong color-stay version, and between it and all the mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, etc, I need something with a bit more texture to it to help scrub it all off. However many days I don&#x27;t wear any makeup, or just a light layer of Bare Mineral powder foundation and some eye liner and mascara. On those days, this Biore cleanser works well for washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foaming formula feels as light to wash with as the powder is that it washes off. It feels refreshing to the skin and is easily rinsed off with a splash of water. I find washing my face with this an effortless task, so I&#x27;m much more likely to wash my face before going to bed when I don&#x27;t wear makeup using this, rather than just skipping it and going to bed with the day&#x27;s oils still on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the strangest cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried! I&#x27;ve used a lot of Biore products over the years and have found that most tend to be geared towards oily or acne-prone skin. I expected that this product would be stripping or drying to my combination/dry mature skin, but it really wasn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much for my skin to feel tight and tortured with cleansing products, but surprisingly this light and foamy cleanser just made my skin feel refreshed. It has a nice menthol-y and pleasant aroma and it makes my skin feel invigorated. It doesn&#x27;t do squat to remove eye makeup, though. So I use my MAC Cleansing oil on my face first, and use the Biore on top to remove everything. I really like how fresh and clean it makes my face feel. Surprisingly it has not broken me out, burned, chapped, or made my face itch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily or mostly-combination skin, you&#x27;ll probably like this. I have some areas where anything short of a cream just won&#x27;t do well, so I&#x27;m liking this Biore as a spring/summer cleanser for drier skins but not in winter. I wouldn&#x27;t pass this up for myself as a summer cleanser if I found a bargain, but with my very dry areas it wouldn&#x27;t be something I could use comfortably all year. Still a nice product and one pump does your whole face. Very economical.</li>
            <li> This is a foaming cleanser. It has a nice pleasant fragrance with just a hint of a chemical smell to it, but overall, was nice. it did a good job of cleansing my skin and did not leave it dry or irritated. It is a &#x60;deep cleansing&#x27; cleanser so I don&#x27;t use it as my daily cleanser, but just once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed with every cleanser by Biore I&#x27;ve tried, and have tried several now. This one is excellent. It has no fragrance, rinses away cleanly, foams gently, and leaves my skin smooth and glowing, with no residue. It also makes my T-zone look good, and shrinks my pores in that area. It takes off makeup easily too. I can&#x27;t find anything bad to say about this. I would definitely purchase this when it runs out, although the bottle is a generous size so that may be awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit:&lt;br /&gt;I upped this from four to five stars.  I decided I love this.  I have oily skin and large pores in my T-zone and this shrinks them down to nothing.  I love the lightweight foam this dispenses, the lack of any scent, and best of all, my skin looks and feels super smooth, firm and amazing without any dryness.  This rinses away very easily and cleanly, but I can&#x27;t stop touching my face after I use this.  It&#x27;s like I gave myself a great facial mask that tightened and smoothed.  I&#x27;m hooked on this and so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling very fresh and refreshed without over drying.  Slight tingling affect as it becomes exposed to air after washing.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Foams nicely, cleans okay. I need something a little stronger to remove my make-up.</li>
            <li> The detoxifying angle of this seems to be tied up to some extent in green tea extract, but I&#x27;m not sure what makes this special as a facial cleanser beyond that point. However, it does seem to do what soap does and it can be applied more simply and is more enjoyable to use. The product comes out as a rather loose foam that is easy to rub on your face. It&#x27;s just at the point of holding together enough to not slip out of your hands. This is surprising as I expected a tighter foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have said their faces feel \\&quot;tight\\&quot; after using it. This was not my experience. Though I felt tingling (from menthol in the cleanser), my skin felt good after using this. It was soft and clean without being too squeaky and didn&#x27;t feel stripped. That being said, I didn&#x27;t feel that I was getting the same level of deep cleaning that I get from the other Biore products I&#x27;ve used. However, it could be that I&#x27;m used to using the scrubs (especially for the pores on my nose) and I&#x27;m unfairly comparing something with scrubbing beads in it to a foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this works fine, but I&#x27;m not sure if it is worth the added cost relative to a good bar of soap. The foam is convenient to apply and it gives skin a nice tingle and left my face feeling good, but no different than using other cleansers. If you&#x27;re not happy with how soap handles your face, this is probably going to be a little better, but this also will cost more and creates more material waste with the plastic dispenser.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice foamy cleanser that left my face refreshingly clean and tingling. The scent is clean and neutral  I did notice a slight tightening but my face did not seem dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This definitely deep cleans and would recommend especially for young women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4-18-13....After numerous uses this did dry my skin, recommend for oily complexions.</li>
            <li> Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser is my favorite among all of my skin care producs for daily use. I feel like the foaming cleanswer is really helping. My face feels cleaner and refreshed after use without the drying that I have with many other face products. I still get breakouts about monthly (probably related to hormones) so I have to supplement its use with salicylic acid containing cleansers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser foams which makes it lather well for quick and easy distribution, scrubbing, and then rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very neutral scent, which is neither attractive nor repulsive. This is a big plus for me as most of the scents in skin care products drive me nuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend without reservation Biore 4 in 1 detoxifying cleanser as a daily use scrub.</li>
            <li> I like this product and so does my 12 year old daughter. It gently cleans and leaves my face feeling refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I like the foaming action because it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> This product has been by far the best wash I have evey used and I have tried many. I beileve it is the toning within it, this is my 6 month using this product and my oily/acne prone skin is no more. combine it with alpha hydrox oil-free treatment 10% glucolic acid and if you suffer from back acne head and shoulder classic clean has done wonders compared to everything else that does not even work well for me anyways, it contains zinc.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite biore product.  It is the best cleanser I have found, and leaves skin feeling great!  Thanks</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser each night before I go to bed. I don&#x27;t use it to take off my makeup, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it would do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this because it&#x27;s very gentle and it has a nice, pleasant smell. I also got it at a good price, with an online coupon. I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy this versus a different cleanser, because I haven&#x27;t found something extra-special about this product, but it&#x27;s a good solid cleanser all around.</li>
            <li> I know the foam doesn&#x27;t REALLY help in the cleansing process but I still love it. Just to be sure, I used a blemish pad after washing my face; it came off white and clean :)</li>
            <li> This cleanser seemed extremely gentle. It would clean your face, if it did not have make-up on it. As for stimulates - as it says on the bottle, it is way too gentle for me to be considered stimulating.&lt;br /&gt;You wet your face and pump the nozzle and massage the foaming bubbles on to your face. That&#x27;s it, it is oil free, but I really do not see the deep cleansing that it claims and do not quite understand what the 4 in 1 is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a Neutrogena fan than a Biore fan, but the performance of this face wash has got me thinking of switching brands - it&#x27;s a very nice product all-round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s packaged as a foam-type dispenser that meters out enough for use without any waste. Given the price of face cleaners, being able to stretch the amount used is never a bad thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But regardless of how it is packaged, the reason for using it is performance. For me, it works very well. My face feels clean and a little \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; after use (with the latter due, I image, to the menthol in the soap). It does dry my skin a bit, but not to the point where it is at all bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is hard to describe. It&#x27;s not at all bad, but just hard to put my finger on. Not soapy, not perfumy, but it certainly is not unscented either. I guess the best word is \\&quot;interesting.\\&quot; Regardless, the scent does not linger after rinsing (another plus for me) so even if you don&#x27;t care all that much for it, you won&#x27;t be smelling it all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used Biore products in quite a while, but this is working so well that my next purchase will be Biore rather than Neutrogena. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The cleanser removed make up and any impurities without problems. One pump is enough for the whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is that some of the ingredients are harsh and not suitable for sensitive skin (for instance sodium laureth sulfate). I have a normal complexion and realized that after about a minute skin was getting tighter (pores where shrinking ok, but the feeling was annoying) and I had to apply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;At the same time skin wasn&#x27;t very dry, and I had a feeling that cleanser didn&#x27;t stripped the moisture. But tightening effect was so strong in comparison to other cleanser I&#x27;ve used in the past that I think it actually did stripped all the moisture and there was some kind of film left afterwards (from one of the ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for dry/normal skin.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I tried this.  I found it to be a bit too strong for over 45+ skin - stripped just a bit too much.  But for my daughter&#x27;s younger skin, it worked very well.  She loved the product and would buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a light foam that goes on easily and cleans off easily.  I don&#x27;t have an opinion of the scent either way, though I still prefer scentless products as with the Simple line.  But it definitely works well.</li>
            <li> I like how clean this makes my face feel.  It has no particular smell and seems mild and gentle.  I like the foamy consistency of it too.</li>
            <li> works and feels great</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and hope it never goes away. It cleans the face very well&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for selling this product</li>
            <li> this made my skin feel tight and itchy I have combination skin and this product was far to harsh for it. perhaps a teenager with high oil could use this but I do not recommend it for anyone else</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this. It&#x27;s not my favorite cleanser and actually I stopped using it less than half-way through the bottle. It had a weird effect on my skin, making me break out. I&#x27;m not generally sensitive to skin-care products so I was a bit put off by this. Anyway, would I recommend it? Meh. Just because it didn&#x27;t work out for me, it might still work for you, so give it a try since Biore has a good reputation for making well-received and effective products. I use several of their others, just not this one.</li>
            <li> I have used Bioré nose strips off-and-on over the years so I was curious how good their cleanser would be. As it turns out, it will clean your face, but then leave it a bit dry, requiring the addition of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like this Biore Cleanser.  I blew off the &#x27;detoxifying&#x27; and &#x27;4 in 1&#x27; verbiage as marketing-speak and focused on how it made my face feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it&#x27;s foams gently. And I was absolutely surprised at how smooth it left my skin.  That said, it&#x27;s going to have to be my Summer cleanser as it&#x27;s a bit too drying for Winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend --but with caveats.  It left my face clean and very smooth to the touch, but was drying.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is a foaming cleaser, which I love. I just think there is something so cool about pumps that aerate things and make them all foamy. I tend to be a little heavy handed when I&#x27;m dishing out products, so foaming cleansers are great for me, because you are less likely to use too much. This cleanser is very light, which is generally the case with foaming products. It has a neutral smell and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. I couldn&#x27;t really tell a difference is skin healthiness between this and the many other over the counter cleansers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> i recently used a Biore product designed for combination skin and ended up very disappointed. So I was surprised that I liked the Biore 4 i4n 1 Detoxifying cleanser. I still get break outs but now I also have wrinkles (oh, the humanity!). Finding a product that manages both well is very difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Biore detoxifying cleanser felt nice on. It was not irritating at all. It rinsed of cleanly. I did not get that tight dry feeling that often follows washing. While I am not at all sure that my face needs to be detoxed (it doesn&#x27;t get out much) this did feel like a good product. I used it over several weeks and it did not irritate my dry old lady skin or my cause more annoying acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for combination skin.(and obviously any skin that has a drug problem and needs to detox)</li>
            <li> I used this twice before looking too deeply into the ingredients list. Both times, I felt it has a slight medicinal/chemical smell to it-- not disgusting, but not my favorite. It&#x27;s a decent amount of foam and it glides across the skin easily and rinses off cleanly. Unlike several others, I didn&#x27;t feel it was drying-- maybe because I&#x27;m used to a different foaming cleanser that strips away oils even more. Anyway, I was left feeling like it worked fine and was pleasant and priced fairly, and I&#x27;d use it as a \\&quot;back-up\\&quot; to my favored product. Until...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the ingredients. Like reviewer Amanda Devon, I care about the ingredients in my health and beauty products. Unlike her, I don&#x27;t necessarily understand what all those terms mean. I know I&#x27;ve heard that certain things are bad (PEGs, parabens, SLS, etc.) and I just try to avoid them, without looking too deeply into what each one is or does. But this time I decided to read just a little further because her review interested me. I read about each concerning ingredient on the nonprofit Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database. And what I read made me decide to throw this product away... just not worth the risks, in my opinion. There are too many known irritants here, and potential carcinogens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, using dangerous products on your skin or hair may be MORE dangerous than eating the products because your digestive tract has enzymes to break down chemicals and excrete them from your body fairly quickly, whereas when your skin absorbs them, they can get into your bloodstream and stay there for a long time. I didn&#x27;t consider this until recently, so I was more concerned with eating organic than worrying about things like shampoos and face washes, which I figured couldn&#x27;t do me much harm. Now that I know better, I&#x27;d rather make safer choices.</li>
            <li> I find that Biore products are targeted most to young people, who often have issues with oily skin and acne.  In that vein, Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser is a harsh cleanser that is hard on oil and contains typical soap ingredients like SLS.  I have pretty sensitive skin, but my only reaction was lightly burning eyes and dry skin.  The former felt very much like menthol, which was confirmed when I checked the ingredients.  The latter was not too bad, and my skin is normally dry, so using a harsh cleanser always has that result.  On the bright side, the scent is relaxing and the foamy suds wash off cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biore has created another decent product for oily skin, and if the price is right and you have issues with oil, I think it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> The 4 in 1 detoxifying  foam is my favorite facial cleanser.  It controls my oily T zone without drying out the rest of my skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed clearer, softer skin with less noticeable fine lines since I started using this product.  As long as Biore keeps making this, I&#x27;ll keep using it.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone, with any type of skin.</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet, but combined with the coupon that was offered, I got a super deal on it!</li>
            <li> Not clear what \\&quot;detoxifying\\&quot; this is supposed to do.  Skin does feel clean -- some minor irritations that cleared quickly but not overly happy with product.  The name Biore has a good  reputation however did not find it all that thrilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Simple products if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically expect my cleanser to do anything other than cleanse, so I was curious about the 4-in-1 concept.  I&#x27;m not really sure I can tell any difference from just a 1-in-1 cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you push down on the pump, the cleanser comes out in a little foamy puff, so it goes on your face foamy.  It does a good job and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitivities to scent so I try to use scent-free products as much as possible.  This has a nice, very light scent that I originally assumed was from the plant extracts in the ingredients.  There is fragrance in the ingredients list but the scent doesn&#x27;t seem perfume-y and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product but haven&#x27;t yet decided whether it will replace my usual cleanser, [[ASIN:B001ET76EY Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]].</li>
            <li> You only need one pump to cover the whole entire face that mean your product would last months and months. Money saving right there. The foaming cleanser leave your face feeling fresh and your pores happy.</li>
            <li> This product is great it works very very well for me. It leave skin feeling clean but not dry love it!!</li>
            <li> This foam smells and feels nice enough, but I can&#x27;t say that I find it all that effective. The foam itself is also very limp and tries to slide off my hand before it reaches my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the pump is pretty nice, but I don&#x27;t like the lid. I don&#x27;t leave it on because it&#x27;s fair impossible to get the lid off with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foamy face wash is nice to use, but I recommend sticking with the other Biore cleansers, such as the [[ASIN:B006RFZ8C2 Biore Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser, 6.77 Ounce]].</li>
            <li> I always use face wash, instead of soap, in the shower. I thought this was a mild foamy face wash that was easy to rinse off. My face feels clean and fresh and the wash was slightly invigorating. This is a quality face wash and I will continue to use it, although it&#x27;s not quite as fun as the steam activated Biore face cleanser, it is a close second. Plus, this one doesn&#x27;t have to be used in the shower, it can be used in the evening over the sink or whenever. Good product and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am torn because I do like this cleanser BUT, be careful when using it around your lips. It will make my lips chap and peel if it gets on them during washing even if I follow with lip balm. I am going to stick with my usual Biore moisture scrub as I have never had such an issue.</li>
            <li> This is indeed a refreshing face cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face felt really clean after using it. I particularly enjoyed the light herbal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product if you want to give your face a deep cleanse.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of foaming face cleaners (or any cleaning treatment).  This one is no different.  This one in particular feels like it&#x27;s drying out my skin every time I use it.  It really does not feel very good.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any lowered amount of pimples or other flaws.  No real effect on tone.  Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
