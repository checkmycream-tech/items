            <li>The shapes are great, I love it!!!</li>

            <li>Great variety.</li>
            <li>these are an awesome value &amp; very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I think if it did, it probably would be a good tool</li>
            <li>I just received these stencils today and haven&#x27;t used them because the powder I ordered hasn&#x27;t gotten here yet, BUT I opened the package, which comes in a cute case, and took out all of the stencils and lined them up with my eyebrows to see which would be the best fit.</li>
            <li>i dont need them, i can align my eyebrow on my own</li>
            <li>Great and quick service</li>
            <li>but I found it better to just try and do them on my own</li>
            <li>I honestly think I do my eyebrows better without these.</li>
            <li>I love just about everything this product has to offer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Extremely happy and I highly recommend trying these!</li>
            <li>Powder is better than pencil.</li>
            <li>So, I have enjoyed using them.....</li>
            <li>Maybe if it was made out of another material it would be better.</li>
            <li>The product is pretty good ..the shape of the stencils are divers however the material the stencil is made of is very light.</li>
            <li>It is compact and lends itself easily to travel.  </li>
            <li>It comes with four different stencils and they&#x27;re all great.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great template to use and has multiple ones to choose from.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, easy to apply make up, makes everything so simple, has a nice selection of arches, and has a cute carrying case.</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>I liked this product as it shapes and makes your eyebrows in shapes you normally have.  </li>
            <li>The price is right,  too!</li>
            <li>You can use a pencil with a little more practice good magnified lighted mirror.</li>
            <li>I was really worried that they would all be huge with a huge arch and make me look like a crazy clown, but I found my perfect match in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried #1 and #2 first, which are the larger sizes, and they looked absolutely ridiculous on my face and didn&#x27;t fit at all, although I could see them fitting girlfriends that I have with longer/bushier eyebrows great.</li>
            <li>Better off having gone back to drawing them on myself.</li>
            <li>likely, Only one will work best for you since everyone is different, but I can see how these could work for anyone.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when they first arrived; there actually was a shape that would work for my eyebrows, which is more than I can say for other stencil sets.</li>
            <li>i used the stencils to help me align my eyebrows the right way it help me so much to wear</li>
            <li>These stencils were easy to use and I love that I know both brows will end up looking the same as long as I follow the outline.</li>
            <li>On the other hand its not durable, comparing it the ELF Eyebrow Stencil, the latter is much more durable and a better buy.</li>
            <li>The seller was fast getting me my product</li>
            <li>Really helps me keep my brows in check.</li>
            <li>wish it had come with directions, but other than that, good generic guide</li>
            <li>Do not know the solution to the problem, but I kept the little eyebrow bush and the cute packet in all came in</li>
            <li>This product was hard to use on my own.  </li>
            <li>This little stencil kit is  easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can only use one of the stencils in this kit, because the rest are too large.  </li>
            <li>I have to help my 16 yr old daughter with them.  </li>
            <li>I was VERY nervous to order stencils online and ordered a couple of different kinds..</li>
            <li>The only thing is, when you&#x27;re trying to apply the eyebrow powder, it&#x27;s impossible to hold the stencil still enough to follow the shape perfectly.</li>
            <li>I guess there was really no used of getting it in the first place because I don&#x27;t ever use it.</li>
            <li>Expect to play a little with these to get them right and keep the color on the lighter side.</li>
            <li>If I could figure out how to use it on  my VERY thin (almost nonexistent) eyebrows to where they would look somewhat natural, I guess I&#x27;d like it more.</li>
            <li>I could never get them exactly the same and was hoping a stencil would be the answer; however, it is not easy to use.</li>

            <li> It becomes a frustrating task quickly, and I&#x27;ve given up on using these.</li>
            <li> All was as I expected it</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I reverted back to using pencil.</li>
            <li> I have smaller, sparse eyebrows and a small face.</li>
            <li> I have no eyebrow due to a thyroid problem, so I have to draw my eyebrows on.</li>

            <li> I ordered about 4-5 different eyebrow stencils, just in case ordering one would prove to be the wrong one.</li>
            <li> Oh well I will keep practicing with it, or keep sketching my usual lines.</li>
            <li> I tried to use these once and found them to be flimsy and hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t meet my expectations as it is hard to hold up against your eyebrow.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re thin and flexible to allow you to mold them to your brow area.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> The stencils weren&#x27;t that bad.</li>

            <li> Pencils ruin the stencils. Stencils ruin pencils. Powder and powder pencils don&#x27;t stay within stencil lines. Do not know the solution to the problem, but I kept the little eyebrow bush and the cute packet in all came in and I threw out the stencils. Better off having gone back to drawing them on myself. Bummed.</li>
            <li> This product was hard to use on my own.  It does not stay plush with her skin and when you airbrush the makeup on it has areas it gets out.  The seller was fast getting me my product and it was as described, but just not for me.</li>
            <li> I love just about everything this product has to offer. It is easy to use, easy to apply make up, makes everything so simple, has a nice selection of arches, and has a cute carrying case. So worth it!</li>
            <li> The shapes are great, I love it!!! On the other hand its not durable, comparing it the ELF Eyebrow Stencil, the latter is much more durable and a better buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered about 4-5 different eyebrow stencils, just in case ordering one would prove to be the wrong one. Out of all of them, the only one I use is this one. It&#x27;s great! The stencils aren&#x27;t too thick or thin or short or long. They&#x27;re perfect for my face. It comes with four different stencils and they&#x27;re all great.</li>
            <li> Great and quick service and I am a happy customer. All was as I expected it and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> These are a little tricky, but get the job done.  I have to help my 16 yr old daughter with them.  I stencil in with an eyebrow pencil before plucking</li>
            <li> Expect to play a little with these to get them right and keep the color on the lighter side. After a few uses, I reverted back to using pencil.</li>
            <li> I just received these stencils today and haven&#x27;t used them because the powder I ordered hasn&#x27;t gotten here yet, BUT I opened the package, which comes in a cute case, and took out all of the stencils and lined them up with my eyebrows to see which would be the best fit. I was VERY nervous to order stencils online and ordered a couple of different kinds.. but I wish I would of saved my money because these are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most likely, Only one will work best for you since everyone is different, but I can see how these could work for anyone. Great variety. I tried #1 and #2 first, which are the larger sizes, and they looked absolutely ridiculous on my face and didn&#x27;t fit at all, although I could see them fitting girlfriends that I have with longer/bushier eyebrows great. The #3 was perfect for me. I have smaller, sparse eyebrows and a small face. I was really worried that they would all be huge with a huge arch and make me look like a crazy clown, but I found my perfect match in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely happy and I highly recommend trying these!</li>
            <li> I can only use one of the stencils in this kit, because the rest are too large.  The problem is trying to hold the stencil up to your face and then adding in the power to make the eyebrow.  I have no eyebrow due to a thyroid problem, so I have to draw my eyebrows on. I could never get them exactly the same and was hoping a stencil would be the answer; however, it is not easy to use.</li>
            <li> These stencils were easy to use and I love that I know both brows will end up looking the same as long as I follow the outline.</li>
            <li> This was bought for me.  I used them for a few weeks but I found it better to just try and do them on my own</li>
            <li> This little stencil kit is  easy to use. It is compact and lends itself easily to travel.  The price is right,  too!</li>
            <li> This kit is alright I guess. If I could figure out how to use it on  my VERY thin (almost nonexistent) eyebrows to where they would look somewhat natural, I guess I&#x27;d like it more. Oh well I will keep practicing with it, or keep sketching my usual lines.</li>
            <li> wish it had come with directions, but other than that, good generic guide and you can watch a you tube video on eyebrow stencils that will teach you how to use them for the best results.</li>
            <li> Really helps me keep my brows in check. It&#x27;s a great template to use and has multiple ones to choose from.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a eyebrow stencil kit and this product met all my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty good ..the shape of the stencils are divers however the material the stencil is made of is very light. I feel if it would be made out of a stronger plastic it would be easier to re-use.</li>
            <li> I tried to use these once and found them to be flimsy and hard to manage.  I haven&#x27;t tried again, so these were a waste of money no matter how inexpensive they were.</li>

            <li> Good product. You must practice a little to learn to use it. Powder is better than pencil. You can use a pencil with a little more practice good magnified lighted mirror.</li>
            <li> For some reason the way the stencil was designed it did not match my eyebrow. I think if it did, it probably would be a good tool but maybe it will work for someone else.</li>
            <li> I liked this product as it shapes and makes your eyebrows in shapes you normally have.  So, I have enjoyed using them.....</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to use.  But it could just be me.</li>
            <li> these are an awesome value &amp; very easy to use. they&#x27;re thin and flexible to allow you to mold them to your brow area. then just fill them in. i find powder works best/fastest. then set with brow wax or setting gel.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t meet my expectations as it is hard to hold up against your eyebrow. Maybe if it was made out of another material it would be better.</li>
