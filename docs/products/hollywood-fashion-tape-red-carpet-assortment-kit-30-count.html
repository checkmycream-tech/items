            <li>The variety of sizes and uses are great to see which ones</li>
            <li>Great Producet</li>
            <li>The tape worked like a charm, even in very warm and humid tropical temperatures.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair and sensitive-skinned so</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>While the covers stay in place on their own with tighter tops, I didn&#x27;t want them falling off with these.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this to hold up a strapless bridesmaid dress.  </li>
            <li>I was worry free while dancing during the reception!  </li>
            <li>&quot; This product is one of my all-time favorite finds.</li>
            <li>I make sure I never run out.</li>
            <li>After I found the Hollywood Fashion Tape I was able to wear everything in my closet.</li>
            <li>I will use the most.</li>
            <li>I have never felt so secure in low-cut blouses or shirts that gap between the buttons!</li>
            <li>I love these fashion tapes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Various sizes are appealing as I could see many uses for this product.</li>
            <li>because I really love the idea&lt;</li>
            <li>Wasnt so sure that tape could hold and keep my shirt from buckling by the bust, but it did its job and then some.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried them..</li>
            <li>Otherwise Amazon works fine as delivery is speedy in sending out orders .</li>
            <li>A very useful product.</li>
            <li>safety pins, bandages, shoe pads, Tampax - all the things needed for a special occasion but often overlooked).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a few comments stating the adhesive isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried these with 3 different tops and found it to be a good product with lighter weight fabrics with some give or stretch to the fabric.</li>
            <li>anyways, it held with absolutely zero movement, my bra never showed and I felt confident.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been on actual Hollywood red carpets with blazing hot lights and the tape my stylist used to ensure that I didn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;fashion malfunction&amp;#34;, exposing more than I needed to, worked perfectly on my gown and sweating - pardon moi - MISTING - skin.  </li>
            <li>I like to wear strapless blouses in the summer and this tape will not fail to hold up and on any thing that its securely bonded to like skin and fabric.</li>
            <li>fashion tape being a fast, easy fix when you don&#x27;t have time to run to the tailor.</li>
            <li>They hold garments right where you stick them.</li>
            <li>She lossed twenty pounds after the final fitting of her dress..</li>
            <li>So technically I received more tape than I ordered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never insecure that my bra might be exposed anymore.</li>
            <li>I also purchased another brand at the same time as these, as I didn&#x27;t know which would be better....</li>
            <li>I love this product and wish I knew where to get it locally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the most success with using it as fabric to fabric (dress to bra) to lessen cleavage and had less luck when I tried to use it to attach fabric to skin.</li>
            <li>This tape truly works - it really holds all night and then some.</li>
            <li>OMG did it ever leave massive, red welts on my skin; including some light bruising!</li>
            <li>I had a closet full of blouses I wasn&#x27;t able to wear to work because the necklines were a little too low.</li>
            <li>you might as well get a brand new.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin had a bit of a reaction to the tape and it didn&#x27;t hold up to dancing for hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this tape for a long time but this is my first time buying it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I need to use it frequently.</li>
            <li>You can only use it once so you will have to use a new one if you make a mistake of sticking it on your clothes.</li>
            <li>Nice product, but doesn&#x27;t stick well to some fabrics, and perhaps not strong enough on other fabrics.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too broad through the shoulders...</li>
            <li>I have used them on bare skin.</li>

            <li> It was somewhat hard to put it on clothes and then stick it to skin and required some practice.</li>
            <li> No more bra straps peeking out or shoulder straps falling out of place!</li>

            <li> I have used this a couple of times already and can think of countless other uses.  I&#x27;m happy I purchased this valuable product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this to hold up a strapless bridesmaid dress.  It worked great to hold my dress onto my bra. I was worry free while dancing during the reception!  I did not try it against my skin, so I cannot comment on that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried these with 3 different tops and found it to be a good product with lighter weight fabrics with some give or stretch to the fabric. I&#x27;ve had the most success with using it as fabric to fabric (dress to bra) to lessen cleavage and had less luck when I tried to use it to attach fabric to skin. My sensitive skin had a bit of a reaction to the tape and it didn&#x27;t hold up to dancing for hours. Once I learned its limitations though, I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 years. It is AWESOME! I&#x27;ve used it for all sorts of things... repairing a loose hem, closing gaps between blouse buttons, keeping low cut blouses/dresses from going too low, keeping my bra straps from slipping/showing, ect. I&#x27;ve read a few comments stating the adhesive isn&#x27;t very good. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with that, unless I tried to move the tape. It&#x27;s like a bandaid. Once it&#x27;s stuck if you pull it up &amp; try to re-stick it you might as well get a brand new. I have used them on bare skin. They do leave a slight red mark after they&#x27;re removed, but my skin isn&#x27;t otherwise irritated or \\&quot;wrinkled.\\&quot; This product is one of my all-time favorite finds. I make sure I never run out. I had a closet full of blouses I wasn&#x27;t able to wear to work because the necklines were a little too low. I have a short torso, so unless it&#x27;s a turtleneck it&#x27;s low-cut on me. After I found the Hollywood Fashion Tape I was able to wear everything in my closet. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect way to try out this product. The variety of sizes and uses are great to see which ones I will use the most. The one I used today was PERFECT for keeping my dress together so I wasn&#x27;t flashing the world. This will now be a must have in my closet!</li>
            <li> Product work to keep my daughter&#x27;s wedding dress attached to her. She lossed twenty pounds after the final fitting of her dress.. It worked too!Would recommend to anyone out there who needs body tape.</li>
            <li> I received Hollywood Fashion Tape, although it was not 100% as described. I ordered a 30-pack, but received a 24-pack plus an additional pack of 12. So technically I received more tape than I ordered. I have used HFT in the past (this was a reorder); it works very well! You can depend on it to not allow a wardrobe malfunction.</li>
            <li> So I was looking for a non-expensive way to wear my gown for my mother&#x27;s company party and thought of these \\&quot;fashion tapes\\&quot; to help pin up the dress! My bust isn&#x27;t very big, so I couldn&#x27;t fill in my dress all the way and went to these, BUT it didn&#x27;t help me at all! It just left a big red mark on my chest and my gown slipping down me all night.</li>
            <li> I have never felt so secure in low-cut blouses or shirts that gap between the buttons! I&#x27;m never insecure that my bra might be exposed anymore. I love these fashion tapes. They hold garments right where you stick them. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, or come loose after a few hours like another, lower-priced fashion tape I bought. The assortment of sizes/shapes is perfect. I&#x27;ve let my coworkers try them out when they had clothing mishaps and thought they would need a safety pin to keep their clothes from slipping. No safety-pin holes! I recommend this fashion tape.</li>
            <li> This is basically double sided-tape cut into various pieces. It was somewhat hard to put it on clothes and then stick it to skin and required some practice. You can only use it once so you will have to use a new one if you make a mistake of sticking it on your clothes. I would just recommend buying double-sided tape instead of this.</li>
            <li> I needed these to only hold up sheer tiny sleeves. They fell after 2 minutes. May as well use scotch tape.</li>
            <li> For a women with big boobs it&#x27;s perfect to prevent a ups all the time! You just fix to you shirt or dress and it stays all night long! Just perfect! Another must have for women bag! Love it!</li>
            <li> No more bra straps peeking out or shoulder straps falling out of place! Better than uncomfortable pins! A very useful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this tape for a long time but this is my first time buying it through Amazon. It sticks well to both skin and fabric and I use it often. I ordered this one specifically because the package looked like the one I always bought before, but it looked totally different when it arrived. I don&#x27;t care because it appears to be the exact same product, but I wanted to give potential buyers a heads up in case they too think at first that they got the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Definitely a five star product and I will be using these all summer.  I used them to hold on silicone nip covers during a recent cruise vacation. I had several very loose and sleeveless tops.  While the covers stay in place on their own with tighter tops, I didn&#x27;t want them falling off with these.  The tape worked like a charm, even in very warm and humid tropical temperatures.  I also purchased another brand at the same time as these, as I didn&#x27;t know which would be better.... this far surpassed the other.</li>
            <li> I like Hollywood tape for my dress &amp; bra straps that require some help to stay in place. I like to wear strapless blouses in the summer and this tape will not fail to hold up and on any thing that its securely bonded to like skin and fabric. Even the hottest Atlanta nights didnt make the tape melt off my body. I love this product and wish I knew where to get it locally. I need to use it frequently. Otherwise Amazon works fine as delivery is speedy in sending out orders . I&#x27;d definitely use this seller again as well as this product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this on a lightweight spring dress and bra and it did the trick. Didn&#x27;t have any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Various sizes are appealing as I could see many uses for this product.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but doesn&#x27;t stick well to some fabrics, and perhaps not strong enough on other fabrics.</li>
            <li> This tape truly works - it really holds all night and then some. I used this on a dress whose arm holes were too big which showed my bra. I just need to get this dress tailored - it&#x27;s too broad through the shoulders...anyways, it held with absolutely zero movement, my bra never showed and I felt confident. Danced in it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue though - and it&#x27;s a biggie - when I peeled it off at the end of the night OMG did it ever leave massive, red welts on my skin; including some light bruising! I&#x27;m fair and sensitive-skinned so maybe it&#x27;s just me but it HURT although the pain went away by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be curious to know if anyone else had the same experience and maybe knows how to prevent it...because I really love the idea&lt;br /&gt;behind fashion tape being a fast, easy fix when you don&#x27;t have time to run to the tailor.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to go in the &amp;#34;Wedding Day Emergency Kit&amp;#34; that I put together for my daughter and her bridesmaids (you know....safety pins, bandages, shoe pads, Tampax - all the things needed for a special occasion but often overlooked).  Since all of bridesmaids wore different style dresses in the same material and color, I thought this item might be of use.  The problem was that the allegedly &amp;#34;red carpet&amp;#34; tape refused to stay stuck to either the dress material or the young ladies&#x27; skin.  I understand that the heat in Phoenix might be a factor but I&#x27;ve been on actual Hollywood red carpets with blazing hot lights and the tape my stylist used to ensure that I didn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;fashion malfunction&amp;#34;, exposing more than I needed to, worked perfectly on my gown and sweating - pardon moi - MISTING - skin.  This might work at a regular low-profile event in North Dakota in the winter but failed completely in sunny Arizona on a &amp;#34;cool for PHX&amp;#34; 92 degree day!</li>
            <li> Wasnt so sure that tape could hold and keep my shirt from buckling by the bust, but it did its job and then some. So taught that I had to pull it apart when unbuttoning my shirt. Glad I tried them..Now I cant do with out them..Great Producet</li>
