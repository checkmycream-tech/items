            <li> I heard about this product from a friend. Great idea!</li>
            <li> this helps with ingrown hairs and works wonders on the skin to condition. love it works great for men also who break out after shaving.</li>
            <li> Mild scent, easily applied. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but it seems to soothe away skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem for as long as I can remember with ingrown nose hairs. They always pop up after trimming the area around the inside of my nostrils, which is necessary to do from time to time. It literally feels like someone is sticking a sharp needle into my nose. This is my second jar of Alpha Mane, and it soothes the pain and helps the ingrown hairs heal faster. I will buy this product again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This cream works really well.  I bought this for my daughter who gets ingrown hair and bumps after shaving her upper legs and her skin looks so much better.  This is my second time buying this cream.</li>

            <li> Read a lot of reviews and I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>

            <li> Great product for the skin.  Very fast shipment.</li>
            <li> This works very well, my husband uses this for ingrown hairs.  The smell is a little more than he likes as a guy, but it fades after application.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on it&#x27;s alleged ability to rid one of shaving bumps. It didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have bought Alpha Mane Razor Bump &amp; Ingrown Hair Cream before, I liked it. So i am buying it again. Would like to say that I used to get bad razor bumps after shaving as well as ingrown hairs to. Shaving was also not very good on my acne ether. After shaving I get unbearable skin irritation for that day. Tried not to shave no more than I had to. I tried different types of skin moisturizing lotion for razor bumps, ingrown hair, skin irritation and acne. I like this stuff the best, Alpha Mane. No more irritation after shaving, no more bad razor bumps and ingrown hairs down to almost nothing. My skin looks more normal looking today than my old red neck and face ever did.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Alpha Mane Razor Bump &amp; Ingrown Hair Cream. I used the 30% off code! The ingredients sound like they are very good for the skin!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works..</li>
            <li> Seems good so far, but it smells like Scrubbing Bubbles.</li>
