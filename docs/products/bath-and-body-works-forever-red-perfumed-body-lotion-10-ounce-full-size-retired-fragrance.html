            <li>It just really smells good.  </li>
            <li>Smells very nice and is soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>Beautiful pump container with a deep red plastic bow around the neck, ideal for any situation where a quick pump of lotion is required.</li>
            <li>I love it was really worth the money</li>
            <li>The aroma of the lotion is on the sweet side and the lotion itself penetrates the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>YOUR SHIPPING WAS EXTREMELY QUICK</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift for my cousin and she loved it, arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li>I bought some of this at Christmas time and loved it so much that I&#x27;ve re-ordered it a 3rd time.</li>
            <li>Love how smooth it smells, and how long it lasts on my wife.</li>

            <li>I love this product such that I cant even express myself.</li>
            <li>And seeing how it wasn&#x27;t in a box just a baggie I don&#x27;t believe it was a real Bath and Body product.</li>
            <li>THANKS TO THE SELLER OF THIS ITEM</li>

            <li>Wow ....this a new scent ...</li>
            <li>it leaves your skin feeling so soft and silky......</li>
            <li>The product in itself is wonderful, just had a problem with the bottle when shipped, it wasn&#x27;t properly protected, so when I received it the red plastic bow on the bottle was broken and it seemed like the lotion had already been used because there was dried lotion around the neck of the bottle</li>
            <li>At least it smells good :-/</li>
            <li>I like to wear this rather than a perfume because it more subtle and not over powering!</li>
            <li>However when it was received the nice little plastic bow was broken off.</li>

            <li> Luv this smell so good worth the money</li>
            <li> great buy. costs so much more in stores. this is one of my favorite scents. very sexy smell but not overbearing</li>
            <li> IM ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND LIKE THE PERFECT SCENT.. Well this is it. The scent is sort of warm lol like I put this stuff on and I lay in bed, under warm fuzzy blankets, and watch movies with my dog...... LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Came packaged poorly, broken... Had to use another container.  Purchased the set as a gift so it wasn&#x27;t as presentable as desired.</li>
            <li> Lotion came with bow broken. Poor packaging. It was meant as a gift and now I cannot present it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it because she gets a lot of compliments.  It just really smells good.  Try it and you will fall in love with it as well.</li>
            <li> This bottle of lotion came and the cap was broke. Which was no big deal if it had been for me. When I finally tried some of the lotion, since I was stuck with this bottle it was sticky and nasty. There also was a lot of glitter to it which it wasn&#x27;t suppose to have had. My sister said it smelled nothing like the other bottles of lotions. And seeing how it wasn&#x27;t in a box just a baggie I don&#x27;t believe it was a real Bath and Body product. I will not buy nothing from this seller again. Not a cool thing to do. I might add I have done all my shopping on Amazon for Christmas the last 3 years and this is the first time I have left a bad review for a seller. It was just disappointing to be done that way.</li>
            <li> i love the smell and package, i don&#x27;t go one day without someone telling me i smell good when i use this....the package is too big to carry in your purse so im getting a smaller one</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my cousin and she loved it, arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> THANKS TO THE SELLER OF THIS ITEM YOUR SHIPPING WAS EXTREMELY QUICK AND I LOVE THE SIZE OF THIS ITEM AS WELL!! NOW I JUST NEED THE MATCHING SPRAY AND IM IN BUSINESS! !!!! ;)</li>
            <li> Smells very nice and is soft on your skin. The item arrived on time and this lotion is a dreamer. I love the feel and the smell.</li>
            <li> The product in itself is wonderful, just had a problem with the bottle when shipped, it wasn&#x27;t properly protected, so when I received it the red plastic bow on the bottle was broken and it seemed like the lotion had already been used because there was dried lotion around the neck of the bottle</li>
            <li> I love it was really worth the money</li>
            <li> This has got to be my favorite fragrance from Bath &amp; Body works! It helps that my husband loves it when I wear this lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this at Christmas time and loved it so much that I&#x27;ve re-ordered it a 3rd time. I love wearing this, the smell is romantic, yet flirty. I like to wear this rather than a perfume because it more subtle and not over powering!</li>
            <li> great product. I love this product such that I cant even express myself. you are doing a good job selling good product. It is good for me and I believe anyone should consider buying this product if they really want something very good.&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking about buying a second one. yours is exceptional!</li>
            <li> Beautiful pump container with a deep red plastic bow around the neck, ideal for any situation where a quick pump of lotion is required. The aroma of the lotion is on the sweet side and the lotion itself penetrates the skin very quickly. This is an excellent product with very satisfying results. It was originally received as a gift, my spouse was so happy with the product that an additional order was placed.</li>
            <li> The price is good shipping on time but one of then&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d proken</li>
            <li> This item was mailed as a birthday gift. However when it was received the nice little plastic bow was broken off. I didn&#x27;t even have time to call and complain because it was given on the recipient&#x27;s birthday. At least it smells good :-/</li>
