            <li>love this combination!  </li>
            <li>great for processing hair dye, but they rip easily</li>
            <li>The elastic is quite nice and stretchy too.</li>
            <li>I wonder what kind of head they were manufactured for.</li>
            <li>but they are a good quality plastic and do not rip easily.</li>
            <li>The plastic tears very easily.</li>
            <li>These caps are durable and quite honestly I bought way too many.</li>
            <li>lol you could probably get the same results from a plastic bag ijs lol</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they&#x27;re very large and the elastic held up even after going under a very warm bonnet.</li>
            <li>The shower caps are an excellent value for the money, however, they are quite big.....</li>
            <li>I expect it will break after about six weeks of use, but then I&#x27;ve got 29 more caps to go.</li>
            <li>came in on time and they did a great job thanks</li>
            <li>I know the description said &amp;#34;Extra Large&amp;#34; Maybe jumbo size would have been more appropriate.  </li>
            <li>They hold heat in and the conditioner works so much better.</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>Love the price for the quantity.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pleased to say they do the job as intended.</li>
            <li>For the price, they&#x27;re just okay.</li>
            <li>I use a stretchy headband over them for a better seal.</li>
            <li>The caps arrived promptly and safely.</li>
            <li>Love these caps.</li>
            <li>Perfect caps for what I wanted to use them for, I use them for deep hair conditioning and treatments.</li>
            <li>Ok for the price.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find these.  </li>
            <li>But I use these for conditioning treatments and the quality seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>I could reuse them since their quality is good, but having ordered 30 of them in a batch, I don&#x27;t really bother at times.</li>
            <li>They are convenient, easy, and durable.  </li>
            <li>They are flexible and don&#x27;t rip easily.  </li>
            <li>They are good quality for a week&#x27;s worth of use and they are very large.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>work fine for me.</li>
            <li>These get the job done, but aren&#x27;t super fancy, which is ok by me.  </li>
            <li>Nice large cap.</li>
            <li>so they were huge on me.</li>
            <li>It will fit ya&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even fit the cap on my head</li>
            <li>Will fit any head size.  </li>
            <li>These are fabulous for use as food bowl covers.  </li>
            <li>The caps are light so your head doesn&#x27;t overheat, but they slip off your head while you&#x27;re sleeping.</li>
            <li>Comfortable elastic plastic..</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are also great for covering left over food containers in place of plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and disposable.</li>
            <li>Can fit 4-6 butterfly clips w ease.</li>
            <li>I like them and the way they fit.  </li>
            <li>These are as they are advertised: cheap, one-use plastic caps - which is not a bad thing as they are great for deep conditioning, henna, or hair dye.</li>
            <li>They have also been useful in the shower when I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair!  </li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
            <li>but the keep the cap clean</li>
            <li>IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR EVERYDAY USE</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they said I could return the item for a full refund.</li>
            <li>They costed $1 (5 packs or 10 packs) , they lasted good until last week.</li>
            <li>They are disposable but of good enough quality to use over a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>This was SO much better and so much easier.</li>
            <li>i treated them as disposable cap and it run out quickly.</li>
            <li>Stretches quickly but can get a couple uses from one cap.</li>
            <li>The only difference is you get many more caps for the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>came to Amazon looking for high quality (better) plastic caps.</li>
            <li>They rip very easily and don&#x27;t fit properly at all!!</li>
            <li>The plastic that covers your hair is large and can fit a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Small</li>
            <li>large size and fit</li>
            <li>I wanted shower caps exactly like the free ones they have in hotels-- simple, light, transparent, and fit closely.  </li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>and I have waist length hair and a very large head.  </li>
            <li>THAT YOU MUST CONSIDER IN OUR VERY FAST AND BUSSY WORLD.</li>
            <li>i got these right away after ordering, (less than two days), and  i have bough shower caps before, and these are good quality, a bit big though, the XL seemed bigger than the x&#x27;ls I&#x27;ve bought before, i don&#x27;t have a big head, i just like having extra room, but im over all happy with the caps and got a good deal</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased plastic processing caps and tried to give myself hot oil treatments, only to have the plastic which holds the cap solid on my head snap or break while I was under a very warm bonnet drier.</li>
            <li>so I thought these extra large caps would be great for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i needed for bleaching my hair and there are lots of them in the box to.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>They are soft and comfortable , well fitted and hold my hair well .  </li>
            <li>Also, there are so many in the package, it will last forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using these caps to give myself hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>The first time there was no problem.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon should really add this listing into the cooking section!</li>
            <li>These are very well made and sturdy enough for many uses.  </li>
            <li>away, price is low and above all,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>but it is easy to twist the excess in the back and tuck it into the elastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These caps are large and are well-made.</li>
            <li>These were so large</li>
            <li>These simple, plastic, inexpensive caps would fit my needs well except that they are too large.  </li>
            <li>perfect for my aged mom who loses shower caps, just toss each time and move on</li>
            <li>I really like these caps</li>
            <li>They really are!I</li>
            <li>These caps fit my head and can accommodate a much larger head as well.  </li>
            <li>it really does what it says.</li>
            <li>The plastic separated from the elastic band on the very cap I used.</li>
            <li>I will use these until I find a real shower cap.</li>
            <li>Not too much to say about a plastic cap</li>
            <li>Cover the whole head..</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, just like I imagined it would be.</li>
            <li>One use per cap, but much easier than saran wrap.  </li>
            <li>; right...just so much easier.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I am sure because my hair is thick and it still fit in plastic cap.</li>
            <li>This is the first shower cap that can completely cover all my hair and it stays on well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, curly hair and when tied up, these caps provide great coverage without leakage.  </li>
            <li>I would say that my head is a normal size; I have shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps you might feel comfortable buying it this way from a trusted salon but certainly not online.</li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t seem that large (unless my head is EXTRA large - and that is not beyond the realm of possibilities).</li>
            <li>I can live with it though for the price.</li>
            <li>They also are not extra large!  </li>
            <li>better than too small, I guess.</li>
            <li>My head is not small, maybe</li>
            <li>The caps are exactly the same thing that you would buy at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply or any store.</li>
            <li>They work fine but are single use only.  </li>
            <li>These says Extra Large</li>
            <li>It is not really extra large.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy, but extra large they are not.  </li>
            <li>Anything but extra large.</li>
            <li>My wife purchased these expecting them to be Extra Large</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suggest anyone purchase this product if they are truly expecting an Extra Large cap.</li>
            <li>Very flimsy -- can only use once.</li>
            <li>Would not waste my time purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>The elastic part that keeps it on is much tighter and smaller than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I look a little more normal with these on my head (not too much but a little bit)</li>
            <li>Very flimsy but large enough for my long hair.</li>
            <li>With coarse curly hair, hot oil, protein, and deep conditioning treatments are a must.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item to anyone who dyes, deep conditions, or treats their hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok but run a little loose re the elastic and</li>
            <li>So small that I doubt if they would have fit an infant&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Instead of Betty Dain caps as ordered I received very small caps of another brand that barely fit on my normal sized head.</li>
            <li>If I wanted normal sized caps I could have just purchased them at my local store.</li>
            <li>I wish the actual product was extra large as advertised.</li>
            <li>but they were the same size as her Large ones and the plastic was different.</li>
            <li>A long time ago I stayed at a motel where they had extra large shower caps and it fit right over my once a week hair do for my thin and fragile hair without scrunching it a bit.  </li>
            <li>Personally I don&#x27;t like the big clunky obnoxiously-patterned shower caps you normally see in stores.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth the few bucks they cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used about half of the 30 I purchased then this past summer, so these are lasting me a good long time.</li>
            <li>The caps are fine, however the way they are rolled as a group, the inside caps are small and the ones on the outer of the roll is very stretched out big.  </li>
            <li>Plastic is thin but strong.</li>
            <li>i bake bread a few times a week and u use these to cover a large bowl for the dough to rise.</li>
            <li>There was a little bit of an odor like the other reviews mentioned, but I didn&#x27;t find it too off-putting and it faded quickly.</li>
            <li>They are very roomy, even a little too roomy for my short hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They are disposable but of good enough quality to use over a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> This was SO much better and so much easier.</li>
            <li> i treated them as disposable cap and it run out quickly.</li>
            <li> Stretches quickly but can get a couple uses from one cap.</li>
            <li> The only difference is you get many more caps for the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> came to Amazon looking for high quality (better) plastic caps.</li>
            <li> They rip very easily and don&#x27;t fit properly at all!!</li>
            <li> The plastic that covers your hair is large and can fit a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Small</li>
            <li> large size and fit</li>
            <li> I wanted shower caps exactly like the free ones they have in hotels-- simple, light, transparent, and fit closely.  </li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> and I have waist length hair and a very large head.  </li>
            <li> THAT YOU MUST CONSIDER IN OUR VERY FAST AND BUSSY WORLD.</li>
            <li> i got these right away after ordering, (less than two days), and  i have bough shower caps before, and these are good quality, a bit big though, the XL seemed bigger than the x&#x27;ls I&#x27;ve bought before, i don&#x27;t have a big head, i just like having extra room, but im over all happy with the caps and got a good deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased plastic processing caps and tried to give myself hot oil treatments, only to have the plastic which holds the cap solid on my head snap or break while I was under a very warm bonnet drier.</li>
            <li> so I thought these extra large caps would be great for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed for bleaching my hair and there are lots of them in the box to.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> They are soft and comfortable , well fitted and hold my hair well .  </li>
            <li> Also, there are so many in the package, it will last forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these caps to give myself hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> The first time there was no problem.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon should really add this listing into the cooking section!</li>
            <li> These are very well made and sturdy enough for many uses.  </li>
            <li> away, price is low and above all,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> but it is easy to twist the excess in the back and tuck it into the elastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These caps are large and are well-made.</li>
            <li> These were so large</li>
            <li> These simple, plastic, inexpensive caps would fit my needs well except that they are too large.  </li>
            <li> perfect for my aged mom who loses shower caps, just toss each time and move on</li>
            <li> I really like these caps</li>
            <li> They really are!I</li>
            <li> These caps fit my head and can accommodate a much larger head as well.  </li>
            <li> it really does what it says.</li>
            <li> The plastic separated from the elastic band on the very cap I used.</li>
            <li> I will use these until I find a real shower cap.</li>
            <li> Not too much to say about a plastic cap</li>
            <li> Cover the whole head..</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, just like I imagined it would be.</li>
            <li> One use per cap, but much easier than saran wrap.  </li>
            <li> ; right...just so much easier.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am sure because my hair is thick and it still fit in plastic cap.</li>
            <li> This is the first shower cap that can completely cover all my hair and it stays on well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair and when tied up, these caps provide great coverage without leakage.  </li>
            <li> I would say that my head is a normal size; I have shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Perhaps you might feel comfortable buying it this way from a trusted salon but certainly not online.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t seem that large (unless my head is EXTRA large - and that is not beyond the realm of possibilities).</li>
            <li> I can live with it though for the price.</li>
            <li> They also are not extra large!  </li>
            <li> better than too small, I guess.</li>
            <li> My head is not small, maybe</li>
            <li> The caps are exactly the same thing that you would buy at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply or any store.</li>
            <li> They work fine but are single use only.  </li>
            <li> These says Extra Large</li>
            <li> It is not really extra large.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy, but extra large they are not.  </li>
            <li> Anything but extra large.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased these expecting them to be Extra Large</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest anyone purchase this product if they are truly expecting an Extra Large cap.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy -- can only use once.</li>
            <li> Would not waste my time purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> The elastic part that keeps it on is much tighter and smaller than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I look a little more normal with these on my head (not too much but a little bit)</li>
            <li> Very flimsy but large enough for my long hair.</li>
            <li> With coarse curly hair, hot oil, protein, and deep conditioning treatments are a must.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item to anyone who dyes, deep conditions, or treats their hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok but run a little loose re the elastic and</li>
            <li> So small that I doubt if they would have fit an infant&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Instead of Betty Dain caps as ordered I received very small caps of another brand that barely fit on my normal sized head.</li>
            <li> If I wanted normal sized caps I could have just purchased them at my local store.</li>
            <li> I wish the actual product was extra large as advertised.</li>
            <li> but they were the same size as her Large ones and the plastic was different.</li>
            <li> A long time ago I stayed at a motel where they had extra large shower caps and it fit right over my once a week hair do for my thin and fragile hair without scrunching it a bit.  </li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t like the big clunky obnoxiously-patterned shower caps you normally see in stores.  </li>
            <li> Not even worth the few bucks they cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about half of the 30 I purchased then this past summer, so these are lasting me a good long time.</li>
            <li> The caps are fine, however the way they are rolled as a group, the inside caps are small and the ones on the outer of the roll is very stretched out big.  </li>
            <li> Plastic is thin but strong.</li>
            <li> i bake bread a few times a week and u use these to cover a large bowl for the dough to rise.</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of an odor like the other reviews mentioned, but I didn&#x27;t find it too off-putting and it faded quickly.</li>
            <li> They are very roomy, even a little too roomy for my short hair</li>
            <li> I have difficulty finding caps large enough in the stores except for some hot, poufy, double layered, expensive &amp;#34;bouffant&amp;#34; styles.  </li>
            <li> what else can say they are bit thin but work well as long as heat doesn&#x27;t get to it - they are light weight</li>
            <li> and when it&#x27;s up, I have a hard time finding shower caps that cover my whole head and hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a male with (I think) an average sized head, and fairly short hair.</li>
            <li> I honestly expected them to bigger.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t imagine it working for long hair.</li>
            <li> and it tore and stretched before I could even get it over her hair.</li>
            <li> Definately worth it if you do your hair yourself and are tired of wearing plastic wrap that clings and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It works really well when you have a lot of hair that can be heavy and pull down the cap.  </li>
            <li> Finally a cap big enough to cover my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of them at General dollar.</li>
            <li> Typical hair shower caps are the opposite - usually they have loose elastic and the plastic doesn&#x27;t completely cover my hair.  </li>
            <li> They are a little smaller than what I expected so if you have a lot of hair</li>
            <li> Product was not as expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, fits well on me.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair that reaches the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> I appreciate Amazon&#x27;s policy of allowing us to order a small item without incurring shipping costs when the item is added to&lt;br /&gt;a larger order.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the first three that came out of the packet had holes in them already.</li>
            <li> The plastic is sturdy even though it is disposable, and the elastic is neither too tight or too loose.</li>
            <li> They are not too loose not to tight.  </li>
            <li> I have mid length hair and it is hard to keep all the hair in the cap</li>
            <li> Just average size.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair</li>
            <li> Wish it were a little tighter.</li>
            <li> I disliked because I wash my hair a lot.</li>
            <li> I use these after conditioning my hair after a shampoo or a heavy duty conditioner.</li>
            <li> I can reuse them a few times</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Not fit for purpose for me.</li>
            <li> I was a little confused by reviews, some say they are too small, some say they are too big.  </li>
            <li> did not find the caps to be too small at all.</li>
            <li> I use them with a dermatologist all night oil prescription and have such a difficult time even finding shower caps, and my need to find them outweighs anything to complain about.</li>
            <li> false advertisement from vendor SuperBiz  - they sent a replacement item other than Plastic Processing Caps by Betty Dain as described &amp; shown on their site.  </li>
            <li> It had a weird smell and the elastic was too loose.  </li>
            <li> but they are little thin....</li>
            <li> Have to use at least 2 caps over the hair.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy these because of the reviews claiming that they were very small.  </li>
            <li> It feels very small.</li>
            <li> however, it is a little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> These hats are very thin plastic, and doesn&#x27;t&#x27; compare to ones I bought a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> It was getting weak.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wanna some weak plastic cap.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The elastic on these is too weak to hold them in place.</li>
            <li> No more saran wrap will be used!!</li>
            <li> Bought this one but found it poor quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased some for a game we were playing at our church Fall Festival</li>
            <li> It was weird that they arrived in a zip lock baggie.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong w/ the product though.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the reviews for shower caps online and all the bad reviews I bought these instead.  </li>
            <li> Often, it calls to cover in plastic and they give you this annoying bag to put on your head and then roll.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works good with the hair treatments</li>
            <li> These says Extra Large but they were not overly large...and worked perfectly when I colored my hair! No more saran wrap will be used!!</li>
            <li> The  plastic caps don&#x27;t have enough elastic, making the caps not flexible enough to even use for processing what it is you are trying to process.  Can someone look into strengthening the elastic in the caps please!</li>
            <li> Very flimsy -- can only use once. The plastic tears very easily. I&#x27;m using them to cover bowls and wash them to use them again, but these rip before I can use them a second time. Didn&#x27;t used to be that flimsy.</li>
            <li> I really like these caps, they feel very durable and the elastic holds the cap to my head even when my hair is heavy with deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> false advertisement from vendor SuperBiz  - they sent a replacement item other than Plastic Processing Caps by Betty Dain as described &amp; shown on their site.  however, vendor did reimburse me for their error.</li>
            <li> The caps in the photo are not what was sent. Instead of Betty Dain caps as ordered I received very small caps of another brand that barely fit on my normal sized head. I contacted the seller and they said I could return the item for a full refund. The problem is that I paid $5 for this item, $4.99 of which was shipping. It makes no sense for me to return the item to receive a 1 cent refund. I would not order these again.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t seem that large (unless my head is EXTRA large - and that is not beyond the realm of possibilities). But I use these for conditioning treatments and the quality seems pretty good. It was weird that they arrived in a zip lock baggie. It seemed like they must have purchased these in bulk and decided to sell the surplus. Nothing wrong w/ the product though.</li>
            <li> I appreciate Amazon&#x27;s policy of allowing us to order a small item without incurring shipping costs when the item is added to&lt;br /&gt;a larger order.  The shower caps are an excellent value for the money, however, they are quite big.....better than too small, I guess.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of them at General dollar. They costed $1 (5 packs or 10 packs) , they lasted good until last week. It was getting weak. I disliked because I wash my hair a lot. I don&#x27;t wanna some weak plastic cap.&lt;br /&gt;I came to Amazon looking for high quality (better) plastic caps. They really are!I can&#x27;t even get it to break if I stretch! The elastic around my cap will not break too, THANK GOD ! LOL....for real , I love it. It will fit ya&#x27;ll I am sure because my hair is thick and it still fit in plastic cap. I can&#x27;t believe it is only $3. I am gotta come back</li>
            <li> This is perfect for dying hair. Exactly what i needed for bleaching my hair and there are lots of them in the box to. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I use these for when i deep condition my hair.  They are convenient, easy, and durable.  I highly recommend this item to anyone who dyes, deep conditions, or treats their hair.</li>
            <li> These nifty plastic cover things are good under my heat cap.  With coarse curly hair, hot oil, protein, and deep conditioning treatments are a must.  I wish I had a hair steamer instead but that is neither here nor there.  These are alot easier than wrapping my head in plastic wrap and I look a little more normal with these on my head (not too much but a little bit)</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy these because of the reviews claiming that they were very small.  I can only say &amp;#34;What the @#$$ are they talking about!!!! My head is not small, maybe 22&amp;#34; where the elastic sits.  These caps fit my head and can accommodate a much larger head as well.  They are disposable but of good enough quality to use over a couple of times.  EXACTLY what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I wanted shower caps exactly like the free ones they have in hotels-- simple, light, transparent, and fit closely.  Personally I don&#x27;t like the big clunky obnoxiously-patterned shower caps you normally see in stores.  So I ordered these, and they were just what I wanted.  The elastic is snug.  I expect it will break after about six weeks of use, but then I&#x27;ve got 29 more caps to go.</li>
            <li> it really does what it says. however, it is a little bit expensive. i treated them as disposable cap and it run out quickly.</li>
            <li> These are not the caps advertised. They are not Betty Dain. They are not  bouffant style and they are not 21 inches. I couldn&#x27;t even fit the cap on my head they were so small!&lt;br /&gt;I received Brittny processing caps one size fits all. I was looking for jumbo/bouffant size there is a difference I have a big head and a lot of hair. If I wanted normal sized caps I could have just purchased them at my local store.</li>
            <li> came in on time and they did a great job thanks</li>
            <li> These caps are large and are well-made. Plastic is thin but strong. The elastic is quite nice and stretchy too.</li>
            <li> I know the description said &amp;#34;Extra Large&amp;#34; Maybe jumbo size would have been more appropriate.  These hats are very thin plastic, and doesn&#x27;t&#x27; compare to ones I bought a few years ago.  They rip very easily and don&#x27;t fit properly at all!!</li>
            <li> It is not really extra large. It feels very small. Just average size. I wish the actual product was extra large as advertised.</li>
            <li> They are soft and comfortable , well fitted and hold my hair well .  I like it , it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shower cap. Bought this one but found it poor quality. The elastic string last 2-3 times of use.</li>
            <li> I purchased these caps because of the size. I honestly expected them to bigger. However, they meet the need foe now but they are little thin....</li>
            <li> A plastic cap is a plastic cap lol you could probably get the same results from a plastic bag ijs lol</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for when I color my hair at home. Often, it calls to cover in plastic and they give you this annoying bag to put on your head and then roll. This was SO much better and so much easier. So glad I found these on amazon!</li>
            <li> I purchased because I find them convenient for showering or wearing when treating your hair with a moisturizer.  Athe elastic on a traditional shower cap does not hold.  Also, there are so many in the package, it will last forever.</li>
            <li> I use these after conditioning my hair after a shampoo or a heavy duty conditioner. They hold heat in and the conditioner works so much better.</li>
            <li> Will fit any head size.  My head is smallish but the cap stayed in place throughout the night.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> IT IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR EVERYDAY USE THAT YOU MUST CONSIDER IN OUR VERY FAST AND BUSSY WORLD.</li>
            <li> great for processing hair dye, but they rip easily</li>
            <li> These are just what I have looked for for ages.  A long time ago I stayed at a motel where they had extra large shower caps and it fit right over my once a week hair do for my thin and fragile hair without scrunching it a bit.  That hotel no longer gives them out. Now I have found them in a quantity which may last me the resat of my life!</li>
            <li> The size of the cap is great but they are flimsy. The plastic separated from the elastic band on the very cap I used.</li>
            <li> It had a weird smell and the elastic was too loose.  It smelled plasticy and the elastic did not keep water out or in.</li>
            <li> These are fabulous for use as food bowl covers.  They are flexible and don&#x27;t rip easily.  Love them</li>
            <li> Love the price for the quantity. Nicely made caps!</li>
            <li> Worked well. Used them while dyeing my hair. I ended up getting my hair cut after I purchased these so they were huge on me. I have thick hair that reaches the middle of my back. Got the job done though.</li>
            <li> Its a plastic bag. They are a little smaller than what I expected so if you have a lot of hair this is not for you but they are a good quality plastic and do not rip easily. I can reuse them a few times so I am happy.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the reviews for shower caps online and all the bad reviews I bought these instead.  They work fine but are single use only.  I will use these until I find a real shower cap.</li>
            <li> I wanted a cap I could use so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday. I could not find one big enough to put my hair up on my head and have it cover all hair these are perfect.</li>
            <li> Here I received the 30 plastic caps which i use for my heat cap treatment.&lt;br /&gt;They work fine for me. They are big enough for my curly bushy hair.</li>
            <li> It works for its price!</li>
            <li> Not too much to say about a plastic cap but I&#x27;m pleased to say they do the job as intended. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Great! And Good deal also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these caps to give myself hot oil treatments. I love the fact that they&#x27;re very large and the elastic held up even after going under a very warm bonnet. I&#x27;ve purchased plastic processing caps and tried to give myself hot oil treatments, only to have the plastic which holds the cap solid on my head snap or break while I was under a very warm bonnet drier. This product held up. I&#x27;ve used about half of the 30 I purchased then this past summer, so these are lasting me a good long time.</li>
            <li> These are great!  I purchased some for a game we were playing at our church Fall Festival so we wouldn&#x27;t get shaving cream all over our hair and they worked perfectly!  They have also been useful in the shower when I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair!  I don&#x27;t have to keep up with a reusable shower cap - at this price, I can afford to just toss them after using them!  I am very pleased with the quality and price!</li>
            <li> These get the job done, but aren&#x27;t super fancy, which is ok by me.  I have long, thick, curly hair and when tied up, these caps provide great coverage without leakage.  I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of uses out of them, so it&#x27;s a great value.  There was a little bit of an odor like the other reviews mentioned, but I didn&#x27;t find it too off-putting and it faded quickly.</li>
            <li> Good buy!!.. I have been using them all the time no problem.</li>
            <li> The caps are light so your head doesn&#x27;t overheat, but they slip off your head while you&#x27;re sleeping. I can live with it though for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and bargain. I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy, but extra large they are not.  I have mid length hair and it is hard to keep all the hair in the cap, I can&#x27;t imagine it working for long hair.</li>
            <li> The elastic on these is too weak to hold them in place. For the price, they&#x27;re just okay. I use a stretchy headband over them for a better seal.</li>
            <li> These caps are excellent.. Value for money.. Good quality.. Cover the whole head.. Comfortable elastic plastic.. I like it and would buy again</li>
            <li> These are very well made and sturdy enough for many uses.  They are very roomy, even a little too roomy for my short hair but it is easy to twist the excess in the back and tuck it into the elastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also great for covering left over food containers in place of plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> perfect for my aged mom who loses shower caps, just toss each time and move on</li>
            <li> These caps are too big even for me and I have waist length hair and a very large head.  I have difficulty finding caps large enough in the stores except for some hot, poufy, double layered, expensive &amp;#34;bouffant&amp;#34; styles.  These simple, plastic, inexpensive caps would fit my needs well except that they are too large.  The caps arrived promptly and safely.</li>
            <li> Been looking for these for years</li>
            <li> They are cheap and disposable. They do the job.</li>
            <li> Stretches quickly but can get a couple uses from one cap. Nice large cap. Can fit 4-6 butterfly clips w ease.</li>
            <li> I threw them in the garbage!  So small that I doubt if they would have fit an infant&#x27;s head. Anything but extra large.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years,&lt;br /&gt;still doing it&#x27;s function, I only use it when&lt;br /&gt;I color my hair so after that, I dispose it&lt;br /&gt;right away, price is low and above all,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a good product. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I had to throw these away since they arrived with no outer bagging, just rolled up together inside two caps. Perhaps you might feel comfortable buying it this way from a trusted salon but certainly not online. Who knows how it has been handled and what surfaces it has touched. This item should be removed from the website since it is not sanitary.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased these.  The first time there was no problem.  The second time, in December 2014, the item that came was NOT the item advertised.  They did not come in packaging.  They came rubber-banded.  They also are not extra large!  Do not purchase this item,</li>
            <li> i got these right away after ordering, (less than two days), and  i have bough shower caps before, and these are good quality, a bit big though, the XL seemed bigger than the x&#x27;ls I&#x27;ve bought before, i don&#x27;t have a big head, i just like having extra room, but im over all happy with the caps and got a good deal</li>
            <li> Product was not as expected. My daughter has very long, thick hair so I thought these extra large caps would be great for deep conditioning. Unfortunately, the first three that came out of the packet had holes in them already. Once I found one that did not have holes I tried using it and it tore and stretched before I could even get it over her hair. Would not waste my time purchasing this product. Not even worth the few bucks they cost.</li>
            <li> Fits great on my head and stays in place even when I sleep with it on. The plastic is sturdy even though it is disposable, and the elastic is neither too tight or too loose.</li>
            <li> i bake bread a few times a week and u use these to cover a large bowl for the dough to rise. it&#x27;s awesome and i would buy again in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> These were so large I wonder what kind of head they were manufactured for. Not fit for purpose for me.</li>
            <li> As someone that dyes my hair and wears glasses, I use these to protect my glasses when the dye is in my hair.  Disposable is great, I used to try to re-use them but it was a pain.  Works as expected, fits well on me.  I am a male with (I think) an average sized head, and fairly short hair.</li>
            <li> Love these caps. Perfect for hair conditioning overnite.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, just like I imagined it would be. I could reuse them since their quality is good, but having ordered 30 of them in a batch, I don&#x27;t really bother at times.</li>
            <li> One use per cap, but much easier than saran wrap.  Definately worth it if you do your hair yourself and are tired of wearing plastic wrap that clings and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; right...just so much easier.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I got the item at a good time. It looks like in the picture. It does its job well. Thanks.</li>
            <li> These are as they are advertised: cheap, one-use plastic caps - which is not a bad thing as they are great for deep conditioning, henna, or hair dye. The caps are exactly the same thing that you would buy at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply or any store. The only difference is you get many more caps for the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find the caps to be too small at all. They are a-okay. I would say that my head is a normal size; I have shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little confused by reviews, some say they are too small, some say they are too big.  Once I used one, I realized why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large part: The plastic that covers your hair is large and can fit a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Small part: The elastic part that keeps it on is much tighter and smaller than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this combination!  It works really well when you have a lot of hair that can be heavy and pull down the cap.  Typical hair shower caps are the opposite - usually they have loose elastic and the plastic doesn&#x27;t completely cover my hair.  This is the first shower cap that can completely cover all my hair and it stays on well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok but run a little loose re the elastic and therefore  when I do a hair treatment, need  to put cotton roll around neck to catch drips. Wish it were a little tighter.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find these.  They are good quality for a week&#x27;s worth of use and they are very large.  I have very long and thick hair and when it&#x27;s up, I have a hard time finding shower caps that cover my whole head and hair.  These do the trick and what an awesome price!</li>
            <li> Perfect caps for what I wanted to use them for, I use them for deep hair conditioning and treatments. No problems with them.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased these expecting them to be Extra Large but they were the same size as her Large ones and the plastic was different. I don&#x27;t suggest anyone purchase this product if they are truly expecting an Extra Large cap.</li>
            <li> One has cap to use for years to come.  I like them and the way they fit.  They are not too loose not to tight.  Just right.</li>
            <li> The caps are fine, however the way they are rolled as a group, the inside caps are small and the ones on the outer of the roll is very stretched out big.  I use them with a dermatologist all night oil prescription and have such a difficult time even finding shower caps, and my need to find them outweighs anything to complain about.</li>
            <li> Finally a cap big enough to cover my long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Good quality.</li>
            <li> large size and fit well I like this product</li>
            <li> Have to use at least 2 caps over the hair.</li>
            <li> My wife used to save the shower caps from each hotel room we visited. I bought some in bulk here instead. We never use them in the shower; we use them to cover the salad bowel when we put it back in the fridge after dinner. Quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should really add this listing into the cooking section!</li>
            <li> These caps are durable and quite honestly I bought way too many. But we&#x27;re here now and I can deep condition whenever I like. Good deal.</li>
            <li> what else can say they are bit thin but work well as long as heat doesn&#x27;t get to it - they are light weight but the keep the cap clean</li>
            <li> this is great,  I can dye my hair and not worry about leaning on something.  and they were so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Ok for the price. Very flimsy but large enough for my long hair. Only a couple of uses per cap.</li>
