            <li>It was such a great price.</li>
            <li>My kids get board quickly with brushing their teeth, so I love that their sonicare brushes keep them brushing for the 2 full minutes with the auto-timer.  </li>
            <li>They say to replace them more frequently, but I mainly remember to replace them each time we go for their 6 month cleanings, which have been great check ups since they are using these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Make the price more reasonable, please!</li>
            <li>This is the price for having clean teeth.</li>

            <li>Can&#x27;t say much more other than these are the only and best brush heads for the Sonicare for kids brush.</li>
            <li>These are great, soft but not too soft-</li>
            <li>I always buy the adult brushheads from Costco which are very cheap over anywhere</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are a touch pricier than what I would expect, but the quality makes them worth the price.</li>
            <li>I can buy 2 of the most advanced manual toothbrush in the pharmacy and have money left over for tons of candy (kidding).  </li>

            <li>The soft part is fine</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>So first, this brushing system was recommended by my son&#x27;s dentist.  </li>
            <li>Too much hassle to return them</li>
            <li>He really likes it, and it&#x27;s no longer a fight to get him to brush.  </li>
            <li>My point is, how can 2 replacement heads cost so much?  </li>
            <li>What I got was two light blue brushes that are soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles kept falling out and it didn&#x27;t stay put on the main unit.  </li>
            <li>Great to find these Sonicare heads on-line as they&#x27;re difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>Price is right and these are specific for Phillips sonic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the adult version for over 15 years and couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>These are the extra heads I purchased and they were exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>We tried many different types of toothbrushes prior to shelling out the big bucks for this one.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush heads are designed so that there is one size for 4-7 year olds (which my 5 year old uses), and another size for 7-10 year olds (which my daughter</li>
            <li>Worked for my 9 yr old.</li>
            <li>They are both the same size being for 7-10  years old.</li>
            <li>I can buy a complete battery powered Oral B unit for almost the same price as 1 replacement head!  </li>
            <li>kids came down with strep throat shortly after I replaced them, and I really didn&#x27;t want to throw the new brushes away.  </li>
            <li>However the brush heads for his age are hard to find and the company I bought these from sent them in a sealed but very battered and worn box that was very undesirable looking.</li>
            <li>toothbrush heads have held up very well, and show little to no wear in the 3-4 months they were used (the recommendation is to replace the toothbrush heads every 3 months).</li>
            <li>No worries about brushing too hard or not long enough, as the toothbrush does all the work for just the right amount of time.  </li>

            <li> She hated it and said it was too hard.</li>

            <li> I did receive 2 different colored brushes. One red and one blue. They are both the same size being for 7-10  years old.</li>
            <li> No more nagging &amp; fighting to get my boys to brush their teeth.  They LOVE their Sonicare.  Best toothbrush on the market.  Does exactly what it claims.  I&#x27;ve had the adult version for over 15 years and couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> These are great, soft but not too soft- they stand up to a lot of biting from the kids.  Not too big for little mouths.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> So far we are all loving the Sonicare.  I feel like my kids teeth are getting cleaner and they like to brush.  These are the extra heads I purchased and they were exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> Great to find these Sonicare heads on-line as they&#x27;re difficult to find in stores.  Ordering was easy and they shipped quickly.  Good quality and as described.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> sent promptly. great product</li>
            <li> My kids (5 and 8) do a much better job brushing their teeth now that we went with the Sonicare toothbrushes. These replacement heads are a touch pricier than what I would expect, but the quality makes them worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are great replacement brush heads for Sonicare for Kids toothbrush.  My chief complaint is the cost.  I&#x27;ve seen how they&#x27;re made and they&#x27;re no more complicated than making dvds or contact lens: the entire process is automated by robots and materials are cheap.  Cost is entirely a function of marketing, packaging and administrative overhead.  This is the price for having clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much more other than these are the only and best brush heads for the Sonicare for kids brush.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for my boys- I love the Sonicare toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Everything arrived in perfect condition and on time, very happy. A++++&lt;br /&gt;My son&#x27;s teeth sparkle and he enjoys using these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sonicare for Kids from my children&#x27;s dentist, and love it! I have a 5 year old and 8 year old, and they share the base, and each have their own toothbrush head. The toothbrush heads are designed so that there is one size for 4-7 year olds (which my 5 year old uses), and another size for 7-10 year olds (which my daughter uses).&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush heads have held up very well, and show little to no wear in the 3-4 months they were used (the recommendation is to replace the toothbrush heads every 3 months).</li>
            <li> The product picture shows a blue and red toothbrush which also happens to be the medium strength bristles. What I got was two light blue brushes that are soft. The soft part is fine but I don&#x27;t need two toothbrushes of the same color. I needed two so that my two kids know which brush belongs to them. Too much hassle to return them but i don&#x27;t like that they switched it out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that got our grandson to brush his teeth for the full period of time he should.  He really likes it, and it&#x27;s no longer a fight to get him to brush.  No worries about brushing too hard or not long enough, as the toothbrush does all the work for just the right amount of time.  Excellent value!</li>
            <li> So first, this brushing system was recommended by my son&#x27;s dentist.  It&#x27;s a good product.  I have no complaints about the system, it helps him brush AND gives him the timer so he knows how long to brush for.  Excellent design, he uses it, I like it.  And other reviewers are correct, these are not easy items to find at the local store.  But come on...am I the only one that thinks almost $20 for two replacement heads is nuts?  I can buy a complete battery powered Oral B unit for almost the same price as 1 replacement head!  I can buy 2 of the most advanced manual toothbrush in the pharmacy and have money left over for tons of candy (kidding).  My point is, how can 2 replacement heads cost so much?  Make the price more reasonable, please!</li>
            <li> great price, durable but soft brush heads, work great for my daughter age 9, we have them on subscribe and save and have been very pleased with each shipment</li>
            <li> Good replacement heads albeit pricey</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding the brushes for the kids Sonicare  in stores. It was easy and convenient to order online, plus the price was good.</li>
            <li> Awful.  The bristles kept falling out and it didn&#x27;t stay put on the main unit.  The packaging says &amp;#34;Philips&amp;#34; but I suspect it&#x27;s a knockoff.  It took a crazy long time to get delivered, and when it did it looked like it was from South Korea.  It wasn&#x27;t inexpensive either, so I feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> We tried many different types of toothbrushes prior to shelling out the big bucks for this one.  Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Good quality product and works well. Arrived when promised.  I would recommend this product and I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have a sonicare and since my son doesn&#x27;t brush well enough I bought him one too. However the brush heads for his age are hard to find and the company I bought these from sent them in a sealed but very battered and worn box that was very undesirable looking.</li>
            <li> Price is right and these are specific for Phillips sonic are so nothing can go wrong. Just buy it as extras as kids will need it every 3 months</li>
            <li> They came. They worked. Their good. Nothing was broken. Nothing got lost. Nothing was smelly. I would order these again.</li>
            <li> Fits Perfectly.  I have the Sonicare for Kids HX6311 toothbrush and these heads fit perfectly.  My kids now each have their own colors.</li>
            <li> I read few reviews in Amazon that the adult Sonicare brush heads are the same size , and lot lot cheaper over this one. I always buy the adult brushheads from Costco which are very cheap over anywhere else.[[ASIN:B00EXPSFMS Philips Sonicare HX6066/70 DiamondClean Standard Brush Heads, 6-Pack]]. With that in mind, I asked my daughter to try one of them. She hated it and said it was too hard. So went back to these expensive brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is expensive,but think about even if one dental expense gets cut by this brush, it pays more than itself and also avoids a scary dentist visit.</li>
            <li> Many pleasant visits to the Dentist. My boys are boys and would rather play than brush. Sonicare has been ideal for us.</li>
            <li> I got two packs of these 2-packs. It was such a great price. I think I still paid less than going to the retailer for just one pack of them.</li>
            <li> Worked for my 9 yr old.</li>
            <li> My kids get board quickly with brushing their teeth, so I love that their sonicare brushes keep them brushing for the 2 full minutes with the auto-timer.  They say to replace them more frequently, but I mainly remember to replace them each time we go for their 6 month cleanings, which have been great check ups since they are using these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids came down with strep throat shortly after I replaced them, and I really didn&#x27;t want to throw the new brushes away.  I held the brush part in boiling water for 5 minutes to sanitize them and the brushes held up with no problem.</li>
