            <li>..glad to have it available.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice and the bottle with the little metal grape detail attached to it looks very nice and decorative</li>
            <li>I tried this product at my Mom&#x27;s house and I fell in love right then and there.</li>
            <li>I was originally introduced to this product while visiting the Biltmore Estate in Ashville, NC.</li>
            <li>It smells incredible, my male friends really like it, and the feel of it on your skin is to die for.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent and absorbs quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>Found it on Amazon and ordered it right away!</li>
            <li>It feels so good on my skin, especially my hands.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion it really works.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and the best hand and body cream are a must.</li>
            <li>so I can be quick about my work in the morning after my shower.</li>
            <li>And it does absorb rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion as it is an all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I love it too, because it keeps her skin soft and smooth and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and after you pick it up you will too!!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more!  </li>
            <li>Smells just the same and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found it and purchased a replacement for myself and for a few gifts.  </li>
            <li>It has the most delish smell and leaves your hands so soft.</li>
            <li>I ordered from bebeautiful and it is fresh.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Honestly it&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li>and my face is smooth and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I love being able to use it before bed without feeling sticky or greasy and just have a little scent to help me drift off to sleep.</li>
            <li>It is a light non greasy fast absorbing moisturizer that is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, soft sent, no oily after feel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing!  </li>
            <li>I received my first bottle as a gift a year ago and have been hooked every since and give it as gifts now myself.</li>
            <li>I love the way it helps my skin to both look and feel younger.  </li>
            <li>You can wear this and not smell like a wino ;)</li>
            <li>Got exactly what my research said I would.  </li>
            <li>First tried it as a gift from my massage therapist.</li>
            <li>The lotion looks &amp; smels exactly as I remembered it in the Biltmore gift shop.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this lotion in Las Vegas at high end hotel gift shop.  </li>
            <li>Came fast</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because I really like this product and bought it as a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to lotion .</li>
            <li>bebeautiful has the real deal.</li>
            <li>However; I just don&#x27;t smell much of a scent.</li>
            <li>Packaging was very well padded.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing minus the oily feeling that most lotions give.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, i was able to recognize every ingredient on the label as naturally derived, which makes a big difference to someone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m especially fond of the bottle which seems to lend itself to a quick, eazy spritz-motion</li>
            <li>Love this cream I have been using it for several years now since my sister in law have to me as a birthday present, thank you Sis.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>far as moisturizing properties, I haven&#x27;t seen the dramatic results others have mentioned in their reviews, but I do think this would be great for winter months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost time for a new one</li>
            <li>I really liked how this lotion smelled, it&#x27;s different from the everyday scents you that everyone has.</li>
            <li>One was wrapped in black netting that was secured around the neck with a nice grape motif wine charm - an unexpected &#x27;extra&#x27;!  </li>
            <li>I have it next to my kitchen sink and it looks pretty.</li>
            <li>I ordered four large bottles when I finally found it.  </li>
            <li>It smells delicious and a little nostalgic.  </li>
            <li>The description made it seem like it was all natural based on the selective ingredients the lister put in the description area.</li>
            <li>a person who is not into fragrance (unless its natural) and preservatives and found the description to be misleading.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that they need to have a larger size available, this size only lasts 5-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>This time by nearly $8 a bottle.  </li>
            <li>You only need to use a little bit and it goes on easy and dries to a powdery/silky soft finish.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented - grapes, of course, but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I especially recommend for people that live in dry/hot climates.  </li>
            <li>What I did notice is that after application my skin looks like I&#x27;ve applied oil and it hasn&#x27;t sunk in yet, even though my skin is not wet or oily to the touch.</li>
            <li>It is not to thick and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for something super thick and moisturizing, I don&#x27;t think this will do it.</li>

            <li> I love this lotion it really works.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and the best hand and body cream are a must.</li>
            <li> so I can be quick about my work in the morning after my shower.</li>
            <li> And it does absorb rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more for sure.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this lotion as it is an all time favorite.</li>

            <li> I will definitely buy more!  </li>
            <li> Smells just the same and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found it and purchased a replacement for myself and for a few gifts.  </li>
            <li> It has the most delish smell and leaves your hands so soft.</li>
            <li> I ordered from bebeautiful and it is fresh.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Honestly it&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li> and my face is smooth and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I love being able to use it before bed without feeling sticky or greasy and just have a little scent to help me drift off to sleep.</li>
            <li> It is a light non greasy fast absorbing moisturizer that is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, soft sent, no oily after feel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing!  </li>
            <li> I received my first bottle as a gift a year ago and have been hooked every since and give it as gifts now myself.</li>
            <li> I love the way it helps my skin to both look and feel younger.  </li>
            <li> You can wear this and not smell like a wino ;)</li>
            <li> Got exactly what my research said I would.  </li>
            <li> First tried it as a gift from my massage therapist.</li>
            <li> The lotion looks &amp; smels exactly as I remembered it in the Biltmore gift shop.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this lotion in Las Vegas at high end hotel gift shop.  </li>
            <li> Came fast</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I really like this product and bought it as a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to lotion .</li>
            <li> bebeautiful has the real deal.</li>
            <li> However; I just don&#x27;t smell much of a scent.</li>
            <li> Packaging was very well padded.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing minus the oily feeling that most lotions give.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, i was able to recognize every ingredient on the label as naturally derived, which makes a big difference to someone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m especially fond of the bottle which seems to lend itself to a quick, eazy spritz-motion</li>
            <li> Love this cream I have been using it for several years now since my sister in law have to me as a birthday present, thank you Sis.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> far as moisturizing properties, I haven&#x27;t seen the dramatic results others have mentioned in their reviews, but I do think this would be great for winter months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost time for a new one</li>
            <li> I really liked how this lotion smelled, it&#x27;s different from the everyday scents you that everyone has.</li>
            <li> One was wrapped in black netting that was secured around the neck with a nice grape motif wine charm - an unexpected &#x27;extra&#x27;!  </li>
            <li> I have it next to my kitchen sink and it looks pretty.</li>
            <li> I ordered four large bottles when I finally found it.  </li>
            <li> It smells delicious and a little nostalgic.  </li>
            <li> The description made it seem like it was all natural based on the selective ingredients the lister put in the description area.</li>
            <li> a person who is not into fragrance (unless its natural) and preservatives and found the description to be misleading.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that they need to have a larger size available, this size only lasts 5-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> This time by nearly $8 a bottle.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit and it goes on easy and dries to a powdery/silky soft finish.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightly scented - grapes, of course, but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I especially recommend for people that live in dry/hot climates.  </li>
            <li> What I did notice is that after application my skin looks like I&#x27;ve applied oil and it hasn&#x27;t sunk in yet, even though my skin is not wet or oily to the touch.</li>
            <li> It is not to thick and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for something super thick and moisturizing, I don&#x27;t think this will do it.</li>
            <li> This lotion took care of some rough skin that no other lotion came close to helping.</li>
            <li> is gonna last a very long time.</li>
            <li> My wife loves her Vineyard  Collection skin moisturizer and feels badly when we travel, because she only has it in a large bottle too large to carry in her bag.  </li>
            <li> It last a long time as well so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit because it goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Just heavy enough it does not feel like it diss appears when it hits the skin.  </li>
            <li> It arrived before other products.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is it does not contain sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I bought two green</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Something went wrong with the pricing (they were asking nearly $75 for 17 oz.), but it appears to have been corrected.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be worth the shipping cost to return the item, so I am removing the pump every time I use the lotion (which is very inconvenient &amp; messy).  </li>
            <li> I usually put it on after spending a day in the sun.</li>
            <li> A friend had given me a small bottle of this product while I was in Mexico 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been lazy about putting lotion on</li>
            <li> I usually because of allergies can&#x27;t take a scented lotion</li>
            <li> I would not buy again, unless you area die hard fan.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like lotion because of the greasy effect, but this isn&#x27;t like that!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again because it&#x27;s a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> sorry :/</li>
            <li> the plastic around the pump was broken.  </li>
            <li> To me it feels slightly greasy, but nothing so awful that I can&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> did not get the &amp;#34;Grape&amp;#34;, was not purple was green, very disappointed</li>
            <li> but now im disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love love love this lotion! It has the most delish smell and leaves your hands so soft. Very moisturizing minus the oily feeling that most lotions give. Great product!</li>
            <li> I simply love this lotion. I got it as a promotional offer and fell in love!! It smells incredible, my male friends really like it, and the feel of it on your skin is to die for. I highly recommend this product and after you pick it up you will too!!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is wonderful. It feels so good on my skin, especially my hands. It&#x27;s lightly scented - grapes, of course, but is not overwhelming. I tried it my hairdresser&#x27;s and ordered it the next day. Awesome, awesome stuff. I&#x27;ll be buying more for gift giving!</li>
            <li> I really liked how this lotion smelled, it&#x27;s different from the everyday scents you that everyone has. I usually put it on after spending a day in the sun. I didn&#x27;t feel like it was all that moisturizing though, it&#x27;s more of a light lotion. So if you&#x27;re looking for something super thick and moisturizing, I don&#x27;t think this will do it. I don&#x27;t know if I will buy it again because it&#x27;s a little on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I was originally introduced to this product while visiting the Biltmore Estate in Ashville, NC. The scent was lovely.  I ordered this on-line and it came promptly.  The texture of the product is fine but...the scent is not the same and is a bit \\&quot;off\\&quot; almost \\&quot;plastic-y\\&quot;.  Perhaps it is \\&quot;older\\&quot; than that purchased at Biltmore. My original bottle was used for many months so the shelf life seemed good. Oh, well.</li>
            <li> Good stuff ! Came fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vineyard Grapes Skin Moisturizer for about 3 yrs. I Love the way it goes on, and the way it&#x27;s fragrance does not overwhelm. I&#x27;m especially fond of the bottle which seems to lend itself to a quick, eazy spritz-motion so I can be quick about my work in the morning after my shower. Great design.</li>
            <li> I LOVE TO MASSAGE IN THE SKIN</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It is not to thick and goes on smoothly. I am always getting compliments on the smell when I wear it. Someone will always tell me that I smell great, like candy. I would definitely recommend this product to someone if they are considering purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this at my beauty salon and am glad for the find.  This lightweight moisturizer feels wonderful on the skin and does not make you feel oily.  It lasts all day and won&#x27;t get in the way of your foundation.  Only negative is it does not contain sunscreen.  The best perk - it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> Love this product this is great lotion.  I will definitely buy more!  Found this product at a winery and this is a much better price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product deserves excellent rating!  Aromatic supported by a non greasy application.  Would recommend this product to anyone in the market!</li>
            <li> I first bought this lotion in Las Vegas at high end hotel gift shop.  I found this on Amazon later for a great price.  This lotion took care of some rough skin that no other lotion came close to helping.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I bought two green and then this one grapes&lt;br /&gt;colored bottle of this moisturizer and it&#x27;s very rich and does what it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, don&#x27;t need much for each application.  Goes on smooth, soft sent, no oily after feel.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> did not get the &amp;#34;Grape&amp;#34;, was not purple was green, very disappointed</li>
            <li> This is the only cream I can find that my husband will use.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really great.  I&#x27;ve been buying it, where ever I can find it.  It smells great.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume.  It has a very light scent.  It&#x27;&#x27;s very smooth on the body; not greasy.  This body lotion is good for all skin types.  I especially recommend for people that live in dry/hot climates.  It&#x27;s very soothing!  For the size of the bottle, it&#x27;s a great price.  I do hope Amazon continues selling.</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect for my guest bathroom.  It smells delicious and a little nostalgic.  Reminded me of strawberry shortcake dolls for some reason - maybe one was scented with a similar grape smell.  Yummy!  You only need to use a little bit and it goes on easy and dries to a powdery/silky soft finish.  Love!  &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the review.  It arrived before other products.  I like the color, smell, bottle and feel of this product.  The price is great.</li>
            <li> Love this cream I have been using it for several years now since my sister in law have to me as a birthday present, thank you Sis. It&#x27;s very smooth, not greezy at all and it&#x27;s smell great. I love it highly recommend it. It last a long time as well so a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice lotion but it&#x27;s too fragrant. A light fragrance is much better for people with allergies.</li>
            <li> This one contains many chemicals and a very strong fragrance which I don&#x27;t like at all. I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have used and loved this wonderful smell lotion for several years.  Great!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is a light non greasy fast absorbing moisturizer that is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.  Fantastic fragrance.  I received my first bottle as a gift a year ago and have been hooked every since and give it as gifts now myself.</li>
            <li> This is the exact replacement for the moisturizer she had just run out of and she is thrilled to find a source for the lotion! She loves the feel and affect it has on her hands after cleaning in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it feels wonderful my daughter loves it and my niece it  smells great too made great Xmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  Not only does it have a wonderful fragrance that&#x27;s not overpowering, it soaks nicely into the skin. leaving no greasy residue.  And the scent lasts all day!  Not to mention, i was able to recognize every ingredient on the label as naturally derived, which makes a big difference to someone with sensitive skin.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product came packed nicely and was not damaged. Great product!</li>
            <li> A friend had given me a small bottle of this product while I was in Mexico 2 years ago.  I loved it then.  Ever since I had been trying to find it.  Finally, my internet search discovered it again.  I love the way it helps my skin to both look and feel younger.  I know this sounds like a paid commercial, but it happens to be the truth.  I ordered four large bottles when I finally found it.  Joy.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this lotion while at a salon. The cute bottle caught my eye (how adorable by the kitchen sink was my thought), but the scent reeled me in. It&#x27;s grape, but a wine-y kind of grape. Light and not over powering. You can wear this and not smell like a wino ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as moisturizing properties, I haven&#x27;t seen the dramatic results others have mentioned in their reviews, but I do think this would be great for winter months. To me it feels slightly greasy, but nothing so awful that I can&#x27;t handle it. And it does absorb rather quickly. What I did notice is that after application my skin looks like I&#x27;ve applied oil and it hasn&#x27;t sunk in yet, even though my skin is not wet or oily to the touch.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what my research said I would.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  First tried it as a gift from my massage therapist.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it didn&#x27;t contain parabens and fragrance. The description made it seem like it was all natural based on the selective ingredients the lister put in the description area. I was very excited to get the product but now im disappointed. It does smell nice and the bottle with the little metal grape detail attached to it looks very nice and decorative but Im a person who is not into fragrance (unless its natural) and preservatives and found the description to be misleading. I wont return it because it does look nice and it does leave my skin smooth so maybe I will use it once in a while and have my house guests use it as well.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion it feels good not greasy, smells so good!!</li>
            <li> Feels great, smells wonderful (like bubble gum?) seems to improve skin health.</li>
            <li> I love the product best I have ever used</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Awesome gift idea for the wine lover  The scent is light and not overpowering.  The bottle is such a great design.</li>
            <li> I tried this product at my Mom&#x27;s house and I fell in love right then and there. I like it because it is non-greasy. Makes my hands, arms and legs smooth.  You only need a little bit because it goes a long ways. I noticed the difference right away.</li>
            <li> My wife loves her Vineyard  Collection skin moisturizer and feels badly when we travel, because she only has it in a large bottle too large to carry in her bag.  I love it too, because it keeps her skin soft and smooth and fresh smelling.  I purchase it as a gift for my wife each year.</li>
            <li> My mom got this stuff in Amish country awhile ago and I tried it and loved it. I found it on here and it&#x27;s just great. I don&#x27;t usually like lotion because of the greasy effect, but this isn&#x27;t like that! I use it everywhere on me, even my face.  Love this stuff. Smells great!!!</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I really like this product and bought it as a Christmas gift.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product about two years.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles of this lotion (one for me and one for a friend), which arrived within 5 days.  One was wrapped in black netting that was secured around the neck with a nice grape motif wine charm - an unexpected &#x27;extra&#x27;!  I gave that one to my friend, who had tried this lotion on a recent trip to the Biltmore House in Asheville, NC. The lotion looks &amp; smels exactly as I remembered it in the Biltmore gift shop.  However, the pump on the bottle I kept for myself does not work!  I tried everything, including &#x27;priming&#x27; the pump, trying to run warm water through it, and even taking the pump apart, but the pump still does not work.  (My friend said her lotion pump works properly.)  Maybe the pump was affected by air pressure during shipment, or maybe I received an &#x27;irregular&#x27; piece of merchandise.  I didn&#x27;t think it would be worth the shipping cost to return the item, so I am removing the pump every time I use the lotion (which is very inconvenient &amp; messy).  The scent &amp; feel of the lotion is yummy!  If not for the defective pump, I would rate this item 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and buy it as a treat wen i can , it is affordable luxury ! will buy again .also thius sellers price is best other mark theirs way up . And shppimg was  free.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It has a light scent and absorbs quickly into my skin.  I just ordered my second bottle.  Also, makes a great gift!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been lazy about putting lotion on but I can&#x27;t wait until I get out of the shower to put this on! It&#x27;s so smooth &amp; smells so good! I use it every day. It&#x27;s a nice light lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy after application. After using it daily for 2 months my skin feels softer than ever! The only drawback is that they need to have a larger size available, this size only lasts 5-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Wife was very happy!!! Loves the stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to lotion . but this is the best lotion i have ever bought for myself</li>
            <li> They use this at my nail place and I love the Grape smell. Found it on Amazon and ordered it right away!</li>
            <li> I was given this several years ago and I had to get more..its absolutely delicious smelling and feeling. I ordered from bebeautiful and it is fresh. Smells just the same and feels amazing. I highly recommend this lotion as it is an all time favorite. Definitely worth more than what u pay and i can assure u bebeautiful has the real deal. I will be back for more for sure. Love this lotion. :)</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has the most delightful scent; not too sweet, not too floral, not too much.  It&#x27;s perfect for the woman who doesn&#x27;t want to go out heavily perfumed. It also absorbs into the skin easily and moisturizers well.  I love being able to use it before bed without feeling sticky or greasy and just have a little scent to help me drift off to sleep.</li>
            <li> Great lotion.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  Something went wrong with the pricing (they were asking nearly $75 for 17 oz.), but it appears to have been corrected.  I will definitely order again.  I had another bottle in my cart, waiting for my credit card cut off date before completing the purchase, when I was informed that they have raised the price again.  This time by nearly $8 a bottle.  It&#x27;s over $1 an ounce now.  Time to look for a substitute product.</li>
            <li> This body lotion is just wonderful. Silky smooth, not greasy and smells just devine.I use this on my pre-teen. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it really works.  I would recommend it anyone.  I use it on my face everyone morning and my face is smooth and vibrant. Nice fragrance to it. the plastic around the pump was broken.  I would recommend this to be packed better .not just a bag over it and paper.</li>
            <li> Saw this at the spa, loved the scent, and silky feel. I usually because of allergies can&#x27;t take a scented lotion but this did not bother me.</li>
            <li> Saw this in a nail salon a couple months ago and when I smelled the amazingness of it I had to buy it. Honestly it&#x27;s totally worth the money. I can tell this bottle is gonna last a very long time. Happy gal (:</li>
            <li> This was given to me as a gift a couple of years ago, it was the nicest lotion I have ever used.  Just heavy enough it does not feel like it diss appears when it hits the skin.  I am so happy to have found it and purchased a replacement for myself and for a few gifts.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It came in an absolutely beautiful bottle that looks just like a wrapped up wine bottle. I have it next to my kitchen sink and it looks pretty. However; I just don&#x27;t smell much of a scent. Not my fave. sorry :/</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!! Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy feeling. Shipper was very quick and effecient. Packaging was very well padded. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the second time i got this product but first time i get it via amazon and im very happy. It&#x27;s almost time for a new one so i just might be coming back.</li>
            <li> fabulous stuff! outstanding creaminess and yet no greasiness or residue and great fragrance..glad to have it available.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. The scent is amazing and it is not greasy after its applied. It leaves you feeling moisterized all day after one application.</li>
            <li> I liked the body cream, but I perfer the hand and elbow cream the best, and will continue to use it. I live in a very dry climate and the best hand and body cream are a must.</li>
            <li> eh it is okay nothing special, smell is ok. I would not buy again, unless you area die hard fan.</li>
