            <li>The color looks exactly how it is displayed in the picture, very beautiful.</li>
            <li>Nice color for flowers.</li>
            <li>The Konad special stamping nail polish works so good</li>
            <li>I wanted more colors.   </li>
            <li>But you need to wait awhile before you put a top coat on or it will smear.</li>
            <li>there was much better</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not as opaque as the white is, it&#x27;s your best shot.</li>
            <li>I will for sure continue buying konad stamping nail polish</li>
            <li>You are better off buying a cheap polish.</li>
            <li>and I had a much easier time getting a good image from the plates.</li>
            <li>good price fast shipping</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This item came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy and quick.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Thick color perfect for nail  art</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been stamping for 6 months and have not found a good yellow stamping polish yet.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth yet covers great without being too thick.  </li>
            <li>The color is pretty and it stamped great but the color came out MUCH lighter then expected.  </li>
            <li>I have a great deep yellow color from this nail polish.</li>
            <li>The color is very much like the image</li>
            <li>Love this color blue, for my nail stamping.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this color, to any one.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>be purchasing more in the future</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think you have to be married to this product.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think this polish could be better.</li>
            <li>This polish is too sheer as are most of the lighter shades of konad stamping polish.  </li>
            <li>i like yellow and this one is a good color of yellow dont have to put on two coats to see it.</li>
            <li>thanks so much!</li>
            <li>on nails very good&lt;</li>
            <li>I suspected as much when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any other brand could do much better either.  </li>
            <li>, it does the designs really bold ( I tried with regular nail polish and it doesn&#x27;t work as well)  </li>
            <li>I bought the white nail plolish and I was impressed because it worked really well,and then I bought the yellow nail polish and it does not show up on anything,its really faint</li>
            <li>I still use it some of my designs that I want to give a bit of color to, without looking too busy.</li>
            <li>My sister purchased this as so far no complaints</li>
            <li>I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised.</li>
            <li>Love that is thick and it show up on nails.  </li>
            <li>I have tried it on a plain nail, and it was still light.  </li>
            <li>If you want to stamp yellow against a dark background, you&#x27;d be better off getting the pastel yellow stamping polish.</li>
            <li>Finding ordinary yellow nail polish that covers well isn&#x27;t easy to begin with.</li>
            <li>Once I try this one, wow it was such a difference.</li>
            <li>Not any better for stamping than yellow Sally Hansen Insta-dry, though it&#x27;s not any worse.</li>

            <li> I finally broke down and bought this one.  </li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s just the same if not better to use a regular formulated (or in reality, a regularly advertised) nail polish that&#x27;s heavily opaque instead.</li>
            <li> Like someone else said, a highly-pigmented yellow is hard to find in regular polish, let alone a stamping polish.  </li>
            <li> It stamped \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but lighter then expected.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for Halloween nail art hoping it would show up over dark colors</li>
            <li> That would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with how light this nail polish appears when stamped on nails.</li>
            <li> I would recommend spending your money on a different color (not gold, the gold was even worse.)</li>
            <li> The polish should be more opaque than it is, which is disappointed and frustrating for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;even hard to get off with remover</li>
            <li> but remember - you can use ANY thick polish for nail stamping.</li>
            <li> My polish arrived in bad shape and I thought I was just being stupid with the technique until I ordered from a separate website.</li>

            <li> Thick color perfect for nail  art</li>
            <li> Love this color blue, for my nail stamping.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this color, to any one.&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing more in the future</li>
            <li> This works just as well as it&#x27;s supposed to but remember - you can use ANY thick polish for nail stamping. We&#x27;ve discovered that! Don&#x27;t think you have to be married to this product. We have a nail salon.</li>
            <li> I got an stamping kit this christmas, I ordered this becasue I wanted more colors.   The Konad special stamping nail polish works so good, it does the designs really bold ( I tried with regular nail polish and it doesn&#x27;t work as well)  I recommend this definitely!</li>
            <li> Bought this for Halloween nail art hoping it would show up over dark colors and I was not disappointed. Konad makes a great stamping polish. No other yellow polish shows up over dark colors like this one.</li>
            <li> I bought the white nail plolish and I was impressed because it worked really well,and then I bought the yellow nail polish and it does not show up on anything,its really faint and I wanted to return it,but im waiting for the seller to get back to me,if your going to buy any of the konad nail polishes I suggest you by the white one,not the yellow</li>
            <li> This nail polish is great for art work.  It goes on smooth yet covers great without being too thick.  The color is very much like the image</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with how light this nail polish appears when stamped on nails. You are better off buying a cheap polish.</li>
            <li> i like yellow and this one is a good color of yellow dont have to put on two coats to see it. great deal as well.</li>
            <li> Nice color for flowers.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think this polish could be better. As a polish specifically formulated for nail stamping, the formula falls short for me on application. The polish should be more opaque than it is, which is disappointed and frustrating for the price I paid. For me, it&#x27;s just the same if not better to use a regular formulated (or in reality, a regularly advertised) nail polish that&#x27;s heavily opaque instead.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.But you need to wait awhile before you put a top coat on or it will smear. The colors are great.</li>
            <li> and in great condition. The color looks exactly how it is displayed in the picture, very beautiful. thanks so much!</li>
            <li> My polish arrived in bad shape and I thought I was just being stupid with the technique until I ordered from a separate website. The stuff I got there was much better and I had a much easier time getting a good image from the plates.</li>
            <li> It stamped \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but lighter then expected.  I have tried it on a plain nail, and it was still light.  You can still see it, but it does not pop like the black/white.  I still use it some of my designs that I want to give a bit of color to, without looking too busy.</li>
            <li> Great for use with their stamping kit.  Love that is thick and it show up on nails.  Easy and quick.</li>
            <li> My sister purchased this as so far no complaints the on it at all, looks like it was a good buy</li>
            <li> good price fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;stays on nails very good&lt;br /&gt;even hard to get off with remover&lt;br /&gt;what eles can you ask for ...right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been stamping for 6 months and have not found a good yellow stamping polish yet.  I finally broke down and bought this one.  Like someone else said, a highly-pigmented yellow is hard to find in regular polish, let alone a stamping polish.  I suspected as much when I ordered it.  This polish is too sheer as are most of the lighter shades of konad stamping polish.  I don&#x27;t think any other brand could do much better either.  It&#x27;s yellow.</li>

            <li> This item came very quickly. I have had no problems with it. Nothing was damaged and it still works. I am happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this stamping polish would be opaque, but no, it&#x27;s transparent. I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be too surprised. Finding ordinary yellow nail polish that covers well isn&#x27;t easy to begin with. If you want to stamp yellow against a dark background, you&#x27;d be better off getting the pastel yellow stamping polish. Although it&#x27;s not as opaque as the white is, it&#x27;s your best shot.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty and it stamped great but the color came out MUCH lighter then expected.  That would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I have a great deep yellow color from this nail polish. Compared to regular nail polish which I used to use for stamping. Once I try this one, wow it was such a difference. I will for sure continue buying konad stamping nail polish</li>
