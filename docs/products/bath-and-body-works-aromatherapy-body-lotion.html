            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you have ever tried this lotion, but It is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>What an amazing and relaxing smell&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li>It comes In a nice glass bottle too.</li>
            <li>This has helped me to relax and helps to keep my feet warm.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light scent that moisturizes and calms you.</li>
            <li>Just love this makes the your skin feel  and  </li>
            <li>Love the product and it came safely packaged</li>
            <li>Love the scent and it&#x27;s effect.</li>
            <li>This Aromatherapy Sleep Lavender is outstanding</li>
            <li>this Bath &amp; Body Aromatherapy Lavender is the best lavender scented product I&#x27;ve found even better than one I purchased at an actual Lavender Farm.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that this comes in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li>As for sleeping better, that is not what I use it for.  </li>
            <li>I simply love the product</li>
            <li>The top of the bottle ended up being cracked</li>
            <li>Lovely way to fall asleep with the smell of lavender on my hands.</li>
            <li>It does have some of the stuff that you aren&#x27;t supposed to use if you are really trying to keep your hands soft and crack free, so it is best used as an aid to smell good, and to relax and NOT to keep your hands soft.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasing aroma and goes on satiny smooth.  </li>
            <li>I liked this so much I purchased the body wash, pillow mist &amp; the body</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it helps me to sleep better, but I love slathering it on every night and smelling it as I drift to sleep.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice clean scent and comes in a high quality glass bottle with plastic pump.</li>
            <li>I notice the aroma is pleasant and is stronger than other products I&#x27;ve used which likely attributes to its superior effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great to rub a little all over to relax and sleep.</li>
            <li>I love the lotion because of the scent as well as how soft it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Relaxing and feels smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and goes on thin</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>n helped so much with my stress.</li>
            <li>It really helped her to sleep easier.</li>
            <li>The scent is soothing and relaxing and really does help me get to sleep easier.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very soothing, nice, not overwhelming or cloying smell.</li>
            <li>I am hoping once the lotion cools down after being heated from the sun that scent gets better.</li>
            <li>A good sized bottle , and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This is nice for after a long day of hard work.  </li>
            <li>It seems to help calm me down.</li>
            <li>I am particular, though, and don&#x27;t necessarily like the feel of lotion (especially if greasy/slimy feeling) ...</li>

            <li> I could sleep for about six hours which was usually in two hour segments during the night.  </li>
            <li> a small dab on my beard is all it takes.</li>
            <li> It came broken.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just the fact it came broken that sucked.</li>
            <li> It is quite expensive, but what are you going to do?  </li>
            <li> It was so cold out</li>
            <li> but living in the midwest and dealing with horribly cold winters, I have to use and moisturize all the time.  </li>
            <li> which was extremely disappointing and annoying.</li>

            <li> I love anything Bath and Body works and was really happy to find this Sleep time lotion.  I use it after my evening bath and it helps me to drift off to sleep.

            <li> I love Bath and Body works products, but, this Vanilla and Lavender SLEEP scent is the best!!! It has a very light scent that moisturizes and calms you.

            <li> I would just call this lavender and leave out the vanilla but it&#x27;s a very soothing, nice, not overwhelming or cloying smell. Great to rub a little all over to relax and sleep.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you have ever tried this lotion, but It is absolutely amazing. I put it on at night and it makes me so relaxed and I sleep so good. If you want a really good smelling lotion that relaxes, get this!</li>
            <li> It smells great.  It puts me to sleep - I put it on after my shower at night and before bed.  And it moisturizes!</li>
            <li> I LOVE that this comes in a glass bottle. I feel so fancy LOL! It smells great and goes on thin, I can&#x27;t wait to use it for bed tonight!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mother and she loves it.  It is quite expensive, but what are you going to do?  the end</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I don&#x27;t really know if it helps me to sleep better, but I love slathering it on every night and smelling it as I drift to sleep.  I even gave bottles of it to some friends for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter along with the lavender hand wash.  She likes the scent of lavender in both products.</li>
            <li> I was given as a gift one year the Sleep body lotion and bath works.  I love the lotion because of the scent as well as how soft it makes my skin feel.  As for sleeping better, that is not what I use it for.  I simply love the product</li>
            <li> It came broken. It was so cold out and it just comes in a little package. The stuff itself smells good and works well, it&#x27;s just the fact it came broken that sucked. Order in summer time</li>
            <li> Great lotion to put on before bed :)</li>
            <li> Just what we needed.  It really helps.</li>
            <li> What an amazing and relaxing smell&lt;br /&gt;Put it on every night to help relax your mind and help you sleep</li>
            <li> Smells really good, and it is a good lotion to put on before bed.  However, compared to other lotions that I have tried (and I have tried plenty), it can feels somewhat sticky.

            <li> This is nice for after a long day of hard work.  Relaxing and feels smooth and soft.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells really good!  My husband loves the smell too!</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail after my package being delayed. The top of the bottle ended up being cracked which was extremely disappointing and annoying. The scent didn&#x27;t even smell like lavender or vanilla just nauseating genetic soapy scent. I am hoping once the lotion cools down after being heated from the sun that scent gets better.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents!</li>
            <li> Lovely way to fall asleep with the smell of lavender on my hands.</li>
            <li> For my wife. I don&#x27;t use it myself.</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble sleeping.  This has helped me to relax and helps to keep my feet warm.  It seems to help calm me down.</li>
            <li> I used to have so much trouble sleeping so I bought this to see if it help, trust me... It helps. I feel so relaxed n helped so much with my stress. I went out n got everything that had lavender.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife, she loved it. It really helped her to sleep easier. Next purchase I make will be a larger size.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It has a nice clean scent and comes in a high quality glass bottle with plastic pump. I have problems getting to sleep and I use it on my arms and hands before bedtime. The scent is soothing and relaxing and really does help me get to sleep easier. They also make the same scent in a pillow spray that I use in addition to this.</li>
            <li> Out of this world great</li>
