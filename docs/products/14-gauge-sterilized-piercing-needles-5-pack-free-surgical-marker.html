            <li> Good product to use if you don&#x27;t want to pay to get it done professionally. Came in the mail a little late though.</li>
            <li> these are great for those who like to do their own piercings or need to gauge up their piercings. Theyre really sharp and since i only used them on myself and boyfriend i used each a good couple of times n they were still pretty sharp. :D</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for in needles.  Clean, sterile sharp and a surgical marker.  It also came with a couple of sterilizing pads for the ear.  Can&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> I used this to pierce my own belly button and it worked great. It was quick, clean, and it&#x27;s a hollow needle which allows you to slip your piece of jewelery into the puncture. I also gave two to my friend who pierced her own nips and she said they worked very well! I highly recommend these needles to others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: This package doesn&#x27;t include clamps, sterilization wipes, or gloves.

            <li> These needles were fantastic! good price, quick shipping (product arrived in 2-3 days), new packaging. I used them to pierce my double lobe and left cartilage about a month ago and they turned out really well. As a first time self-piercer I was apprehensive about needles but these came individually wrapped in their own sterile package with plastic tips for safety. The marker was nice too to mark the hole. These needles are very sharp so they slid right through and made my piercing experience easy and mostly painless. They cut through like butter which is exactly what you want, it&#x27;s over so quickly. I highly highly highly recommend these needles to anyone thinking about piercing themselves or a friend - they are sterile and effective!! I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> these needles are great quality very durable very sharp and in clean uniform packages well worth the money very nice metal great all around</li>
            <li> Individual sterilized packages. Nice and sharp, pierced through skin easily. Good value. Correct gauge, work well. Used for belly button piercing, didn&#x27;t need 5 but I can do stuff in future I guess.</li>
            <li> They are nice and sharp and each can in an individual steril packaging. They also came very quickly. I was pleased.</li>
