            <li>This teeth whitening system works very good.</li>
            <li>This is as good as what the dentists use; Just use it with causion keeping it off your gums, cheeks and lips best you can using a mouth guard that fits your teeth perfectly.</li>
            <li>My teeth were perfect for prom and I look wonderful with a perfect smile to go with my dress.</li>

            <li>Works Great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>use a 0.63% Stannous Fluoride Rinse (MedActiveÂ®) every night, and take exceptionally great care of both my teeth and gums to ensure optimal oral health.  </li>
            <li>But it works great.</li>
            <li>lol  </li>
            <li>Whitener works great.</li>
            <li>I am getting great results with it, as my teeth&lt;</li>
            <li>My friend saw my great results and is now using&lt;br /&gt;it.</li>
            <li>Great deal.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already received comments that my teeth look great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This stuff WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great gel, and is very strong!</li>
            <li>Just wanted to post about the non existant pain, if this works it will be AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Whitens nicely !!! :)</li>
            <li>but I still see a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li>This item is very good in keeping the teeth looking better.  </li>
            <li>It is VERY strong!</li>
            <li>We ordered these because we did the one at the kiosk in the San Antonio Mall (bleach bright).</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>but you would be wise to buy this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Licensed Dentist buys &amp; uses a Teeth Bleaching/Lightening product &amp; patients are delighted with the results.</li>
            <li>Does just as good as strips with a lower cost.</li>
            <li>and this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product, and I saw a difference within 3 days, but I don&#x27;t put the gel in the tray.</li>
            <li>I got some results but not as good as I</li>
            <li>This was definately a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>I found the gel itself worked just as good.</li>
            <li>I have been shopping around for a good teeth whitener set</li>
            <li>I think this will be good for 50-60 applications.</li>
            <li>The results are as good as the $350-$750 charged by the pros.</li>
            <li>I love love love it!!!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product. :)</li>
            <li>Works great, but make sure to keep it off your gums.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is just a real strong mixture or something.</li>
            <li>She will probably be getting more from you!</li>
            <li>I found it to work better then the dentist office product!</li>
            <li>Although they&#x27;d make sure your teeth are clean and can benefit from this the best.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a strong whitener.  </li>
            <li>Is cheap but great ...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Whitening was amazing.  </li>
            <li>It did effectively whiten my teeth</li>
            <li>I will never try another kind again.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I saw noticeable results after 2 nights.</li>
            <li>but I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any sensitivity either which was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit as a gift for my sister and tried the gel in my own bleach tray.</li>
            <li>and he was impressed with the quality if this system, and it came so fast</li>
            <li>Not an effective whitener, will not be reordering</li>
            <li>Is kind of a pain to do.</li>
            <li>If you are the type of person that if one is good, than two must be better, you will burn your gums.  </li>
            <li>kind of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>if you want the gel to be effective so spend the time on it.</li>
            <li>I normally have excellent gums.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I think this kind works better.</li>
            <li>This works, very strong whitening gel.</li>
            <li>I recommend having a professional mouth guard made just for your teeth (to keep the gel off your gums, cheeks, and lips best).  </li>
            <li>But still with 10 syringes, and the price, this is still BY FAR the best bang for your buck product.</li>
            <li>If you have professional trays, this is an excellent use for them.  </li>
            <li>To strong!  </li>
            <li>Very very strong stuff, make sure to wipe off your gums or it&#x27;ll hurt after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two very important tips;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price for the strips was very high and the reviews not that great.</li>
            <li>works better than the dentist version</li>
            <li>Thanks for all of the great deals on amazon.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was pleased with results.</li>
            <li>works well wish I had more trays I messed up one of the trays when I was fitting it</li>
            <li>so we decided to order some more of the gel.</li>
            <li>Ok ,so it foams that because its whitening your teeth,and I wasn&#x27;t foaming at the mouth.</li>
            <li>Payed more and got a name brand from the dentist . . .</li>
            <li>Would recommend and buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>it has served me well for many years.  </li>
            <li>Why do I have to use soo many word in my feedback,is this a school?</li>
            <li>I wish I was able to do this more often.  </li>
            <li>I will continue with more care</li>
            <li>Get a brand that is more well known.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with the product itself and the amount of proper tools provided with it.</li>
            <li>I returned that and ordered two more because my wife wanted one and</li>
            <li>I actually just put this product inside my invisaligns and it works great!  </li>
            <li>I cant stop smiling:):)</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more lightening as I continue to use the gel.</li>
            <li>5 uses later and its still perfect.</li>
            <li>This could be because I haven&#x27;t been able to keep the product on for more than 5 minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li>How many truly American-made products do that?  </li>
            <li>I want to be able to know who is accountable when I start spitting up blood.    </li>
            <li>Probably the best deal for a whitening kit, but I would advise getting a different mouth peice mold.</li>
            <li>I wish you were able to give no stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks like I have to search for a better mouth tray.</li>
            <li>I was able to get 3-31/2 applications out of a syringe.</li>
            <li>It was fantastic!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to try this one more time</li>
            <li>glad I did.</li>
            <li>Probably at this strength needs to be supervised or you just have to know what your doing better than myself.</li>
            <li>Go for a more gradual result with a lower % of peroxide and SAVE YOUR GUMS.</li>
            <li>I was able to have wrapped for Xmas no probs at all</li>
            <li>I have had whitening products for many years.  </li>
            <li>(My maltest found them, and had her way with them, hence I needed to get some more)  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to achieve my goal in 4 treatments.</li>
            <li>When the wound heals, I will purchase whitening strips and do it the safe, old-fashioned way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Iv always tried the strips and they are just WAYYYYY more comfortable then the tray!</li>
            <li>I have been buying this product from this vendor for 3 years now and love it.</li>
            <li>:  make sure you get the teeth trays well fitted to your teeth.</li>
            <li>The Product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Product is so strong it burnt the top of my mouth and gums and had to throw it away.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t look like a rabie dog and way more important so you can be able to remain  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the gel works fine.</li>
            <li>Our teeth are significantly whiter, brighter and we both feel more confident with our smiles as a result.  </li>
            <li>The company claims to be Made in the USA, which is always a great feeling, and a great way to support small, growing businesses in the United States.  </li>
            <li>Whitens teeth better than the strips and is much more economical.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and works as advertised.</li>
            <li>Maybe my teeth are too tea stained to be easily whitened, but this just didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.  </li>
            <li>but you can easily tell my teeth look brighter after ONE use</li>
            <li>It warns you about the strong gel.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think at all that its too strong.</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong.</li>
            <li>I think the solution is too strong and the trays let it leak onto the gums, causing the burns.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong taste when it leaks out of the tray, but I have never have gotten my gums or tongue burnt from the product.</li>
            <li>Product is strong</li>
            <li>Too strong for my teeth.</li>
            <li>DO YOU GET A GOOD HIGH END PRODUCT</li>
            <li>teeth looked amazing after the first use.</li>
            <li>Beautiful white teeth!</li>
            <li>Fine, but</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and it works fine.</li>
            <li>There are 10 tubes of strong gel, trays and a mini light.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to receive the kit so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have used many products from the dentist and have my own trays so this isn&#x27;t a new venture for me.  </li>
            <li>My teeth is nice and white, Love it!</li>
            <li>my first try and so far so good, not an ounce of pain!</li>
            <li>I saw HUGE improvement immediately.</li>
            <li>Did not get the LED light accelerator...</li>
            <li>Is there any way to fit them</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this item for the last 5 months twice a week and get great results.</li>
            <li>and you look like a goof with the light</li>
            <li>ALL IN  ALL INCLUDED WAS A LIGHT ACTIVATOR, JUST LIKE WHEN</li>
            <li>(even without the LED light</li>
            <li>I spend 30 minutes going through steps 1 and 2 and when I got to step 3, the light didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how you would fit it and</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for the money!!!</li>
            <li>I get many complaments on my smile that I never got before</li>
            <li>and I ve received so many compliments about my smile.</li>
            <li>The light works</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the light they provide, and have no way of knowing if it helps at all, but I guess it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>but I have not tried the &amp;#34;Blue Light &amp;#34;part of the process yet as it is not confimed at what time of the process I should be doing that.</li>
            <li>Her teeth went from brown to a light yellowish color within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>The light does help and over all</li>
            <li>no instructions and the light piece doesn&#x27;t seem to fit once you have the trays in.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>product is great and use it daily and works like a charm!  </li>
            <li>so I spit those out and just put the stuff on my teeth and the light in my mouth.</li>
            <li>im not quite sure if its really worth waiting for.</li>
            <li>but anyways with or without the LED light</li>
            <li>(because they must shrink to perfectly fit your teeth) and then place them in your teeth and press so they mold to the shape of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as a professional whitening but the results are still noticeable.</li>
            <li>Very nice job, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and shows quick results.</li>
            <li>Also be sure to have Sensodyne BEFORE your first treatment to aid with the sensitivity while your enamel restores.</li>
            <li>Using it in front under my lower lip and top lip and under my tongue and they are getting soaked pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I would love to try some more, but without being able to return, if they are the same quality, I would just be wasting time and money.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant change.  </li>
            <li>I have whitened my teeth successfully with inexpensive, generic whitening strips, but I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>This is worth buying!</li>
            <li>I recommended it to my 21 year old son and he was impressed how white his teeth had gotten.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s got REALLY clean teeth, but no lighter.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic, can&#x27;t say enough good things, would buy it again.</li>
            <li>But if your teeth are clean, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>It seems like an effective cheaper alternative based on reviews, but I have not used it much because my jaw hurt for over a week after the first two uses.  </li>
            <li>I am calling Cool Teeth Whitening and demanding a refund.</li>
            <li>It does the job nice and clear.</li>
            <li>Overall, this turned out to be a good experience.</li>
            <li>better than before, it&#x27;s much stronger, note-</li>
            <li>so i couldn&#x27;t decide if it is actually working so good as described.</li>
            <li>I was all ready to just write it off as a loss if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li>About 2 years ago I used a 30% Carbamide Peroxide product supplied my dentist daily for 8 weeks with good results and no sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time that is about the only thing good about this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>teeth are not bad but they aren&#x27;t the whitest.</li>
            <li>Bottom tooth tray ended up folding over and doesn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li>Used first time for about 15 minutes and could easily see a difference.  </li>
            <li>But for the price, this is a far more effective product than any of the over commercialized, highly diluted, &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; retail whiteners (CrestÂ®, ColgateÂ®, LISTERINEÂ®) that cost anywhere from $40-$100 per treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have the best looking smile I have ever had in my life due to this product, and absolutely suggest it if you want a glowing smile and don&#x27;t want to spend 100</li>
            <li>and It has made a tremendous difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s a tremendous bargain and value.</li>
            <li>Ok so I have used so many products &amp; smoked for 17 years and finally I can see my teeth getting whiter!</li>
            <li>Worked quickly.  </li>
            <li>quick to mold it to your mouth.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s amazing, the only thing i can complain about is that the Led Light didn&#x27;t turned on maybe i should change the batteries</li>
            <li>and  it was super</li>
            <li>I am a very handy person and followed the instructions very carefully.  </li>
            <li>I saw results with the very first treatment.</li>
            <li>The light takes so much pressure to hold on that your thumb or fingers can get carpal!</li>
            <li>This Gel came with more syringes filled with more gel than the others, however the formula seems to be the same and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this gel before and as the last time the whitening is consistent and good.  </li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t realize how easy it was to put too much solution in the tray.  </li>
            <li>The thermo-form trays are easy to heat and mold in your mouth; the syringes are easy to open and apply the gel to the inside of said tray; and the LED light works as designed.  </li>
            <li>Very effective, but be careful not to put too much in the retainer; if it overflows and gets on your gums, it&#x27;ll hurt quite a bit and the contacted area of flesh will turn bright white for a day or so!</li>
            <li>Use it sparingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product with above average to good results.</li>
            <li>It is strong, so I have only been able to put it on my teeth for 8 min.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant but works great.</li>
            <li>They work well and the light really accellerates the cleaning process.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how much the light helps, but I&#x27;m not getting it anymore.</li>
            <li>What I did was put some of the gel directly on my teeth and a added bit more within the trays and had NOooo problems.</li>
            <li>No it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>so your jaw is in a more natural position?  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to enhance my smile during those in between times.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>gums\\&quot;, I was kind of expecting it but not only</li>
            <li>This whitener is powerful.</li>
            <li>This stuff is FAR and away better than the store bought stuff that I used.</li>
            <li>No change in brightness of my smile.</li>
            <li>Let me be clear that I do not have any dental problems and my teeth are in healthy condition.</li>
            <li>This kit was definately worth it.</li>
            <li>I went from yellowed to brilliant white in only 2 syringes.</li>
            <li>it skeptics,it was worth the 20$ or so to get it to</li>
            <li>It has given me confidence to smile again.</li>
            <li>My teeth were kind of white to begin with</li>
            <li>On her free time she uses the Plus White gel, and both morning and night she brushes her teeth with a fluoride toothpaste and puts the whitening booster on top of it.</li>
            <li>There is a link to the [...] website where a better instruction sheet with pictures and alternate purchasing options are available.</li>
            <li>This is a MUST if you have any tint to your smile.</li>
            <li>This is one of the easiest, cheapest, most natural way to improve your appearance.</li>
            <li>Inside the bag, nothing is marked cool teeth whitening and the instructions have an Easy Whitening logo on them.</li>
            <li>Strong and effective, may be too strong and cause some minor burning to the gum line if left on the full amount of time suggested.</li>
            <li>The trays I had were very thin and fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I have developed the yellowish brown discoloration of my front teeth from consuming much coffee, tea and cola, despite normal good dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>I realized that the mouth pieces included were kind of pointless and didn&#x27;t fit even after boiling them to loosen the material they&#x27;re made out of and then placing them into your mouth to form fit them.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t see results right away.  </li>
            <li>My coworker noticed right away &amp; asked to see my teeth .</li>
            <li>Whitens well and the price was right.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why you must follow the instructions the right way</li>
            <li>The product worked great the first few months.</li>
            <li>The trays are not a custom fit, but once on keeping a small washcloth if not your tongue will keep them in place for 30-45 mins and wa-la your teeth look good.</li>
            <li>give this product my full support, and hope the company is able to improve packaging in the future.  </li>
            <li>This one is The most pure and powerful and doesnt make my teeth sting and feel sensitive.</li>
            <li>actual chemical turns into what I call super peroxide (ha), be sure not to over apply to the trays before putting them in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>My sister who is a dentist told me apparently you could keep redoing the teeth tray so it could better shape your teeth.</li>
            <li>Apparently longer use may have even better result, but I wouldn&#x27;t know if my teeth enamel can handle that.</li>
            <li>The UV light is finicky and has to be held with just the right pressure to emit a constant ray of light.  </li>
            <li>The instructions warn you about molding the trays right and keeping gel away from your gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got immediate results after first application.</li>
            <li>The kit really works and whitened my teeth quickly.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed more even color in my teeth, I recently quit smoking and was looking for a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>, however the price is VERY reasonable to try out.</li>
            <li>and the first one seemed to just melt very fast before I could even put it in my mouth.</li>
            <li>This products makes your teeth whiter even after first use.</li>
            <li>But I noticed a difference in the first use.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are considerably more white.</li>
            <li>I used this one for 15 minutes at first.</li>
            <li>(instructions say 15-30 mins the first time you use it).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve encountered that makes my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly...</li>
            <li>I did it again by putting it in hot water and it shrank up.</li>
            <li>I applied to my teeth using the syringe and then spread using a q-tip exactly where needed, and put the trays on.</li>
            <li>Even the first time I used it noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I give this a try first.</li>
            <li>Before you use the mouth trays the first time, you&#x27;re supposed to dip them in hot water and shape them to your mouth.  </li>
            <li>So I thought my fellow Amazonians should be aware of what you see here, because you don&#x27;t quite know what your sticking into your mouth if you buy this product.    </li>
            <li>FIRST:  </li>
            <li>Depending on how much you use!</li>
            <li>i put 3 stars for now because im not using it yet,it says there can&#x27;t use for nursing mom so better to wait next month after i stop breastfeed</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It works the first time it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s any better or faster than white strips, but it is cheaper.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used this product it worked well, but after a week my teeth would hurt even if I would just breathe through my mouth.</li>
            <li>So this was my first time using an at home kit</li>
            <li>My first time using it</li>
            <li>It was a better idea to use a mouthpiece I later got from my dentist.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First of all for $22</li>
            <li>I had first tried a tube of whitening gel from walmart.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Bought this kit two weeks ago and both myself and partner are AMAZED at how fast the whitening agent works!  </li>
            <li>I have used the product 5 times now, carefully following instructions, but I have never been able to make it up to the recommended 20-30 minute whitening time.  </li>
            <li>I first tried with the trays but they kept gagging me</li>
            <li>This product will MOST DEFINITELY produce results.</li>
            <li>I understand that the super high % of peroxide is advertised</li>
            <li>I recieved this product today, the light DOES NOT work even with new batteries and it makes me very unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li>The syringes and other pieces were not in any kind of sealed package.</li>
            <li>I have tried at least 15 different teeth whitening systems and this works best.  </li>
            <li>Based on the number of positive reviews, I knew the product was legit.</li>
            <li>can be pretty intense zinger if you leave on longer.  </li>
            <li>What I received was a clear plastic bag with a sticker on it that said cool teeth whitening.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the first two tries on my upper teeth but the third fit quite well.  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake of using too much the first time and it seeped out of the trays.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far I&#x27;ve had this in for 15 minutes (going the full 30)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead, I take the gel, and do a very LIGHT amount into the tray, where the flat part meets the side wall right in the corner,  all the way around the top and bottom, Once you insert it into your mouth, pucker your gums tight, as this will get the gel all over the teeth</li>
            <li>But like the other reviews, it is very STRONG.  </li>
            <li>this could be somehow due to user error, I wish the instructions for fitting the mouthpieces were more specific.  </li>
            <li>I had Easy White done by cosmetic dentist at cost of $500.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This makes me think that the solution is very effective but that I&#x27;ll need to be very, very careful the next time I use the trays.  </li>
            <li>probably wishful thinking on my part, as I kept the trays in so briefly--but certainly my gums were whiter.  </li>
            <li>There are 10 large whitening gel tubes in this kit.</li>
            <li>They stay nice and tightly suctioned to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>thanks again.</li>
            <li>didnt work as fast as they stated</li>
            <li>WHITE LED LIGHT INCLUDED&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it caused them to blister and bleed, very tender and sore for days...</li>
            <li>My dentist does (1) free whitening a year along with being an established patient &amp; with regular cleanings.  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t notice much whitening compared to strip products, but perhaps my salvaged molds were just off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whole roof of my mouth was burned, teeth hurt for two days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had anything burn quite as much before.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only downside was the light, which stopped working properly after 1 use.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>The results are real, your teeth will get whiter, however, as the COO of an oral care and relief company, please use caution when using this product.  </li>
            <li>this teeth whitening kit really works.</li>
            <li>I tried fitting the trays (followed the instructions carefully.)</li>
            <li>This comes with so much gel, id say 30- 40 uses.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediate improvement in my teeth and am very pleased&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a whole bunch of the whitening jel too.</li>
            <li>Sometimes DIY mouth trays don&#x27;t remelt and remold very well, but I had no problems with this one.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>It really works, but you just have to be very carefull with your gums.</li>
            <li>Just too much for my teeth to take.  </li>
            <li>For those complaining about the burning sensation: you put too much in the tray and got it on your gums.</li>
            <li>it really works!I didnt even use the light.try</li>
            <li>I used this product for 7 days straight.</li>
            <li>I could reasonably see a difference within that week.</li>
            <li>Not as much to say.</li>
            <li>I think this happened because I put too much whitener in the mouth piece and when I place it over my teeth the gel came out.</li>
            <li>People need to understand that teeth whitening is not an overnight process, and depending on the severity of the staining, it will take anywhere from 2-8 weeks (though some people will see results faster) before you really start to glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The should give you a second set since they are just cheap plastic anyway and probably cost .05 cents to make each one ??  </li>
            <li>This stuff works really well....</li>
            <li>Be ready to jimmyrig some stuff though...</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>Using the cheap whitening trays, even with molding to my teeth and trimming to be below my gum line, there is no way to keep the gel entirely off of my gums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this once so far and noticed a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>Now I feel very hesitant to use it and just might throw it way.</li>
            <li>30-40 min with the tray because i think i used way too much gel and saliva</li>
            <li>I am excited because the results are almost instant and that was just with 10 minutes..</li>
            <li>I could tell a big difference on  first appication, and even more on the second appication.  </li>
            <li>I used this gel 3 times with the trays the first day with maybe 1shade difference, then I used it the next day, 3 times with my blue led light mouth piece!</li>
            <li>After a week, the shine of the front teeth has returned and my teeth look clean and brushed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a percentage quite higher than even what we (the public) get through Amazon, Brite Smile (44% Carbamide Peroxide).&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very soft, and is dual action, meaning you can do top and bottom at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only 4 syringes in and my teeth are significantly whiter, definitely more so than any other whitening product I have tried!</li>
            <li>First day back, my gums burned right away.</li>
            <li>This product worked right after first use (Specks of white were all over my teeth).</li>
            <li>But this&lt;br /&gt;product works much better than the other whitening tray products!</li>
            <li>I have used many different whitening products...typically the white strips...</li>
            <li>It is strong so be careful when putting the gel on because it will burn your gums.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for those who would like their teeth get whitened .</li>
            <li>i highly recommend getting this item</li>
            <li>I completely FREAKED out and was on the verge of tears thinking this product had just ruined my gums!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>The molding was so easy to do judt submerge in just boiled water for 4 seconds and to my surprise they were not hot when I took the impressionsof my teeth.</li>
            <li>have high hopes for this product, so hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to increase my star rating in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>After, insert the top and bottom mouth guards and affix whitening light under the upper and lower lip for at least 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Now I can smile again and not be too concerned that people are staring at my once yellow teeth.</li>
            <li>I used the whitening light the first few times but found it didn&#x27;t speed up the process</li>
            <li>Just be careful if you have sensitive teeth, because that tooth will become more sensitive for a while.</li>
            <li>I had zoom done at dental office and this product has kept my smile white!!!</li>
            <li>Alas, they are also so sensitive that I can&#x27;t use this as much as I need too for good results.</li>
            <li>If you screw up in forming them, which is pretty easy to do, there&#x27;s really no going back.</li>
            <li>I received item very quickly and packed carefully and with  complete directions.  </li>
            <li>word of caution, even using the right amount results in only 4-5 uses per syringe.  </li>
            <li>; so you don&#x27;t screwed it like i did for not following the right way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied that at least I have the clean teeth look for now.</li>
            <li>My teeth were a little more sensitive</li>
            <li>Now I need to get new teeth trays.</li>
            <li>Will write a new review if i see it working &amp;#34;so good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The delivered item actually only has 4 Syringes of Gel, and does not have a White LED Light included at all.  </li>
            <li>For safety reason, I follow the instruction given and apply it for the shortest duration necessary (10 minutes with the light on daily).</li>
            <li>I want super white teeth just as much as the next fool, but I ain&#x27;t sticking \\&quot;who-know&#x27;s-what-made-in-China-by-some-half-rate-pharma-co-employing-slave-labor\\&quot; into my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I am determined to get glow in the dark super whiteeeeeeeeee teeth!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make my teeth very sensitive like I thought it might.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive teeth and have had problems with a lot of pain from the dentist whitening gels.  </li>
            <li>Usually I can use as many consecutive whitestrips as I want, but this caused some aching, which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>They may be more expensive but they are worth it!</li>
            <li>Used a small portion of the teeth shade guide, folded it up, and placed it under the battery cover so as to apply more pressure to the batteries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done two back to back 45 minute sessions and still did not see significant changes.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised by the unbelieveable results!  </li>
            <li>wow!  </li>
            <li>However, the enclosed light (the main reason I purchased the kit) was totally DEAD when I got it.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t figured out the light yet since I am using trays my dentist provided previously.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m being super careful.</li>
            <li>So far, I have only used the kit 5 times and so far did not finish up the first tube yet.</li>
            <li>Anyone having trouble with the light should try it before buying a new one or demanding a refund.</li>
            <li>My gums are bright red when previously they were pink.</li>
            <li>They are super sensitive and have white tissue by the teeth and when I brush that white goes away and is replaced by bleeding gums</li>
            <li>Hard not to keep some of the jell from touching your gums.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have seen an big improvement in the whiteness of my teeth in general.</li>
            <li>The included mouthguard is too flimsy and clearly of inferior quality.</li>
            <li>I have used this product sparingly, not every day, because I don&#x27;t want my teeth to become sensitive.</li>
            <li>It was really too big for my mouth and the edges cut into my gums.</li>
            <li>and I believe I will be able to come up at least 3 shades whiter.</li>
            <li>We bought this product to whiten our teeth obviously and it seems to do the job very well.</li>
            <li>My advice is to save up and go get your teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural grinder when I go to bed.</li>
            <li>so I sent the whole thing back.  </li>
            <li>I really am amazed because I have only used it 3xs for about 25 minutes each.</li>
            <li>My option is either try this teeth whitening product or get the professional dental whitening.</li>
            <li>I was hoping the gel would get into the grooves of my teeth, but so far I don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li>Asian product manufacturers produce very distinctive product images - crappy.    </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any adult wishing to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li>and no I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I used it with the light for 30 min at a time before bed a few times per week.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews online of this product and people with sensitive teeth not having problems I figured I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I had to pay $295 to get the tooth fixed again.</li>
            <li>Start by going light and use a few times a week.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and the product doesn&#x27;t hurt me at all...</li>
            <li>Only thing i didint like about it is that there is no experiation date on it, other than that it was fine.</li>
            <li>Right now my upper teeth is a different color as lower teeth.</li>
            <li>Similar whitening treatments preformed at dental offices can cost anywhere from $100-$300 per treatment, and they use the EXACT same ingredients and applicators.  </li>
            <li>I held it for five seconds like it said, no longer no less.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived this morning, didn&#x27;t took too long to arrive, i used it like for 25-30 minutes, i never had a pearly white smile i hope to reach that level with this product</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time for 8 minutes (careful, it will burn your gums) and immediately noticed</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I expected in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Granted, I don&#x27;t leave it on very long but it really works and at the price it&#x27;s offered at</li>
            <li>A couple warnings for people interested in buying, when you are molding your tray, do not leave it in the boiling water longer than a couple seconds, I left mine in to long</li>
            <li>I would only place the tooth tray in the boiling water for only 2-4 seconds so it wasn&#x27;t curling up so much before I placed in my mouth.</li>
            <li>It really works better than the expensive $300 kits at the dentists office.  </li>
            <li>The price was right, the product works, made my gums a little sensitive.  </li>
            <li>once I popped the trays into my mouth my gums burned like no other</li>
            <li>However , other than that I felt that it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>I odered some previous teeth whitening products from this sight and none worked, but when i got this I used right away.</li>
            <li>overall i give 3.5 stars because it did actually whiten my teeth, but just not dramatic enough</li>
            <li>I finish up with a regular toothbrush and toothpaste made for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I use professional white strips -</li>
            <li>but i naturally do have white teeth</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the 3d crest intensive professional whitening strips to see how that works.</li>
            <li>And numb for a good twenty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did a little research to see what dentists use and what percentage, and this falls right in line with this</li>
            <li>The bottom tray extended past my gum line, but a quick pass with a mini razor blade solved that problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bleach also seems much stronger than other brands and has a tendency to burn my gums.</li>
            <li>The instructions clearly state to be careful not to apply to gums or sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can see why a dentist would normally use this -- if left too long on your gums, it can bleach and burn them.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I did not receive any mouthpieces with my order and the blue-light flashlight crapped out pretty quick too.</li>
            <li>is, the LICENSED DDS can buy what the general public can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>only due to if I fill the trays it will really give me zingers) then slide a tray in to prevent the gel getting on any tissue.</li>
            <li>It irritated mine on the first few uses but after a week of use the irritation ceased.</li>
            <li>They can be tricky molding as they get very flimsy and I followed directions on molding them very carefully and one still folded up on me thus making treatment more difficult.</li>
            <li>Within the first week, actually the few days of use, the discoloration is noticeably gone.</li>
            <li>I went too heavy on the first application and had to take several days off for my gums to heal.  </li>
            <li>I could probably go a little longer but did notice a few &amp;#34;zings&amp;#34; after doing it for 4 days in a row ( they were very mild</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was skeptical when I saw such a high % teeth whitener at such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Overall, not impressed with it, and I&#x27;d just caution you that it&#x27;s very important to follow the procedure and wipe off your gums.  </li>
            <li>It was hard to keep them in for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>first of all when i tried to mold my teeth to the mouthpeice it totally mess up, it didnt fit right at all to my teeth, Second of all when i was on the first step of the bleaching process it completly bleached horribly on my teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Could be a good product, but the usability is bad enough you&#x27;d never know.</li>

            <li> Move on with your day kind folks of Amazon...and caveat emptor to all!!</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening system works very good.</li>
            <li> This is as good as what the dentists use; Just use it with causion keeping it off your gums, cheeks and lips best you can using a mouth guard that fits your teeth perfectly.</li>
            <li> My teeth were perfect for prom and I look wonderful with a perfect smile to go with my dress.</li>

            <li> Works Great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> use a 0.63% Stannous Fluoride Rinse (MedActiveÂ®) every night, and take exceptionally great care of both my teeth and gums to ensure optimal oral health.  </li>
            <li> But it works great.</li>
            <li> lol  </li>
            <li> Whitener works great.</li>
            <li> I am getting great results with it, as my teeth&lt;</li>
            <li> My friend saw my great results and is now using&lt;br /&gt;it.</li>
            <li> Great deal.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already received comments that my teeth look great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great gel, and is very strong!</li>
            <li> Just wanted to post about the non existant pain, if this works it will be AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Whitens nicely !!! :)</li>
            <li> but I still see a remarkable improvement.</li>
            <li> This item is very good in keeping the teeth looking better.  </li>
            <li> It is VERY strong!</li>
            <li> We ordered these because we did the one at the kiosk in the San Antonio Mall (bleach bright).</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> but you would be wise to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Licensed Dentist buys &amp; uses a Teeth Bleaching/Lightening product &amp; patients are delighted with the results.</li>
            <li> Does just as good as strips with a lower cost.</li>
            <li> and this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product, and I saw a difference within 3 days, but I don&#x27;t put the gel in the tray.</li>
            <li> I got some results but not as good as I</li>
            <li> This was definately a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I found the gel itself worked just as good.</li>
            <li> I have been shopping around for a good teeth whitener set</li>
            <li> I think this will be good for 50-60 applications.</li>
            <li> The results are as good as the $350-$750 charged by the pros.</li>
            <li> I love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product. :)</li>
            <li> Works great, but make sure to keep it off your gums.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just a real strong mixture or something.</li>
            <li> She will probably be getting more from you!</li>
            <li> I found it to work better then the dentist office product!</li>
            <li> Although they&#x27;d make sure your teeth are clean and can benefit from this the best.  </li>
            <li> Great price for a strong whitener.  </li>
            <li> Is cheap but great ...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Whitening was amazing.  </li>
            <li> It did effectively whiten my teeth</li>
            <li> I will never try another kind again.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I saw noticeable results after 2 nights.</li>
            <li> but I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any sensitivity either which was a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit as a gift for my sister and tried the gel in my own bleach tray.</li>
            <li> and he was impressed with the quality if this system, and it came so fast</li>
            <li> Not an effective whitener, will not be reordering</li>
            <li> Is kind of a pain to do.</li>
            <li> If you are the type of person that if one is good, than two must be better, you will burn your gums.  </li>
            <li> kind of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> if you want the gel to be effective so spend the time on it.</li>
            <li> I normally have excellent gums.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I think this kind works better.</li>
            <li> This works, very strong whitening gel.</li>
            <li> I recommend having a professional mouth guard made just for your teeth (to keep the gel off your gums, cheeks, and lips best).  </li>
            <li> But still with 10 syringes, and the price, this is still BY FAR the best bang for your buck product.</li>
            <li> If you have professional trays, this is an excellent use for them.  </li>
            <li> To strong!  </li>
            <li> Very very strong stuff, make sure to wipe off your gums or it&#x27;ll hurt after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two very important tips;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price for the strips was very high and the reviews not that great.</li>
            <li> works better than the dentist version</li>
            <li> Thanks for all of the great deals on amazon.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was pleased with results.</li>
            <li> works well wish I had more trays I messed up one of the trays when I was fitting it</li>
            <li> so we decided to order some more of the gel.</li>
            <li> Ok ,so it foams that because its whitening your teeth,and I wasn&#x27;t foaming at the mouth.</li>
            <li> Payed more and got a name brand from the dentist . . .</li>
            <li> Would recommend and buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> it has served me well for many years.  </li>
            <li> Why do I have to use soo many word in my feedback,is this a school?</li>
            <li> I wish I was able to do this more often.  </li>
            <li> I will continue with more care</li>
            <li> Get a brand that is more well known.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the product itself and the amount of proper tools provided with it.</li>
            <li> I returned that and ordered two more because my wife wanted one and</li>
            <li> I actually just put this product inside my invisaligns and it works great!  </li>
            <li> I cant stop smiling:):)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more lightening as I continue to use the gel.</li>
            <li> 5 uses later and its still perfect.</li>
            <li> This could be because I haven&#x27;t been able to keep the product on for more than 5 minutes at a time.  </li>
            <li> How many truly American-made products do that?  </li>
            <li> I want to be able to know who is accountable when I start spitting up blood.    </li>
            <li> Probably the best deal for a whitening kit, but I would advise getting a different mouth peice mold.</li>
            <li> I wish you were able to give no stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looks like I have to search for a better mouth tray.</li>
            <li> I was able to get 3-31/2 applications out of a syringe.</li>
            <li> It was fantastic!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try this one more time</li>
            <li> glad I did.</li>
            <li> Probably at this strength needs to be supervised or you just have to know what your doing better than myself.</li>
            <li> Go for a more gradual result with a lower % of peroxide and SAVE YOUR GUMS.</li>
            <li> I was able to have wrapped for Xmas no probs at all</li>
            <li> I have had whitening products for many years.  </li>
            <li> (My maltest found them, and had her way with them, hence I needed to get some more)  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to achieve my goal in 4 treatments.</li>
            <li> When the wound heals, I will purchase whitening strips and do it the safe, old-fashioned way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Iv always tried the strips and they are just WAYYYYY more comfortable then the tray!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product from this vendor for 3 years now and love it.</li>
            <li> :  make sure you get the teeth trays well fitted to your teeth.</li>
            <li> The Product is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Product is so strong it burnt the top of my mouth and gums and had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t look like a rabie dog and way more important so you can be able to remain  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the gel works fine.</li>
            <li> Our teeth are significantly whiter, brighter and we both feel more confident with our smiles as a result.  </li>
            <li> The company claims to be Made in the USA, which is always a great feeling, and a great way to support small, growing businesses in the United States.  </li>
            <li> Whitens teeth better than the strips and is much more economical.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Maybe my teeth are too tea stained to be easily whitened, but this just didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.  </li>
            <li> but you can easily tell my teeth look brighter after ONE use</li>
            <li> It warns you about the strong gel.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think at all that its too strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong.</li>
            <li> I think the solution is too strong and the trays let it leak onto the gums, causing the burns.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong taste when it leaks out of the tray, but I have never have gotten my gums or tongue burnt from the product.</li>
            <li> Product is strong</li>
            <li> Too strong for my teeth.</li>
            <li> DO YOU GET A GOOD HIGH END PRODUCT</li>
            <li> teeth looked amazing after the first use.</li>
            <li> Beautiful white teeth!</li>
            <li> Fine, but</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it works fine.</li>
            <li> There are 10 tubes of strong gel, trays and a mini light.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to receive the kit so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have used many products from the dentist and have my own trays so this isn&#x27;t a new venture for me.  </li>
            <li> My teeth is nice and white, Love it!</li>
            <li> my first try and so far so good, not an ounce of pain!</li>
            <li> I saw HUGE improvement immediately.</li>
            <li> Did not get the LED light accelerator...</li>
            <li> Is there any way to fit them</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this item for the last 5 months twice a week and get great results.</li>
            <li> and you look like a goof with the light</li>
            <li> ALL IN  ALL INCLUDED WAS A LIGHT ACTIVATOR, JUST LIKE WHEN</li>
            <li> (even without the LED light</li>
            <li> I spend 30 minutes going through steps 1 and 2 and when I got to step 3, the light didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how you would fit it and</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the money!!!</li>
            <li> I get many complaments on my smile that I never got before</li>
            <li> and I ve received so many compliments about my smile.</li>
            <li> The light works</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the light they provide, and have no way of knowing if it helps at all, but I guess it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> but I have not tried the &amp;#34;Blue Light &amp;#34;part of the process yet as it is not confimed at what time of the process I should be doing that.</li>
            <li> Her teeth went from brown to a light yellowish color within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The light does help and over all</li>
            <li> no instructions and the light piece doesn&#x27;t seem to fit once you have the trays in.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> product is great and use it daily and works like a charm!  </li>
            <li> so I spit those out and just put the stuff on my teeth and the light in my mouth.</li>
            <li> im not quite sure if its really worth waiting for.</li>
            <li> but anyways with or without the LED light</li>
            <li> (because they must shrink to perfectly fit your teeth) and then place them in your teeth and press so they mold to the shape of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as a professional whitening but the results are still noticeable.</li>
            <li> Very nice job, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and shows quick results.</li>
            <li> Also be sure to have Sensodyne BEFORE your first treatment to aid with the sensitivity while your enamel restores.</li>
            <li> Using it in front under my lower lip and top lip and under my tongue and they are getting soaked pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I would love to try some more, but without being able to return, if they are the same quality, I would just be wasting time and money.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant change.  </li>
            <li> I have whitened my teeth successfully with inexpensive, generic whitening strips, but I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> This is worth buying!</li>
            <li> I recommended it to my 21 year old son and he was impressed how white his teeth had gotten.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s got REALLY clean teeth, but no lighter.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic, can&#x27;t say enough good things, would buy it again.</li>
            <li> But if your teeth are clean, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It seems like an effective cheaper alternative based on reviews, but I have not used it much because my jaw hurt for over a week after the first two uses.  </li>
            <li> I am calling Cool Teeth Whitening and demanding a refund.</li>
            <li> It does the job nice and clear.</li>
            <li> Overall, this turned out to be a good experience.</li>
            <li> better than before, it&#x27;s much stronger, note-</li>
            <li> so i couldn&#x27;t decide if it is actually working so good as described.</li>
            <li> I was all ready to just write it off as a loss if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago I used a 30% Carbamide Peroxide product supplied my dentist daily for 8 weeks with good results and no sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time that is about the only thing good about this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> teeth are not bad but they aren&#x27;t the whitest.</li>
            <li> Bottom tooth tray ended up folding over and doesn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li> Used first time for about 15 minutes and could easily see a difference.  </li>
            <li> But for the price, this is a far more effective product than any of the over commercialized, highly diluted, &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; retail whiteners (CrestÂ®, ColgateÂ®, LISTERINEÂ®) that cost anywhere from $40-$100 per treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have the best looking smile I have ever had in my life due to this product, and absolutely suggest it if you want a glowing smile and don&#x27;t want to spend 100</li>
            <li> and It has made a tremendous difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a tremendous bargain and value.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have used so many products &amp; smoked for 17 years and finally I can see my teeth getting whiter!</li>
            <li> Worked quickly.  </li>
            <li> quick to mold it to your mouth.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s amazing, the only thing i can complain about is that the Led Light didn&#x27;t turned on maybe i should change the batteries</li>
            <li> and  it was super</li>
            <li> I am a very handy person and followed the instructions very carefully.  </li>
            <li> I saw results with the very first treatment.</li>
            <li> The light takes so much pressure to hold on that your thumb or fingers can get carpal!</li>
            <li> This Gel came with more syringes filled with more gel than the others, however the formula seems to be the same and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this gel before and as the last time the whitening is consistent and good.  </li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t realize how easy it was to put too much solution in the tray.  </li>
            <li> The thermo-form trays are easy to heat and mold in your mouth; the syringes are easy to open and apply the gel to the inside of said tray; and the LED light works as designed.  </li>
            <li> Very effective, but be careful not to put too much in the retainer; if it overflows and gets on your gums, it&#x27;ll hurt quite a bit and the contacted area of flesh will turn bright white for a day or so!</li>
            <li> Use it sparingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product with above average to good results.</li>
            <li> It is strong, so I have only been able to put it on my teeth for 8 min.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant but works great.</li>
            <li> They work well and the light really accellerates the cleaning process.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how much the light helps, but I&#x27;m not getting it anymore.</li>
            <li> What I did was put some of the gel directly on my teeth and a added bit more within the trays and had NOooo problems.</li>
            <li> No it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> so your jaw is in a more natural position?  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to enhance my smile during those in between times.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> gums\\&quot;, I was kind of expecting it but not only</li>
            <li> This whitener is powerful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is FAR and away better than the store bought stuff that I used.</li>
            <li> No change in brightness of my smile.</li>
            <li> Let me be clear that I do not have any dental problems and my teeth are in healthy condition.</li>
            <li> This kit was definately worth it.</li>
            <li> I went from yellowed to brilliant white in only 2 syringes.</li>
            <li> it skeptics,it was worth the 20$ or so to get it to</li>
            <li> It has given me confidence to smile again.</li>
            <li> My teeth were kind of white to begin with</li>
            <li> On her free time she uses the Plus White gel, and both morning and night she brushes her teeth with a fluoride toothpaste and puts the whitening booster on top of it.</li>
            <li> There is a link to the [...] website where a better instruction sheet with pictures and alternate purchasing options are available.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST if you have any tint to your smile.</li>
            <li> This is one of the easiest, cheapest, most natural way to improve your appearance.</li>
            <li> Inside the bag, nothing is marked cool teeth whitening and the instructions have an Easy Whitening logo on them.</li>
            <li> Strong and effective, may be too strong and cause some minor burning to the gum line if left on the full amount of time suggested.</li>
            <li> The trays I had were very thin and fit perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I have developed the yellowish brown discoloration of my front teeth from consuming much coffee, tea and cola, despite normal good dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> I realized that the mouth pieces included were kind of pointless and didn&#x27;t fit even after boiling them to loosen the material they&#x27;re made out of and then placing them into your mouth to form fit them.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t see results right away.  </li>
            <li> My coworker noticed right away &amp; asked to see my teeth .</li>
            <li> Whitens well and the price was right.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why you must follow the instructions the right way</li>
            <li> The product worked great the first few months.</li>
            <li> The trays are not a custom fit, but once on keeping a small washcloth if not your tongue will keep them in place for 30-45 mins and wa-la your teeth look good.</li>
            <li> give this product my full support, and hope the company is able to improve packaging in the future.  </li>
            <li> This one is The most pure and powerful and doesnt make my teeth sting and feel sensitive.</li>
            <li> actual chemical turns into what I call super peroxide (ha), be sure not to over apply to the trays before putting them in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> My sister who is a dentist told me apparently you could keep redoing the teeth tray so it could better shape your teeth.</li>
            <li> Apparently longer use may have even better result, but I wouldn&#x27;t know if my teeth enamel can handle that.</li>
            <li> The UV light is finicky and has to be held with just the right pressure to emit a constant ray of light.  </li>
            <li> The instructions warn you about molding the trays right and keeping gel away from your gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got immediate results after first application.</li>
            <li> The kit really works and whitened my teeth quickly.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed more even color in my teeth, I recently quit smoking and was looking for a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> , however the price is VERY reasonable to try out.</li>
            <li> and the first one seemed to just melt very fast before I could even put it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This products makes your teeth whiter even after first use.</li>
            <li> But I noticed a difference in the first use.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are considerably more white.</li>
            <li> I used this one for 15 minutes at first.</li>
            <li> (instructions say 15-30 mins the first time you use it).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve encountered that makes my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly...</li>
            <li> I did it again by putting it in hot water and it shrank up.</li>
            <li> I applied to my teeth using the syringe and then spread using a q-tip exactly where needed, and put the trays on.</li>
            <li> Even the first time I used it noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I give this a try first.</li>
            <li> Before you use the mouth trays the first time, you&#x27;re supposed to dip them in hot water and shape them to your mouth.  </li>
            <li> So I thought my fellow Amazonians should be aware of what you see here, because you don&#x27;t quite know what your sticking into your mouth if you buy this product.    </li>
            <li> FIRST:  </li>
            <li> Depending on how much you use!</li>
            <li> i put 3 stars for now because im not using it yet,it says there can&#x27;t use for nursing mom so better to wait next month after i stop breastfeed</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It works the first time it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s any better or faster than white strips, but it is cheaper.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used this product it worked well, but after a week my teeth would hurt even if I would just breathe through my mouth.</li>
            <li> So this was my first time using an at home kit</li>
            <li> My first time using it</li>
            <li> It was a better idea to use a mouthpiece I later got from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First of all for $22</li>
            <li> I had first tried a tube of whitening gel from walmart.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Bought this kit two weeks ago and both myself and partner are AMAZED at how fast the whitening agent works!  </li>
            <li> I have used the product 5 times now, carefully following instructions, but I have never been able to make it up to the recommended 20-30 minute whitening time.  </li>
            <li> I first tried with the trays but they kept gagging me</li>
            <li> This product will MOST DEFINITELY produce results.</li>
            <li> I understand that the super high % of peroxide is advertised</li>
            <li> I recieved this product today, the light DOES NOT work even with new batteries and it makes me very unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> The syringes and other pieces were not in any kind of sealed package.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 15 different teeth whitening systems and this works best.  </li>
            <li> Based on the number of positive reviews, I knew the product was legit.</li>
            <li> can be pretty intense zinger if you leave on longer.  </li>
            <li> What I received was a clear plastic bag with a sticker on it that said cool teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the first two tries on my upper teeth but the third fit quite well.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of using too much the first time and it seeped out of the trays.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve had this in for 15 minutes (going the full 30)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead, I take the gel, and do a very LIGHT amount into the tray, where the flat part meets the side wall right in the corner,  all the way around the top and bottom, Once you insert it into your mouth, pucker your gums tight, as this will get the gel all over the teeth</li>
            <li> But like the other reviews, it is very STRONG.  </li>
            <li> this could be somehow due to user error, I wish the instructions for fitting the mouthpieces were more specific.  </li>
            <li> I had Easy White done by cosmetic dentist at cost of $500.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This makes me think that the solution is very effective but that I&#x27;ll need to be very, very careful the next time I use the trays.  </li>
            <li> probably wishful thinking on my part, as I kept the trays in so briefly--but certainly my gums were whiter.  </li>
            <li> There are 10 large whitening gel tubes in this kit.</li>
            <li> They stay nice and tightly suctioned to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> thanks again.</li>
            <li> didnt work as fast as they stated</li>
            <li> WHITE LED LIGHT INCLUDED&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it caused them to blister and bleed, very tender and sore for days...</li>
            <li> My dentist does (1) free whitening a year along with being an established patient &amp; with regular cleanings.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t notice much whitening compared to strip products, but perhaps my salvaged molds were just off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The whole roof of my mouth was burned, teeth hurt for two days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had anything burn quite as much before.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only downside was the light, which stopped working properly after 1 use.</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> The results are real, your teeth will get whiter, however, as the COO of an oral care and relief company, please use caution when using this product.  </li>
            <li> this teeth whitening kit really works.</li>
            <li> I tried fitting the trays (followed the instructions carefully.)</li>
            <li> This comes with so much gel, id say 30- 40 uses.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediate improvement in my teeth and am very pleased&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a whole bunch of the whitening jel too.</li>
            <li> Sometimes DIY mouth trays don&#x27;t remelt and remold very well, but I had no problems with this one.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> It really works, but you just have to be very carefull with your gums.</li>
            <li> Just too much for my teeth to take.  </li>
            <li> For those complaining about the burning sensation: you put too much in the tray and got it on your gums.</li>
            <li> it really works!I didnt even use the light.try</li>
            <li> I used this product for 7 days straight.</li>
            <li> I could reasonably see a difference within that week.</li>
            <li> Not as much to say.</li>
            <li> I think this happened because I put too much whitener in the mouth piece and when I place it over my teeth the gel came out.</li>
            <li> People need to understand that teeth whitening is not an overnight process, and depending on the severity of the staining, it will take anywhere from 2-8 weeks (though some people will see results faster) before you really start to glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The should give you a second set since they are just cheap plastic anyway and probably cost .05 cents to make each one ??  </li>
            <li> This stuff works really well....</li>
            <li> Be ready to jimmyrig some stuff though...</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> Using the cheap whitening trays, even with molding to my teeth and trimming to be below my gum line, there is no way to keep the gel entirely off of my gums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once so far and noticed a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> Now I feel very hesitant to use it and just might throw it way.</li>
            <li> 30-40 min with the tray because i think i used way too much gel and saliva</li>
            <li> I am excited because the results are almost instant and that was just with 10 minutes..</li>
            <li> I could tell a big difference on  first appication, and even more on the second appication.  </li>
            <li> I used this gel 3 times with the trays the first day with maybe 1shade difference, then I used it the next day, 3 times with my blue led light mouth piece!</li>
            <li> After a week, the shine of the front teeth has returned and my teeth look clean and brushed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a percentage quite higher than even what we (the public) get through Amazon, Brite Smile (44% Carbamide Peroxide).&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very soft, and is dual action, meaning you can do top and bottom at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only 4 syringes in and my teeth are significantly whiter, definitely more so than any other whitening product I have tried!</li>
            <li> First day back, my gums burned right away.</li>
            <li> This product worked right after first use (Specks of white were all over my teeth).</li>
            <li> But this&lt;br /&gt;product works much better than the other whitening tray products!</li>
            <li> I have used many different whitening products...typically the white strips...</li>
            <li> It is strong so be careful when putting the gel on because it will burn your gums.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for those who would like their teeth get whitened .</li>
            <li> i highly recommend getting this item</li>
            <li> I completely FREAKED out and was on the verge of tears thinking this product had just ruined my gums!!</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> The molding was so easy to do judt submerge in just boiled water for 4 seconds and to my surprise they were not hot when I took the impressionsof my teeth.</li>
            <li> have high hopes for this product, so hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to increase my star rating in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After, insert the top and bottom mouth guards and affix whitening light under the upper and lower lip for at least 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Now I can smile again and not be too concerned that people are staring at my once yellow teeth.</li>
            <li> I used the whitening light the first few times but found it didn&#x27;t speed up the process</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you have sensitive teeth, because that tooth will become more sensitive for a while.</li>
            <li> I had zoom done at dental office and this product has kept my smile white!!!</li>
            <li> Alas, they are also so sensitive that I can&#x27;t use this as much as I need too for good results.</li>
            <li> If you screw up in forming them, which is pretty easy to do, there&#x27;s really no going back.</li>
            <li> I received item very quickly and packed carefully and with  complete directions.  </li>
            <li> word of caution, even using the right amount results in only 4-5 uses per syringe.  </li>
            <li> ; so you don&#x27;t screwed it like i did for not following the right way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied that at least I have the clean teeth look for now.</li>
            <li> My teeth were a little more sensitive</li>
            <li> Now I need to get new teeth trays.</li>
            <li> Will write a new review if i see it working &amp;#34;so good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The delivered item actually only has 4 Syringes of Gel, and does not have a White LED Light included at all.  </li>
            <li> For safety reason, I follow the instruction given and apply it for the shortest duration necessary (10 minutes with the light on daily).</li>
            <li> I want super white teeth just as much as the next fool, but I ain&#x27;t sticking \\&quot;who-know&#x27;s-what-made-in-China-by-some-half-rate-pharma-co-employing-slave-labor\\&quot; into my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I am determined to get glow in the dark super whiteeeeeeeeee teeth!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my teeth very sensitive like I thought it might.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive teeth and have had problems with a lot of pain from the dentist whitening gels.  </li>
            <li> Usually I can use as many consecutive whitestrips as I want, but this caused some aching, which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> They may be more expensive but they are worth it!</li>
            <li> Used a small portion of the teeth shade guide, folded it up, and placed it under the battery cover so as to apply more pressure to the batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done two back to back 45 minute sessions and still did not see significant changes.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised by the unbelieveable results!  </li>
            <li> wow!  </li>
            <li> However, the enclosed light (the main reason I purchased the kit) was totally DEAD when I got it.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t figured out the light yet since I am using trays my dentist provided previously.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m being super careful.</li>
            <li> So far, I have only used the kit 5 times and so far did not finish up the first tube yet.</li>
            <li> Anyone having trouble with the light should try it before buying a new one or demanding a refund.</li>
            <li> My gums are bright red when previously they were pink.</li>
            <li> They are super sensitive and have white tissue by the teeth and when I brush that white goes away and is replaced by bleeding gums</li>
            <li> Hard not to keep some of the jell from touching your gums.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have seen an big improvement in the whiteness of my teeth in general.</li>
            <li> The included mouthguard is too flimsy and clearly of inferior quality.</li>
            <li> I have used this product sparingly, not every day, because I don&#x27;t want my teeth to become sensitive.</li>
            <li> It was really too big for my mouth and the edges cut into my gums.</li>
            <li> and I believe I will be able to come up at least 3 shades whiter.</li>
            <li> We bought this product to whiten our teeth obviously and it seems to do the job very well.</li>
            <li> My advice is to save up and go get your teeth professionally whitened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural grinder when I go to bed.</li>
            <li> so I sent the whole thing back.  </li>
            <li> I really am amazed because I have only used it 3xs for about 25 minutes each.</li>
            <li> My option is either try this teeth whitening product or get the professional dental whitening.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the gel would get into the grooves of my teeth, but so far I don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> Asian product manufacturers produce very distinctive product images - crappy.    </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any adult wishing to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> and no I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I used it with the light for 30 min at a time before bed a few times per week.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews online of this product and people with sensitive teeth not having problems I figured I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I had to pay $295 to get the tooth fixed again.</li>
            <li> Start by going light and use a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and the product doesn&#x27;t hurt me at all...</li>
            <li> Only thing i didint like about it is that there is no experiation date on it, other than that it was fine.</li>
            <li> Right now my upper teeth is a different color as lower teeth.</li>
            <li> Similar whitening treatments preformed at dental offices can cost anywhere from $100-$300 per treatment, and they use the EXACT same ingredients and applicators.  </li>
            <li> I held it for five seconds like it said, no longer no less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived this morning, didn&#x27;t took too long to arrive, i used it like for 25-30 minutes, i never had a pearly white smile i hope to reach that level with this product</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time for 8 minutes (careful, it will burn your gums) and immediately noticed</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I expected in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Granted, I don&#x27;t leave it on very long but it really works and at the price it&#x27;s offered at</li>
            <li> A couple warnings for people interested in buying, when you are molding your tray, do not leave it in the boiling water longer than a couple seconds, I left mine in to long</li>
            <li> I would only place the tooth tray in the boiling water for only 2-4 seconds so it wasn&#x27;t curling up so much before I placed in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It really works better than the expensive $300 kits at the dentists office.  </li>
            <li> The price was right, the product works, made my gums a little sensitive.  </li>
            <li> once I popped the trays into my mouth my gums burned like no other</li>
            <li> However , other than that I felt that it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I odered some previous teeth whitening products from this sight and none worked, but when i got this I used right away.</li>
            <li> overall i give 3.5 stars because it did actually whiten my teeth, but just not dramatic enough</li>
            <li> I finish up with a regular toothbrush and toothpaste made for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I use professional white strips -</li>
            <li> but i naturally do have white teeth</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the 3d crest intensive professional whitening strips to see how that works.</li>
            <li> And numb for a good twenty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did a little research to see what dentists use and what percentage, and this falls right in line with this</li>
            <li> The bottom tray extended past my gum line, but a quick pass with a mini razor blade solved that problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bleach also seems much stronger than other brands and has a tendency to burn my gums.</li>
            <li> The instructions clearly state to be careful not to apply to gums or sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can see why a dentist would normally use this -- if left too long on your gums, it can bleach and burn them.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not receive any mouthpieces with my order and the blue-light flashlight crapped out pretty quick too.</li>
            <li> is, the LICENSED DDS can buy what the general public can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> only due to if I fill the trays it will really give me zingers) then slide a tray in to prevent the gel getting on any tissue.</li>
            <li> It irritated mine on the first few uses but after a week of use the irritation ceased.</li>
            <li> They can be tricky molding as they get very flimsy and I followed directions on molding them very carefully and one still folded up on me thus making treatment more difficult.</li>
            <li> Within the first week, actually the few days of use, the discoloration is noticeably gone.</li>
            <li> I went too heavy on the first application and had to take several days off for my gums to heal.  </li>
            <li> I could probably go a little longer but did notice a few &amp;#34;zings&amp;#34; after doing it for 4 days in a row ( they were very mild</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical when I saw such a high % teeth whitener at such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Overall, not impressed with it, and I&#x27;d just caution you that it&#x27;s very important to follow the procedure and wipe off your gums.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to keep them in for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> first of all when i tried to mold my teeth to the mouthpeice it totally mess up, it didnt fit right at all to my teeth, Second of all when i was on the first step of the bleaching process it completly bleached horribly on my teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Could be a good product, but the usability is bad enough you&#x27;d never know.</li>
            <li> Not only did I follow the very few directions that were provided exactly.</li>
            <li> The gel burned the sensitive areas of my gums, and left them raw and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of using it religiously for 25-30 mins twice a day, i found it did make my teeth whiter...but only like half a shade whiter, and the fact that my teeth gets very sensitive every time i use it...</li>
            <li> Found out it was just the batteries (flat, watch type) weren&#x27;t contacting the terminals properly.</li>
            <li> I use a cotton ball I stretch out and put between my upper and one between my lower lip and teeth to prevent drool, then I apply the gel with a plastic nail cuticle tool (Its end is flat and is about the size of my teeth) to my teeth(fronts</li>
            <li> , YOU GET ENOUGH TO TO KEEP YOUR TEETH WHITE FOR A LONG TIME.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean yes i had results and very fast, but it left my gums basically throbing</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used as much as recommended, just a small amount.</li>
            <li> gel goes a long way if you use just enough.</li>
            <li> There is a key to this: Regular everyday people, professional or not, cannot buy what the DDS uses.</li>
            <li> These will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many teeth whitening strips in the past and have only gotten poor results.</li>
            <li> Directions not very clear on procedure and mouthguards are cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting a reminarilizing gel because it does make your teeth a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> very little discomfort, no increase in sensitivity, but WOW 3-4 shades whiter already!!</li>
            <li> The bleach squirts out too quickly and you end up wasting at least half a syringe every time.</li>
            <li> systems\\&quot;, is a scam, and a mighty expensive one.</li>
            <li> so fortunately I think I may have avoided an expensive trip to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> this made no real difference in how white my teeth are, yes I followed the directions...</li>
            <li> Tries another Brand, same results...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a few shades difference in just a few weeks and am still on my first syringe.  </li>
            <li> A little tricky at first, but if you brush the gel on you teeth in a thin layer between the teeth and near the gum line *</li>
            <li> Let me say that the whitening gel is fantastic, however the trays are very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> the plastic didn&#x27;t retain its shape very well, and the awkward fit made me drool excessively.  </li>
            <li> My upper gums, where a small amount of gel had gotten, were burning, turned white, and starting to bleed.</li>
            <li> It was only a little bit after that I tried the second, so I doubt the water \\&quot;cooled off\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have white teeth but between teeth on my bottom can get a little yellow and this has taken care of that</li>
            <li> just like every other teeth whitening gel, do not get it on your gums, and this is very simple if you will fallow my instructions.</li>
            <li> But, having had very little success with over-the-counter whiteners in the past, I was still skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, after weeks of use, I am still not getting that pearly white color which is commonly seen when treated professionally.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that something with this price tag would actually accomplish anything but for $20 bucks or so, it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you keep using the stuff, after a single syringe your gums don&#x27;t even feel overfill anymore.</li>
            <li> The trays immediately didn&#x27;t form the right way (I followed directions to a T) rendering the entire kit useless.</li>
            <li> This product causes some small concern as to the origin of manufacture and lack of ingredient labeling directly on the product (contents are listed on an instruction sheet that comes in the box).</li>
            <li> Well today I woke up and everywhere that my gums where white after bleaching, the skin had peeled off and is now raw and red</li>
            <li> it started tingling a little and then, slowly got hot and hotter all in about 4-5 min.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to think you can only get that fake white teeth look from getting it done professionally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE- The white gums I previously mentioned after using?</li>
            <li> This way, you save your gums and you use much less product but get the same effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> Quick results but a little sloppy.  </li>
            <li> We both agreed that the gel is the most painful thing on earth and turned our gums white and even caused slight gingival recession.</li>
            <li> Each morning I put a little 44% in both upper and lower molded mouthpieces, and while I shower and shave my teeth are being whitened.</li>
            <li> Probably I&#x27;ll use a q-tip to use as little of the gel as possible until I can build up my tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> system came with a little blue LED mouth piece, which I didn&#x27;t use since the directions never mentioned it</li>
            <li> However I was very careful this time about biting down gently and slowly and adjusting the tray once it was in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It has that dull look like I have not brushed my teeth enough.</li>
            <li> I still have some left for my next whitening job which I do at least once</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awkward position for your jaw muscles to be in - it did not hurt initially, but my jaw became very sore the next day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the weaker stuff in the past and was dissatisfied, this product cuts through the grey tint, and yellow staining from the tetracycline I used as a child.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t careful you will burn your gums.</li>
            <li> However, be careful of overfilling the trays.  </li>
            <li> sting your gums if you use too much, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this product works when you&#x27;re religious about doing it everyday.</li>
            <li> You also have to be careful when applying the gel&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> The DDS office uses Carbamide Peroxide, not available for &#x27;public&#x27; sale.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions carefully</li>
            <li> Any advertising that shows you a photo of a product in a plain vanilla box, and contains an American flag INSIDE of it is suspicious.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only down 2 syringes!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product a few times and have only noticed a slight difference in whitening.  </li>
            <li> I think next time I will try whitening strips - maybe they will be less messy.  </li>
            <li> I used it every other day for 1 week</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 20 minutes every other day for the past two weeks, and I have seen a big improvement.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want the gel to touch your gums, cheeks or lips or it will sting and turn those areas white for a day [not healthy].  </li>
            <li> You should use this 30 to 60 minutes a day, every other day or two until you reach your desired whiteness.  </li>
            <li> Be careful with the amount you use because it can cause irritation to the gum line, but to also help with that you can remodel your trays!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I have not had the issues with soar gums as others have stated.</li>
            <li> My daughter has some discoloration on her teeth for yrs now due to the asthma nebulizer meds.</li>
            <li> after I quit I decided to freshen up the obvious sign of the past.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this kit due to the price.  </li>
            <li> They are too big, and bulky for my small mouth.  </li>
            <li> Please use with extreme caution.  </li>
            <li> I could bear no more than 12 minutes the last time I used the product, and when I removed the tray in pain, I noticed a small wound/eroded area in the gum between my front teeth (the little area that naturally curves down slightly between the two teeth).  </li>
            <li> I followed the process on the instruction sheet - the gel worked but as others have indicated it burns quite a bit so be VERY careful of the amount you use.  </li>
            <li> After a single application my teeth were a few shades lighter and stayed that way for a while.</li>
            <li> If I had the spare money I would buy strips because at least I can talk and not spit constantly.</li>
            <li> so my english sucks</li>
            <li> However, be careful with the amount of gel used, mine spilled out onto my gums and burned them in a few spots.  </li>
            <li> After calming myself down, brushing my teeth and rinsing my mouth with COLD water 4 or 5 times (warm water was painful on my now sensitive gums)</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re careful about it (I use a little less gel than maybe I should)</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve basically filed down my teeth and my teeth are SO sensative.</li>
            <li> My teeth have gotten much whiter, but I must say it is very painful after the first few days...</li>
            <li> I used it while watching a tv show fro half an hour.  </li>
            <li> It probably costs less to make than the battery that needed to be replaced</li>
            <li> I would use again, but I would put less gel inside the mold.</li>
            <li> Literally, I have chucks of black rubber floating around in my whitening gel.</li>
            <li> and my teeth might be 1 slightly shade whitter.</li>
            <li> But the whitener does work and it is helpful in erasing previous signs of not taking care of your teeth.</li>
            <li> i like the product but the instructions are confusing and not clear as to what i should and shouldnt do.</li>
            <li> However, despite an expiration date of 12/15/2014 on the box, the black rubber on the plunger seal (I had to Google the part names of a syringe!) began to break down and suspend inside of the gel itself.</li>
            <li> it doesnt matter how little of the product you use whatever you do dont get this garbage on your gums.</li>
            <li> did it burn a little, the bleach went into my gums and I could feel it bubbling in the tray.</li>
            <li> Im extremely upset about this :/</li>
            <li> I have used this product every other day for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> After using the gel I noticed that a filling that I have was brittle and flaked a little.  </li>
            <li> It has whiten just a little in the two months I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I used it once and a little got on my gums</li>
            <li> Teeth do look a little whiter</li>
            <li> She has had no complaints on her gums burning, but I keep her on a strict regimen when it comes to brushing, so they could be a little sore.</li>
            <li> It can burn a little as others have mentioned</li>
            <li> This product seems to be helping, a little.</li>
            <li> boil a little bit of water, then put the trays inside the water just for like 4 seconds  </li>
            <li> After a couple uses I noticed my teeth were significantly brighter but that the whitener had chewed a painful small sore into the roof of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very confident this is legit.</li>
            <li> however, I did have a little trouble with the bottom mold.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes but was disappointed that I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them about twice a week for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> be careful not to get it on your gums though as will burn this delicate area</li>
            <li> and I tried it a few times.</li>
            <li> Received this a few weeks ago and feel it works as well as the whitening strips from crest.</li>
            <li> they killed mt gums leaving me recovering from blistered gums for a week.....</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Do this everyday for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel burned at first application and within a minute I had to remove the mouth piece because it was so painful.</li>
            <li> your&lt;br /&gt;mouth is raw.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money and dangerous for a novice to use.  </li>
            <li> Like I said directions a little confusing??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how often you can use it, weekly, twice a week, etc.</li>
            <li> The mere fact that they tout everywhere that it&#x27;s \\&quot;MADE IN USA\\&quot; - as though they have something to prove - is a red flag.    </li>
            <li> I have been using this product, 20-30 minutes, per night, for the past 5 nights.  </li>
            <li> The one that comes with this is a bit small.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product over two months ago, I thought since since it was stronger it would whiten my teeth faster than the whitening solution I usually use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the bleaching strips and trays sold over-the-counter, so I fully intended to go past a paltry two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone that puts a negative review on this product is either impatient, or has no idea what they are doing.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried because sensitivity is usually a problem for me, but I had no problem with that; even on my gums!</li>
            <li> The difference I have noticed in the past two weeks are like night and day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very messy too...</li>
            <li> After using countless boxes of whitestrips with extremely minimal results and hours of painful tooth sensitivity, I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews of this product and people complained about it irritating their gums.</li>
            <li> had no irritation like some folks did, pretty worthless purchase</li>
            <li> but instead gave my teeth a dull sort of starchy look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , i was a little confused by the instructions</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself a delicate creature, but this thing burned my gums like a mother.  </li>
            <li> teeth were at least a shade or two</li>
            <li> Also,  It sucks to sit and drool for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Also from shoddy dental work I have recieved&lt;br /&gt;over</li>
            <li> She has no health insurance, smokes over a pack a day, and drinks tea at least 5 times a day.</li>
            <li> Immediately after using the recommended amount of this product, my gums began to burn, and I was forced to spit out the product.  </li>
            <li> If you have an exposed nerve or enamel is thin, it will hurt for a few hours after your done.</li>
            <li> they will stinnnnggggg like your gums are eating away slowly..</li>
            <li> A little uncomfortable to wear</li>
            <li> The trays were a little difficult to form, the instructions were confusing/ 30 minutes to bleach plus 30 minutes to whiten?</li>
            <li> It does not taste bad, however, I only used it twice because my gums became swollen and irritated.</li>
            <li> My first use of this product was terrifying.</li>
            <li> Yet the day after my first use my gums were in terrible shape.</li>
            <li> Just poor quality control.</li>
            <li> Especially near the gum line, where the worst of the staining seemed to be.</li>
            <li> As a result, the treatments were exhausting</li>
            <li> The trays are absolutely the worst things ever.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I even tried rubbing vaseline on my gums before inserting the tray to prevent the gel from getting on my gums and causing worse irritation.  </li>
            <li> Even breathing with my mouth open hurts really bad when it&#x27;s cold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see if I can find other trays on here before I can even use the gel. :(</li>
            <li> They were hard and completely numb...</li>
            <li> And the burning of the gums I was aware of, but it is very bad and extremely painful.</li>
            <li> kinda useless without them.</li>
            <li> Also, the kit instructs that I should remineralize my teeth, but fails to instruct how that occurs.</li>
            <li> but I feel it is unlikely that you will get what you order</li>
            <li> Holy crap did this stuff burn my gums, not sure what I did wrong</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trays are a little tricky to mold since the sides are so thin, but not too terrible that they can&#x27;t be fixed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was terrible an it looked so raw and ate away at.</li>
            <li> So I Googled that name to find an awful amateur website - (...)</li>
            <li> Needless to say I won&#x27;t be using this very dangerous product again.  </li>
            <li> and it folded in on itself and stuck together making it almost impossible to mold to my teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> My teeth hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad you can&#x27;t just turn it on and have it stay on without holding it.</li>
            <li> followed with a salt rinse hoping that I hadn&#x27;t injured myself too badly.  </li>
            <li> For some reason it was really painful when I put this gel on my teeth, and I immediately rinsed it all off.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked....</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> and so soar and bloody</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible and doesn&#x27;t whiten teeth</li>
            <li> it hurts soooooooo bad!!!!</li>
            <li> and it was terrible.</li>
            <li> Her teeth got to the point where they were disgusting to look at.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smelled horrible also.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> works better than the dentist version</li>
            <li> Great deal saving me a fortune over what my dentist wanted to charge.</li>
            <li> It works very well I could see a diffrents after using  twice</li>
            <li> Thanks for all of the great deals on amazon.  To get this at wal mart , you cant... but its the only way to go for all of our needs. thanks again.</li>
            <li> didnt work as fast as they stated</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I used it every other day for 1 week and then about twice a week. I use it now 3-4 times a month. Great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them about twice a week for a few months now.  I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Did not work as I had Hoped.</li>
            <li> My daughter was pleased with results.</li>
            <li> This products makes your teeth whiter even after first use. I put this on my retainer and leave it on for about 10 minutes and it works great!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews of this product and people complained about it irritating their gums. It irritated mine on the first few uses but after a week of use the irritation ceased. Now I use it maybe once a month and It has made a tremendous difference in the whiteness of my teeth. Care should be taken in forming the teeth trays. Follow the instructions. For the price it&#x27;s a tremendous bargain and value.</li>
            <li> works well wish I had more trays I messed up one of the trays when I was fitting it so I only have one.  But I noticed a difference in the first use.  great product.</li>
            <li> With this product, I no longer need to wear the mouth piece overnight! Each morning I put a little 44% in both upper and lower molded mouthpieces, and while I shower and shave my teeth are being whitened. I finish up with a regular toothbrush and toothpaste made for sensitive teeth. It must be working, because now when I&#x27;m talking one on one, they look at my mouth, not in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference.</li>
            <li> Teeth are pearly white whenever I use this, the only issue is that it hurts like heck when it gets on my gums.</li>
            <li> I buy the whitener from my dentist, but can&#x27;t afford the $500.00 to have him make custom trays for me, so I use these.  They work well and the light really accellerates the cleaning process.  I have never tried the gel from this package.</li>
            <li> I use my retainers for the gel and it all works terrific. I have used this product sparingly, not every day, because I don&#x27;t want my teeth to become sensitive. It works great how I use it! My teeth are considerably more white.</li>
            <li> The description above says:&lt;br /&gt;Teeth Whitening Kit 44%&lt;br /&gt;(10) Syringes of Gel&lt;br /&gt;(1) White Light&lt;br /&gt;(2) Trays&lt;br /&gt;(1) Shade Guide&lt;br /&gt;(1) Instructions Sheet&lt;br /&gt;FREE WHITE LED LIGHT INCLUDED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivered item actually only has 4 Syringes of Gel, and does not have a White LED Light included at all.  Also, the box I received has written in marker \\&quot;Sample - Non Peroxide formula\\&quot;.  The description actually lists peroxide as an ingredient.  Looks like I will just return this, and order from another seller.</li>
            <li> I received this kit and it had no mouthpieces with it...kinda useless without them. Ended up buying separate mouthpieces.  The gel works well though. Just poor quality control.</li>
            <li> It did effectively whiten my teeth but it caused my teeth to have aches and gave my teeth several white spots and my gums became swollen and red.</li>
            <li> Only thing i didint like about it is that there is no experiation date on it, other than that it was fine.</li>
            <li> To strong!  Fried my gums!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this gel before and as the last time the whitening is consistent and good.  I still have some left for my next whitening job which I do at least once every three months for a week each time.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have seen an big improvement in the whiteness of my teeth in general. So far, I have only used the kit 5 times and so far did not finish up the first tube yet. Instructions are there to be read and followed - just do it. It warns you about the strong gel. Don&#x27;t get on your gums. Works great for me.</li>
            <li> We ordered these because we did the one at the kiosk in the San Antonio Mall (bleach bright). The lady had given us our trays to take home so we decided to order some more of the gel. I used this one for 15 minutes at first. I ended up leaving it on for another 10 minutes (instructions say 15-30 mins the first time you use it). I saw HUGE improvement immediately. I&#x27;m not sure how often you can use it, weekly, twice a week, etc. I plan on doing it again in another week. By then it will have been about 3 weeks in between. I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I had some side effects with the one in the mall. I had some blisters in my mouth afterwards. I have decided it was because of the tray the lady used. It was really too big for my mouth and the edges cut into my gums. I was nervous about using this one. However I was very careful this time about biting down gently and slowly and adjusting the tray once it was in my mouth. I didnt have any of the problems this time. At the mall it was $109+tax per person. Honestly I think this kind works better.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I odered some previous teeth whitening products from this sight and none worked, but when i got this I used right away. After reading some of the reviews about gums blistering I was leary but when ahead anyway. What I did was put some of the gel directly on my teeth and a added bit more within the trays and had NOooo problems. I am a smoker ( in the process of quitting) so I was amazed with the results and I don&#x27;t think at all that its too strong. Ok ,so it foams that because its whitening your teeth,and I wasn&#x27;t foaming at the mouth. The trays are not a custom fit, but once on keeping a small washcloth if not your tongue will keep them in place for 30-45 mins and wa-la your teeth look good.</li>
            <li> Did not get the LED light accelerator... ForTeeth whiteng kit which should been included-sydlee135@aol.com</li>
            <li> The instructions are so vauge and yes it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out, but once I popped the trays into my mouth my gums burned like no other it caused them to blister and bleed, very tender and sore for days...it doesnt matter how little of the product you use whatever you do dont get this garbage on your gums. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for me. Payed more and got a name brand from the dentist . . . what a difference</li>
            <li> Holy crap did this stuff burn my gums, not sure what I did wrong but I was peeling pieces of my gums for days it just burned like acid!</li>
            <li> I had to order the trays.  The product stated the trays were included but did not come in with the two kits I ordered.</li>
            <li> Works well and im only using once per week for 30 minutes. Can definitely see an improvement immediately upon removing tray from teeth and rinsing. Would recommend and buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Yes my teeth are a bit whiter. No it wasn&#x27;t worth it. My gums are bright red when previously they were pink. They are super sensitive and have white tissue by the teeth and when I brush that white goes away and is replaced by bleeding gums and I&#x27;m being super careful. If you do decide to get this product, at all costs avoid letting the gel touch your gums. Maybe use a brush to put it on your teeth then use the guard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used whitening products before, but am having a lot of sensitivity issues with this product. I would not order again.</li>
            <li> I had Easy White done by cosmetic dentist at cost of $500.  3 shade improvement, very happy with results.  i purchased this as an inexpensive touchup to keep teeth white.  I use 1/2 tube about 30-45 minutes once a month.  can be pretty intense zinger if you leave on longer.  my goal is maintenance not trying for even whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Had to return.  I don&#x27;t consider myself a delicate creature, but this thing burned my gums like a mother.  The LED light also came broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used something like this before, so I can&#x27;t make a comparison.  It seems like an effective cheaper alternative based on reviews, but I have not used it much because my jaw hurt for over a week after the first two uses.  It&#x27;s an awkward position for your jaw muscles to be in - it did not hurt initially, but my jaw became very sore the next day.  I used it while watching a tv show fro half an hour.  I don&#x27;t know if I will try to use it again; probably not for fear of the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this could be somehow due to user error, I wish the instructions for fitting the mouthpieces were more specific.  I am a very handy person and followed the instructions very carefully.  Is there any way to fit them so your jaw is in a more natural position?  I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Based on the number of positive reviews, I knew the product was legit. But, having had very little success with over-the-counter whiteners in the past, I was still skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news: it works! I have been using it for about 20 minutes every other day for the past two weeks, and I have seen a big improvement. Especially near the gum line, where the worst of the staining seemed to be. According to the enclosed Whitening Shade Guide, I have gone from #6 to a #4 (on their scale of 1 to 16, 1 being the whitest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hasn&#x27;t irritated my gums,either. Thank you for a great product for the money!</li>
            <li> Horrible and doesn&#x27;t whiten teeth</li>
            <li> My dentist does (1) free whitening a year along with being an established patient &amp; with regular cleanings.  I purchased this to enhance my smile during those in between times.</li>
            <li> These will whiten the hell out of your teeth. Don&#x27;t leave them in over 6 minutes or your teeth will be aching for hours!</li>
            <li> Definitely whitens your teeth. Works well. Worth the money. supply lasted me about a year.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong. It&#x27;s the first product I&#x27;ve encountered that makes my teeth hurt. Usually I can use as many consecutive whitestrips as I want, but this caused some aching, which I don&#x27;t mind. However, the molds don&#x27;t work that well. If you screw up in forming them, which is pretty easy to do, there&#x27;s really no going back. I also didn&#x27;t notice much whitening compared to strip products, but perhaps my salvaged molds were just off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could be a good product, but the usability is bad enough you&#x27;d never know.</li>
            <li> Just received the whitening kit today... A couple warnings for people interested in buying, when you are molding your tray, do not leave it in the boiling water longer than a couple seconds, I left mine in to long and it folded in on itself and stuck together making it almost impossible to mold to my teeth but eventually I got it molded enough to make the impression to my teeth and get to whitening.. Now the biggest warning, after reading the reviews about \\&quot;Burning gums\\&quot;, I was kind of expecting it but not only did it burn a little, the bleach went into my gums and I could feel it bubbling in the tray. When I took the trays out of my mouth, my gums were snow white and had NO feeling!! They were hard and completely numb... I completely FREAKED out and was on the verge of tears thinking this product had just ruined my gums!! After calming myself down, brushing my teeth and rinsing my mouth with COLD water 4 or 5 times (warm water was painful on my now sensitive gums) I noticed the white on my gums went away in about 15 minutes.. Bottom line, beauty is pain!!! And though this product burns and temporarily turns your gums snow white, I can already see the difference in the color of my teeth!! I plan on waiting a couple days and doing another treatment!! I am excited because the results are almost instant and that was just with 10 minutes.. I cant wait to see how white they get after 4 or 5 treatments!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- The white gums I previously mentioned after using? Well today I woke up and everywhere that my gums where white after bleaching, the skin had peeled off and is now raw and red... Im extremely upset about this :/</li>
            <li> I recieved this product today, the light DOES NOT work even with new batteries and it makes me very unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and it has served me well for many years.  Excellent delivery time.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This whitening gel hurt my teeth immediately as soon as I put them on.  I have used many different whitening products...typically the white strips...and this is the only teeth whitening product that gave me A LOT of pain.  I followed the directions exactly...I did not overload on the gel.  For some reason it was really painful when I put this gel on my teeth, and I immediately rinsed it all off.  Stick to the white strips!  They may be more expensive but they are worth it!</li>
            <li> This was a great buy, I will reorder when my supply runs out.  Why do I have to use soo many word in my feedback,is this a school?</li>
            <li> It does not taste bad, however, I only used it twice because my gums became swollen and irritated. I knew that this would happen but did not like the discomfort. This whitener is powerful.</li>
            <li> I wish I was able to do this more often.  I&#x27;m a coffee drinker so my teeth are stained badley.  Alas, they are also so sensitive that I can&#x27;t use this as much as I need too for good results.</li>
            <li> I recommend having a professional mouth guard made just for your teeth (to keep the gel off your gums, cheeks, and lips best).  You don&#x27;t want the gel to touch your gums, cheeks or lips or it will sting and turn those areas white for a day [not healthy].  You won&#x27;t see results right away.  You should use this 30 to 60 minutes a day, every other day or two until you reach your desired whiteness.  This is as good as what the dentists use; Just use it with causion keeping it off your gums, cheeks and lips best you can using a mouth guard that fits your teeth perfectly.</li>
            <li> This Gel came with more syringes filled with more gel than the others, however the formula seems to be the same and it works very well.  I no longer have coffee stained teeth and I&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t have to use it too often.</li>
            <li> This stuff is FAR and away better than the store bought stuff that I used. If you aren&#x27;t careful you will burn your gums.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are not bad but they aren&#x27;t the whitest. I should have just went to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Thank you for bringing back the shine to my teeth. Over 35 years of not taking proper care of my teeth was totally atoned for in 20 days! Now I can smile again and not be too concerned that people are staring at my once yellow teeth. I can see the difference this has made since I started using it. I have just ordered another set for me and my sister-in-law.</li>
            <li> The trays immediately didn&#x27;t form the right way (I followed directions to a T) rendering the entire kit useless. I guess the whitening gel may still work with another tray but I&#x27;m not sure as I have to find one first. Meh is my overall feeling as the gel is sitting in my fridge not whitening a thing.</li>
            <li> My teeth were perfect for prom and I look wonderful with a perfect smile to go with my dress. I love love love it!!!</li>
            <li> I went to a dentist years ago and paid $400 for the same results I&#x27;m seeing with this product.  However, be careful of overfilling the trays.  I did overfill last night and will have to wait for my gyms to heal because the solution burned my gums.  I was warned in the directions.  I just didn&#x27;t realize how easy it was to put too much solution in the tray.  I will continue with more care and I believe I will be able to come up at least 3 shades whiter.</li>
            <li> The bleach squirts out too quickly and you end up wasting at least half a syringe every time. The bleach also seems much stronger than other brands and has a tendency to burn my gums. I will go back to using my former brand.</li>
            <li> This product burned my gums, left them white, peeling and tender. I normally have excellent gums.  I think the solution is too strong and the trays let it leak onto the gums, causing the burns.  I had high hopes but was disappointed that I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> Two very important tips;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouth trays will melt if you use boiling water, and when they mold in your mouth- they stay that way.  They stay nice and tightly suctioned to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual chemical turns into what I call super peroxide (ha), be sure not to over apply to the trays before putting them in your mouth.  Your gums will burn/get oxygenated.  Also be sure to have Sensodyne BEFORE your first treatment to aid with the sensitivity while your enamel restores.</li>
            <li> No change in brightness of my smile. Also, the kit instructs that I should remineralize my teeth, but fails to instruct how that occurs.</li>
            <li> My first use of this product was terrifying. Not only did I follow the very few directions that were provided exactly. The gel burned at first application and within a minute I had to remove the mouth piece because it was so painful. Let me be clear that I do not have any dental problems and my teeth are in healthy condition. When I removed the mouthpiece My upper gums, where a small amount of gel had gotten, were burning, turned white, and starting to bleed. Unsatisfied with this product is an understatement. I have taken pictures of my teeth after I removed the mouthpiece and cleaned off the gel. I would like to know how the company is going to rectify this situation.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 15 different teeth whitening systems and this works best.  I will never try another kind again.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly order this set.  I was wanting another set with 2 lights, 2 sets of mouth guards, and 10 syringes to share with my daughters.  I didn&#x27;t want to hassle with sending it back and ordering another one.</li>
            <li> We bought this product to whiten our teeth obviously and it seems to do the job very well. We already had the mouth pieces to put it in so that was not an issue for us.</li>
            <li> I use it with my invisalign that I&#x27;ve had made by my Orthodontist. I have not used the tray that came with the packaging. I use it about twice a week for 45min at night. It does have a strong taste when it leaks out of the tray, but I have never have gotten my gums or tongue burnt from the product. My teeth is nice and white, Love it!</li>
            <li> The whitening gel is so foul you can&#x27;t possibly keep it in your mouth for the recommended time. It&#x27;s very messy too... should&#x27;ve just stuck with the Crest strips.</li>
            <li> Every body says there is a difference in my teeth color but I don&#x27;t see it. I have lost all the gel stuff. It burns your gums every time. My advice is to save up and go get your teeth professionally whitened. My sister who is a dentist told me apparently you could keep redoing the teeth tray so it could better shape your teeth. I did it again by putting it in hot water and it shrank up. Now I need to get new teeth trays. Would I recommend it? No. Get a brand that is more well known. Right now my upper teeth is a different color as lower teeth.</li>
            <li> Love this item!!! Great at home whitener. I&#x27;ve used this item for the last 5 months twice a week and get great results. Be careful with the amount you use because it can cause irritation to the gum line, but to also help with that you can remodel your trays!</li>
            <li> This item is very good in keeping the teeth looking better.  It also helps in deodorizing the mouth. Great product!</li>
            <li> This teeth whitening system works very good. My teeth were a little more sensitive so I could only have it on my teeth for five minutes and I had to use sensdyn toothpaste before and after to help with the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> this product meet or exceeded my expectations especially for the value and the money when I ordered it would purchase again</li>
            <li> After using countless boxes of whitestrips with extremely minimal results and hours of painful tooth sensitivity, I decided to try this product. I used it for the first time for 8 minutes (careful, it will burn your gums) and immediately noticed teeth were at least a shade or two whiter. I am impressed with the product itself and the amount of proper tools provided with it. This will definitely become a regular tool in my beauty arsenal</li>
            <li> So far, so good. The Product is pretty good. I would buy again. Good value for the price. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural grinder when I go to bed. It&#x27;s bad. Over the years I&#x27;ve basically filed down my teeth and my teeth are SO sensative. Even breathing with my mouth open hurts really bad when it&#x27;s cold out.&lt;br /&gt;A couple years ago I bought the crest white strips trying to whiten my teeth. My teeth hurt so bad. I bought two kits and only used the strips twice before giving up the pain was too bad.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve had this in for 15 minutes (going the full 30) my first try and so far so good, not an ounce of pain! The crest strips were hurting almost instantly. A little uncomfortable to wear and you look like a goof with the light but no pain.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem has nothing to do with the kit itself, I just have a LOT of drool. In 10 minutes I&#x27;ve already changed out the paper towel (out of cotton balls) three times. Using it in front under my lower lip and top lip and under my tongue and they are getting soaked pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know how well it whitens but I will be back to update in a week or two on that. Just wanted to post about the non existant pain, if this works it will be AMAZING!</li>
            <li> NOt for your wisdom teeth but you would be wise to buy this product. I have used this product every other day for the past two weeks. I was looking to buy the crest strips. The price for the strips was very high and the reviews not that great. So I thought I would try  Teeth Whitening Kit  based on it&#x27;s  reviews and price with great results. I could tell a big difference on  first appication, and even more on the second appication.  Do not get on your gums. I applied to my teeth using the syringe and then spread using a q-tip exactly where needed, and put the trays on. This worked best for me.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product! Whitens teeth better than the strips and is much more economical.  I did have issues with the trays that you put the whitener in.  Bottom tooth tray ended up folding over and doesn&#x27;t fit right but that could be that my bite is off not the product.  To do it over- I would only place the tooth tray in the boiling water for only 2-4 seconds so it wasn&#x27;t curling up so much before I placed in my mouth. I had done it for the instructed time of 5-6 seconds.</li>
            <li> This caused the worst pain I have felt in many many years. The whole roof of my mouth was burned, teeth hurt for two days. Maybe it is just a real strong mixture or something.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product.  I ordered it and received the remineralizing gel.  I returned that and ordered two more because my wife wanted one and this time I only received 5 syringes in each packet.  After using the gel I noticed that a filling that I have was brittle and flaked a little.  The one use that I got out of the product did whiten my teeth by a shade or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the product probably works but I feel it is unlikely that you will get what you order and you may not wish to use it if you have any fillings.  Also,  It sucks to sit and drool for 30 minutes.  I am just going to suck it up and go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I actually just put this product inside my invisaligns and it works great!  Very very strong stuff, make sure to wipe off your gums or it&#x27;ll hurt after a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution, even using the right amount results in only 4-5 uses per syringe.  But still with 10 syringes, and the price, this is still BY FAR the best bang for your buck product.</li>
            <li> I followed the process on the instruction sheet - the gel worked but as others have indicated it burns quite a bit so be VERY careful of the amount you use.  I already had trays so didn&#x27;t need to fool with those so I can&#x27;t say whether that worked or not.  However, the enclosed light (the main reason I purchased the kit) was totally DEAD when I got it.  It probably costs less to make than the battery that needed to be replaced so I sent the whole thing back.  Overall, not impressed with it, and I&#x27;d just caution you that it&#x27;s very important to follow the procedure and wipe off your gums.  I&#x27;ve never had anything burn quite as much before.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to buy this product does he work well on the back teeth too?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works great!&lt;br /&gt;will sting your gums if you use too much, so be careful. But this&lt;br /&gt;product works much better than the other whitening tray products!</li>
            <li> this made no real difference in how white my teeth are, yes I followed the directions...&lt;br /&gt;I had no irritation like some folks did, pretty worthless purchase</li>
            <li> Item as described. Fast Shipping. Works Great. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves this! She will probably be getting more from you! They made her teeth sparkle! Beautiful white teeth!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product but I received something generic looking. The title specifically said it would come in a factory sealed retail box. What I received was a clear plastic bag with a sticker on it that said cool teeth whitening. Inside the bag, nothing is marked cool teeth whitening and the instructions have an Easy Whitening logo on them. I&#x27;m not very confident this is legit.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product!&lt;br /&gt;My teeth looked amazing after the first use. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Ok so I have used so many products &amp; smoked for 17 years and finally I can see my teeth getting whiter! I really am amazed because I have only used it 3xs for about 25 minutes each. I keep taking pictures and comparing them because I still cant believe my eyes. The molding was so easy to do judt submerge in just boiled water for 4 seconds and to my surprise they were not hot when I took the impressionsof my teeth. My coworker noticed right away &amp; asked to see my teeth . I cant stop smiling:):)</li>
            <li> Enough bleach for two people to get their teeth shiny white and still have some left over for next time!</li>
            <li> My teeth are three shades whiter. I would defintely reccommend it.  I left the tray in my mouth for 30 minutes. . Great product.</li>
            <li> I left the gel on for 30 minutes and it did lighten a shade.  I would not recommend swallowing for the 30 minutes or so the gel is on your teeth because it did seem to upset my stomach.  Only used it once so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing more lightening as I continue to use the gel.</li>
            <li> Worked quickly.  Used first time for about 15 minutes and could easily see a difference.  However, be careful with the amount of gel used, mine spilled out onto my gums and burned them in a few spots.  I would use again, but I would put less gel inside the mold.</li>
            <li> Used for a week...very little discomfort, no increase in sensitivity, but WOW 3-4 shades whiter already!! and I&#x27;m only down 2 syringes!! Works well on tobacco stains and somehow you retain that &amp;#34;just brushed&amp;#34; feeling all day afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside was the light, which stopped working properly after 1 use. Found out it was just the batteries (flat, watch type) weren&#x27;t contacting the terminals properly. Used a small portion of the teeth shade guide, folded it up, and placed it under the battery cover so as to apply more pressure to the batteries. Worked like a charm!!! 5 uses later and its still perfect. Anyone having trouble with the light should try it before buying a new one or demanding a refund.</li>
            <li> The kit really works and whitened my teeth quickly.  I recommended it to my 21 year old son and he was impressed how white his teeth had gotten.</li>
            <li> Strong and effective, may be too strong and cause some minor burning to the gum line if left on the full amount of time suggested. Whitens well and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The included mouthguard is too flimsy and clearly of inferior quality. You will end up having to replace it, overall this just didn&#x27;t work out for me and I would recommend looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product a few times and have only noticed a slight difference in whitening.  I&#x27;ve done two back to back 45 minute sessions and still did not see significant changes.  On the other hand, I have not had the issues with soar gums as others have stated.</li>
            <li> The trays were a little difficult to form, the instructions were confusing/ 30 minutes to bleach plus 30 minutes to whiten? My gums were so irritated after two uses that I had to discontinue for a week. First day back, my gums burned right away. Ouch!</li>
            <li> Very effective, but be careful not to put too much in the retainer; if it overflows and gets on your gums, it&#x27;ll hurt quite a bit and the contacted area of flesh will turn bright white for a day or so!</li>
            <li> This kit was definately worth it. Now if only I could stop drinking things that stain my teeth! lol. Anyway, this product works when you&#x27;re religious about doing it everyday. Even the first time I used it noticed a difference. When you use it, there might be spots that are lighter than others, but they will eventually blend it once you continue to use it. I recommend getting a reminarilizing gel because it does make your teeth a little sensitive. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product. :)</li>
            <li> The product worked great the first few months. However, despite an expiration date of 12/15/2014 on the box, the black rubber on the plunger seal (I had to Google the part names of a syringe!) began to break down and suspend inside of the gel itself. Literally, I have chucks of black rubber floating around in my whitening gel. Also, the gel lost all of it&#x27;s gel strength, leaving it with a water-like viscosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical when I saw such a high % teeth whitener at such a cheap price. I am learning once again that you get what you pay for. I am calling Cool Teeth Whitening and demanding a refund. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I have developed the yellowish brown discoloration of my front teeth from consuming much coffee, tea and cola, despite normal good dental hygiene. It has that dull look like I have not brushed my teeth enough. There is no nicotine related issue here. My option is either try this teeth whitening product or get the professional dental whitening. I give this a try first. Within the first week, actually the few days of use, the discoloration is noticeably gone. For safety reason, I follow the instruction given and apply it for the shortest duration necessary (10 minutes with the light on daily). Apparently longer use may have even better result, but I wouldn&#x27;t know if my teeth enamel can handle that. After a week, the shine of the front teeth has returned and my teeth look clean and brushed. However, after weeks of use, I am still not getting that pearly white color which is commonly seen when treated professionally. Overall I am satisfied that at least I have the clean teeth look for now.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS ONE OF THE &amp;#34;BEST DEALS&amp;#34; ALL IN  ALL INCLUDED WAS A LIGHT ACTIVATOR, JUST LIKE WHEN&lt;br /&gt;I WENT TO THE DENTIST @ $150.00!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO NOT ONLY DO YOU GET A GOOD HIGH END PRODUCT, YOU GET ENOUGH TO TO KEEP YOUR TEETH WHITE FOR A LONG TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL INDEED BE BACK &amp; THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Before you use the mouth trays the first time, you&#x27;re supposed to dip them in hot water and shape them to your mouth.  Fine, but the plastic didn&#x27;t retain its shape very well, and the awkward fit made me drool excessively.  It was hard to keep them in for more than a few minutes.  The gel burned the sensitive areas of my gums, and left them raw and sensitive.  The UV light is finicky and has to be held with just the right pressure to emit a constant ray of light.  As a result, the treatments were exhausting and I couldn&#x27;t do anything else while I was trying to whiten my teeth.  I didn&#x27;t see any results and have used 10 syringes of gel.  This could be because I haven&#x27;t been able to keep the product on for more than 5 minutes at a time.  I think next time I will try whitening strips - maybe they will be less messy.  I was hoping the gel would get into the grooves of my teeth, but so far I don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this product, and by all reviews on Amazon it \\&quot;appears\\&quot; to work; HOWEVER, this product is NOT made in the USA.  So I thought my fellow Amazonians should be aware of what you see here, because you don&#x27;t quite know what your sticking into your mouth if you buy this product.    FIRST:  Any advertising that shows you a photo of a product in a plain vanilla box, and contains an American flag INSIDE of it is suspicious.  How many truly American-made products do that?  The mere fact that they tout everywhere that it&#x27;s \\&quot;MADE IN USA\\&quot; - as though they have something to prove - is a red flag.    SECOND:  It ONLY costs $20 bucks - when competing products cost well over $300 (U.S.) EVERYWHERE else.  Hmm...smells like slave labor.    THIRD:  The product image looks like your standard product image from Alibaba.com.  Asian product manufacturers produce very distinctive product images - crappy.    LAST:  So if you notice \\&quot;Sunshine\\&quot; is listed as the \\&quot;supplier\\&quot;.  Sunshine??  Really?  Oh that name so wreaks of Asia - just like Chinese restaurants.  So I Googled that name to find an awful amateur website - (...)sunshineteethwhitening.com - and Boo-Yah!!!  China baby!  Look out Monk!    I want super white teeth just as much as the next fool, but I ain&#x27;t sticking \\&quot;who-know&#x27;s-what-made-in-China-by-some-half-rate-pharma-co-employing-slave-labor\\&quot; into my mouth.  This ain&#x27;t a cell phone.  I want to be able to know who is accountable when I start spitting up blood.    Move on with your day kind folks of Amazon...and caveat emptor to all!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product, 20-30 minutes, per night, for the past 5 nights.  The results are real, your teeth will get whiter, however, as the COO of an oral care and relief company, please use caution when using this product.  The instructions clearly state to be careful not to apply to gums or sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a 0.63% Stannous Fluoride Rinse (MedActiveÂ®) every night, and take exceptionally great care of both my teeth and gums to ensure optimal oral health.  Immediately after using the recommended amount of this product, my gums began to burn, and I was forced to spit out the product.  I recommend applying a pea-size amount to your finger and coating only the  surface of the tooth, and repeat for every visible tooth surface.  After, insert the top and bottom mouth guards and affix whitening light under the upper and lower lip for at least 20 minutes.  If you feel any discomfort, stop using the product immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product my full support, and hope the company is able to improve packaging in the future.  But for the price, this is a far more effective product than any of the over commercialized, highly diluted, &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; retail whiteners (CrestÂ®, ColgateÂ®, LISTERINEÂ®) that cost anywhere from $40-$100 per treatment.  Similar whitening treatments preformed at dental offices can cost anywhere from $100-$300 per treatment, and they use the EXACT same ingredients and applicators.  The company claims to be Made in the USA, which is always a great feeling, and a great way to support small, growing businesses in the United States.  Thank you for providing a great product!  I will be reordering in the future!</li>
            <li> this teeth whitening kit really works. i saw results after 1-3 applications. be careful not to get it on your gums though as will burn this delicate area</li>
            <li> If you have an exposed nerve or enamel is thin, it will hurt for a few hours after your done. But it works great.</li>
            <li> I tried fitting the trays (followed the instructions carefully.) and the first one seemed to just melt very fast before I could even put it in my mouth. I held it for five seconds like it said, no longer no less. It was ruined. The second one did the opposite and I tried it a few times. It was only a little bit after that I tried the second, so I doubt the water \\&quot;cooled off\\&quot;. Idk. I&#x27;ll see if I can find other trays on here before I can even use the gel. :(</li>
            <li> I am in the process of using this product now.  I have noticed quite an increase in the whitening of my teeth.  I received item very quickly and packed carefully and with  complete directions.  I am very happy with this product and will order again when I need this again.  I would recommend this to any adult wishing to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> This works, very strong whitening gel. Makes teeth whiter, no doubt. This comes with so much gel, id say 30- 40 uses. Depending on how much you use! Will buy this again!</li>
            <li> It does the job nice and clear. My teeth are whiter in just 5 sesions. Is cheap but great ... Go ahead!</li>
            <li> i put 3 stars for now because im not using it yet,it says there can&#x27;t use for nursing mom so better to wait next month after i stop breastfeed my baby.i will post comment here soon as i use it already!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed immediate improvement in my teeth and am very pleased&lt;br /&gt;. however, I did have a little trouble with the bottom mold. You have to&lt;br /&gt;be quick to mold it to your mouth.You also have to be careful when applying the gel&lt;br /&gt;to your molds because it you get it on your gums it feels/looks like your&lt;br /&gt;mouth is raw. you don&#x27;t need to apply a lot to see results!! (even without the LED light&lt;br /&gt;that did not work)</li>
            <li> Works great, but make sure to keep it off your gums. Probably the best deal for a whitening kit, but I would advise getting a different mouth peice mold. The one that comes with this is a bit small. Noticed an improvement after 2 uses 3 days apart.</li>
            <li> I wish you were able to give no stars. I bought this recently and the whitening trays suck. I followed the directions and they did not shape to my teeth at all. I bought a whole bunch of the whitening jel too. Now I have no way to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I have to search for a better mouth tray.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product over two months ago, I thought since since it was stronger it would whiten my teeth faster than the whitening solution I usually use. But that is not the case. It has whiten just a little in the two months I have been using it. And the burning of the gums I was aware of, but it is very bad and extremely painful.</li>
            <li> I spend 30 minutes going through steps 1 and 2 and when I got to step 3, the light didn&#x27;t work.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product just arrived today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions for forming the trays to my teeth.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with the first two tries on my upper teeth but the third fit quite well.  Sometimes DIY mouth trays don&#x27;t remelt and remold very well, but I had no problems with this one.  The bottom tray extended past my gum line, but a quick pass with a mini razor blade solved that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to put a dot of the gel on each tooth and to start at two minutes and then work my way up to a maximum of thirty.  I&#x27;ve used the bleaching strips and trays sold over-the-counter, so I fully intended to go past a paltry two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I inserted the trays and and the gel started foaming.  Then burning.  Then burning A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept the trays in for maybe a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spit them out and rinsed out my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like my teeth looked a teensy bit whiter--probably wishful thinking on my part, as I kept the trays in so briefly--but certainly my gums were whiter.  And numb for a good twenty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes me think that the solution is very effective but that I&#x27;ll need to be very, very careful the next time I use the trays.  Probably I&#x27;ll use a q-tip to use as little of the gel as possible until I can build up my tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have high hopes for this product, so hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to increase my star rating in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff but I followed the instructions to a T and It bleached my gums for over a day and caused them to in a way \\&quot;scab\\&quot; my gums appeared like skin was coming off and well it was noticeable to everyone. I do not recommend this and no I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is  great! I&#x27;ve used the weaker stuff in the past and was dissatisfied, this product cuts through the grey tint, and yellow staining from the tetracycline I used as a child. After using twice a week for two weeks, I now only have to use once a month. I could actualy use every two months If I wanted.  Product is strong so I would advise using the remineralization gel post treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many teeth whitening strips in the past and have only gotten poor results. For a fraction of the price of the top-of-the-line strips, I thought I&#x27;d give this system a try. I did a little research to see what dentists use and what percentage, and this falls right in line with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trays are a little tricky to mold since the sides are so thin, but not too terrible that they can&#x27;t be fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system came with a little blue LED mouth piece, which I didn&#x27;t use since the directions never mentioned it and I don&#x27;t know how you would fit it and the trays in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel goes a long way if you use just enough. I was able to get 3-31/2 applications out of a syringe. I made the mistake of using too much the first time and it seeped out of the trays. I didn&#x27;t think it would be a problem, but it foamed up when it mixed with saliva, forcing me to spit every couple minutes or drool. Use it sparingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product with above average to good results. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone not looking to pays hundreds at the dentist just to use the same process.</li>
            <li> I used this gel 3 times with the trays the first day with maybe 1shade difference, then I used it the next day, 3 times with my blue led light mouth piece!,, I saw 2-3 shades difference, no sensitivity, this product works best with an led mouth tray</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  I was a little hesitant but works great.</li>
            <li> use as directed , don&#x27;t try double or back to back treatments or you will burn your gums. Whitens nicely !!! :)</li>
            <li> I tried this out the day I received it.  I was so surprised by the unbelieveable results!  It was fantastic!  My teeth were white as can be!  I use professional white strips - but this stuff out did my white strips!  I am totally happy with this product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The price was right, the product works, made my gums a little sensitive.  It works the first time it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> Received this a few weeks ago and feel it works as well as the whitening strips from crest. It is strong, so I have only been able to put it on my teeth for 8 min. I could probably go a little longer but did notice a few &amp;#34;zings&amp;#34; after doing it for 4 days in a row ( they were very mild but I know what those feel like and have NO desire to feel that again.). I use a cotton ball I stretch out and put between my upper and one between my lower lip and teeth to prevent drool, then I apply the gel with a plastic nail cuticle tool (Its end is flat and is about the size of my teeth) to my teeth(fronts only due to if I fill the trays it will really give me zingers) then slide a tray in to prevent the gel getting on any tissue. I do tops then after time is up I do the bottom teeth with the same process. This stuff is great and will last me a very long time. I have white teeth but between teeth on my bottom can get a little yellow and this has taken care of that so........AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference and i have sensative gums, so after about 4 times using it, the paste made my gums sore.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected. Packaged as described. There was only one mouth tray. Everything else intact. I&#x27;ve used this product only twice. Burns and stings. Hard not to keep some of the jell from touching your gums. Otherwise I could see a visibly difference after the second time I used it. So it is an excellent product. I would inform others about it as well. Stings and Burns but to get the results I&#x27;ve seen after two applications. So be it.</li>
            <li> The trays are absolutely the worst things ever. You can try to heat them, but they shrink and then stretch and turn to goo.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully! I saw results with the very first treatment. After 3 treatments, my teeth were whiter than the chart offered. Great product, especially for the money!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I used it once and a little got on my gums it started tingling a little and then, slowly got hot and hotter all in about 4-5 min. I got it all off my teeth and gums still burning, I looked in the direction and it said nothing about this. After removing the stuff my gums the area that was burning turned white, and stayed that way for about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;The spot that was still soar was above my two front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;3 days latter my gums were swollen and when I brushed they hurt. This lasted for about 7 days.&lt;br /&gt;10 days latter my gums are almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try this one more time if I feel any burning at all I will never try this again.</li>
            <li> I was a Dental Assistant for years. I had my Dr.Whiten my teeth when I started work for him. Soon I was making Bleaching Trays for patients and teaching them how to bleach their teeth at home, using the product we used.There is a key to this: Regular everyday people, professional or not, cannot buy what the DDS uses.The advertising of \\&quot;Teeth whitening systems\\&quot;, is a scam, and a mighty expensive one. The Licensed Dentist buys &amp; uses a Teeth Bleaching/Lightening product &amp; patients are delighted with the results.But, say a family member can&#x27;t afford the DDS treatment &amp; opts to use a Commercially advertised product (with a Brand name)from his local Pharmacy.He follows instructions &amp; ultimately finds that his teeth &#x27;just won&#x27;t lighten&#x27; like the family member&#x27;s did.Tries another Brand, same results...he&#x27;s got REALLY clean teeth, but no lighter. These drugstore products say contents contain Peroxide, so why isn&#x27;t it working?&lt;br /&gt;Fact is, the LICENSED DDS can buy what the general public can&#x27;t.The DDS office uses Carbamide Peroxide, not available for &#x27;public&#x27; sale. It&#x27;s a percentage quite higher than even what we (the public) get through Amazon, Brite Smile (44% Carbamide Peroxide).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank Amazon for providing a way for us to \\&quot;buy\\&quot; the products they have that are not 100% (like going to the Dental Office), but as close as an unlicensed person can get!</li>
            <li> Quick results but a little sloppy.  I would purchase it again. Teeth were noticeably brighter and whiter. Great price too!</li>
            <li> They say every one reacts differently to this product. It whitened my teeth several shades in 11 days using it 30 min each morning. $25 instead of $500 at the dentist.  I get many complaments on my smile that I never got before</li>
            <li> they killed mt gums leaving me recovering from blistered gums for a week..... thanx guys get em outa there.. im a smoker but i brush my teeth so it is not my mouth its the product.. its acetone for your teeth...lol  you do not want this stuff on your gums.....for warned.... easier sounding then it is and OUCH....</li>
            <li> it really works. I ve been used it for about a month and I ve received so many compliments about my smile. It really works, but you just have to be very carefull with your gums. If you get the acid in it it will irritate.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for several items, but decided on this one. I&#x27;m sold glad I did. My daughter has some discoloration on her teeth for yrs now due to the asthma nebulizer meds. I&#x27;ve talked to her dentist about it, they told me they can&#x27;t do anything about it now. I went to searching and found something this on Amazon, with just two use its gone. I haven&#x27;t used as much as recommended, just a small amount. I&#x27;m very happy with the results. #kickrocksdentallady</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I expected in a timely manner. Does just as good as strips with a lower cost. Messier than strips. If I had the spare money I would buy strips because at least I can talk and not spit constantly.</li>
            <li> Whitener works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for close to a month and my teeth might be 1 slightly shade whitter. Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a teeth whitening kit and this was a good purchase. There are 10 tubes of strong gel, trays and a mini light. I read the instructions carefully but I still had some confusion so I did some online research. Basically, you need to have this whitening solution in contact with your teeth and the trays are there to protect your lips.  The light works but I don&#x27;t know if it makes any difference. I have no way to compare. Overall, this turned out to be a good experience.</li>
            <li> Just too much for my teeth to take.  Couldn&#x27;t stand it.  Burned my gums to the mouth piece.  Probably at this strength needs to be supervised or you just have to know what your doing better than myself.</li>
            <li> Maybe my teeth are too tea stained to be easily whitened, but this just didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> better than before, it&#x27;s much stronger, note- A finger-nail polish, or finger-nail polish remover bottle works well with this, then, you can paint your teeth with it</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product, and I saw a difference within 3 days, but I don&#x27;t put the gel in the tray. I used a toothbrush to paint it on my teeth and then use the tray. This way, you save your gums and you use much less product but get the same effectiveness.  I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s any better or faster than white strips, but it is cheaper. I can&#x27;t comment on the light they provide, and have no way of knowing if it helps at all, but I guess it can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used this product it worked well, but after a week my teeth would hurt even if I would just breathe through my mouth. My bottom teeth now get pains even when not using the product. It is VERY strong! The gel ate away part of my gums above my front teeth. Be careful and if you have sensitive teeth please do not buy it.</li>
            <li> This whitening gel works well. After a single application my teeth were a few shades lighter and stayed that way for a while. Unfortunately, I did not receive any mouthpieces with my order and the blue-light flashlight crapped out pretty quick too. I don&#x27;t even know how much the light helps, but I&#x27;m not getting it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used whitening gels before, back when they were weaker, like 10%. This stuff is amazing. I went from yellowed to brilliant white in only 2 syringes. For those complaining about the burning sensation: you put too much in the tray and got it on your gums. Also, if you keep using the stuff, after a single syringe your gums don&#x27;t even feel overfill anymore. This stuff is fantastic, can&#x27;t say enough good things, would buy it again.</li>
            <li> it really works!I didnt even use the light.try it skeptics,it was worth the 20$ or so to get it to me.would do it again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 7 days straight. I could reasonably see a difference within that week. I skipped the weekend and statyed again on Monday for the next 14 days. I have stopped using it and my teeth are still whiter than they were but can tell a difference since ive stopped. I feel like to keep.that at their whitest I jeed to use this everynight forever.</li>
            <li> Not as much to say. IO just started using those but i naturally do have white teeth so i couldn&#x27;t decide if it is actually working so good as described. Will write a new review if i see it working &amp;#34;so good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So this was my first time using an at home kit and it definitely does the job. I was a smoker for several years and after I quit I decided to freshen up the obvious sign of the past. My first time using it I realized that the mouth pieces included were kind of pointless and didn&#x27;t fit even after boiling them to loosen the material they&#x27;re made out of and then placing them into your mouth to form fit them. It was a better idea to use a mouthpiece I later got from my dentist. After a couple uses I noticed my teeth were significantly brighter but that the whitener had chewed a painful small sore into the roof of my mouth. I think this happened because I put too much whitener in the mouth piece and when I place it over my teeth the gel came out. But the whitener does work and it is helpful in erasing previous signs of not taking care of your teeth.</li>
            <li> Ive tried alot of whiteners from amazon. This one is The most pure and powerful and doesnt make my teeth sting and feel sensitive.I leave it on for 30-45 minutes with my customized trays.After just one time its 2 shades whiter.I will continue buying this.Thanks! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> First of all for $22 I was all ready to just write it off as a loss if I wasn&#x27;t satisfied. Honestly, I saw noticeable results after 2 nights. I understand everyone&#x27;s enamel is different so people may get different results but I really liked it. I didn&#x27;t get any sensitivity either which was a nice bonus. I bought some remineralization gel just in case and I didn&#x27;t have to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any results from using this product accept my mouth feels cleaner .....get what u pay for ....mine as well just bought 20 dollar toothpaste</li>
            <li> Dont buy this stuff! it hurts soooooooo bad!!!! I mean yes i had results and very fast, but it left my gums basically throbing and so soar and bloody and it was terrible.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference within 2 days! Will definitely buy this product again. I found it to work better then the dentist office product!</li>
            <li> i like the product but the instructions are confusing and not clear as to what i should and shouldnt do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and have seen a big difference in my teeth. I&#x27;ve gotten comments about it from family and coworkers. I used it with the light for 30 min at a time before bed a few times per week. Didn&#x27;t make my teeth very sensitive like I thought it might. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I had first tried a tube of whitening gel from walmart. I got some results but not as good as I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;I was shopping on amazon and saw this whitening kit. I am getting great results with it, as my teeth&lt;br /&gt;were yellow from being on antibiotics when I was a baby. Also from shoddy dental work I have recieved&lt;br /&gt;over the years. It has given me confidence to smile again. My friend saw my great results and is now using&lt;br /&gt;it. Recently she has bought a kit for her daughter.</li>
            <li> This was definately a good deal for the price. These will last me a very long time. My teeth were kind of white to begin with but I wanted them whiter and this product worked. It is strong so be careful when putting the gel on because it will burn your gums. I used the whitening light the first few times but found it didn&#x27;t speed up the process so I stopped using it. I found the gel itself worked just as good.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this teeth whitening system, I&#x27;ve used it twice. I did get some of the gel on my gums, and it burns a bit, but the product works as advertised. Easy to use and shows quick results.</li>
            <li> They worked well but sometimes for some reason it burns my gum and when I wipe it off, my gum has whiten. ???? Happen to anyone else? However , other than that I felt that it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> People need to understand that teeth whitening is not an overnight process, and depending on the severity of the staining, it will take anywhere from 2-8 weeks (though some people will see results faster) before you really start to glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great gel, and is very strong! just like every other teeth whitening gel, do not get it on your gums, and this is very simple if you will fallow my instructions. I have the best looking smile I have ever had in my life due to this product, and absolutely suggest it if you want a glowing smile and don&#x27;t want to spend 100+ dollars at your dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fist off, I use this tray, http://www.amazon.com/Forming-Whitening-Shield-Container-Dental/dp/B004HCE4LI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1354877916&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;teeth+whitening+trays&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very soft, and is dual action, meaning you can do top and bottom at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying the gel, I DO NOT put dabs on my teeth, it is to inconsistent, and can result in getting on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I take the gel, and do a very LIGHT amount into the tray, where the flat part meets the side wall right in the corner,  all the way around the top and bottom, Once you insert it into your mouth, pucker your gums tight, as this will get the gel all over the teeth...I let it sit between 20-30 mins at a time, (do not swallow! take a big drink of water before you start) and it has just worked wonders. Anyone that puts a negative review on this product is either impatient, or has no idea what they are doing.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this kit due to the price.  How could it work well and be so inexpensive?  I have used many products from the dentist and have my own trays so this isn&#x27;t a new venture for me.  I also have very sensitive teeth and have had problems with a lot of pain from the dentist whitening gels.  After reading the reviews online of this product and people with sensitive teeth not having problems I figured I would give it a try.  I&#x27;m very happy I did.  My teeth were noticeable whitened and I didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity.  Granted, I don&#x27;t leave it on very long but it really works and at the price it&#x27;s offered at there is no reason not to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering these get syringes again in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit as a gift for my sister and tried the gel in my own bleach tray. We both agreed that the gel is the most painful thing on earth and turned our gums white and even caused slight gingival recession. I have bonding on a lateral incisor and this stuff literally burned through it and chipped off the side of the bonding. I had to pay $295 to get the tooth fixed again. Not a fan! I understand that the super high % of peroxide is advertised but omg this stuff kills. I would not recommend this product to anybody. Go for a more gradual result with a lower % of peroxide and SAVE YOUR GUMS.</li>
            <li> My friend loves keeping his teeth gleaming white and he was impressed with the quality if this system, and it came so fast I was able to have wrapped for Xmas no probs at all</li>
            <li> Not an effective whitener, will not be reordering</li>
            <li> Yes, I would recommend this product.  It works exactly as described.  Just be careful if you have sensitive teeth, because that tooth will become more sensitive for a while.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Some patience and persistence required</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and product is working great!</li>
            <li> This product hurt my teeth ! don&#x27;t buy this s***.</li>
            <li> Too strong for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Is kind of a pain to do. Directions not very clear on procedure and mouthguards are cumbersome. If you screw them up molding them you mind as well throw everything else out. They can be tricky molding as they get very flimsy and I followed directions on molding them very carefully and one still folded up on me thus making treatment more difficult. The should give you a second set since they are just cheap plastic anyway and probably cost .05 cents to make each one ??  Teeth do look a little whiter but I have not tried the &amp;#34;Blue Light &amp;#34;part of the process yet as it is not confimed at what time of the process I should be doing that. Like I said directions a little confusing??</li>
            <li> I tried several weeks of whitening from a kit my dentist provided. The formula was 11% and it just didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. 3 days with this kit and I&#x27;ve already received comments that my teeth look great. I am using the teeth molds that my dentist provided rather than the ones in the kit.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I did not use this product for myself - I used it on my mother. She has no health insurance, smokes over a pack a day, and drinks tea at least 5 times a day. Her teeth got to the point where they were disgusting to look at. They were turning brown in color. I&#x27;m not talking teeth that turning just a tad bit yellow, or are very yellow, they were brown. I apply this stuff on her twice a day. The plates are not the best quality but it helps the gel stick and stay in place, somewhat. She has had no complaints on her gums burning, but I keep her on a strict regimen when it comes to brushing, so they could be a little sore. She uses this product along with \\&quot;Plus White Bleach Whitening Gel\\&quot; and \\&quot;Arm &amp; Hammer Whitening Booster\\&quot;. I have seen immaculate results on her. She uses the syringe and plate once in the morning and once at night. On her free time she uses the Plus White gel, and both morning and night she brushes her teeth with a fluoride toothpaste and puts the whitening booster on top of it. Her teeth went from brown to a light yellowish color within 2 weeks. I am amazed. Great product.</li>
            <li> Product is so strong it burnt the top of my mouth and gums and had to throw it away. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well.... I saw faster results when I left them in for 40min instead of 30... Be ready to jimmyrig some stuff though...</li>
            <li> This stuff WORKS GREAT I had zoom done at dental office and this product has kept my smile white!!! Have re purchased multiple times</li>
            <li> first of all when i tried to mold my teeth to the mouthpeice it totally mess up, it didnt fit right at all to my teeth, Second of all when i was on the first step of the bleaching process it completly bleached horribly on my teeth they were bleach spots not even whiting.You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to receive the kit so quickly.  Let me say that the whitening gel is fantastic, however the trays are very poor quality.  They are too big, and bulky for my small mouth.  I tried to mold them to my teeth, with no luck.  I have had whitening products for many years.  The trays I had were very thin and fit perfectly.  (My maltest found them, and had her way with them, hence I needed to get some more)  I would love to try some more, but without being able to return, if they are the same quality, I would just be wasting time and money.</li>
            <li> Great price for a strong whitener.  But like the other reviews, it is very STRONG.  Start by going light and use a few times a week.  I&#x27;ve noticed a few shades difference in just a few weeks and am still on my first syringe.  If you are the type of person that if one is good, than two must be better, you will burn your gums.  I went too heavy on the first application and had to take several days off for my gums to heal.  Just use in moderation and you&#x27;ll see the effects.</li>
            <li> I have been shopping around for a good teeth whitener set and I finally bought this one. I also wanted something in actual retail packaging. Everything was just as described, same as the pictures. The box has made in usa and FDA logos on it. There are 10 large whitening gel tubes in this kit. I think this will be good for 50-60 applications. The instructions warn you about molding the trays right and keeping gel away from your gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got immediate results after first application. Overall I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;This is a teeth whitening kit that I can recommend.</li>
            <li> Great price! I was only 4 colors from white. I was able to achieve my goal in 4 treatments. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  Please use with extreme caution.  About 2 years ago I used a 30% Carbamide Peroxide product supplied my dentist daily for 8 weeks with good results and no sensitivity.  I used this 44% product twice. Once for 3-5 minutes and once the next day for 30 minutes. Teeth were sensative for a couple of days after. Whitening was amazing.  Haven&#x27;t figured out the light yet since I am using trays my dentist provided previously. This product causes some small concern as to the origin of manufacture and lack of ingredient labeling directly on the product (contents are listed on an instruction sheet that comes in the box). There is a link to the [...] website where a better instruction sheet with pictures and alternate purchasing options are available.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my daughter so she can whiten her teeth prior to her May wedding.  It is not as good as a professional whitening but the results are still noticeable.</li>
            <li> The light takes so much pressure to hold on that your thumb or fingers can get carpal! Too bad you can&#x27;t just turn it on and have it stay on without holding it. And the trays do NOT mold to your teeth per the directions. I&#x27;m sure the gel works fine. We shall see.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. It is affordable and it works.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it works fine. I did not like the way it is package.  It is not packaged. It is a bunch of syringes thrown in a box. The syringes and other pieces were not in any kind of sealed package. Just a bunch or pieces bouncing around in a card board box with to package or packing material. It sounded like a bunch of marbles in a box and I wondered about the cleanliness of the pieces.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that something with this price tag would actually accomplish anything but for $20 bucks or so, it was worth a try.  It can burn a little as others have mentioned but if you&#x27;re careful about it (I use a little less gel than maybe I should) - it isn&#x27;t a problem.  If you do get some irritation, put orajel on any spots before putting the trays in your mouth and it will reduce any pain.  The light does help and over all I have noticed a significant change.  I used it every day for about a week and now use it once or twice a week to perk the white back up.  Very nice job, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> it is perfect.. I noticed the deference after the firs use... I have sensitive teeth and the product doesn&#x27;t hurt me at all... thank u</li>
            <li> Bought this kit two weeks ago and both myself and partner are AMAZED at how fast the whitening agent works!  Our teeth are significantly whiter, brighter and we both feel more confident with our smiles as a result.  The thermo-form trays are easy to heat and mold in your mouth; the syringes are easy to open and apply the gel to the inside of said tray; and the LED light works as designed.  If you are in the market for a teeth whitening kit, consider this product.  The price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> kind of a hassle.  no instructions and the light piece doesn&#x27;t seem to fit once you have the trays in.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money and dangerous for a novice to use.  I have whitened my teeth successfully with inexpensive, generic whitening strips, but I decided to give this a try.  I have used the product 5 times now, carefully following instructions, but I have never been able to make it up to the recommended 20-30 minute whitening time.  Using the cheap whitening trays, even with molding to my teeth and trimming to be below my gum line, there is no way to keep the gel entirely off of my gums.  I even tried rubbing vaseline on my gums before inserting the tray to prevent the gel from getting on my gums and causing worse irritation.  I could bear no more than 12 minutes the last time I used the product, and when I removed the tray in pain, I noticed a small wound/eroded area in the gum between my front teeth (the little area that naturally curves down slightly between the two teeth).  I was panicked and gargled with baking soda in water followed with a salt rinse hoping that I hadn&#x27;t injured myself too badly.  It seems to be healing so fortunately I think I may have avoided an expensive trip to the dentist.  Needless to say I won&#x27;t be using this very dangerous product again.  When the wound heals, I will purchase whitening strips and do it the safe, old-fashioned way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this product do your research.  You should only get a product this corrosive from your dentist, using quality trays and careful monitoring by a professional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my 2 weeks of using this product, and I already seen the progress..my teeth is whitened. Wow!! I highly recommend for those who would like their teeth get whitened .</li>
            <li> This is worth buying! product is great and use it daily and works like a charm!  I will never buy it from the office again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this once so far and noticed a whiter smile. I also noticed more even color in my teeth, I recently quit smoking and was looking for a whiter smile. I was a little worried because sensitivity is usually a problem for me, but I had no problem with that; even on my gums! I first tried with the trays but they kept gagging me so I spit those out and just put the stuff on my teeth and the light in my mouth. Even with not following the directions it worked for me. I think this product is great!</li>
            <li> Everyone was saying how extremely white there teeth has got since of using this product so i had to try it for myself. I started with decently white teeth already (shade around 4 or 5) i wanted shade 1 of whiteness. After about 2 weeks of using it religiously for 25-30 mins twice a day, i found it did make my teeth whiter...but only like half a shade whiter, and the fact that my teeth gets very sensitive every time i use it...im not quite sure if its really worth waiting for. I&#x27;m starting to think you can only get that fake white teeth look from getting it done professionally. I&#x27;m still going to continue whitening. I recently purchased the 3d crest intensive professional whitening strips to see how that works. Iv always tried the strips and they are just WAYYYYY more comfortable then the tray! I am determined to get glow in the dark super whiteeeeeeeeee teeth! i hope it works! overall i give 3.5 stars because it did actually whiten my teeth, but just not dramatic enough, however the price is VERY reasonable to try out. btw DON&#x27;T get the gel on your gums! they will stinnnnggggg like your gums are eating away slowly..even after you wipe the gel off.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time that is about the only thing good about this product.&lt;br /&gt;It did not written my teeth but instead gave my teeth a dull sort of starchy look.&lt;br /&gt;Smelled horrible also.</li>
            <li> It really works better than the expensive $300 kits at the dentists office.  I have been buying this product from this vendor for 3 years now and love it.</li>
            <li> This product worked right after first use (Specks of white were all over my teeth). Yet the day after my first use my gums were in terrible shape. It looked as if someone cut the fronts of them. It was terrible an it looked so raw and ate away at. I was shocked.... Now I feel very hesitant to use it and just might throw it way.</li>
            <li> You can see why a dentist would normally use this -- if left too long on your gums, it can bleach and burn them. If you have professional trays, this is an excellent use for them.  Just keep it to 5-10 minutes.  And don&#x27;t even think about using it overnight. The results are as good as the $350-$750 charged by the pros. Although they&#x27;d make sure your teeth are clean and can benefit from this the best.  But if your teeth are clean, this is the way to go. If you&#x27;re currently using the 3-10 percent stuff overnight, stop.  Get this.</li>
            <li> Only 4 syringes in and my teeth are significantly whiter, definitely more so than any other whitening product I have tried! A little tricky at first, but if you brush the gel on you teeth in a thin layer between the teeth and near the gum line *not at it-- it&#x27;ll burn your gums* and then put a line of gel in the tray, then sit with it for the recommended time-- wow!  I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be helping, a little. My teeth have gotten much whiter, but I must say it is very painful after the first few days...even if I wipe off some of the paste from my gums.</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m from mexico so my english sucks but i&#x27;ll do my best)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived this morning, didn&#x27;t took too long to arrive, i used it like for 25-30 minutes, i never had a pearly white smile i hope to reach that level with this product but you can easily tell my teeth look brighter after ONE use, it&#x27;s amazing, the only thing i can complain about is that the Led Light didn&#x27;t turned on maybe i should change the batteries but anyways with or without the LED light i highly recommend getting this item, i was a little confused by the instructions so i&#x27;ll leave you some instructions &amp;#34;for dummies&amp;#34; so you don&#x27;t screwed it like i did for not following the right way:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. boil a little bit of water, then put the trays inside the water just for like 4 seconds  (because they must shrink to perfectly fit your teeth) and then place them in your teeth and press so they mold to the shape of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Bush and floss perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Place a liiiiitle bit of gel along each tray (as soon as you put them in your mouth the gel will become foam) that&#x27;s why you must follow the instructions the right way so you don&#x27;t look like a rabie dog and way more important so you can be able to remain  30-40 min with the tray because i think i used way too much gel and saliva was falling al over my chin i couldn&#x27;t stop cleaning my mouth and  it was super unconfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Do this everyday for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. now you&#x27;re one pearly white teeth mdfkr!</li>
            <li> This product will MOST DEFINITELY produce results. The difference I have noticed in the past two weeks are like night and day. This is a MUST if you have any tint to your smile. I use it about 20-30 minutes a day and I dont always get to use it every day but I still see a remarkable improvement. This is one of the easiest, cheapest, most natural way to improve your appearance. You won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:  make sure you get the teeth trays well fitted to your teeth. It is a MUST if you want the gel to be effective so spend the time on it. I also store the gel in the refrigerator to sustain the quality and efficacy of the product.</li>
