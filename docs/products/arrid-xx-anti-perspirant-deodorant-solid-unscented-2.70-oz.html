            <li>Those of us who are allergic to fragrance are very appreciative of this &#x27;fragrance-free&#x27; version of Arrid and the ability to purchase it on Amazon.</li>

            <li>great price quick delivery</li>
            <li>And since its unscented, you can put another deodorant on top of it if you want, in order to smell nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price was great and shipping right on time.</li>
            <li>ArridXX unscented is very effective in keeping you always fresh and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Ideal for those of us who are scent-challenged.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bough a bunch of sticks</li>
            <li>Amazon says I need thirteen more words to finish this review and submit.</li>
            <li>Most stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite .</li>
            <li>Love tit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years &amp; find it is a product that works.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;does not burn the skin.. used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness I was able to order in bulk.  </li>
            <li>She probably will not need any more for a while.</li>
            <li>The maker has a history of changing the odor from time to time, and never for the better - thus my praise of the unscented version.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than those &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;extra-strength&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Easily my favorite deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mitchum brand is much better.</li>
            <li>Have used this brand for many years.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY deodorant that has worked flawlessly for me forever.  </li>
            <li>That was acceptable, I&#x27;m just glad I could get it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised and at a good price.</li>
            <li>I like Arrid brand because it can be washed off easily in the shower, unlike most antiperspirants</li>
            <li>It no longer goes on easy, it feels more like a paste when you put it on, pulling at your skin and sticking it together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Arrid XX Unscented for a decade or more because I don&#x27;t want to smell like cheap cologne, which is what most men&#x27;s anti-perspirant smells like these days.</li>
            <li>We have tried a couple other brands but we like the Arrid XX best.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and isn&#x27;t slimy or flaky.</li>
            <li>My wife has been hunting unsuccessfully for this deodorant for several years and she is thrilled now that she has a good supply.</li>
            <li>Super !</li>
            <li>These were a good price and arrived super fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thankful Amazon still makes this available.</li>
            <li>This is a necessary product for sensitive-skin folks like myself, and I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s available--and so quickly--via Amazon.</li>
            <li>This really worked for me where many, many others did not hold up throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Very effective, and Amazon is the only place I could find the unscented.</li>
            <li>Arrid XX is very effective in reducing/eliminating sweaty and panic-induced (ie final exam) body odors.</li>
            <li>Good for men and women, no perfume and strong enough.</li>
            <li>Original formula lasted all day&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and I am thankful this item has not been significantly changed over the years.</li>
            <li>As I am allergic to most scents put in care products today, I am very grateful to have this product available.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product that is hard to find in my locale.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a male good luck with it pulling that underarm hair out.</li>
            <li>It works so good you only have to use it every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad its unscented too - who wants to smell like deodorant?</li>
            <li>Good enough where I&#x27;m compelled to review something you rub under your arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not like to smell like a flower, I want clean, fresh smell that will stay with you all</li>
            <li>* Mild scent, blocks odor well</li>
            <li>And, quick ship.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good two years now for something similar to Mennen Fresh Scent Antiperspirant (or</li>
            <li>Excellent price and this particular one is not easy to find in stores</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many things and am very sensitive about scents.</li>
            <li>So far it is okay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find a good antiperspirant/deodorant UNSCENTED!  </li>
            <li>If the plastic wrap containing the 6 items had been opened from the other side, I would have returned it then, As it was, from the side we pulled from, the first three to come out of the wrap were perfect, but when the fourth was removed the dial on the bottom dropped off.  </li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deodorant and not a single store by us carries it.  </li>
            <li>Most deodorants are so heavily scented that it&#x27;s overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The cost is reasonable and it was delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is a first:  a stick deodorant that almost hurts when you apply it.</li>
            <li>problem solved by putting on the shirt first, then using the product.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know I could like a deodorant so much!</li>
            <li>I just wish it was easier to find the unscented as so many stores only carry the scented.</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere, Walmart was the first to discontinue, then my grocery stores, all of them...</li>
            <li>After seeing all the positive reviews I gave this product a try.  </li>
            <li>is in much greater quantity than the deodorant portion (the wet glossy stuff), making the consistency very close to the old-fashioned Mennen Fresh Scent Antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>and it is the only one that consistently has an unscented option available.</li>
            <li>If you get caught short and live in the greater Seattle area, you can get it at Bartell&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and it  never has irritated my skin or more nose and works very well for a very long day.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>so the whole family can use it.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, thanks to Amazon, you can locate these &amp;#34;obscure&amp;#34; items.</li>
            <li>The price was quite reasonable for the package of six 2.6 ounce sticks.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything</li>
            <li>, I really recommend you try this one.</li>
            <li>thanks for being there</li>
            <li>I was really upset to find it gone from all stores in my area.</li>
            <li>Right after you put this on, you might notice it if you have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>I must have funky body chemistry that just doesn&#x27;t work with this particular antiperspirant/deodorant.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both like this particular deodorant.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to smell like sports, or mountains, I just want something that keeps me dry and clean.  </li>
            <li>Pay close attention when this as says that the product normally ships within 3-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>After Mennen &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; their Speed Stick Fresh Scent about a year ago by making the product greasy in coverage and overpowering in smell, I searched for a replacement for the deodorant that I used for 20 years, and I finally found it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying all different kinds of antiperspirants/deodorants, this is the only one that fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are not many to chose from as most are scented.</li>
            <li>My item arrived the next day and was exactly what I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful seller.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>This Arrid is acceptable but it leaves more white marks and it doesn&#x27;t work as well or last as long.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find this in &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; so was pleased to get it.</li>
            <li>As far as how well it works?</li>
            <li>The regular version of Arrid XX has an intense perfume ingredient that is abrasive to the nose, even causing sneezing spells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so sensitive to scents</li>
            <li>Thanks for making the size such as to comply with airline carry on baggage rules as well.</li>
            <li>Guess I will have to use them sparingly, (smile), and will try alternating other unscented ones in case I can&#x27;t obtain it again.</li>
            <li>It is getting more and more difficult to locate Arrid Extra dry antiperspirant  without fragrance in stores.  </li>
            <li>New formula doesn&#x27;t last all day&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This is great stuff and almost impossible to find on the store shelves.  </li>
            <li>I prefer Arrid XX because it really works to keep my underarms dry</li>
            <li>one does not have to use very much, but be warned, it does come off on dark shirts or clothing.  </li>
            <li>Most of the other deodrants have excessive smells that are over bearing.  </li>
            <li>I have always used Arrid XX since true unscented is hard to find.  </li>
            <li>It had been her favorite for a long time and was disappointed when it was no longer available.</li>
            <li>This vendor apparently ships this from the middle east on a boat that circumnavigates the globe...twice.</li>

            <li> I have been looking for a good two years now for something similar to Mennen Fresh Scent Antiperspirant (or</li>
            <li> Excellent price and this particular one is not easy to find in stores</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many things and am very sensitive about scents.</li>
            <li> So far it is okay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find a good antiperspirant/deodorant UNSCENTED!  </li>
            <li> If the plastic wrap containing the 6 items had been opened from the other side, I would have returned it then, As it was, from the side we pulled from, the first three to come out of the wrap were perfect, but when the fourth was removed the dial on the bottom dropped off.  </li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deodorant and not a single store by us carries it.  </li>
            <li> Most deodorants are so heavily scented that it&#x27;s overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> The cost is reasonable and it was delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is a first:  a stick deodorant that almost hurts when you apply it.</li>
            <li> problem solved by putting on the shirt first, then using the product.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know I could like a deodorant so much!</li>
            <li> I just wish it was easier to find the unscented as so many stores only carry the scented.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere, Walmart was the first to discontinue, then my grocery stores, all of them...</li>
            <li> After seeing all the positive reviews I gave this product a try.  </li>
            <li> is in much greater quantity than the deodorant portion (the wet glossy stuff), making the consistency very close to the old-fashioned Mennen Fresh Scent Antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> and it is the only one that consistently has an unscented option available.</li>
            <li> If you get caught short and live in the greater Seattle area, you can get it at Bartell&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it  never has irritated my skin or more nose and works very well for a very long day.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> so the whole family can use it.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, thanks to Amazon, you can locate these &amp;#34;obscure&amp;#34; items.</li>
            <li> The price was quite reasonable for the package of six 2.6 ounce sticks.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything</li>
            <li> , I really recommend you try this one.</li>
            <li> thanks for being there</li>
            <li> I was really upset to find it gone from all stores in my area.</li>
            <li> Right after you put this on, you might notice it if you have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> I must have funky body chemistry that just doesn&#x27;t work with this particular antiperspirant/deodorant.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both like this particular deodorant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to smell like sports, or mountains, I just want something that keeps me dry and clean.  </li>
            <li> Pay close attention when this as says that the product normally ships within 3-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> After Mennen &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; their Speed Stick Fresh Scent about a year ago by making the product greasy in coverage and overpowering in smell, I searched for a replacement for the deodorant that I used for 20 years, and I finally found it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying all different kinds of antiperspirants/deodorants, this is the only one that fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are not many to chose from as most are scented.</li>
            <li> My item arrived the next day and was exactly what I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful seller.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> This Arrid is acceptable but it leaves more white marks and it doesn&#x27;t work as well or last as long.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find this in &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; so was pleased to get it.</li>
            <li> As far as how well it works?</li>
            <li> The regular version of Arrid XX has an intense perfume ingredient that is abrasive to the nose, even causing sneezing spells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sensitive to scents</li>
            <li> Thanks for making the size such as to comply with airline carry on baggage rules as well.</li>
            <li> Guess I will have to use them sparingly, (smile), and will try alternating other unscented ones in case I can&#x27;t obtain it again.</li>
            <li> It is getting more and more difficult to locate Arrid Extra dry antiperspirant  without fragrance in stores.  </li>
            <li> New formula doesn&#x27;t last all day&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This is great stuff and almost impossible to find on the store shelves.  </li>
            <li> I prefer Arrid XX because it really works to keep my underarms dry</li>
            <li> one does not have to use very much, but be warned, it does come off on dark shirts or clothing.  </li>
            <li> Most of the other deodrants have excessive smells that are over bearing.  </li>
            <li> I have always used Arrid XX since true unscented is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It had been her favorite for a long time and was disappointed when it was no longer available.</li>
            <li> This vendor apparently ships this from the middle east on a boat that circumnavigates the globe...twice.</li>
            <li> This version brings no odor of its own, thus cannot be found unpleasant by myself or family members.</li>
            <li> This keeps me dry and is totally odorless</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for once again having a product that is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find unscented, thanks.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to buy deodorant for a long while.</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for carrying this product you will be getting another order as long as you keep carrying this.</li>
            <li> xx has been around for a long time and it works quite well without a &amp;quot;smell.&amp;quot;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this as long as Church &amp; Dwight keeps making it.</li>
            <li> This product has the same level of active ingredient as other much more expensive prescription strength deodorant.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby because I was tired of trying to pick out the right scent for my husband...</li>
            <li> Oh well, back to Certain Dri or Secret Clinical.</li>
            <li> , my undershirts immediately turned yellow under the armpit not to mention what that&#x27;ll do to polo or other shirts that I don&#x27;t wear undershirts with.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry</li>
            <li> this will keep you dry without smelling up the joint with perfume and flowers...</li>
            <li> Too wet, takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> (Some of you probably know that the new &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; Mennen Fresh Scent Antiperspirant, which replaced the now discontinued Mennen Fresh Scent Antiperspirant, has an awful smell and is extremely harsh to the skin.  </li>
            <li> You absolutely never sweat or smell while using this product.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t slippery and easy to apply like ordinary Suave stick; it&#x27;s just uncomfortable to apply.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I just get let down and return to my stand by favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like unscented because that is 1 less smell combination with laundry detergent, fabric softener, hand &amp; body lotion, etc.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant lasts way longer, which means I&#x27;m less self-conscious during the summer months.</li>
            <li> There had been no damage to the shipping container and no damage to the items themselves, but half the order is unusable unless we find a way to attach the dials.</li>
            <li> I only bought it because the very expensive , new &amp;#34;Secret Clinical Strength&amp;#34; cream is 1.6 ounces and gone in no time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any guy who dislikes the new, useless Speed Stick Power line of products.</li>
            <li> Not even a little.  </li>
            <li> The unscented version of Arrid XX has become very hard to get in local stores.</li>
            <li> Wallyworld and other retailers stopped stocking this item, at least the unscented version.</li>
            <li> For me this antiperspirant just plain works and has no perfumes.</li>
            <li> again, I have to report that a product is NOT available in the stores in my small town....</li>
            <li> Bought because of glowing reviews but no better than Arm and Hammer.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find it for sale locally, so ordered it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> So long, that I finally had run out of my other deodorant and was forced to buy some scented junk (that my wife hated) until this arrived.</li>
            <li> The unscented smell is literally the smell of nothing, which is hard to find at times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find unscented deodorant which is why I ordered this.</li>
            <li> When it fails, droplets run down, even when not in the heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to go bad or go past its expiration date.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Brands like Michum etc, that has the liquid antiperspirant are uncomfortable and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never breaks down at the worst time and never seems to irritate tender under arms.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s unpleasant to apply.</li>
            <li> Bad Idea</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me, and sweat like crazy, and you hate the way those liquid deodorants fell</li>
            <li> And this is coming from a girl who has a terrible sweating issue.</li>
            <li> This stuff works shockingly well.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very effective, and Amazon is the only place I could find the unscented.</li>
            <li> Very good product. used for over 25 years.  will not switch. Keeps me dry and I can use my colognes with it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this in &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; so was pleased to get it.</li>
            <li> This is a first:  a stick deodorant that almost hurts when you apply it. It isn&#x27;t slippery and easy to apply like ordinary Suave stick; it&#x27;s just uncomfortable to apply. If you&#x27;re a male good luck with it pulling that underarm hair out. As far as how well it works? It&#x27;s ok. I only bought it because the very expensive , new &amp;#34;Secret Clinical Strength&amp;#34; cream is 1.6 ounces and gone in no time. So I bought this to save money and it ended up doing that but it&#x27;s unpleasant to apply. You&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arrid XX Unscented for a decade or more because I don&#x27;t want to smell like cheap cologne, which is what most men&#x27;s anti-perspirant smells like these days. Pay close attention when this as says that the product normally ships within 3-6 weeks. They aren&#x27;t kidding! This vendor apparently ships this from the middle east on a boat that circumnavigates the globe...twice. Took mine around a month to arrive. So long, that I finally had run out of my other deodorant and was forced to buy some scented junk (that my wife hated) until this arrived. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the positive reviews I gave this product a try.  It doesn&#x27;t work for me - at all.  Not even a little.  I must have funky body chemistry that just doesn&#x27;t work with this particular antiperspirant/deodorant.  However, the fact that is doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on your clothes was a definite plus.  Oh well, back to Certain Dri or Secret Clinical.</li>
            <li> Wallyworld and other retailers stopped stocking this item, at least the unscented version. I know not why. I&#x27;m thankful Amazon still makes this available. I even set up a \\&quot;every six month\\&quot; automatic delivery. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to buy deodorant for a long while. The unscented smell is literally the smell of nothing, which is hard to find at times. It does not make my skin itch. I am glad I bough a bunch of sticks so I don&#x27;t have to think about buying for a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t stink so it must work.  Amazon says I need thirteen more words to finish this review and submit.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It truly has zero scent so the whole family can use it.  You absolutely never sweat or smell while using this product.  It is the best out there.  Most stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore so I&#x27;m so glad I can still get it online!</li>
            <li> Wal-mart and Walgreens both quit carrying this product. I don&#x27;t want to smell like perfume so I only use a non-scented deodorant. There are not many to chose from as most are scented. We have tried a couple other brands but we like the Arrid XX best. Thank you Amazon for carrying this product you will be getting another order as long as you keep carrying this.</li>
            <li> hello,&lt;br /&gt;  since our local store stopped carrying the arrid xx unscented, this pack from amazon neatly fills the bill.  arrid xx has been around for a long time and it works quite well without a &amp;quot;smell.&amp;quot;  one does not have to use very much, but be warned, it does come off on dark shirts or clothing.  problem solved by putting on the shirt first, then using the product.  yrmv great product and super delivery.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Original formula lasted all day&lt;br /&gt;* Does not clump&lt;br /&gt;* Mild scent, blocks odor well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* New formula doesn&#x27;t last all day&lt;br /&gt;* When it fails, droplets run down, even when not in the heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this for a while.  I would alternate between regular and unscented.&lt;br /&gt;Then on a refill, it stopped working all day.</li>
            <li> For me this antiperspirant just plain works and has no perfumes. It works so good you only have to use it every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff and almost impossible to find on the store shelves.  Most deodorants are so heavily scented that it&#x27;s overwhelming.  This keeps me dry and is totally odorless</li>
            <li> I have been moving around on deodorant products and finally came to this one recommended by a friend. This really worked for me where many, many others did not hold up throughout the day. Human body chemistry changes as time passes and Arrid XX became the answer.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite . Will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that you can order it here and I plan to do it as soon as I&#x27;m done with the 2 others I got on sale.  If you get caught short and live in the greater Seattle area, you can get it at Bartell&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as what&#x27;s in stores or should I say used to be in the stores.  Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love tit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards.</li>
            <li> Best buy anywhere for Arrid Unscented. And, quick ship. Super !</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for years because it is the only one I found that does not cause me to have an allergic reaction.  My local stores stopped carrying the \\&quot;Unscented\\&quot; version, but thankfully Amazon has it and I can order when I need it.  Also, purchasing this product in a 6-pack was cheaper than buying locally anyway.  Win-Win.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is great if you like unscented deodorant.  It goes on easily and isn&#x27;t slimy or flaky.</li>
            <li> After Mennen &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; their Speed Stick Fresh Scent about a year ago by making the product greasy in coverage and overpowering in smell, I searched for a replacement for the deodorant that I used for 20 years, and I finally found it. I would recommend this to any guy who dislikes the new, useless Speed Stick Power line of products.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that is hard to find in my locale. I have used this product for many years &amp; find it is a product that works.</li>
            <li> Switched to this after mitchum unscented changed their formula.  So far it is okay.</li>
            <li> Best of the best guard. I cannot go for something else.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this deodorant for years, and she loves it. All of a sudden, she couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in the retail stores. I don&#x27;t know why these companies take these great products and &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; them to something so considerably different into something that you hate. Fortunately, thanks to Amazon, you can locate these &amp;#34;obscure&amp;#34; items. Buy in bulk because you never know when the manufacturer will not be making these anymore. Also, the price on these we&#x27;re great, to our surprise .</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product and service.  This is a necessary product for sensitive-skin folks like myself, and I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s available--and so quickly--via Amazon.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of biking this will keep you dry without smelling up the joint with perfume and flowers...&lt;br /&gt;does not burn the skin.. used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> Just what the wife wanted.</li>
            <li> Great price, great protection and no fragrance - used it for years and won&#x27;t change or even try something else.</li>
            <li> works well, great price.</li>
            <li> ArridXX unscented is very effective in keeping you always fresh and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Ideal for those of us who are scent-challenged.</li>
            <li> Who knew this item would be discontinued.  Thank goodness I was able to order in bulk.  Guess I will have to use them sparingly, (smile), and will try alternating other unscented ones in case I can&#x27;t obtain it again.</li>
            <li> My wife has been hunting unsuccessfully for this deodorant for several years and she is thrilled now that she has a good supply. It had been her favorite for a long time and was disappointed when it was no longer available. The price was quite reasonable for the package of six 2.6 ounce sticks. She probably will not need any more for a while. When the time comes, I know where to look for it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for years. It last all day and does not have a scent to it. I like that because you do not have to worry about mixing smells when putting on your perfume. I looked all over and could not find it in a store so was very pleased to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Bought because of glowing reviews but no better than Arm and Hammer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby because I was tired of trying to pick out the right scent for my husband...some just didn&#x27;t smell good on him.  This just takes the guess work out of it and it works just as well as the scented stuff.  I sometimes get a rash from fragranced products and didn&#x27;t like washing my clothes with my husbands clothes because the fragrance ends up in my clothes and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about that a bit, so all around I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the unscented locally.  I like unscented because that is 1 less smell combination with laundry detergent, fabric softener, hand &amp; body lotion, etc.  I like Arrid brand because it can be washed off easily in the shower, unlike most antiperspirants&lt;br /&gt;that form a plastic-like coating which can&#x27;t be washed off &amp; feel yuky.  These were a good price and arrived super fast.  I will order them again when I run out.</li>
            <li> My item arrived the next day and was exactly what I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful seller.</li>
            <li> Never breaks down at the worst time and never seems to irritate tender under arms.</li>
            <li> For those of us with alergies the unscented is the way to go. Very effective deodorant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so hard to find a good antiperspirant/deodorant UNSCENTED!  I don&#x27;t want to smell like sports, or mountains, I just want something that keeps me dry and clean.  Thanks Amazon for once again having a product that is hard to find.  Oh and the value is great, I won&#x27;t need deodorant for a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find unscented deodorant which is why I ordered this.It truly has no scent and it works great.My husband and I both like this particular deodorant.</li>
            <li> I loved the Degree unscented deodorant but unfortunately they stopped making it.  This Arrid is acceptable but it leaves more white marks and it doesn&#x27;t work as well or last as long.  The hunt continues . . .</li>
            <li> The unscented version of Arrid XX has become very hard to get in local stores. Arrid XX is very effective in reducing/eliminating sweaty and panic-induced (ie final exam) body odors. This version brings no odor of its own, thus cannot be found unpleasant by myself or family members. The regular version of Arrid XX has an intense perfume ingredient that is abrasive to the nose, even causing sneezing spells. The maker has a history of changing the odor from time to time, and never for the better - thus my praise of the unscented version.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many things and am very sensitive about scents. I have used this for years and it  never has irritated my skin or more nose and works very well for a very long day.</li>
            <li> Only place we can find this product.</li>
            <li> This product has the same level of active ingredient as other much more expensive prescription strength deodorant. I&#x27;m glad its unscented too - who wants to smell like deodorant?</li>
            <li> I was so thankful to find you could buy deodorant on Amazon, Everyone in town decided to stop selling my Arrid XX&lt;br /&gt;Antiperspirant/Deodorant.  I do not like to smell like a flower, I want clean, fresh smell that will stay with you all day.&lt;br /&gt;It is a winner.  The price was great and shipping right on time.</li>
            <li> Wow!  It really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything AND it works!  WHO KNEW??!!??  I&#x27;m so sensitive to scents and I sing in a chorus where we need to be odor-free on the risers (those lights and those smells can make a girl pass out!) and this deodorant is perfect.  Seriously.  Didn&#x27;t know I could like a deodorant so much!</li>
            <li> Everything as expected.&lt;br /&gt;Very good.&lt;br /&gt;GH</li>
            <li> Too wet, takes forever to dry. Does prevent odor.</li>
            <li> Good product. Hard to find unscented, thanks.</li>
            <li> The best resource....clean and very effective....will buy again.</li>
            <li> Oh my god. Best deodorant ever. Definitely better than those &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;extra-strength&amp;#34; ones. And this is coming from a girl who has a terrible sweating issue. This deodorant lasts way longer, which means I&#x27;m less self-conscious during the summer months.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to go bad or go past its expiration date. KWIM?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this anywhere.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Easily my favorite deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying all different kinds of antiperspirants/deodorants, this is the only one that fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brands like Michum etc, that has the liquid antiperspirant are uncomfortable and itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, and sweat like crazy, and you hate the way those liquid deodorants fell, I really recommend you try this one. I almost don&#x27;t sweat at all when I wear this stuff. And since its unscented, you can put another deodorant on top of it if you want, in order to smell nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find the unscented version in stores and I don&#x27;t care for the scented version, but once again Amazon had my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great stuff.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it has no scent.  Most of the other deodrants have excessive smells that are over bearing.  After searching in the stores I tried the internet and found the product.  The cost is reasonable and it was delivered quickly.  When I use up my current supply I will reorder.</li>
            <li> My memory is definitely failing. . . I stopped using Arrid ages ago but read the reviews and gave it a try.  Bad Idea, my undershirts immediately turned yellow under the armpit not to mention what that&#x27;ll do to polo or other shirts that I don&#x27;t wear undershirts with. Mitchum brand is much better.</li>
            <li> As I am allergic to most scents put in care products today, I am very grateful to have this product available. The antiperspirant/deodorant properties are also excellent. I have used this for years and I am thankful this item has not been significantly changed over the years. Thanks for making the size such as to comply with airline carry on baggage rules as well.</li>
            <li> I have always used Arrid XX since true unscented is hard to find.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Have used this brand for many years.  I was unable to find it for sale locally, so ordered it through Amazon.  Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a deodorant that works as well and Iove the fact that it is unscented. Both me and my husband use it.</li>
            <li> have used it for ears, do not think ou can beat it</li>
            <li> Either this is a counterfeit product, or else Arrid has changed their formula since the last time I purchased this. It simply doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Dependable Arrid at a good price!!!</li>
            <li> Product as described, arrived as promised</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY deodorant that has worked flawlessly for me forever.  But they don&#x27;t sell the unscented in any stores in my area.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deodorant and not a single store by us carries it.  He was so thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff works shockingly well. And you get the added benefit of not smelling like hideous deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My former brand is no longer made, so I tried this based on these Amazon reviews. How good is it? Good enough where I&#x27;m compelled to review something you rub under your arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unscented deodorants aren&#x27;t 100% unscented. Right after you put this on, you might notice it if you have a sensitive nose. But trust me, it doesn&#x27;t smell like fragrance or chemicals. I&#x27;ll buy this as long as Church &amp; Dwight keeps making it.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite!  Has to be the unscented though!!!  I just wish it was easier to find the unscented as so many stores only carry the scented.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need clinical deodorants, this arrid unscented is the best. Great price for the six pack! Good for men and women, no perfume and strong enough.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good two years now for something similar to Mennen Fresh Scent Antiperspirant (or maybe it was Mennen Unscented Antiperspirant, can&#x27;t remember now), and finally I found it, this Arrid XX Antiperspirant/Deodorant.  Arrid XX does not irritate my skin, and there is no scent whatsoever.  And although the label says this is an Antiperspirant/Deodorant, the antiperspirant portion (white powdery stuff) is in much greater quantity than the deodorant portion (the wet glossy stuff), making the consistency very close to the old-fashioned Mennen Fresh Scent Antiperspirant.  (Some of you probably know that the new &amp;#34;Power&amp;#34; Mennen Fresh Scent Antiperspirant, which replaced the now discontinued Mennen Fresh Scent Antiperspirant, has an awful smell and is extremely harsh to the skin.  I suggest you give Arrid XX a try.)</li>
            <li> If the plastic wrap containing the 6 items had been opened from the other side, I would have returned it then, As it was, from the side we pulled from, the first three to come out of the wrap were perfect, but when the fourth was removed the dial on the bottom dropped off.  The fifth and sixth are the same way.  There had been no damage to the shipping container and no damage to the items themselves, but half the order is unusable unless we find a way to attach the dials.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product for years, but it would seem they changed the formula! It no longer goes on easy, it feels more like a paste when you put it on, pulling at your skin and sticking it together. It also seems to have a fruity scent to it now, when it did not before! I don&#x27;t know how they can claim this as &#x27;unscented&#x27; when it is not! I went and bought one from a local store just to see, and it smelled fruity too! I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re thinking, Arrid, but stop it!</li>
            <li> One of the units is unusable as the bottom dial came off</li>
            <li> again, I have to report that a product is NOT available in the stores in my small town....I looked everywhere, Walmart was the first to discontinue, then my grocery stores, all of them...I keep checking, and now it looks like it is in Walmart again...I have to use unscented because of allergies...thanks for being there</li>
            <li> I prefer Arrid XX because it really works to keep my underarms dry and it is the only one that consistently has an unscented option available.</li>
            <li> great price quick delivery</li>
            <li> Excellent price and this particular one is not easy to find in stores</li>
            <li> It is getting more and more difficult to locate Arrid Extra dry antiperspirant  without fragrance in stores.  So being able to purchase the product through Amazon is truly a wonderful thing.  Those of us who are allergic to fragrance are very appreciative of this &#x27;fragrance-free&#x27; version of Arrid and the ability to purchase it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was really upset to find it gone from all stores in my area. So happy to have found it on your site.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for years and it is the only thing that works for me. When I have tried another&lt;br /&gt;product I just get let down and return to my stand by favorite.&lt;br /&gt;It got to me on the 22nd which is only 2 days longer thanestimated. That was acceptable, I&#x27;m just glad I could get it.</li>
            <li> Great unscented product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my order as it arrived in very good shape, well packaged.  I rated this product just the way I feel.</li>
