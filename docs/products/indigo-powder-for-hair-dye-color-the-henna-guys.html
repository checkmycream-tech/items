            <li>The Indigo was GREAT blended with Henna to color my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product, just not for me.  </li>

            <li>Made my hair feeling great and I love the color</li>
            <li>I love this indigo!</li>
            <li>Very good product, very pure.  </li>
            <li>I mix some with Jamila henna and it gives pretty good coverage of my greys!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase, I received my product the next day which was awesome!  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase and will order again.</li>
            <li>I will surely buy this again.</li>
            <li>The best indigo I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>the is an amazing product that worked to cover my grey and provided beautiful highlights in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Wanted to try it to see if it would take the orange out of the gray that the henna takes such good care of, but the brown kind of dulled my look.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy and savings.  </li>
            <li>This was easy to rinse out with water first.</li>
            <li>Next time, I plan on mixing henna and indigo but with more indigo than henna.</li>
            <li>If I was naturally a dark headed red, brown or black, it would be a very good product, but I am more gray than anything now.  </li>
            <li>The product works really well.</li>
            <li>This particular manufacturer has a chart on the Amazon page that tells how much of the Indigo to put with the Henna to get the shade you want.  </li>
            <li>My henna was the Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, 150-gram mixed with Goya coconut milk first.</li>
            <li>I even left it on overnight to make sure it was on long enough.</li>
            <li>This indigo works much much better than Henna black, although my hair is not gray yet , I do have a couple  of white</li>
            <li>The indigo fixed the issue I had with the henna</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and is all one color, my hair is relaxed and dyed.  </li>
            <li>Mixed then let sit for 10 min till a blue/deep green glaze formed on the top.</li>
            <li>The first treatment was equal parts henna and indigo, but my grays pulled too much red.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical about natural hair dyes but after coloring my hair with henna then indigo,I must say I&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li>I am going to grow old in a blaze of red with carrot colored highlights!  </li>
            <li>I only used maybe 3/4 cup of indigo, mixed it with warm tap water to mash potato consistency, did not add salt as some recommended as I was too lazy to go down to the kitchen to get it, then I covered the bowl with my shower cap and let it sit for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I reached a dark color leaning towards a rich black.</li>
            <li>The henna and indigo have transformed my dry brittle hair which is now soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I did the 2-step process, henna first, then a few days later, applied the indigo step to cover the orange color on the roots.</li>
            <li>since my hair color is black with this I got a rich black.</li>

            <li> It had a lot of sticks in it.  It got my hair black, but not super jet black.</li>
            <li> I used this indigo after I henna&#x27;d my hair. I even left it on overnight to make sure it was on long enough. I didn&#x27;t get as black as I wanted &amp; the color didn&#x27;t last long. Will NOT buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> The Indigo was GREAT blended with Henna to color my hair.  Had to use the entire package but that created enough hair color for my mother and my hair.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great buy and savings.  $20 total compared to $180 we would&#x27;ve spent at the salon.</li>
            <li> It does not change your hair color to brown.</li>
            <li> I mix some with Jamila henna and it gives pretty good coverage of my greys!</li>
            <li> Very good product, very pure.  I personally did not like the way it turned my henna dyed red hair, brown.  Wanted to try it to see if it would take the orange out of the gray that the henna takes such good care of, but the brown kind of dulled my look.  If I was naturally a dark headed red, brown or black, it would be a very good product, but I am more gray than anything now.  This particular manufacturer has a chart on the Amazon page that tells how much of the Indigo to put with the Henna to get the shade you want.  Very good to know.  Great product, just not for me.  I am going to grow old in a blaze of red with carrot colored highlights!  FYI, in order for Indigo to take, it has to have the henna to bind it to the hair.  If you don&#x27;t use the henna, the indigo will not change the color of your hair at all.  Read the reviews, the girls give good advise!</li>
            <li> I used this indigo to tone down the red after using a henna and indigo mix. The first treatment was equal parts henna and indigo, but my grays pulled too much red. I did a second treatment with just indigo. I only left it on for about 30 minutes. It toned down the flaring red without making it too dark, but it is a dark brown. Next time, I plan on mixing henna and indigo but with more indigo than henna. If you use just henna and find that it&#x27;s too red, a second treatment of indigo will definitely change the color. Just don&#x27;t leave on for too long, less than 30 minutes. The product works really well.</li>
            <li> I bought this together with the 100% henna to color my dark brown hair. The indigo fixed the issue I had with the henna (I reviewed the henna separately). I did the 2-step process, henna first, then a few days later, applied the indigo step to cover the orange color on the roots. I only used maybe 3/4 cup of indigo, mixed it with warm tap water to mash potato consistency, did not add salt as some recommended as I was too lazy to go down to the kitchen to get it, then I covered the bowl with my shower cap and let it sit for 30 minutes. After that I applied the indigo to my hair - just the roots area with visibly orange color - and let it stand in my hair for 30 minutes (covered with saran wrap). After that, I rinsed the hair in the shower without shampoo but I did have to use conditioner to get rid of the grits from the hair properly. My hair is dark brown with a little bit of dark burgundy highlights in some parts. I loved it! Will continue to use both indigo and henna for regular use moving forward. I will experiment with mixing henna and indigo together as 1-step process next time to see what color I get from it.</li>
            <li> Good product, excellent results</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase, I received my product the next day which was awesome!  I was a bit skeptical about natural hair dyes but after coloring my hair with henna then indigo,I must say I&#x27;m in love!  My hair feels soft and is all one color, my hair is relaxed and dyed.  The henna and indigo have transformed my dry brittle hair which is now soft and shiny.  I would definitely buy again and recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this indigo! It is a great price and mixes well with henna!</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a good timeframe from The Henna Guys. I used this in the 2 step process. My henna was the Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder 9 Herbs Blend, 150-gram mixed with Goya coconut milk first. Then I followed up with this Indigo Powder, 1 tsb of sea salt, 2 tsp of the Nupur henna, and 1 tsp of Gum Guar powder(this helps make the mixture smoother). Mixed then let sit for 10 min till a blue/deep green glaze formed on the top. Applied to my hair(natural African American hair) and let darken for 1 hr 30 min. This was easy to rinse out with water first. Then I did another rinse with moisturizing conditioner. I reached a dark color leaning towards a rich black. I am pleased with this purchase and will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this indigo powder and the seller. Will order again.</li>
            <li> The best indigo I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> Must not have used it correctly, it did not stick or color my hair black.  Will try again soon.</li>
            <li> color just did not take/stay like the other package that I received from them; disappointed!</li>
            <li> Made my hair feeling great and I love the color</li>
            <li> This indigo works much much better than Henna black, although my hair is not gray yet , I do have a couple  of white hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted to make my hair darker and since my hair color is black with this I got a rich black.</li>
            <li> the is an amazing product that worked to cover my grey and provided beautiful highlights in my hair.  I will surely buy this again.</li>
