            <li>The color itself is great - a good</li>
            <li>As with any nail polish make sure your nails do not have any oil or cream on them before applying polish for the best result.</li>
            <li>lashing polish just use CDN vinylux as top coat for best results.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>Good durability.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t changed it for 10 days and still looks good.  </li>
            <li>I loved it and as soon as I returned home</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look good with fair skin time and is not as durable as it claims.</li>
            <li>good staying power, but dries nails out.</li>
            <li>Great color and stays on over 2 weeks using the top coat even when doing the dishes without gloves.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this fact as well as the color assortment.</li>
            <li>I love CND products, and this weekly polish is great for in between salon visits.</li>

            <li>It leaves a nice shine</li>
            <li>Excellent, it really deliver.</li>
            <li>CND Vinylux #132, is a nice neutral color</li>
            <li>This is Greatest nail polish that lasts a full week, removes easily with nail polish remover</li>
            <li>Very easy product to use.</li>
            <li>speedy delivery nice colors, though I wish I could be able to pick the colors</li>
            <li>It was still nice and stayed on over a week with the top coat.</li>
            <li>Thrilled and am buying more colors.</li>
            <li>Almost as durable as shellac, Vinylux is easy to remove!</li>
            <li>I used the polish with the Cnd vinylux top coat and my polish was perfect for nearly two weeks!</li>
            <li>This wonderful patent actually keeps the polish nicely on for 5-7 days, despite water exposure.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with a nice color.</li>
            <li>Love this polish.</li>
            <li>As soon as you do more than two coats it never dries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that by touching up the tips of my nails and reapplying the top coat, I can get about 6 days.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this color would have more substance.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Also, you can get more than 7 days out of this I&#x27;ve gone 10</li>
            <li>Wish it came in more color selections.</li>
            <li>Love the neutral color.</li>
            <li>It also stayed shiny the while week too.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering in more colors.</li>
            <li>I wanted so badly to love this Vinylux concept.  </li>
            <li>but I had hoped for greater wear from this polish.</li>
            <li>Best manicure colors for French.</li>
            <li>overall, CND vinylux is the best polish I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Love the polish, just not this color.  </li>
            <li>I tried Vinylux using Negligee + their top coat.  </li>
            <li>Love the concept</li>
            <li>wear gloves in the garden :)</li>
            <li>I used with the top coat</li>
            <li>Love this color, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;barely pink&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>in addition to the polish and top coat</li>
            <li>B00EA5B2VW CND - VINYLUX TOP COAT Weekly Polish Creative Nail Design Manicure Lacquer 0.5oz]].  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use a top coat.</li>
            <li>Better than intentionally exposing your hands to UV rays then</li>
            <li>Like this polish ..stays on when used with top coat</li>
            <li>Love the color and glossy finish.</li>
            <li>this entire line is excellent!</li>
            <li>Both polish and top coat work well.  </li>
            <li>does not get any better or easier then this.  </li>
            <li>I Love this polish.  </li>
            <li>My nails were perfect for an entire week:) love it.</li>
            <li>I like the Vinylux product much more than acrylic</li>
            <li>Great stuff really lasts a week.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect for the top coat on a french manicure.</li>
            <li>I do get a solid 5 days -- and my nails look awesome!!</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the Vinlyux topcoat too.</li>
            <li>I love that I can put it on by myself,</li>
            <li>just wish a more interesting color selection was offered.  </li>
            <li>My favorite Vinylux color.</li>
            <li>Love this polish.  </li>
            <li>Manicure finally lasted MORE than 7 days!!!  </li>
            <li>The color is great; it is so natural, it will go with everything.</li>
            <li>This is a great polish for a natural look.</li>
            <li>This color did not go on smoothly and also has more &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Loved this polish so much that I bought a set for my friends.</li>
            <li>Thanks vinylux for easy usage and reliability for a fair price.</li>
            <li>and then the polish remover easily removes the rest.</li>
            <li>(and it came off easy with my 100% acetone remover).  </li>
            <li>It applies easily without any lines like some polishes.</li>
            <li>Easily removed with acetone; does not require soaking, scraping or sanding.  </li>
            <li>risky.&lt;br /&gt;However this stuff lasts much better, so I can do a quick polish the day before and even leave it on for a couple days.</li>
            <li>Vinylux is a great product, combining the longevity of a gel manicure and the ease of a traditional manicure.  </li>
            <li>Nice color, dries fast.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great because you can use regular remover too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as durable as the gel manis you get at the salon, but without the UV light or the price.</li>
            <li>No base coat needed</li>
            <li>Acetone free, applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Hope it stays available forever..</li>
            <li>fantastic invention.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the scrub fresh and the top coat.</li>
            <li>After trying it with 2 coats it gives a very nice coverage (not sheer like it looks in the bottle)</li>
            <li>Comes off so quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I love it at first, but discovered it too hurt the nail, was somewhat time consuming, and I worried about the effect of the light on my skin and nail beds.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this  to see if it really does stay on a week--when applied as directed with the Vinylux Top Coat--and if it is easily removed as it claims.</li>
            <li>First manicure lasted almost 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two coats of color and one top coat...</li>
            <li>Vinylux is super, super polish!</li>
            <li>A light pink -- great neutral  color.</li>
            <li>I can get the same colors that  I loved in the original Shellac.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how much I actually liked the color.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have as much problem with an orange  colored polish by Vinylux, so I am not quite sure</li>
            <li>Vinylux is a superior product to standard polishes, it strengthens your nail and does not chip or peel.  </li>
            <li>Acrylic ruined my nails, but Vinylux helps give them more firmness hopefully letting them grow out much stronger.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t get the full 7</li>
            <li>This has just the right touch of pink for a beautiful summer nail.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a natural, easy to apply polish that lasts, this one is top on my list.</li>
            <li>And it dries quick too.</li>
            <li>My favorite Vinylux color by far!!  </li>
            <li>I put three coats of the color on bare nails, then one coat of the top coat and my mani lasts 7-10 days easily.</li>
            <li>A very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied!!</li>
            <li>it dries quickly, stays nice for almost the entire week</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and free shipping.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to remove and leaves nails smooth.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a pretty light pink which is perfect for me since I like the nudes/pinks all year long.</li>
            <li>I have searched and wasted money trying to find the perfect shade of natural nail polish.</li>
            <li>CND&#x27;s Vinylux is the longest-lasting polish I have ever used during many years of almost weekly manicures, and so far it does not seem to damage my nails.</li>
            <li>When used with the weekly top coat, it delivers on it&#x27;s promise of lasting a full week without chipping.  </li>
            <li>The CDN polish is a good product, it stays on longer than other polish, it is a little pricey but looks good.  </li>
            <li>I like this nail polish very much.  </li>
            <li>When I want my thin, fragile nails to have polish but go easy on color, this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quick and easy to change colors (no soaking, just regular polish remover).</li>
            <li>No shimmer, just a perfectly light pink, clean, manicured look!</li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Used along with Top Coat and Studio White.</li>
            <li>When I was  in Las Vegas I treated myself to a manicure and that is where I first was introduced to this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist just told me about this product - this is my first CND Vinylux purchase.  </li>
            <li>First, I manicured and cleaned my nails thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I got compliments on it even 5 days after my first day of application.</li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>all in all it&#x27;s better than regular polish!  </li>
            <li>You HAVE to use the Vinylux Top Coat though - that&#x27;s the key!</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I needed to put 3 coats on to get a more opaque look.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that it tried any faster than any of the other nail polish that I own, and it was chipping within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>It lasts pretty long but the longer your nails are the quicker it chips, even with the top coat.</li>
            <li>The service was great, the color very natural and stylish and it last for a week at least</li>
            <li>Make sure it is 100% acetone though becuase that is the only kind that will really get everything off with little hassle.</li>
            <li>More sheer that appears in pic but still pretty &amp; very natural.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant because polish only lasts a day or two, but this product almost makes it a full week!</li>
            <li>I waited 10 minutes after applying the top coat for everything to dry.  </li>
            <li>and I can easily remove it myself when necessary without damaging my nails--unlike Shellac which requires a lengthy soak in polish remover and manual removal.  </li>
            <li>The color is a very light pink.</li>
            <li>A HUGE improvement over a regular manicure and much easier than salon gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>This product was delivered fast and lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>A polish that really does stay on for a week.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>When it peels off I feel some of my nail comes off as well because my nails have become very week.</li>
            <li>It is so much healthier for your nails then gel polish.  </li>
            <li>A nice everyday color.</li>
            <li>Nice soft pink.  </li>
            <li>It was old and discolored!!!</li>
            <li>I love this color &amp;#34;Negligee&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s very light pink, but with a slight irridescence (pearl).</li>
            <li>It is a nice pink color and it lasts a week which is more than usual for me.</li>
            <li>I dries super fast, no light required, and does last amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this nail polish due to it&#x27;s claims to last a week and relatively good reviews.  </li>
            <li>This nail polish stays shiny and chip free for at least one full week!  </li>
            <li>Lovely sheer color, and it really does last (with the matching topcoat).</li>
            <li>The color did not last a full week...</li>
            <li>I love the Vinylux I have used previously.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t last any better than regular polish.</li>
            <li>It wears particularly well, often times up to two weeks.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to dry, but you can put their top coat on (or I also love Duri Rejuvacote) even if it&#x27;s still a little tacky, and it will dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>it was iridescence which I normally don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>It lasted right at 5 days and then started chipping which beats chipping after the next day with Essie and cover girl polish</li>
            <li>This color of Vinylux polish is a nice subtle shade.  </li>
            <li>But this vinylux chips after a few days like a normal manicure, but it is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Natural look and helps keep my nails stronger!</li>
            <li>I really like the Vinylux polishes since they really do last longer than &#x27;normal&#x27; polish and they dry so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Nice glaze to french manicure, but wears no better than OPI.</li>
            <li>No base coat required, two coats of Vinylux color and then top coat, ten minutes to dry hard</li>
            <li>the color is a little light, but it held up.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, clean looking color.</li>
            <li>If this ends up lasting 7 days, the dry time will be worth it!  </li>
            <li>I also use 2 coats of clear coat over this.</li>
            <li>Makes my hand look soft</li>
            <li>I plan to buy a few more different shades!</li>
            <li>Love this polish, really does last at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Glad my nails grow slowly</li>
            <li>Very light and subtle color</li>
            <li>Light enough to wear everyday; since I live in Wisconsin and it&#x27;s still winter</li>
            <li>It really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It stays on about a week, better than all previous polishes other than gels.</li>
            <li>I got the nail polish in the color &amp;#34;Negligee&amp;#34; (light pink) and the application was not very even.  </li>
            <li>Lasted 2 weeks without major chipping.</li>
            <li>This is a delicate colour and with the top coat looks very soft and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I applied two coats, and it was ok, but not great</li>
            <li>Ordinary polish wears off from the tips of my nails very quickly - I don&#x27;t like to wear polish for very long</li>
            <li>if buying the top coat from this same CND brand would help (I typically use Seche Vite), but I won&#x27;t be purchasing anymore polish from this brand since one was such a let down.</li>
            <li>not dry out nails.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I did find that when removing, after you first add polish remover, it comes off faster if you use another fingernail to scrape a line down the middle of the polish you are removing.</li>
            <li>sheer natural shade that enhances the natural pink of your nail bed.  </li>
            <li>I also have the &amp;#34;Powder My Nose&amp;#34; color, which is much more natural, not even pink, just skin color, which is nice but sort of boring.</li>
            <li>Normally, with other nail polishes, the color begins to chip after 4 days.  </li>
            <li>As far as the color, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for - a pale pink</li>
            <li>It is really clear with a pink shimmery tint.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> great product will keep using it</li>
            <li> Not that great of a product.</li>

            <li> This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> love this color!!</li>
            <li> Very nice development in the world of gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This nail Polish is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing, used with too coat as directed and it  stays on for days with no chips!</li>
            <li> The color itself is great - a good</li>
            <li> As with any nail polish make sure your nails do not have any oil or cream on them before applying polish for the best result.</li>
            <li> lashing polish just use CDN vinylux as top coat for best results.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> Good durability.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t changed it for 10 days and still looks good.  </li>
            <li> I loved it and as soon as I returned home</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look good with fair skin time and is not as durable as it claims.</li>
            <li> good staying power, but dries nails out.</li>
            <li> Great color and stays on over 2 weeks using the top coat even when doing the dishes without gloves.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this fact as well as the color assortment.</li>
            <li> I love CND products, and this weekly polish is great for in between salon visits.</li>
            <li> Nice color ,good transaction</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I ordered three more colors!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this polish, and I am so glad she did!  </li>
            <li> Glad to have a product you can use without lights!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Good authentic item.</li>
            <li> and a nice color.</li>
            <li> This product is nice.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice shine</li>
            <li> Excellent, it really deliver.</li>
            <li> CND Vinylux #132, is a nice neutral color</li>
            <li> This is Greatest nail polish that lasts a full week, removes easily with nail polish remover</li>
            <li> Very easy product to use.</li>
            <li> speedy delivery nice colors, though I wish I could be able to pick the colors</li>
            <li> It was still nice and stayed on over a week with the top coat.</li>
            <li> Thrilled and am buying more colors.</li>
            <li> Almost as durable as shellac, Vinylux is easy to remove!</li>
            <li> I used the polish with the Cnd vinylux top coat and my polish was perfect for nearly two weeks!</li>
            <li> This wonderful patent actually keeps the polish nicely on for 5-7 days, despite water exposure.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with a nice color.</li>
            <li> Love this polish.</li>
            <li> As soon as you do more than two coats it never dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that by touching up the tips of my nails and reapplying the top coat, I can get about 6 days.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this color would have more substance.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Also, you can get more than 7 days out of this I&#x27;ve gone 10</li>
            <li> Wish it came in more color selections.</li>
            <li> Love the neutral color.</li>
            <li> It also stayed shiny the while week too.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering in more colors.</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly to love this Vinylux concept.  </li>
            <li> but I had hoped for greater wear from this polish.</li>
            <li> Best manicure colors for French.</li>
            <li> overall, CND vinylux is the best polish I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Love the polish, just not this color.  </li>
            <li> I tried Vinylux using Negligee + their top coat.  </li>
            <li> Love the concept</li>
            <li> wear gloves in the garden :)</li>
            <li> I used with the top coat</li>
            <li> Love this color, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;barely pink&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> in addition to the polish and top coat</li>
            <li> B00EA5B2VW CND - VINYLUX TOP COAT Weekly Polish Creative Nail Design Manicure Lacquer 0.5oz]].  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use a top coat.</li>
            <li> Better than intentionally exposing your hands to UV rays then</li>
            <li> Like this polish ..stays on when used with top coat</li>
            <li> Love the color and glossy finish.</li>
            <li> this entire line is excellent!</li>
            <li> Both polish and top coat work well.  </li>
            <li> does not get any better or easier then this.  </li>
            <li> I Love this polish.  </li>
            <li> My nails were perfect for an entire week:) love it.</li>
            <li> I like the Vinylux product much more than acrylic</li>
            <li> Great stuff really lasts a week.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect for the top coat on a french manicure.</li>
            <li> I do get a solid 5 days -- and my nails look awesome!!</li>
            <li> Be sure to use the Vinlyux topcoat too.</li>
            <li> I love that I can put it on by myself,</li>
            <li> just wish a more interesting color selection was offered.  </li>
            <li> My favorite Vinylux color.</li>
            <li> Love this polish.  </li>
            <li> Manicure finally lasted MORE than 7 days!!!  </li>
            <li> The color is great; it is so natural, it will go with everything.</li>
            <li> This is a great polish for a natural look.</li>
            <li> This color did not go on smoothly and also has more &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Loved this polish so much that I bought a set for my friends.</li>
            <li> Thanks vinylux for easy usage and reliability for a fair price.</li>
            <li> and then the polish remover easily removes the rest.</li>
            <li> (and it came off easy with my 100% acetone remover).  </li>
            <li> It applies easily without any lines like some polishes.</li>
            <li> Easily removed with acetone; does not require soaking, scraping or sanding.  </li>
            <li> risky.&lt;br /&gt;However this stuff lasts much better, so I can do a quick polish the day before and even leave it on for a couple days.</li>
            <li> Vinylux is a great product, combining the longevity of a gel manicure and the ease of a traditional manicure.  </li>
            <li> Nice color, dries fast.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great because you can use regular remover too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as durable as the gel manis you get at the salon, but without the UV light or the price.</li>
            <li> No base coat needed</li>
            <li> Acetone free, applies smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Hope it stays available forever..</li>
            <li> fantastic invention.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the scrub fresh and the top coat.</li>
            <li> After trying it with 2 coats it gives a very nice coverage (not sheer like it looks in the bottle)</li>
            <li> Comes off so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I love it at first, but discovered it too hurt the nail, was somewhat time consuming, and I worried about the effect of the light on my skin and nail beds.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this  to see if it really does stay on a week--when applied as directed with the Vinylux Top Coat--and if it is easily removed as it claims.</li>
            <li> First manicure lasted almost 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two coats of color and one top coat...</li>
            <li> Vinylux is super, super polish!</li>
            <li> A light pink -- great neutral  color.</li>
            <li> I can get the same colors that  I loved in the original Shellac.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I actually liked the color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have as much problem with an orange  colored polish by Vinylux, so I am not quite sure</li>
            <li> Vinylux is a superior product to standard polishes, it strengthens your nail and does not chip or peel.  </li>
            <li> Acrylic ruined my nails, but Vinylux helps give them more firmness hopefully letting them grow out much stronger.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t get the full 7</li>
            <li> This has just the right touch of pink for a beautiful summer nail.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural, easy to apply polish that lasts, this one is top on my list.</li>
            <li> And it dries quick too.</li>
            <li> My favorite Vinylux color by far!!  </li>
            <li> I put three coats of the color on bare nails, then one coat of the top coat and my mani lasts 7-10 days easily.</li>
            <li> A very pretty color.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied!!</li>
            <li> it dries quickly, stays nice for almost the entire week</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and free shipping.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to remove and leaves nails smooth.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a pretty light pink which is perfect for me since I like the nudes/pinks all year long.</li>
            <li> I have searched and wasted money trying to find the perfect shade of natural nail polish.</li>
            <li> CND&#x27;s Vinylux is the longest-lasting polish I have ever used during many years of almost weekly manicures, and so far it does not seem to damage my nails.</li>
            <li> When used with the weekly top coat, it delivers on it&#x27;s promise of lasting a full week without chipping.  </li>
            <li> The CDN polish is a good product, it stays on longer than other polish, it is a little pricey but looks good.  </li>
            <li> I like this nail polish very much.  </li>
            <li> When I want my thin, fragile nails to have polish but go easy on color, this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quick and easy to change colors (no soaking, just regular polish remover).</li>
            <li> No shimmer, just a perfectly light pink, clean, manicured look!</li>
            <li> Pretty color.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Used along with Top Coat and Studio White.</li>
            <li> When I was  in Las Vegas I treated myself to a manicure and that is where I first was introduced to this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist just told me about this product - this is my first CND Vinylux purchase.  </li>
            <li> First, I manicured and cleaned my nails thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I got compliments on it even 5 days after my first day of application.</li>
            <li> Pretty color.</li>
            <li> all in all it&#x27;s better than regular polish!  </li>
            <li> You HAVE to use the Vinylux Top Coat though - that&#x27;s the key!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I needed to put 3 coats on to get a more opaque look.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that it tried any faster than any of the other nail polish that I own, and it was chipping within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> It lasts pretty long but the longer your nails are the quicker it chips, even with the top coat.</li>
            <li> The service was great, the color very natural and stylish and it last for a week at least</li>
            <li> Make sure it is 100% acetone though becuase that is the only kind that will really get everything off with little hassle.</li>
            <li> More sheer that appears in pic but still pretty &amp; very natural.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant because polish only lasts a day or two, but this product almost makes it a full week!</li>
            <li> I waited 10 minutes after applying the top coat for everything to dry.  </li>
            <li> and I can easily remove it myself when necessary without damaging my nails--unlike Shellac which requires a lengthy soak in polish remover and manual removal.  </li>
            <li> The color is a very light pink.</li>
            <li> A HUGE improvement over a regular manicure and much easier than salon gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered fast and lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> A polish that really does stay on for a week.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> When it peels off I feel some of my nail comes off as well because my nails have become very week.</li>
            <li> It is so much healthier for your nails then gel polish.  </li>
            <li> A nice everyday color.</li>
            <li> Nice soft pink.  </li>
            <li> It was old and discolored!!!</li>
            <li> I love this color &amp;#34;Negligee&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s very light pink, but with a slight irridescence (pearl).</li>
            <li> It is a nice pink color and it lasts a week which is more than usual for me.</li>
            <li> I dries super fast, no light required, and does last amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this nail polish due to it&#x27;s claims to last a week and relatively good reviews.  </li>
            <li> This nail polish stays shiny and chip free for at least one full week!  </li>
            <li> Lovely sheer color, and it really does last (with the matching topcoat).</li>
            <li> The color did not last a full week...</li>
            <li> I love the Vinylux I have used previously.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last any better than regular polish.</li>
            <li> It wears particularly well, often times up to two weeks.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to dry, but you can put their top coat on (or I also love Duri Rejuvacote) even if it&#x27;s still a little tacky, and it will dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> it was iridescence which I normally don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> It lasted right at 5 days and then started chipping which beats chipping after the next day with Essie and cover girl polish</li>
            <li> This color of Vinylux polish is a nice subtle shade.  </li>
            <li> But this vinylux chips after a few days like a normal manicure, but it is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> Natural look and helps keep my nails stronger!</li>
            <li> I really like the Vinylux polishes since they really do last longer than &#x27;normal&#x27; polish and they dry so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Nice glaze to french manicure, but wears no better than OPI.</li>
            <li> No base coat required, two coats of Vinylux color and then top coat, ten minutes to dry hard</li>
            <li> the color is a little light, but it held up.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, clean looking color.</li>
            <li> If this ends up lasting 7 days, the dry time will be worth it!  </li>
            <li> I also use 2 coats of clear coat over this.</li>
            <li> Makes my hand look soft</li>
            <li> I plan to buy a few more different shades!</li>
            <li> Love this polish, really does last at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Glad my nails grow slowly</li>
            <li> Very light and subtle color</li>
            <li> Light enough to wear everyday; since I live in Wisconsin and it&#x27;s still winter</li>
            <li> It really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It stays on about a week, better than all previous polishes other than gels.</li>
            <li> I got the nail polish in the color &amp;#34;Negligee&amp;#34; (light pink) and the application was not very even.  </li>
            <li> Lasted 2 weeks without major chipping.</li>
            <li> This is a delicate colour and with the top coat looks very soft and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I applied two coats, and it was ok, but not great</li>
            <li> Ordinary polish wears off from the tips of my nails very quickly - I don&#x27;t like to wear polish for very long</li>
            <li> if buying the top coat from this same CND brand would help (I typically use Seche Vite), but I won&#x27;t be purchasing anymore polish from this brand since one was such a let down.</li>
            <li> not dry out nails.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I did find that when removing, after you first add polish remover, it comes off faster if you use another fingernail to scrape a line down the middle of the polish you are removing.</li>
            <li> sheer natural shade that enhances the natural pink of your nail bed.  </li>
            <li> I also have the &amp;#34;Powder My Nose&amp;#34; color, which is much more natural, not even pink, just skin color, which is nice but sort of boring.</li>
            <li> Normally, with other nail polishes, the color begins to chip after 4 days.  </li>
            <li> As far as the color, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for - a pale pink</li>
            <li> It is really clear with a pink shimmery tint.</li>
            <li> I almost sent this back but after sitting on it too long I decided for the low cost I may as well keep it.</li>
            <li> It last long, you just need to follow instructions and apply it as directed (youtube has official</li>
            <li> I am  not able to recommend this because the polish chips easily, it is hard to make it look smooth because there isn&#x27;t enough color</li>
            <li> I am hard on my nails and this wares very well.  </li>
            <li> Negligee color is very sheer, a pink color with maybe a hint of lavender.  </li>
            <li> Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;The polish stays on up to 2 weeks as long as I wear rubber gloves to wash dishes.  </li>
            <li> I will be using it for a long time</li>
            <li> If you want something clear with a slight pink tint, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Drying time is about the same as other polishes.</li>
            <li> At this point, my nails were dry to the touch, but if you bump them into anything, you&#x27;ll get a mark.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea about the &amp;#34;sunshine curing&amp;#34; property, but it does seem to last a little longer than drug store polish.  </li>
            <li> Quality was as expected.</li>
            <li> If you think you&#x27;ll get an opaque pink, you won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It last less then a week .last less than a week.</li>
            <li> not good cover, clear.</li>
            <li> This is not like other Vinylux nail polish that I ha used.</li>
            <li> I need to check out the other colors.  </li>
            <li> I usually have chips even after 1 day using regular polish.  </li>
            <li> It is a little lighter than expected</li>
            <li> Well worth using and cutting out the salon visits for every manicure.</li>
            <li> I love that you don&#x27;t need a base coat with this.</li>
            <li> - I used to quickly polish my nails just for an event and remove it after the event to let my poor thin nails breathe.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying some other shades!</li>
            <li> (I started to see some wear at nail edges and less shiny appearance at 6 days of wearing)  </li>
            <li> peels off in sheets in less than 24n hrs.</li>
            <li> but you can apply few coats.</li>
            <li> After a few years without, I swapped to shellac.</li>
            <li> which is messy and</li>
            <li> the base is starting to show too much.</li>
            <li> Within 4-5 days I had some slight lifting around the cuticle area and some small chips along the tips.  </li>
            <li> Very pale but little coverage; you can see you nails underneath.</li>
            <li> The thicker coverage is stronger than the usual stuff so my nails don&#x27;t chip or break and grow out.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> (I have a lot of nail polish from various salon brands, and I was not impressed with this).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m so very pale</li>
            <li> It lasts at least a week.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet of staying power!</li>

            <li> They have limited colors is a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> not a good value, this product is made in Mexico.</li>
            <li> I am very hard on my hands and this polish lasts thru all that I do.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a great shade for me.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s not that expensive</li>
            <li> I was once a fake nail girl.</li>
            <li> I applied the base coat, and then two coats of the nail color, waiting a few minutes between each coat.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, time-consuming, toxic and destructive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s basically impossible to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the Negligee color however, as it is noticably streaky.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this polish. It lasts at least a week. Comes off so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Pretty color. Natural look and helps keep my nails stronger!</li>
            <li> the color is a little light, but it held up.</li>
            <li> perfect color for my nails. Wears as promised. My manicure lasted 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Won&#x27;t be without it!!</li>
            <li> 2.5 weeks and still perfect. Glad my nails grow slowly</li>
            <li> Too see-through to wear without 4 coats. As soon as you do more than two coats it never dries. So it&#x27;s basically impossible to use this product.</li>
            <li> Vinylux is a great product, combining the longevity of a gel manicure and the ease of a traditional manicure.  No base coat required, two coats of Vinylux color and then top coat, ten minutes to dry hard and you&#x27;re good to go.  While I wouldn&#x27;t agree that the polish lasts 7 days, it does last several without chips or wear.  I&#x27;ve found that by touching up the tips of my nails and reapplying the top coat, I can get about 6 days.  Stays shiny and doesn&#x27;t peel like gel can.  Comes off with regular acetone.  A HUGE improvement over a regular manicure and much easier than salon gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Negligee color is very sheer, a pink color with maybe a hint of lavender.  A nice everyday color.</li>
            <li> Product exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> I was hoping this color would have more substance. It is really clear with a pink shimmery tint. It lasts pretty long but the longer your nails are the quicker it chips, even with the top coat.</li>
            <li> Great nail polish I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Good authentic item. Quality was as expected. It last long, you just need to follow instructions and apply it as directed (youtube has official video)&lt;br /&gt;Its sheer but you can apply few coats.Stays about 10 days. Great! Will order again.</li>
            <li> Nice color, dries fast. Not sure yet of staying power!</li>
            <li> Color is VERY sheer, I guess that is why it&#x27;s called negligee. Did not realize that when I ordered it. Good durability.</li>
            <li> Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;The polish stays on up to 2 weeks as long as I wear rubber gloves to wash dishes.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this polish!!! It lasts for 2+ wks w/o chipping!!! The color is great; it is so natural, it will go with everything.</li>
            <li> I almost sent this back but after sitting on it too long I decided for the low cost I may as well keep it. I was surprised how much I actually liked the color. I didn&#x27;t realize in the photo it was iridescence which I normally don&#x27;t like. After trying it with 2 coats it gives a very nice coverage (not sheer like it looks in the bottle) and it&#x27;s a pretty light pink which is perfect for me since I like the nudes/pinks all year long. Also, you can get more than 7 days out of this I&#x27;ve gone 10 and it&#x27;s great because you can use regular remover too! I bought the OPI Gel lamp for my Gel polish but when I don&#x27;t want to deal with the time consuming removal this is a great polish! Wish it came in more color selections. I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> When I want my thin, fragile nails to have polish but go easy on color, this is the perfect solution. The thicker coverage is stronger than the usual stuff so my nails don&#x27;t chip or break and grow out. Almost as durable as shellac, Vinylux is easy to remove! Well worth using and cutting out the salon visits for every manicure.</li>
            <li> I like this polish because although it lasts a  bit longer than tradtional nail polish you can still take it off with nail polish remover. Make sure it is 100% acetone though becuase that is the only kind that will really get everything off with little hassle.</li>
            <li> This lasted the 7 days before chipping just as promised! Love the neutral color. It also stayed shiny the while week too.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering in more colors.</li>
            <li> As advertised -- looks great and stays on.  Haven&#x27;t changed it for 10 days and still looks good.  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> speedy delivery nice colors, though I wish I could be able to pick the colors</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s almost as durable as the gel manis you get at the salon, but without the UV light or the price. It doesn&#x27;t damage your nails, and I&#x27;ve had 5 days with no chips. I use an acetone nail polish remover when I switch out my polish. I also use 2 coats of clear coat over this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this color would be so sheer.  It was still nice and stayed on over a week with the top coat. A very pretty color.</li>
            <li> This is not like other Vinylux nail polish that I ha used. I am wondering if it is a knock off. The reviews said negligee was sheer. This goes on streaky white and is not sheer. After 2 coats it is still streaky. I love the Vinylux I have used previously. I just don&#x27;t think this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly to love this Vinylux concept.  The color itself is great - a good any occasion color that is perfect for dress or work or whenever.  But the polish did NOT last a week.  Within 4-5 days I had some slight lifting around the cuticle area and some small chips along the tips.  I guess it&#x27;s not that expensive so it&#x27;s no big deal but I had hoped for greater wear from this polish.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with a nice color. Lasted 2 weeks without major chipping. A great buy. and a nice color.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Manicure finally lasted MORE than 7 days!!!  Used along with Top Coat and Studio White. Best manicure colors for French.</li>
            <li> I used the polish with the Cnd vinylux top coat and my polish was perfect for nearly two weeks! This is the only polish I&#x27;ll be using from now on!</li>
            <li> overall, CND vinylux is the best polish I&#x27;ve ever used.  Love the polish, just not this color.  Although it says no bottom coat needed, maybe that&#x27;s what this color needs</li>
            <li> I tried Vinylux using Negligee + their top coat.  It didn&#x27;t last but 3 days before it started peeling at the tips.  Love the concept but they haven&#x27;t nailed it yet.</li>
            <li> This is a delicate colour and with the top coat looks very soft and is long lasting. My manicures can go 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am simply smitten with my recent (how did I just learn of this:!:!) discovery of Vinylux. I was once a fake nail girl. Expensive, time-consuming, toxic and destructive. After a few years without, I swapped to shellac. I love it at first, but discovered it too hurt the nail, was somewhat time consuming, and I worried about the effect of the light on my skin and nail beds. THIS stuff is the bomb. I dries super fast, no light required, and does last amazingly well. My nails peel and chip within a day with regular polish. This stuff is the bomb. So happy. I haven&#x27;t kept it on a week yet. It&#x27;s so quick and easy to change colors (no soaking, just regular polish remover). Love it!</li>
            <li> The CDN polish is a good product, it stays on longer than other polish, it is a little pricey but looks good.  They have limited colors is a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last any better than regular polish. won&#x27;t purchase again. not a good value, this product is made in Mexico. I did not realize that before I purchased it</li>
            <li> This polish lasts over a week no chipping peeling at all.</li>
            <li> Gel will ruin your nails this will help you move forward and will last 6-7 days and simply remove with regular remover is seconds and start again- Waiting for the salons in my area to start using!</li>
            <li> I buy this polish and bring it with me to the salon. You must use it with the matching topcoat. It is a nice pink color and it lasts a week which is more than usual for me.</li>
            <li> I have searched and wasted money trying to find the perfect shade of natural nail polish. This has just the right touch of pink for a beautiful summer nail. Warning ... It takes a long time to dry, but you can put their top coat on (or I also love Duri Rejuvacote) even if it&#x27;s still a little tacky, and it will dry very quickly. Beautiful shine and beautiful color.</li>
            <li> Stays on 7-10 days! Applies and removes like regular nail polish. Doesn&#x27;t chip and has beautiful finish. Great nail polish!</li>
            <li> Great color and stays on over 2 weeks using the top coat even when doing the dishes without gloves.  No base coat needed</li>
            <li> When I was  in Las Vegas I treated myself to a manicure and that is where I first was introduced to this product.  I loved it and as soon as I returned home I ordered this nail polish. Great stuff!  The only thing is it is difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied!! It was old and discolored!!!</li>
            <li> It works great.  I need to check out the other colors.  wear gloves in the garden :)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is nice. The color is a very light pink. Since I&#x27;m so very pale it&#x27;s not a great shade for me.</li>
            <li> I love that you don&#x27;t need a base coat with this. I used with the top coat and it almost never chips! At about 2 weeks, I have to remove only because the fingernail is growing out and the base is starting to show too much. I did find that when removing, after you first add polish remover, it comes off faster if you use another fingernail to scrape a line down the middle of the polish you are removing. It&#x27;s like it makes a break in the barrier and then the polish remover easily removes the rest. Loved this polish so much that I bought a set for my friends.</li>
            <li> This is Greatest nail polish that lasts a full week, removes easily with nail polish remover no filing necessary, which weakens nails!</li>
            <li> This product was delivered fast and lived up to my expectations. It is a little lighter than expected but I don&#x27;t mind putting on an extra coat.</li>
            <li> Love this color, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;barely pink&amp;#34; sheer natural shade that enhances the natural pink of your nail bed.  When used with the weekly top coat, it delivers on it&#x27;s promise of lasting a full week without chipping.  I plan to buy a few more different shades!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist just told me about this product - this is my first CND Vinylux purchase.  I decided to purchase the base coat [[ASIN:B0002Q8W9I NEW cnd Nail Design Stickey Base Coat 0.33Oz]] in addition to the polish and top coat [[ASIN:B00EA5B2VW CND - VINYLUX TOP COAT Weekly Polish Creative Nail Design Manicure Lacquer 0.5oz]].  First, I manicured and cleaned my nails thoroughly.  I applied the base coat, and then two coats of the nail color, waiting a few minutes between each coat.  I waited 10 minutes after applying the top coat for everything to dry.  At this point, my nails were dry to the touch, but if you bump them into anything, you&#x27;ll get a mark.  I had to redo one nail because of this (and it came off easy with my 100% acetone remover).  If this ends up lasting 7 days, the dry time will be worth it!  I plan to update after 7 days to give my final opinion.  I usually have chips even after 1 day using regular polish.  As far as the color, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for - a pale pink (I think it has lavender hues) that is semi-sheer.  I&#x27;ve attached a photo of my nails after one day so you can see the color!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Today is day 5 and NO chips!!</li>
            <li> A  friend recommended this polish to me. This is a great polish for a natural look. It lasted me for a week without chipping. Drying time is about the same as other polishes. It leaves a nice shine so I don&#x27;t use a top coat. It applies easily without any lines like some polishes. If you are looking for a natural, easy to apply polish that lasts, this one is top on my list. As with any nail polish make sure your nails do not have any oil or cream on them before applying polish for the best result.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Acetone free, applies smoothly.  Looks great and protects the nails!</li>
            <li> Long lasting, clean looking color. I got compliments on it even 5 days after my first day of application. I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Lovely sheer color, and it really does last (with the matching topcoat). I ordered three more colors! Very nice development in the world of gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> Light enough to wear everyday; since I live in Wisconsin and it&#x27;s still winter I have no idea about the &amp;#34;sunshine curing&amp;#34; property, but it does seem to last a little longer than drug store polish.  Better than intentionally exposing your hands to UV rays then all the chemicals required to remove the shells.  I would purchase and use again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have gel or acrylic nails.  I am an obsessive gardener and cook.  This nail polish stays shiny and chip free for at least one full week!  Amazing.</li>
            <li> The perfect shade for summer (and all times of the year)...it&#x27;s neutral and goes with everything. and also doesn&#x27;t show noticeable chips.</li>
            <li> Like this polish ..stays on when used with top coat</li>
            <li> I am  not able to recommend this because the polish chips easily, it is hard to make it look smooth because there isn&#x27;t enough color so it streaks.  I followed the directions to the T and it&#x27;s a great idea, but it&#x27;s not a substitute for a gel manicure.  I really wanted to quit Gel Nails because I think over time it is harsh on the nail itself....the soaking in acetone, the removal of the polish, etc....But this vinylux chips after a few days like a normal manicure, but it is easy to remove.  I didn&#x27;t have as much problem with an orange  colored polish by Vinylux, so I am not quite sure if it&#x27;s the Negligee color or what.</li>
            <li> Love the color and glossy finish. Fast shipping and free shipping. It lasted right at 5 days and then started chipping which beats chipping after the next day with Essie and cover girl polish</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t brush evenly.</li>
            <li> Pleas read my comments on the brown red color......this entire line is excellent! Hope it stays available forever..I will be using it for a long time</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this nail polish due to it&#x27;s claims to last a week and relatively good reviews.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  I got the nail polish in the color &amp;#34;Negligee&amp;#34; (light pink) and the application was not very even.  I applied two coats, and it was ok, but not great (I have a lot of nail polish from various salon brands, and I was not impressed with this).  I didn&#x27;t think that it tried any faster than any of the other nail polish that I own, and it was chipping within a couple of days.  I&#x27;m not sure if buying the top coat from this same CND brand would help (I typically use Seche Vite), but I won&#x27;t be purchasing anymore polish from this brand since one was such a let down.</li>
            <li> Both polish and top coat work well.  I am hard on my nails and this wares very well.  Lasts a week on me.</li>
            <li> Vinylux is a superior product to standard polishes, it strengthens your nail and does not chip or peel.  Easily removed with acetone; does not require soaking, scraping or sanding.  Try it once and you&#x27;ll be a believer. First manicure lasted almost 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two coats of color and one top coat... does not get any better or easier then this.  Must try, great product!</li>
            <li> A polish that really does stay on for a week.  I am very hard on my hands and this polish lasts thru all that I do.  VERY happy customer.  And it dries quick too.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of CND Vinylux. It lasts just about a week without chipping.  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I Love this polish.  You must use a base coat.</li>
            <li> fantastic invention.  the look and durability of gel without the trashed nailbeds!</li>
            <li> Love this polish, really does last at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Excellent, it really deliver. My nails were perfect for an entire week:) love it.</li>
            <li> Its a sheer nail polish that does not impress me whatsoever.  Doesn&#x27;t look good with fair skin time and is not as durable as it claims.</li>
            <li> More sheer that appears in pic but still pretty &amp; very natural.  Did 2 coats so next time I will try 3. Lasted almost 2 weeks!  Thrilled and am buying more colors.</li>
            <li> Nice color ,good transaction</li>
            <li> Oh, my goodness.  This stuff WORKS!</li>
            <li> The service was great, the color very natural and stylish and it last for a week at least</li>
            <li> This is a very sheer polish and probably is intended to be part of a french manicure, but I have very short nails and I just wear it alone - I&#x27;m amazed that it holds up as well as it does.  Ordinary polish wears off from the tips of my nails very quickly - I don&#x27;t like to wear polish for very long - I used to quickly polish my nails just for an event and remove it after the event to let my poor thin nails breathe.  However, if I polish the night before, it actually would start chipping and wearing off the tips before I even WENT to the event the next day, so I&#x27;d have to polish just before leaving. which is messy and risky.&lt;br /&gt;However this stuff lasts much better, so I can do a quick polish the day before and even leave it on for a couple days.</li>
            <li> This color is almost transparent.  I like the Vinylux product much more than acrylic it&#x27;s much easier to remove and leaves nails smooth.  Acrylic ruined my nails, but Vinylux helps give them more firmness hopefully letting them grow out much stronger.</li>
            <li> Nice soft pink.  Needed two coats.</li>
            <li> My favorite Vinylux color by far!!  My mom even loves it and she is 79!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant because polish only lasts a day or two, but this product almost makes it a full week!</li>
            <li> This nail Polish is amazing! It really lasts a long time. I&#x27;m very impressed with it. I will be buying some other shades!</li>
            <li> I like the vinylux products and haven&#x27;t found them in salons yet. This is a soft, sheer pink. I like it and it does last about a week if you wear gloves while cleaning.</li>
            <li> Pretty color. Very pale but little coverage; you can see you nails underneath. If you want something clear with a slight pink tint, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Great stuff really lasts a week.</li>
            <li> This olish lasts forever and doesn&#x27;t chip!!!</li>
            <li> great product will keep using it</li>
            <li> I have been using it for quite awhile and I find that it stays on my nails for two weeks without chipping.</li>
            <li> good staying power, but dries nails out.</li>
            <li> not good cover, clear.</li>
            <li> I really like the Vinylux polishes since they really do last longer than &#x27;normal&#x27; polish and they dry so quickly.  I was disappointed in the Negligee color however, as it is noticably streaky.</li>
            <li> Not that great of a product.</li>
            <li> This polish is translucent. It would be perfect for the top coat on a french manicure. If you think you&#x27;ll get an opaque pink, you won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a photo of my nails with three coats applied.</li>
            <li> Great color that stays on!</li>
            <li> CND Vinylux #132, is a nice neutral color</li>
            <li> Keeps shine like glass.&lt;br /&gt;Resists chipping up to 6-7 days or longer if you are just hanging out at the beach.&lt;br /&gt;Comes off with acetone.&lt;br /&gt;Does not dry out nails.&lt;br /&gt;Great alternative to Shellac</li>
            <li> This wonderful patent actually keeps the polish nicely on for 5-7 days, despite water exposure. Thanks vinylux for easy usage and reliability for a fair price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. A light pink -- great neutral  color. Very easy product to use. While I don&#x27;t get the full 7 days-- I do get a solid 5 days -- and my nails look awesome!! I&#x27;m hooked. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Product arrive as promised. The color did not last a full week...all in all it&#x27;s better than regular polish!  Thanks</li>
            <li> This Polish stayed on for 5 day and more.&lt;br /&gt;Long lashing polish just use CDN vinylux as top coat for best results.</li>
            <li> CND&#x27;s Vinylux is the longest-lasting polish I have ever used during many years of almost weekly manicures, and so far it does not seem to damage my nails. I do not use gels or acrylics, which do cause damage, so this is a great product for me.  This week I am trying this color with French tips underneath. Be sure to use the Vinlyux topcoat too.</li>
            <li> I love this color &amp;#34;Negligee&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s very light pink, but with a slight irridescence (pearl). I also have the &amp;#34;Powder My Nose&amp;#34; color, which is much more natural, not even pink, just skin color, which is nice but sort of boring. Now I have both! Vinylux is super, super polish! I put three coats of the color on bare nails, then one coat of the top coat and my mani lasts 7-10 days easily. You HAVE to use the Vinylux Top Coat though - that&#x27;s the key!</li>
            <li> I used to get Shellac at my mani/pedi&#x27;s but I am not supposed to wear nail polish at my job.  I read about this in a magazine (it is made by same company that makes the Shellac). I decided to try this  to see if it really does stay on a week--when applied as directed with the Vinylux Top Coat--and if it is easily removed as it claims. It DOES!  I love that I can put it on by myself, it dries quickly, stays nice for almost the entire week (I started to see some wear at nail edges and less shiny appearance at 6 days of wearing)  and I can easily remove it myself when necessary without damaging my nails--unlike Shellac which requires a lengthy soak in polish remover and manual removal.  Also like that I can get the same colors that  I loved in the original Shellac.  This is great stuff.</li>
            <li> This color of Vinylux polish is a nice subtle shade.  It wears particularly well, often times up to two weeks.</li>
            <li> I like this nail polish very much.  It stays on about a week, better than all previous polishes other than gels. Air dries and can be removed with regular nail polish remover. Unlike gels.</li>
            <li> like it but lackluster.  just wish a more interesting color selection was offered.  but product came on time.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this polish, and I am so glad she did!  Normally, with other nail polishes, the color begins to chip after 4 days.  With Vinylux it lasts way over 10 days.  I am very pleased with this fact as well as the color assortment.</li>
            <li> For me, it stayed on for a week.  Makes my hand look soft</li>
            <li> My favorite Vinylux color. No shimmer, just a perfectly light pink, clean, manicured look!</li>
            <li> This color did not go on smoothly and also has more &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;.  I was hoping it would be closer to Ballet Slippers but will have to try another color.</li>
            <li> Like the color!  Glad to have a product you can use without lights!</li>
            <li> Nice glaze to french manicure, but wears no better than OPI.</li>
            <li> Amazing, used with too coat as directed and it  stays on for days with no chips! Love it! Very light and subtle color</li>
            <li> peels off in sheets in less than 24n hrs. I ordered the scrub fresh and the top coat. When it peels off I feel some of my nail comes off as well because my nails have become very week.</li>
            <li> I love CND products, and this weekly polish is great for in between salon visits. I wash my hands vigorously and quite often at work, and regular nail polish doesn&#x27;t even last a day. This will actually last me all week. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I needed to put 3 coats on to get a more opaque look. But otherwise I loved it!</li>
            <li> love this color!! goes on well and lasts 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> Only lasted 2 days... my bottle must be defective.  whack</li>
            <li> Polish chipped after a day</li>
            <li> Love this polish.  It is so much healthier for your nails then gel polish.  Will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> It last less then a week .last less than a week.</li>
