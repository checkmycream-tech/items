            <li>Nice containers, thank you!</li>

            <li>The caps fit perfect.</li>
            <li>all of the lids fit perfectly and i didn&#x27;t have any issues with any of the tubes.</li>

            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>These lip balm containers are satisfactory but not as good as others I have purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great for making all your favorite lip balms.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very pleased.</li>
            <li>I loved making my own chapstick.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>came very quick great price ..</li>
            <li>Worked great, no leaks and dials turn easily.</li>
            <li>I was given an arrival date range of 12-3 to 12-27, and amazingly I received them on the 3rd!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, of the 50 tubes</li>
            <li>Perfect size and work really well.</li>
            <li>Bought them for a friend that makes her own chapstick.</li>
            <li>I bought those to make my owl vegan allergy free cruelty free lip gloss and they are great, good finish and good quality of the tubs.</li>
            <li>My daughter wanted to make her own chapsticks</li>
            <li>Caps come in their own bag, so you don&#x27;t have to disassemble the tubes before filling.</li>
            <li>Exaclyt what i wanted, remember to order stickers with them if your not going to make your own</li>
            <li>I love to make lip balm and giving them as gifts and just having a nice stash that I never run out of.</li>
            <li>I know what a good cap fit should feel like with an audible snap after pushing the cap on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can surely still use it, and I have no complaints about the quality of the product, but I would have liked to have known what to expect.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of being able to see the product I put inside them</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rather than trying to pour into these, I used a very cheap disposable plastic pipette.</li>
            <li>They really worked great.</li>
            <li>and then the lip balm will end up getting stuck to the inside top of the cap.</li>
            <li>and we like being able to see the fill level.</li>
            <li>I love these tubes.  </li>
            <li>The price is great and the product is of good quality provided the proper amount is received.</li>
            <li>I love these tubs.  </li>
            <li>The kids love they can see the color of the lip-balm and sparkles when added .</li>
            <li>Great price will buy from this company again fast shipping.</li>
            <li>they tend to twist up in a pocket, more than tubes i&#x27;ve gotten elsewhere, but does the trick</li>
            <li>and I love these as opposed to opaque tubes because you can see the color.</li>
            <li>I think the product description needs to mention that not all orders will be &amp;#34;as pictured&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;as described&amp;#34; before more people receive something they weren&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li>All the containers are complete and they look like they are I good condition also!</li>
            <li>Over all this is a great product when you are making your own lip balms or such.</li>
            <li>This is a great simple product that allows me to make my own lip balms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having so much fun making my own lip balm.</li>
            <li>Caps come off easily, and the tubes roll up too easily as well, to where it will roll up just from being in your pocket</li>
            <li>Also, when you get to the end of a tube, it will fall out easily as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and as advertised.</li>
            <li>These tubes are great and I will certainly be back for more.</li>
            <li>Otherwise these tubes are absolutely fine</li>
            <li>Great for those starting out who don&#x27;t need huge quantities of lip balm tubes.</li>
            <li>You can tell that this is a cheaply made item.</li>
            <li>However, in my case I&#x27;m using them as free gifts for family members and they don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>I asked the seller if they were BPA free</li>
            <li>Kinda cheap...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I filled 20 of these up with homemade chapstick (a recipe with beeswax, coconut oil, and cocoa butter).</li>
            <li>They arrived in a timely manner, looked good,and caps fit well.</li>
            <li>these tubes worked perfect for my homemade chap sticks, and since they are plain, you can decorate them any way you want.</li>
            <li>If you are going to make your own lip balm, I highly recommend these tubes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not flimsy, lids fit nice, overall satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>We made our first batch and love it.</li>
            <li>Nice clear containers!</li>
            <li>The price is still great for 43 tubes, but I made the mistake of pouring into some of the tubes before realizing they were jammed.</li>
            <li>I had let it cool for a minute or two off the heat, but it was still rather warm and completely liquid.</li>
            <li>Great price, however the caps come off way too easily with very little effort.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are cheap and look good, so I guess they deserve a couple stars.</li>
            <li>these are good little tubes, except the caps don&#x27;t fit super snug on the bottom part.</li>
            <li>We were not missing any tubes or caps that was very important to us.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Another this is these are a bit cheap(not unexpected) but they twist up way to easily.</li>
            <li>after reading other reviews, i made sure all the lids fit first.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Be aware though, these ship from China, so you need to factor in a couple weeks for shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought this order of 50 transparent lip balm tubes (along with 50 transparent tubes with white caps but from another, much better seller) and they were all varying in size and quality.</li>
            <li>This was not a problem for me, but be aware.</li>
            <li>These hold up quite well to the melted wax and hot oils that are in my homemade lip balm.  </li>
            <li>These tubes do not look pretty with lip balm in them, so if you want it to look glamorous</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m attempting to make my first homemade batch of lip balm.</li>
            <li>well when they are interested in the look of the beeswax.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Complaint is that I wish the caps snapped on better, because sometimes I feel like it&#x27;s going to lose its top</li>
            <li>These are a great bargain, however the caps don&#x27;t click for a no worry stay on the tube and twice today I&#x27;ve had to roll my lip balm back down because it rolls itself up while in my pocket.</li>
            <li>However the lids on these don&#x27;t stay on very well.</li>
            <li>For others who aren&#x27;t paying very close attention, these ship from China.</li>
            <li>This worked really well for me, I can&#x27;t imagine trying to pour into these things without a holder stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the look of these tubes, but will be looking for another option ASAP.</li>
            <li>Working quickly, I was able to get 20 filled before it hardened in the pipette (occasionally running my fingers down it to push remaining wax/oil out of it while it was still soft).</li>
            <li>I was looking for a moderate number of tubes to test a new project and these were affordable and looked like they would fit my needs.  </li>
            <li>I got exactly what I ordered, clear plastic lip balm containers.  </li>
            <li>My recipe was for a more solid product at room temperature, which may have contributed to this, but the fact that it was only some of them makes me think it&#x27;s a design/consistency</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Kinda thought they would be a little better for the money...</li>
            <li>They function just like normal chapstick tubes.</li>
            <li>It was a new idea for teacher gifts for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed as it clearly states that these are CLEAR/transparent and the picture also shows clear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just really disappointing that I trusted that these would be worth the moneyâmy moneyâand that the manufacturer and seller clearly don&#x27;t care if their customers get good products.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, 13 OF 25 SO FAR HAVE LEAKED!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not super high quality, and there are some obvious manufacturing differences between them, but for the price and amount I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>I filled half my tubes then had to spend 20 mins swapping lids till i got them all matched up.</li>
            <li>Generally speaking, these are decent.</li>
            <li>I like that they were clear.</li>
            <li>So far no leaks when pouring the chapstick into them.  </li>
            <li>The real issue arose when I put the caps on the tubes to ensure there was the proper amount of each</li>
            <li>7 of them are completely unusable.</li>
            <li>If i keep one in my pocket for a day it will be turned up as far as it can go.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say that these ended up being even remotely high-quality or useable, but I guess I just expected more than what these delivered.</li>
            <li>I wrote the email to avoid leaving a poor review for the benefit of the company, not my own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite this hiccup, they&#x27;re exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given the filled tubes out to dozens of people and am not aware of even a single tube failing on anyone.  </li>
            <li>only clear.  </li>
            <li>These empty lip balm containers are very flimsy and the caps do not stay on.</li>
            <li>caps seal tightly, not loose.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the other 25 yet as I really needed these to be done</li>
            <li>The only downside was that some caps are clear and others are white.  </li>
            <li>What I mean by that is that some of the caps fit some tubes tighter than others, so you have to sort through and match up the caps with tubes that fight tightly enough.</li>

            <li> If you are going to make your own lip balm, I highly recommend these tubes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not flimsy, lids fit nice, overall satisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> We made our first batch and love it.</li>
            <li> Nice clear containers!</li>
            <li> The price is still great for 43 tubes, but I made the mistake of pouring into some of the tubes before realizing they were jammed.</li>
            <li> I had let it cool for a minute or two off the heat, but it was still rather warm and completely liquid.</li>
            <li> Great price, however the caps come off way too easily with very little effort.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are cheap and look good, so I guess they deserve a couple stars.</li>
            <li> these are good little tubes, except the caps don&#x27;t fit super snug on the bottom part.</li>
            <li> We were not missing any tubes or caps that was very important to us.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Another this is these are a bit cheap(not unexpected) but they twist up way to easily.</li>
            <li> after reading other reviews, i made sure all the lids fit first.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Be aware though, these ship from China, so you need to factor in a couple weeks for shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this order of 50 transparent lip balm tubes (along with 50 transparent tubes with white caps but from another, much better seller) and they were all varying in size and quality.</li>
            <li> This was not a problem for me, but be aware.</li>
            <li> These hold up quite well to the melted wax and hot oils that are in my homemade lip balm.  </li>
            <li> These tubes do not look pretty with lip balm in them, so if you want it to look glamorous</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m attempting to make my first homemade batch of lip balm.</li>
            <li> well when they are interested in the look of the beeswax.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Complaint is that I wish the caps snapped on better, because sometimes I feel like it&#x27;s going to lose its top</li>
            <li> These are a great bargain, however the caps don&#x27;t click for a no worry stay on the tube and twice today I&#x27;ve had to roll my lip balm back down because it rolls itself up while in my pocket.</li>
            <li> However the lids on these don&#x27;t stay on very well.</li>
            <li> For others who aren&#x27;t paying very close attention, these ship from China.</li>
            <li> This worked really well for me, I can&#x27;t imagine trying to pour into these things without a holder stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the look of these tubes, but will be looking for another option ASAP.</li>
            <li> Working quickly, I was able to get 20 filled before it hardened in the pipette (occasionally running my fingers down it to push remaining wax/oil out of it while it was still soft).</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moderate number of tubes to test a new project and these were affordable and looked like they would fit my needs.  </li>
            <li> I got exactly what I ordered, clear plastic lip balm containers.  </li>
            <li> My recipe was for a more solid product at room temperature, which may have contributed to this, but the fact that it was only some of them makes me think it&#x27;s a design/consistency</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Kinda thought they would be a little better for the money...</li>
            <li> They function just like normal chapstick tubes.</li>
            <li> It was a new idea for teacher gifts for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed as it clearly states that these are CLEAR/transparent and the picture also shows clear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just really disappointing that I trusted that these would be worth the moneyâmy moneyâand that the manufacturer and seller clearly don&#x27;t care if their customers get good products.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, 13 OF 25 SO FAR HAVE LEAKED!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not super high quality, and there are some obvious manufacturing differences between them, but for the price and amount I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> I filled half my tubes then had to spend 20 mins swapping lids till i got them all matched up.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, these are decent.</li>
            <li> I like that they were clear.</li>
            <li> So far no leaks when pouring the chapstick into them.  </li>
            <li> The real issue arose when I put the caps on the tubes to ensure there was the proper amount of each</li>
            <li> 7 of them are completely unusable.</li>
            <li> If i keep one in my pocket for a day it will be turned up as far as it can go.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to say that these ended up being even remotely high-quality or useable, but I guess I just expected more than what these delivered.</li>
            <li> I wrote the email to avoid leaving a poor review for the benefit of the company, not my own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite this hiccup, they&#x27;re exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given the filled tubes out to dozens of people and am not aware of even a single tube failing on anyone.  </li>
            <li> only clear.  </li>
            <li> These empty lip balm containers are very flimsy and the caps do not stay on.</li>
            <li> caps seal tightly, not loose.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other 25 yet as I really needed these to be done</li>
            <li> The only downside was that some caps are clear and others are white.  </li>
            <li> What I mean by that is that some of the caps fit some tubes tighter than others, so you have to sort through and match up the caps with tubes that fight tightly enough.</li>
            <li> At first when we went to try them out they were a little hard to open, But once you figure it out they work very well.</li>
            <li> Problem is what im making is so soft it wont twist back down</li>
            <li> If you decide to freeze your lip balm, you should wait to open them until they are not completely frozen</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the lids to not stay on securely.</li>
            <li> Some sort of reply would have been better than the cold shoulder.</li>
            <li> I checked some random tubes, and all the tops fit the tubes well.</li>
            <li> The caps are all one or two sizes too big which is quite problematic for any personal use or if you&#x27;re using these to sell handmade lip balms lest someone dares to carry them in their purse (or anything) and the slightest nudge makes the tubes come apart and product ruins your stuff.</li>
            <li> Mine are WHITE and certainly not transparent.  </li>
            <li> However, one package contained 49 lip balm tubes and the other contained 51; not a big deal since I still got 100.</li>
            <li> Very very long wait</li>
            <li> I was just able to put these to use only to find, that the tubes leak extremely bad.</li>
            <li> After letting them cool and harden, 4 of the remaining 19 rolled up, but then the chapstick did not go back down when twisted back down.</li>
            <li> , they feel too loose.</li>
            <li> theye don&#x27;t  twist back down.  </li>
            <li> The parts are so loose that they twist open in your pocket making a mess.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and pay a little extra for some that are well made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their are a few tiny places were there is some plastic finning from the molds, but it is very limited, and the price was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have served me well so far, and do not warp on filling (at least, not below 130Â°).&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> The caps are also very loose.</li>
            <li> Items was exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> They arrived sooner than expected and were packaged in groups of 10.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an empty lip balm tube.</li>
            <li> They appear to be jammed so that you can&#x27;t roll your lip balm up.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd round.</li>
            <li> I have altered my recipe a few times, only to have them still leak.</li>
            <li> so was to be expected.</li>
            <li> Came when expected only issue was I was missing 1 cap to the tubes</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, unlike all the other lip balm tubes I&#x27;ve used in the past, these were the only ones that leaked product throughout the tubes probably due to some design flaw (just like ridiculously loose caps).</li>
            <li> (but it&#x27;s straight from China, so not incredibly surprising).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it holds lipbalm and other liquids that you pour into it.</li>
            <li> is not the case with other tube orders I have placed.</li>
            <li> Of the 20, one had slight leakage.</li>
            <li> l made lip balms with these tonight, and over half of them leaked, some of them to the point of having to trash them.</li>
            <li> if you mess up your recipe after they have solidified the insert comes out and easlily pulls off the product so you can re-melt the product or throw it out and start again</li>
            <li> also have little recycle (#5) marks on the bottom, for those of you who are concerned about environmentally stewardship after using the tube.&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: if you&#x27;re looking for tubes made of post-consumer recycled material, I&#x27;d recommend looking for black lip balm tubes, as some of these are)</li>
            <li> From the few I fiddled with, some lids were very tight, and some were very loose.</li>
            <li> The day before we were going to leave for the holidays, I decided I couldn&#x27;t wait any longer, so I poured my chapstick into some little paint tubs I found at Hobby Lobby.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit to get them</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner, a little over a week.</li>
            <li> I ordered 50 of these and am not able to use them due to the leaking.</li>
            <li> but since I have 50 (ish) and can probably reuse them, I probably won&#x27;t need to decide for a few years anyway.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leak all the way through to my counter, but it did leak down past the bottom ledge thing and into the twisting mechanism.</li>
            <li> I do NOT recommend anyone to buy this product if you plain on selling your lip balm.</li>
            <li> I ordered two at the same time and was very disappointed that one order was translucent and the other was solid white.</li>
            <li> That means they&#x27;ll take at least a few weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d buy these again,</li>
            <li> Customer service however is a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> My complaint is ALL the caps are too loose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I feel like it&#x27;s too late to return at this point.</li>
            <li> None of them were missing or broken and came in when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> and now I have to get new ones, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not very good!</li>
            <li> You always expect with thin plastic items with complex parts that they might break, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem yet.</li>
            <li> I had zero broken or malfunctions.</li>
            <li> Poor consistency.</li>
            <li> Poor quality imo</li>
            <li> Two of the tubes were broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li> Every cap failed.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> and not too expensive</li>
            <li> or else you will have a difficult twisting them out.</li>
            <li> so this was a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Sad!</li>
            <li> I was too disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with these because they are not made well.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would save some money with these.... bad idea!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are very low quality. I have purchased these type of tubes on Amazon before and they were great. I thought I would save some money with these.... bad idea! The parts are so loose that they twist open in your pocket making a mess. The caps are also very loose. I am throwing the rest of these in the trash. Do yourself a favor and pay a little extra for some that are well made.</li>
            <li> Came when expected only issue was I was missing 1 cap to the tubes</li>
            <li> These are a great bargain, however the caps don&#x27;t click for a no worry stay on the tube and twice today I&#x27;ve had to roll my lip balm back down because it rolls itself up while in my pocket.</li>
            <li> Worked great for lip balm!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the lids to not stay on securely. I will not order these again.</li>
            <li> Items was exactly as expected. I had zero broken or malfunctions. Will consider purchasing again. They really worked great. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> Not very good! Caps come off easily, and the tubes roll up too easily as well, to where it will roll up just from being in your pocket and then the lip balm will end up getting stuck to the inside top of the cap. Also, when you get to the end of a tube, it will fall out easily as well. Other than that they are cheap and look good, so I guess they deserve a couple stars.</li>
            <li> Great tubes for making Chapstick. I like that they were clear.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moderate number of tubes to test a new project and these were affordable and looked like they would fit my needs.  They arrived sooner than expected and were packaged in groups of 10.  The roll mechanism works well and we like being able to see the fill level.</li>
            <li> Nice clear containers!</li>
            <li> Thanks! Worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great for homemade chapstick</li>
            <li> No stars. Every cap failed. I had 19 complaints on 25 sales. I can&#x27;t return them. Sad.</li>
            <li> I love these tubes.  I have made several homemade chapsticks with them and have had no problems.  So far no leaks when pouring the chapstick into them.  I would recommend them!</li>
            <li> Works great for DIY home chapsticks for my children</li>
            <li> I got these to make chapstick as stocking stuffers, so I ordered well over a month in advance before Christmas. The day before we were going to leave for the holidays, I decided I couldn&#x27;t wait any longer, so I poured my chapstick into some little paint tubs I found at Hobby Lobby. Of course, these lip balm tubes arrived the next day. Very very long wait (but it&#x27;s straight from China, so not incredibly surprising).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I don&#x27;t know if I would have used them even if they had arrived on time. From the few I fiddled with, some lids were very tight, and some were very loose. Poor consistency. I haven&#x27;t dug through all of them to see if there are any usable ones. I was too disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great price, however the caps come off way too easily with very little effort. You can tell that this is a cheaply made item. However, in my case I&#x27;m using them as free gifts for family members and they don&#x27;t mind. I do NOT recommend anyone to buy this product if you plain on selling your lip balm.</li>
            <li> These lip balm tubes came in perfect condition. Perfect size and work really well. Great for making all your favorite lip balms.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. This is my second order of these. I love to make lip balm and giving them as gifts and just having a nice stash that I never run out of. Be aware though, these ship from China, so you need to factor in a couple weeks for shipping.</li>
            <li> Bought them for a friend that makes her own chapstick. She&#x27;s very pleased.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased two orders of the 50 piece sets. The tubes are wonderful and are just what I wanted. However, one package contained 49 lip balm tubes and the other contained 51; not a big deal since I still got 100. The real issue arose when I put the caps on the tubes to ensure there was the proper amount of each and I realized the order with 49 tubes only arrived with 44 caps. Still, accidents do happen so I went to the Leegoal website and wrote an email notifying them of the issue and have yet to receive a response several business days later. The price is great and the product is of good quality provided the proper amount is received. Customer service however is a major disappointment. Some sort of reply would have been better than the cold shoulder. I wrote the email to avoid leaving a poor review for the benefit of the company, not my own. Oh well, reap what you sow.</li>
            <li> I bought those to make my owl vegan allergy free cruelty free lip gloss and they are great, good finish and good quality of the tubs.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made product. I was disappointed with these because they are not made well.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for my chapsticks - my friend made labels that went around them and they turned out really cute.</li>
            <li> At a per-unit price of ~20Â¢ apiece, this 50-piece package of lip balm tubes was a good purchase.  They have served me well so far, and do not warp on filling (at least, not below 130Â°).&lt;br /&gt;They also have little recycle (#5) marks on the bottom, for those of you who are concerned about environmentally stewardship after using the tube.&lt;br /&gt;(NOTE: if you&#x27;re looking for tubes made of post-consumer recycled material, I&#x27;d recommend looking for black lip balm tubes, as some of these are)</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed as it clearly states that these are CLEAR/transparent and the picture also shows clear.  Mine are WHITE and certainly not transparent.  WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED!!!!</li>
            <li> All my tubes worked, no problem with lids.  If you&#x27;ve ever used a twist up chap stick container before, this is it.  only clear.  would and have bought these again.</li>
            <li> I bought this order of 50 transparent lip balm tubes (along with 50 transparent tubes with white caps but from another, much better seller) and they were all varying in size and quality. That&#x27;s not to say that these ended up being even remotely high-quality or useable, but I guess I just expected more than what these delivered. The caps are all one or two sizes too big which is quite problematic for any personal use or if you&#x27;re using these to sell handmade lip balms lest someone dares to carry them in their purse (or anything) and the slightest nudge makes the tubes come apart and product ruins your stuff. It&#x27;s just really disappointing that I trusted that these would be worth the moneyâmy moneyâand that the manufacturer and seller clearly don&#x27;t care if their customers get good products. I would never buy from this seller again. Oh yeah, unlike all the other lip balm tubes I&#x27;ve used in the past, these were the only ones that leaked product throughout the tubes probably due to some design flaw (just like ridiculously loose caps).</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted to make her own chapsticks this was perfect and the quality was great, the caps fit awesome. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love these tubs.  It took a little bit to get them but they work great!!! I like that you can see through them</li>
            <li> Purchased to make home-made lip balms. They work great!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I know Im just talking about some tubes but they do what they need to and we have had zero problems with all of them. I asked the seller if they were BPA free and she told me they were so I will go with her trusting words and say they are. Over all this is a great product when you are making your own lip balms or such. I will order again when I need too.</li>
            <li> The caps fit perfect. Have not had any issues no visible cracks. Holds up to heat well. Great for beginners in make lip balms at home. The kids love they can see the color of the lip-balm and sparkles when added . Great price will buy from this company again fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I loved making my own chapstick. However the lids on these don&#x27;t stay on very well. In the future I will buy a different brand. Kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> it works! and not too expensive</li>
            <li> None of them were missing or broken and came in when it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> these are good little tubes, except the caps don&#x27;t fit super snug on the bottom part. they tend to twist up in a pocket, more than tubes i&#x27;ve gotten elsewhere, but does the trick</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner, a little over a week. The tubes are as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their are a few tiny places were there is some plastic finning from the molds, but it is very limited, and the price was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall happy, and will order from them again.</li>
            <li> This is a great simple product that allows me to make my own lip balms. Easy to use and as advertised. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> all the caps are there.</li>
            <li> These are great. Only. Complaint is that I wish the caps snapped on better, because sometimes I feel like it&#x27;s going to lose its top</li>
            <li> these were great - i just made 50 lip balms for holiday family &amp; teacher gifts. all of the lids fit perfectly and i didn&#x27;t have any issues with any of the tubes. after reading other reviews, i made sure all the lids fit first. these are great tubes for the price and i would buy them again!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I wanted to make some homemade lip balm and these worked perfectly. It was a new idea for teacher gifts for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an empty lip balm tube. I don&#x27;t know what else you were expecting. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do- it holds lipbalm and other liquids that you pour into it. The end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these twice now for making chapstick. They&#x27;re great quality. You always expect with thin plastic items with complex parts that they might break, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem yet. They function just like normal chapstick tubes.</li>
            <li> Excellent condition and arrived on time.  The only downside was that some caps are clear and others are white.  This was not a problem for me, but be aware.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having so much fun making my own lip balm. These tubes are great and I will certainly be back for more.</li>
            <li> These hold up quite well to the melted wax and hot oils that are in my homemade lip balm.  I&#x27;ve given the filled tubes out to dozens of people and am not aware of even a single tube failing on anyone.  If you are going to make your own lip balm, I highly recommend these tubes.</li>
            <li> Some work, some don&#x27;t. Kinda cheap...&lt;br /&gt;Kinda thought they would be a little better for the money... Prob won&#x27;t reorder</li>
            <li> For others who aren&#x27;t paying very close attention, these ship from China. That means they&#x27;ll take at least a few weeks to arrive. I was given an arrival date range of 12-3 to 12-27, and amazingly I received them on the 3rd!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, of the 50 tubes 7 of them are completely unusable. They appear to be jammed so that you can&#x27;t roll your lip balm up. The price is still great for 43 tubes, but I made the mistake of pouring into some of the tubes before realizing they were jammed. After I realized my mistake I went through the entire package and pulled out the non-functioning ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite this hiccup, they&#x27;re exactly what I expected. I&#x27;m making tinted lip balms and I love these as opposed to opaque tubes because you can see the color. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Nice containers, thank you!</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, these are decent. They&#x27;re not super high quality, and there are some obvious manufacturing differences between them, but for the price and amount I&#x27;m okay with that. What I mean by that is that some of the caps fit some tubes tighter than others, so you have to sort through and match up the caps with tubes that fight tightly enough. I had a couple that I just tossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I filled 20 of these up with homemade chapstick (a recipe with beeswax, coconut oil, and cocoa butter). I had let it cool for a minute or two off the heat, but it was still rather warm and completely liquid. Of the 20, one had slight leakage. It didn&#x27;t leak all the way through to my counter, but it did leak down past the bottom ledge thing and into the twisting mechanism. I poured that one back into the pot and tossed it. After letting them cool and harden, 4 of the remaining 19 rolled up, but then the chapstick did not go back down when twisted back down. My recipe was for a more solid product at room temperature, which may have contributed to this, but the fact that it was only some of them makes me think it&#x27;s a design/consistency issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than trying to pour into these, I used a very cheap disposable plastic pipette. Working quickly, I was able to get 20 filled before it hardened in the pipette (occasionally running my fingers down it to push remaining wax/oil out of it while it was still soft). Then I just tossed the one I used. This worked really well for me, I can&#x27;t imagine trying to pour into these things without a holder stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d buy these again, but since I have 50 (ish) and can probably reuse them, I probably won&#x27;t need to decide for a few years anyway.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for some christmas gifts and they are servicable. One issue for me is they are not all the same tubes. I got 3 kinds that where fairly different. I filled half my tubes then had to spend 20 mins swapping lids till i got them all matched up. Another this is these are a bit cheap(not unexpected) but they twist up way to easily. If i keep one in my pocket for a day it will be turned up as far as it can go. Problem is what im making is so soft it wont twist back down</li>
            <li> Love these! if you mess up your recipe after they have solidified the insert comes out and easlily pulls off the product so you can re-melt the product or throw it out and start again</li>
            <li> Took about a month to get....and I&#x27;m disappointed.  Once u fill the tubes...if u twist up...theye don&#x27;t  twist back down.  Poor quality imo</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I ordered, clear plastic lip balm containers.  They&#x27;re not flimsy, lids fit nice, overall satisfied with the product.  However, I received 49 tubes and 57 lids when I was supposed to get 50 of each.  Two of the tubes were broken upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I have taken to making lip balms this winter. This is my 3rd round. My complaint is ALL the caps are too loose.&lt;br /&gt;This is not the case with other tube orders I have placed. I know what a good cap fit should feel like with an audible snap after pushing the cap on.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as if these caps are a size too big. I fear the slightest jostle in a purse would dislodge the cap.</li>
            <li> Some of the containers the lids don&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> I checked some random tubes, and all the tops fit the tubes well.</li>
            <li> all worked properly and all parts were there</li>
            <li> l made lip balms with these tonight, and over half of them leaked, some of them to the point of having to trash them.</li>
            <li> I received the merchandise within the time frame given.  All the containers are complete and they look like they are I good condition also!</li>
            <li> My sister and I were making lip balm in these tubes. At first when we went to try them out they were a little hard to open, But once you figure it out they work very well. If you decide to freeze your lip balm, you should wait to open them until they are not completely frozen or else you will have a difficult twisting them out. These tubes do not look pretty with lip balm in them, so if you want it to look glamorous I would not recommend them. Otherwise these tubes are absolutely fine and I recommend them to you.</li>
            <li> I ordered these after I ordered another one that wouldn&#x27;t be here till almost February.  I am using these containers for homemade chapstick.  Work great.</li>
            <li> I ordered two at the same time and was very disappointed that one order was translucent and the other was solid white. If I would have know I wasn&#x27;t getting what I ordered I would have ordered from another web site. A site I have ordered from before. I think the product description needs to mention that not all orders will be &amp;#34;as pictured&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;as described&amp;#34; before more people receive something they weren&#x27;t expecting. I can surely still use it, and I have no complaints about the quality of the product, but I would have liked to have known what to expect.</li>
            <li> I purchased these and when I got them the label says clear/transparent but the tubes inside the bag are a solid white. I liked the idea of being able to see the product I put inside them so this was a bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I was just able to put these to use only to find, that the tubes leak extremely bad. I have altered my recipe a few times, only to have them still leak. I really like the look of these tubes, but will be looking for another option ASAP. I ordered 50 of these and am not able to use them due to the leaking. But I feel like it&#x27;s too late to return at this point. Sad!</li>
            <li> great price took a while to arrive but they came from china to NY so was to be expected. they work well and thats what counts great value</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m attempting to make my first homemade batch of lip balm. These should work perfectly and there&#x27;s so many that I should never run out of balm!</li>
            <li> All there and worked great</li>
            <li> These are perfect for making homemade Chapstick.  Look and work great.</li>
            <li> I use these with my beeswax balm.  They do a good job for letting the customer know what they are buying and it shows the color well when they are interested in the look of the beeswax.</li>
            <li> We were not missing any tubes or caps that was very important to us. We made our first batch and love it.</li>
            <li> these tubes worked perfect for my homemade chap sticks, and since they are plain, you can decorate them any way you want. awesome sauce. thanks!</li>
            <li> came very quick great price .. Would buy again ð</li>
            <li> They arrived in a timely manner, looked good,and caps fit well. HOWEVER, 13 OF 25 SO FAR HAVE LEAKED! 2 of them were defective. I haven&#x27;t tried the other 25 yet as I really needed these to be done and now I have to get new ones, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> These empty lip balm containers are very flimsy and the caps do not stay on.</li>
            <li> These are great like how you cane see the lip balm through the tube</li>
            <li> Worked great, no leaks and dials turn easily. Caps come in their own bag, so you don&#x27;t have to disassemble the tubes before filling. Great for those starting out who don&#x27;t need huge quantities of lip balm tubes.</li>
            <li> Exaclyt what i wanted, remember to order stickers with them if your not going to make your own</li>
            <li> I use these for home made chap sticks. These are great! Good price. Lots of tubes and they work well...caps seal tightly, not loose. No damage to product and it arrived on time as promised!</li>
            <li> 3 out of 50 were defective item</li>
            <li> Product was great. I didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from China so shipping took longer than I was expecting</li>
            <li> Got here on time . Just what I wanted thank you .</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> These lip balm containers are satisfactory but not as good as others I have purchased from Amazon. The plastic is a bit too thin and the caps didn&#x27;t fit well, they feel too loose.</li>
