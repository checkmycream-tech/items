            <li>Firstly, this arrived packaged in a wonderful box, which was like receiving a gift when I opened it.</li>
            <li>Organity positions this as being a citrus-like scent and I agree, although there is also a hint of Wintergreen in there too, which I don’t mind at all because it’s quite minty and refreshing!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying it!</li>
            <li>I love the smell!</li>

            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>I would like to say though, that their customer service team is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I love how this smells and feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>have been using it for a week, and love that it is not greasy.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about Organity is that it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>With Organity, my skin has a lovely texture and that embarassing shine is gone.</li>
            <li>love how it is organic</li>
            <li>I love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten used to the smell - still not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this product and hope I can continue to afford it..</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>

            <li>Not greasy or oily at all as many moisturizers are.</li>

            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>

            <li>I really love all the ingredients in this product and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Of the many dozens of moisturizers tried through the years, none have worked as well as the Organity lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer more than 1 month.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so healthy .</li>
            <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t too appealing to me, but it is not offensive.</li>
            <li>The customer service is also outstanding.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li>The Organity lotion feels so soothing and refreshing to my face.</li>
            <li>3 Stars, (it&#x27;s ok)</li>
            <li>3 Stars, (it&#x27;s ok)</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important for me to find a spectacular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the Dewey affects it gives me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I picked this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>Also, I love the smell and texture and the fact that it is certified organic and no animal testing.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is I love it.</li>
            <li>(If you are someone who prefers non scented lotion).&lt;br /&gt;Great, quality product at a fabulous price point!</li>
            <li>At this price per ounce it had BETTER be &amp;#34;pure premium.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Great product and it really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the pleasing scent and the hydrated, yet matte look this product provides, I was also quite pleased with the ingredients and the fact that they did not break out my skin.</li>
            <li>too many scents 2.</li>
            <li>While most reviewers seem to like the scent, I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love the purity of the ingredients of the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>more so than I&#x27;ve ever experience on an on going basis--</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>and it works great for both purposes as it is lightweight and not greasy, but also highly moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Organity is light and absorbs fast and leaves the most pleasant scent lingering - not overpowering -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited for any future products from Organity because this moisturizer is truly wonderful!</li>
            <li>This product smells great and has an aromatherapeutic element to it which is both relaxing and uplifting and the scent does not bother me because it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the ingredients are organic and is free of harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin becoming a ton clearer--</li>
            <li>and it absorbed nicely and did not leave any stickiness.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I&#x27;m looking for a new organic moisturizer and the reviews are mostly quite good.</li>
            <li>So far, this moisturizer fits the bill - we need more certified organic products!!  </li>
            <li>Very Nice so far.  </li>
            <li>So excited- can&#x27;t wait for more products from them.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and makes skin feel nourished.</li>
            <li>Odor a bit strong, takes a bit to get used to.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like the strong citrus smell</li>
            <li>The orange smell is too strong for me</li>
            <li>To notice a difference the first day was amazing.</li>
            <li>and I was cautious at first, but I&#x27;m happy to report that I love the way it smells and have had no negative reactions.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and light with a sweet citrus fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a try in my wrist and it was fine</li>
            <li>Though all the organic ingredients are fine with 0 scores from EWG.</li>
            <li>My fine lines seems to be disappearing.</li>
            <li>First thing that caught my attention was the wonderful citrus scent, every time I&#x27;ve used it now I feel like I just got done with a facial at a spa.  </li>
            <li>This cream may or may not be wonderful, but you should be aware that this is a VERY TINY JAR</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about scents, but the citrus smell is refreshing!</li>
            <li>I love how rich and creamy the formula is and when applied it immediately melts into my skin and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel fabulous.</li>
            <li>Its light on my face and stays moist all day and with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I like the ingredients, and that alone is worth more than 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves a light, protective moisturizing feel to the skin.</li>
            <li>Im happy to finally find a moisturizer that I dont have to question when it comes to ingredients.</li>
            <li>The customer service at Organity is fabulous too.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazingly smooth after application.  </li>
            <li>Free - 2oz Jar https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OPCBGYI/ref&#x3D;cm_sw_r_awd_M5M0vbZ8EJ4V4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does leave my skin feeling amazing every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li>this moisturizer fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>They also recommend cleansing your face before applying and suggest a method to help absorbing is to place a warm, damp face cloth on your skin beforehand, which helps the cream sink in.</li>
            <li>really happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone looking to cut out chemicals, or who have drier skin as this has helped me with both of these!</li>
            <li>Quite the contrary, in fact: my skin is much smoother looking and seems to be more even-toned and healthy feeling.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is penetrating my skin at all but sitting right on top of it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy, absorbs fast, is very light feeling on your face, and I swear it immediately brightens my skin once I put it on.</li>
            <li>However,the feeling of cool mint on my face every morning or night is super!</li>
            <li>My skin looked more hydrated and had a very clear, healthy looking tone; plumped up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are so many uses for this cream such as your face after showering or when you wake up in the morning, shaving rashes, irritated skin, can treat symptoms of acne, and so many more.</li>
            <li>Originally I gave this a lower rating but have since changed my mind.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I Love the product and that it is also very affordable!</li>
            <li>And though I&#x27;ve only used this for a short while, it hasn&#x27;t caused my skin any issues, in fact, my skin has been more radiant and dewey, which makes me very happy!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m also sensitive to smells- goes on smoothly and makes your skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>Organity has gotten rid of his dry patches and his skin looks great.</li>
            <li>The smell is so clean and organic - just like the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I put it on after I showered and it made my skin feel super smooth and clean and non</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant citrus smell to it initially, then it does wear off...</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed it immediately and I was able to apply my make-up right afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Plus the consistency is just right, not too runny or too heavy, but best of all is the organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too…woodsy for my taste, and very strong (though I don&#x27;t normally wear perfume or scented lotions, so I might be hyper-sensitive).</li>
            <li>The texture is rich and creamy and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is such a high quality Organic face cream, with no artificial additives, and a wonderful fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>However, it is more greasy than the oil free moisturizer I normally wear.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t figure out why this has such good reviews.</li>
            <li>I liked that all of the ingredients were natural.</li>
            <li>Their tagline, &amp;#34;Luxurious &amp; Effective&amp;#34; is 100% true; the bonus being</li>
            <li>Organity contacted us and  they gave us a full refund even though we did not ask for it.</li>
            <li>Really early to tell but great so far!</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well on fine line especially.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this new product!</li>
            <li>Luckily I tried this at bedtime because there was no way I could have applied makeup over this because of how tacky it remained.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are at the top of the class, and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and organic is a huge plus in my opinion, so it may work well as a night moisturizer.</li>

            <li>It absorbs quickly so it doesnt feel at all greasy but stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and recommend it mainly because of its&#x27; ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer was the scent - a light citrus-y fragrance from natural essential oils that is not at all overwhelming, but rather pleasant and uplifting.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes beautifully without being heavy and pore clogging.</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer that has ever truly balanced my skin!</li>
            <li>The moisturizer cream itself is a light tan clay color with a soft consistency that makes it easy to draw up onto your fingertips for application.  </li>
            <li>Gently massage the face after applying the moisturizer, it is a super treat!</li>
            <li>When I received this product, I felt it was very well packaged and secure.</li>
            <li>It came with detailed instructions to not add too much.</li>
            <li>I found that my skin wasn&#x27;t really moisturized and in fact it stayed bright red after applying it.</li>
            <li>I am a real buyer, not a plant (no pun intended)  fabulous product  ...</li>
            <li>fresh with a hint of basil essence.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>It totally moisturizers and does not irritate the skin (my skin is sensitive and this is a great product for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She commented on the fresh minty smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking really fresh after using this.</li>
            <li>I have good skin and careful with what I use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really crazy about it, though, so my search is still on.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and many lotions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more sensitive to smells than some people</li>
            <li>However, it had fully absorbed into my skin and my face and forearm</li>
            <li>However, it had fully absorbed into my skin and my face and forearm</li>
            <li>Well worth purchasing in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I trust more natural and organic products to help me with the symptoms of acne while I tackle the causes of it through diet and a healthier lifestyle.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh smell too which I like.  </li>
            <li>It being a product entirely designed and manufactured in the US rounds out the package nicely in my opinion.</li>
            <li>When I apply it at night, next morning the face look like satisfied with the rich supply.  </li>
            <li>They have done everything to make right of the situation..</li>
            <li>I put it on right after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>I received a bottle with a faulty seal and they sent another bottle right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with the customer service at Organity and can tell that they have an immense amount of pride in their product, hold themselves to to very high standard, and really care about the customer&#x27;s experience.</li>
            <li>Apparently it&#x27;s citrus, but I have a lot of organic citrus products and this smells more woodsy or Christmasy to me.  </li>
            <li>Made entirely from GMO-free nutrient-rich organic ingredients grown without pesticides, chemical fertilizers, growth hormones, or antibiotics, and containing no additives or fillers like water,  Organity Moisturizer is designed to reduce and repair the harm done to your skin by free radicals, to improve skin elasticity, and reduce fine lines &amp; wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just began using this moisturizer and love the peace of mind knowing my skin is absorbing natural organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent twice as much on moisturizers that were not half as good!</li>
            <li>in the end, the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I only use this when I am sure I am staying home.</li>
            <li>I do love the product, since I am trying to get away from as many commercial products as possible.</li>
            <li>I had to always put it on his face whe he was sleeping because he would complain so much!</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to use Organity and look forward to more products from this company.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy again. :)</li>
            <li>Thanks, Organity!</li>
            <li>Recently tried a sample of this product after using Aveda for many years.</li>
            <li>its worth the price and very hydrating....</li>
            <li>My favorite moisturizer after years of trying different brands!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is the only product I have ever tried that I have been satisfied with on every front.</li>
            <li>I will be looking for more products in the future and would love something for my lips next!!!</li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li>Love this product, I will definitely get it again!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first week I started using it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Just put a damp cloth on your face first and apply.</li>
            <li>It feels like this product is helping to remove the first layer of skin that &amp;#34;dulls&amp;#34; your complexion.</li>
            <li>I like it and will most likely continue buying it!</li>
            <li>The only thing is I had to scoop out the top layer.  </li>
            <li>Really like this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>Now I have to say I did not read this at first and applied quite a bit...</li>
            <li>The second day even better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever remember such top notch customer service.</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend and most of all will likely repurchase when I&#x27;m out and continue a healthy regime.</li>
            <li>Ever since I&#x27;ve started using Organity, my face has been smooth and feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Started using moisturizer in mid January, works great and goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I wish they would make more organic products such as shampoos and cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I would honestly love to see them come out with an actual primer..</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this for several days now, may face feels considerably smoother and definitely has a more healthy glow about it!</li>
            <li>As far as moisturizing is concerned, it seems to be doing a good job battling the dry Chicago winter air!</li>
            <li>I do notice that every review that is critical of this product is marked as &amp;#34;not helpful&amp;#34; and commented on by a company representative, but I promised to provide a honest review and that is what I am doing regardless of the consequences to my standing.oisturizer and could still smell the scent of it, so it didn&#x27;t dissipate.</li>
            <li>I do notice that every review that is critical of this product is marked as &amp;#34;not helpful&amp;#34; and commented on by a company representative, but I promised to provide a honest review and that is what I am doing regardless of the consequences to my standing.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a natural moisturizer that is soothing, hydrating, non-greasy, effective and affordable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabrina</li>
            <li>and I have found that this moisturizer is extremely balancing and after using it for an extended period of time my skin is bright and clear</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant slightly citrusy aroma and hasn&#x27;t caused my sometimes sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my face, and its effect lasts all day long, I will reorder it!</li>
            <li>The cream absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft and protected, without a greasy build up.  </li>
            <li>the results so far have been extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as large as the picture shows at all.  </li>
            <li>it is very fresh and clean and reminded me of the smell of professional facial</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my results that I decided to try it on my 8 year old son who has very dry skin in the winter, especially on his face.</li>
            <li>I figured that perhaps I used too much so today</li>
            <li>This cream really packs a punch.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li>Just very unnatural.  </li>
            <li>He loves it just as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I got this for my mom for mother&#x27;s day and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I really like using it.</li>
            <li>A fabulous Organity Anti Aging &amp; Anti Wrinkle Facial Cream.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Have to say it works really well.</li>
            <li>very sticky like honey.  </li>
            <li>Nobody wants to walk around smelling like fermented oranges all day.</li>
            <li>It really softens the skin and evens the tone.</li>
            <li>and I got the following side effects: irritation, dizziness and light headache.</li>
            <li>After doing much research, I realized that what I needed to do was cut out these chemicals and try something</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really appreciated the email I received w/ suggestions on usage.</li>
            <li>cant deal with chemicals, need REAL cream for my skin</li>
            <li>It is deeply healing and leaves the skin smooth yet is non greasy.</li>
            <li>I still paid way too much for this product.  </li>
            <li>It is much smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li>It feels like my skin wants this cream.  </li>
            <li>They seem to really care how you, as a customer, feel about their products and I appreciate that.  </li>
            <li>Although it took me a while to find this natural moisturizer, among the jingle-jungle of products, I will definitely make it a good part of my daily protocol for the skin from now on.</li>
            <li>The directions say to make sure that you stir before use, due to there being no chemicals to bind the cream together.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about the fact that it was all organic and actually not harmful to your skin.   </li>
            <li>I think the product is ok for it price, but I will continue to search for other brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok, so let’s talk a little more about Organity - first of all the scent.</li>
            <li>I know it isn&#x27;t causing any more damage than all the other chemical laden products out there.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, due to my many skin allergies, when I put this cream on I must have an allergy to one of the ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and didn&#x27;t care for the overwhelming fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>I like this moisturizer very much as it gives my face an invisible shield, quenching the thirst and improving my skin even more than other natural moisturizers I had used.</li>
            <li>The pot itself is a good size, and with 2oz of moisturizer, there should be enough here to last me for several months - I have purchased other products before at a similar price point which were just 1oz, so I was very pleased to be getting twice</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this moisturizer surpasses any moisturizer that I have used in the past</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this cream because it is not harmful for your skin whatsoever, it is made with real ingredients, has so many benefits, and is the only moisturizer you will ever need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I was quite surprised by this, but on reflection, it’s because they do not use any water in their ingredients.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has a strong scent that I really can&#x27;t describe -- other than to say that it didn&#x27;t seem citrus-like.</li>
            <li>Especially being newly pregnant and wanting safer options.</li>
            <li>Super customer service on the sellers&#x27; part, it is obvious that they stand by their product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality, organic product that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so the fact that this product uses only natural ingredients without any fillers is the original reason I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s because of all of the natural, real ingredients this company uses.</li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I take comfort in knowing that what my skin is absorbing is completely organic.</li>
            <li>With my regular moisturizer, I always felt that my skin looked shiny and felt greasy, even after it had been absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Its normal considering the nature of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>so I do notice products that sit more heavily on my face that ones that are lighter.  </li>
            <li>At first I used too much and the excess balled up on my arm (like tiny lint balls).</li>
            <li>after about 20 minutes it had finally been absorbed, yet my skin remained tacky, sticky, and that scent still dominated my nostrils.  </li>
            <li>As an Amazon shopper I rely on honest reviews when I make purchasing decisions, and pointing out negative features in products helps manufacturers improve their products.  </li>
            <li>As an Amazon shopper I rely on honest reviews when I make purchasing decisions, and pointing out negative features in products helps manufacturers improve their products.  </li>
            <li>As a redhead with sensitive skin, I have tried many different creams - I have used this for a few weeks now and love how it feels on my skin - there is a citrus scent that is not unpleasant and it disappears within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Love this new cream, after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer states that you only need apply a LITTLE bit for it to be effective, and they are not kidding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experimented by applying some on my forearm before applying to my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been in search of a new moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new face cream</li>
            <li>It absorbs very well, nourishes the skin deep inside and stays there all day, all of which at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found this early in the winter as the season is so harsh on our skin.</li>
            <li>Have used a few times love texture of cream and natural scent leaves skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and everything causes a reaction.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is highly concentrated but absorbs immediately-my skin is hydrated and soft</li>
            <li>I even tried it on my daughter who has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I also tend to be very sensitive to face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I love it....not greasy or heavy feeling!</li>
            <li>This cream does the exact opposite!</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients is a must!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually one to wear make-up though</li>
            <li>related to my first reason-</li>
            <li>Also, you do not need a lot of product to get the job done, a little goes a long way which is always nice these days.</li>
            <li>Because our all natural moisturizer does not contain chemicals, it is suitable for dry, normal, oily and sensitive skin types and even if you have acne prone skin or other</li>
            <li>I have had sensitive skin for a number of years and realized that many moisturizers I had tried in the past contained chemicals of one sort or another and were affecting my skin -</li>
            <li>The scent is not overly strong and after a few minutes, does fade.</li>
            <li>I experimented some more and then finally I applied just a VERY small amount, and this time I must have gotten something right because it didn&#x27;t ball</li>
            <li>just a small amount of our natural facial moisturizer after cleansing and it absorbs quickly, leaving you with SOFT, SMOOTH, YOUTHFUL SKIN and no oily residue.</li>
            <li>I tried this item two different times, thinking I just didn&#x27;t mix it up good, but no, the second time was no better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and is absorbed surprisingly quickly.</li>
            <li>It is also a very dark color instead of the light color shown in the picture advertisement.  </li>
            <li>With learning more and more about all the bad stuff companies but into lotions and cosmetics</li>
            <li>I have oily sensitive skin</li>
            <li>it has left my face feeling very sticky.  </li>
            <li>I used it very sparingly and got the same result.</li>
            <li>Organically&lt;br /&gt;made and preserved with all natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Goes on light but dries a bit heavy.</li>
            <li>When I wash my face at night, my skin stills feels soft.</li>
            <li>All Natural Skin Care by</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised by the size of the container</li>
            <li>I use it with natural oil.</li>
            <li>I like the results so far.</li>
            <li>Without proper skin care and products your skin can really take a beating.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a real non greasy moisturizer, look no further you have found it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about anything I put on my face, especially moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>The natural citrus scent, the texture, the way it leaves my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>the tangy citrus scent is all natural not perfumed.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and maybe thats why,</li>
            <li>but this product specifically states its for sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week so far and</li>
            <li>My son (21 yrs old) said he felt like throwing up just having to smell it when I opened it.  </li>
            <li>My facial moisturizer arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the product was really nice - not too thick and definitely not watery.</li>
            <li>Worked very well at moisturizing area right away, in a few days it went away.</li>
            <li>I also have had very problematic skin (typical breakouts) and this has helped so much!</li>
            <li>My jar also came half full.  </li>
            <li>Also, you only need to use a very small amount and it will absorb nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this product and my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t broken out more than usual.</li>
            <li>organic - this gave me the confidence that there would be no hidden chemical nasties or toxic additions.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t understand why this product has such high reviews.</li>
            <li>I love how you only have to use a little for instant absorption and moisturization.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had extreme cold temperatures this week in the North East and my skin looks perfect, not dry</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and vibrant and very little is needed to spread out and cover the surface of the face.</li>
            <li>The container is small, but very light, and I do have some troubles getting the cap screwed on in the exact right spot all the time, but that&#x27;s honestly my only complaint!</li>
            <li>It is packaged well, smells DELISHOUS and really moisturizes dry skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t  see difference yet, it&#x27;s thick and the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>I realized my skin only absorbs natural products, and this is &amp;#34;chicken soup for the skin&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>and it took several tries to get it right.</li>
            <li>For Normal, Sensitive, Dry &amp; Oily Skin - Paraben</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently moved away from highly processed and chemical laden facial products</li>
            <li>I was frustrated that I couldn&#x27;t find anything that I was happy with.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive especially during the winter in the northeast.</li>
            <li>and they want to know my secret :)</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and thick, then seems to melt and create a hydrating coating.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry desert</li>
            <li>Organity Organic Active Moisturizer is a luxurious product at a reasonable price for a generous 2 Oz.</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t have to worry about shady ingredients that are going to be absorbed into my body</li>
            <li>Thanks Organity and looking forward to trying other products you have!</li>
            <li>My face feels soft and moisturized all day long!</li>
            <li>I keep it refrigerated due to the fact that in AZ we are experiencing really high temperatures.</li>
            <li>As someone who has had skin cancer in the past, I am constantly looking for products that are organic because all the chemicals you put on your skin are absorbed through the skin.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a larger jar (this is pretty tiny) but a little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> Firstly, this arrived packaged in a wonderful box, which was like receiving a gift when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Organity positions this as being a citrus-like scent and I agree, although there is also a hint of Wintergreen in there too, which I don’t mind at all because it’s quite minty and refreshing!</li>

            <li> Lemongrass scent gives a energetic feeling.</li>
            <li> top of my serum to seal in moisture&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like to say though, that their customer service team is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I love how this smells and feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> have been using it for a week, and love that it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about Organity is that it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> With Organity, my skin has a lovely texture and that embarassing shine is gone.</li>
            <li> love how it is organic</li>
            <li> I love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten used to the smell - still not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product and hope I can continue to afford it..</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Even when I put on more than I was supposed to, it just felt sticky, almost tacky.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or oily at all as many moisturizers are.</li>

            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>

            <li> I really love all the ingredients in this product and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> Of the many dozens of moisturizers tried through the years, none have worked as well as the Organity lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer more than 1 month.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so healthy .</li>
            <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t too appealing to me, but it is not offensive.</li>
            <li> The customer service is also outstanding.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li> The Organity lotion feels so soothing and refreshing to my face.</li>
            <li> 3 Stars, (it&#x27;s ok)</li>
            <li> 3 Stars, (it&#x27;s ok)</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important for me to find a spectacular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the Dewey affects it gives me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I picked this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> Also, I love the smell and texture and the fact that it is certified organic and no animal testing.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is I love it.</li>
            <li> (If you are someone who prefers non scented lotion).&lt;br /&gt;Great, quality product at a fabulous price point!</li>
            <li> At this price per ounce it had BETTER be &amp;#34;pure premium.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Great product and it really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the pleasing scent and the hydrated, yet matte look this product provides, I was also quite pleased with the ingredients and the fact that they did not break out my skin.</li>
            <li> too many scents 2.</li>
            <li> While most reviewers seem to like the scent, I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love the purity of the ingredients of the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> more so than I&#x27;ve ever experience on an on going basis--</li>
            <li> Love this cream.</li>
            <li> and it works great for both purposes as it is lightweight and not greasy, but also highly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Organity is light and absorbs fast and leaves the most pleasant scent lingering - not overpowering -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited for any future products from Organity because this moisturizer is truly wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product smells great and has an aromatherapeutic element to it which is both relaxing and uplifting and the scent does not bother me because it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the ingredients are organic and is free of harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin becoming a ton clearer--</li>
            <li> and it absorbed nicely and did not leave any stickiness.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m looking for a new organic moisturizer and the reviews are mostly quite good.</li>
            <li> So far, this moisturizer fits the bill - we need more certified organic products!!  </li>
            <li> Very Nice so far.  </li>
            <li> So excited- can&#x27;t wait for more products from them.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and makes skin feel nourished.</li>
            <li> Odor a bit strong, takes a bit to get used to.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the strong citrus smell</li>
            <li> The orange smell is too strong for me</li>
            <li> To notice a difference the first day was amazing.</li>
            <li> and I was cautious at first, but I&#x27;m happy to report that I love the way it smells and have had no negative reactions.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and light with a sweet citrus fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a try in my wrist and it was fine</li>
            <li> Though all the organic ingredients are fine with 0 scores from EWG.</li>
            <li> My fine lines seems to be disappearing.</li>
            <li> First thing that caught my attention was the wonderful citrus scent, every time I&#x27;ve used it now I feel like I just got done with a facial at a spa.  </li>
            <li> This cream may or may not be wonderful, but you should be aware that this is a VERY TINY JAR</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about scents, but the citrus smell is refreshing!</li>
            <li> I love how rich and creamy the formula is and when applied it immediately melts into my skin and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> Its light on my face and stays moist all day and with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients, and that alone is worth more than 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves a light, protective moisturizing feel to the skin.</li>
            <li> Im happy to finally find a moisturizer that I dont have to question when it comes to ingredients.</li>
            <li> The customer service at Organity is fabulous too.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazingly smooth after application.  </li>
            <li> Free - 2oz Jar https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OPCBGYI/ref&#x3D;cm_sw_r_awd_M5M0vbZ8EJ4V4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does leave my skin feeling amazing every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> this moisturizer fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> They also recommend cleansing your face before applying and suggest a method to help absorbing is to place a warm, damp face cloth on your skin beforehand, which helps the cream sink in.</li>
            <li> really happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone looking to cut out chemicals, or who have drier skin as this has helped me with both of these!</li>
            <li> Quite the contrary, in fact: my skin is much smoother looking and seems to be more even-toned and healthy feeling.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is penetrating my skin at all but sitting right on top of it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy, absorbs fast, is very light feeling on your face, and I swear it immediately brightens my skin once I put it on.</li>
            <li> However,the feeling of cool mint on my face every morning or night is super!</li>
            <li> My skin looked more hydrated and had a very clear, healthy looking tone; plumped up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are so many uses for this cream such as your face after showering or when you wake up in the morning, shaving rashes, irritated skin, can treat symptoms of acne, and so many more.</li>
            <li> Originally I gave this a lower rating but have since changed my mind.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I Love the product and that it is also very affordable!</li>
            <li> And though I&#x27;ve only used this for a short while, it hasn&#x27;t caused my skin any issues, in fact, my skin has been more radiant and dewey, which makes me very happy!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m also sensitive to smells- goes on smoothly and makes your skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Organity has gotten rid of his dry patches and his skin looks great.</li>
            <li> The smell is so clean and organic - just like the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after I showered and it made my skin feel super smooth and clean and non</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant citrus smell to it initially, then it does wear off...</li>
            <li> My skin absorbed it immediately and I was able to apply my make-up right afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Plus the consistency is just right, not too runny or too heavy, but best of all is the organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too…woodsy for my taste, and very strong (though I don&#x27;t normally wear perfume or scented lotions, so I might be hyper-sensitive).</li>
            <li> The texture is rich and creamy and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is such a high quality Organic face cream, with no artificial additives, and a wonderful fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> However, it is more greasy than the oil free moisturizer I normally wear.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t figure out why this has such good reviews.</li>
            <li> I liked that all of the ingredients were natural.</li>
            <li> Their tagline, &amp;#34;Luxurious &amp; Effective&amp;#34; is 100% true; the bonus being</li>
            <li> Organity contacted us and  they gave us a full refund even though we did not ask for it.</li>
            <li> Really early to tell but great so far!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well on fine line especially.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this new product!</li>
            <li> Luckily I tried this at bedtime because there was no way I could have applied makeup over this because of how tacky it remained.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are at the top of the class, and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and organic is a huge plus in my opinion, so it may work well as a night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are at the top of the class, and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and organic is a huge plus in my opinion, so it may work well as a night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly so it doesnt feel at all greasy but stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and recommend it mainly because of its&#x27; ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer was the scent - a light citrus-y fragrance from natural essential oils that is not at all overwhelming, but rather pleasant and uplifting.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes beautifully without being heavy and pore clogging.</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer that has ever truly balanced my skin!</li>
            <li> The moisturizer cream itself is a light tan clay color with a soft consistency that makes it easy to draw up onto your fingertips for application.  </li>
            <li> Gently massage the face after applying the moisturizer, it is a super treat!</li>
            <li> When I received this product, I felt it was very well packaged and secure.</li>
            <li> It came with detailed instructions to not add too much.</li>
            <li> I found that my skin wasn&#x27;t really moisturized and in fact it stayed bright red after applying it.</li>
            <li> I am a real buyer, not a plant (no pun intended)  fabulous product  ...</li>
            <li> fresh with a hint of basil essence.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> It totally moisturizers and does not irritate the skin (my skin is sensitive and this is a great product for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She commented on the fresh minty smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking really fresh after using this.</li>
            <li> I have good skin and careful with what I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really crazy about it, though, so my search is still on.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and many lotions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more sensitive to smells than some people</li>
            <li> However, it had fully absorbed into my skin and my face and forearm</li>
            <li> However, it had fully absorbed into my skin and my face and forearm</li>
            <li> Well worth purchasing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I trust more natural and organic products to help me with the symptoms of acne while I tackle the causes of it through diet and a healthier lifestyle.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh smell too which I like.  </li>
            <li> It being a product entirely designed and manufactured in the US rounds out the package nicely in my opinion.</li>
            <li> When I apply it at night, next morning the face look like satisfied with the rich supply.  </li>
            <li> They have done everything to make right of the situation..</li>
            <li> I put it on right after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle with a faulty seal and they sent another bottle right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with the customer service at Organity and can tell that they have an immense amount of pride in their product, hold themselves to to very high standard, and really care about the customer&#x27;s experience.</li>
            <li> Apparently it&#x27;s citrus, but I have a lot of organic citrus products and this smells more woodsy or Christmasy to me.  </li>
            <li> Made entirely from GMO-free nutrient-rich organic ingredients grown without pesticides, chemical fertilizers, growth hormones, or antibiotics, and containing no additives or fillers like water,  Organity Moisturizer is designed to reduce and repair the harm done to your skin by free radicals, to improve skin elasticity, and reduce fine lines &amp; wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just began using this moisturizer and love the peace of mind knowing my skin is absorbing natural organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent twice as much on moisturizers that were not half as good!</li>
            <li> in the end, the cost is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I only use this when I am sure I am staying home.</li>
            <li> I do love the product, since I am trying to get away from as many commercial products as possible.</li>
            <li> I had to always put it on his face whe he was sleeping because he would complain so much!</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use Organity and look forward to more products from this company.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again. :)</li>
            <li> Thanks, Organity!</li>
            <li> Recently tried a sample of this product after using Aveda for many years.</li>
            <li> its worth the price and very hydrating....</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer after years of trying different brands!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the only product I have ever tried that I have been satisfied with on every front.</li>
            <li> I will be looking for more products in the future and would love something for my lips next!!!</li>
            <li> Will absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this product, I will definitely get it again!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first week I started using it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Just put a damp cloth on your face first and apply.</li>
            <li> It feels like this product is helping to remove the first layer of skin that &amp;#34;dulls&amp;#34; your complexion.</li>
            <li> I like it and will most likely continue buying it!</li>
            <li> The only thing is I had to scoop out the top layer.  </li>
            <li> Really like this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> Now I have to say I did not read this at first and applied quite a bit...</li>
            <li> The second day even better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever remember such top notch customer service.</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend and most of all will likely repurchase when I&#x27;m out and continue a healthy regime.</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve started using Organity, my face has been smooth and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> Started using moisturizer in mid January, works great and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wish they would make more organic products such as shampoos and cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I would honestly love to see them come out with an actual primer..</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this for several days now, may face feels considerably smoother and definitely has a more healthy glow about it!</li>
            <li> As far as moisturizing is concerned, it seems to be doing a good job battling the dry Chicago winter air!</li>
            <li> I do notice that every review that is critical of this product is marked as &amp;#34;not helpful&amp;#34; and commented on by a company representative, but I promised to provide a honest review and that is what I am doing regardless of the consequences to my standing.oisturizer and could still smell the scent of it, so it didn&#x27;t dissipate.</li>
            <li> I do notice that every review that is critical of this product is marked as &amp;#34;not helpful&amp;#34; and commented on by a company representative, but I promised to provide a honest review and that is what I am doing regardless of the consequences to my standing.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a natural moisturizer that is soothing, hydrating, non-greasy, effective and affordable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabrina</li>
            <li> and I have found that this moisturizer is extremely balancing and after using it for an extended period of time my skin is bright and clear</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant slightly citrusy aroma and hasn&#x27;t caused my sometimes sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my face, and its effect lasts all day long, I will reorder it!</li>
            <li> The cream absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft and protected, without a greasy build up.  </li>
            <li> the results so far have been extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as large as the picture shows at all.  </li>
            <li> it is very fresh and clean and reminded me of the smell of professional facial</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my results that I decided to try it on my 8 year old son who has very dry skin in the winter, especially on his face.</li>
            <li> I figured that perhaps I used too much so today</li>
            <li> This cream really packs a punch.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li> Just very unnatural.  </li>
            <li> He loves it just as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom for mother&#x27;s day and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like using it.</li>
            <li> A fabulous Organity Anti Aging &amp; Anti Wrinkle Facial Cream.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Have to say it works really well.</li>
            <li> very sticky like honey.  </li>
            <li> Nobody wants to walk around smelling like fermented oranges all day.</li>
            <li> It really softens the skin and evens the tone.</li>
            <li> and I got the following side effects: irritation, dizziness and light headache.</li>
            <li> After doing much research, I realized that what I needed to do was cut out these chemicals and try something</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the email I received w/ suggestions on usage.</li>
            <li> cant deal with chemicals, need REAL cream for my skin</li>
            <li> It is deeply healing and leaves the skin smooth yet is non greasy.</li>
            <li> I still paid way too much for this product.  </li>
            <li> It is much smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> It feels like my skin wants this cream.  </li>
            <li> They seem to really care how you, as a customer, feel about their products and I appreciate that.  </li>
            <li> Although it took me a while to find this natural moisturizer, among the jingle-jungle of products, I will definitely make it a good part of my daily protocol for the skin from now on.</li>
            <li> The directions say to make sure that you stir before use, due to there being no chemicals to bind the cream together.  </li>
            <li> I was excited about the fact that it was all organic and actually not harmful to your skin.   </li>
            <li> I think the product is ok for it price, but I will continue to search for other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok, so let’s talk a little more about Organity - first of all the scent.</li>
            <li> I know it isn&#x27;t causing any more damage than all the other chemical laden products out there.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, due to my many skin allergies, when I put this cream on I must have an allergy to one of the ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and didn&#x27;t care for the overwhelming fruity smell.  </li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer very much as it gives my face an invisible shield, quenching the thirst and improving my skin even more than other natural moisturizers I had used.</li>
            <li> The pot itself is a good size, and with 2oz of moisturizer, there should be enough here to last me for several months - I have purchased other products before at a similar price point which were just 1oz, so I was very pleased to be getting twice</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this moisturizer surpasses any moisturizer that I have used in the past</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this cream because it is not harmful for your skin whatsoever, it is made with real ingredients, has so many benefits, and is the only moisturizer you will ever need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, I was quite surprised by this, but on reflection, it’s because they do not use any water in their ingredients.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a strong scent that I really can&#x27;t describe -- other than to say that it didn&#x27;t seem citrus-like.</li>
            <li> Especially being newly pregnant and wanting safer options.</li>
            <li> Super customer service on the sellers&#x27; part, it is obvious that they stand by their product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality, organic product that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> so the fact that this product uses only natural ingredients without any fillers is the original reason I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s because of all of the natural, real ingredients this company uses.</li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I take comfort in knowing that what my skin is absorbing is completely organic.</li>
            <li> With my regular moisturizer, I always felt that my skin looked shiny and felt greasy, even after it had been absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Its normal considering the nature of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> so I do notice products that sit more heavily on my face that ones that are lighter.  </li>
            <li> At first I used too much and the excess balled up on my arm (like tiny lint balls).</li>
            <li> after about 20 minutes it had finally been absorbed, yet my skin remained tacky, sticky, and that scent still dominated my nostrils.  </li>
            <li> As an Amazon shopper I rely on honest reviews when I make purchasing decisions, and pointing out negative features in products helps manufacturers improve their products.  </li>
            <li> As an Amazon shopper I rely on honest reviews when I make purchasing decisions, and pointing out negative features in products helps manufacturers improve their products.  </li>
            <li> As a redhead with sensitive skin, I have tried many different creams - I have used this for a few weeks now and love how it feels on my skin - there is a citrus scent that is not unpleasant and it disappears within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Love this new cream, after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer states that you only need apply a LITTLE bit for it to be effective, and they are not kidding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experimented by applying some on my forearm before applying to my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been in search of a new moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new face cream</li>
            <li> It absorbs very well, nourishes the skin deep inside and stays there all day, all of which at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this early in the winter as the season is so harsh on our skin.</li>
            <li> Have used a few times love texture of cream and natural scent leaves skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and everything causes a reaction.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is highly concentrated but absorbs immediately-my skin is hydrated and soft</li>
            <li> I even tried it on my daughter who has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I also tend to be very sensitive to face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I love it....not greasy or heavy feeling!</li>
            <li> This cream does the exact opposite!</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients is a must!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to wear make-up though</li>
            <li> related to my first reason-</li>
            <li> Also, you do not need a lot of product to get the job done, a little goes a long way which is always nice these days.</li>
            <li> Because our all natural moisturizer does not contain chemicals, it is suitable for dry, normal, oily and sensitive skin types and even if you have acne prone skin or other</li>
            <li> I have had sensitive skin for a number of years and realized that many moisturizers I had tried in the past contained chemicals of one sort or another and were affecting my skin -</li>
            <li> The scent is not overly strong and after a few minutes, does fade.</li>
            <li> I experimented some more and then finally I applied just a VERY small amount, and this time I must have gotten something right because it didn&#x27;t ball</li>
            <li> just a small amount of our natural facial moisturizer after cleansing and it absorbs quickly, leaving you with SOFT, SMOOTH, YOUTHFUL SKIN and no oily residue.</li>
            <li> I tried this item two different times, thinking I just didn&#x27;t mix it up good, but no, the second time was no better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and is absorbed surprisingly quickly.</li>
            <li> It is also a very dark color instead of the light color shown in the picture advertisement.  </li>
            <li> With learning more and more about all the bad stuff companies but into lotions and cosmetics</li>
            <li> I have oily sensitive skin</li>
            <li> it has left my face feeling very sticky.  </li>
            <li> I used it very sparingly and got the same result.</li>
            <li> Organically&lt;br /&gt;made and preserved with all natural ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Goes on light but dries a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> When I wash my face at night, my skin stills feels soft.</li>
            <li> All Natural Skin Care by</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised by the size of the container</li>
            <li> I use it with natural oil.</li>
            <li> I like the results so far.</li>
            <li> Without proper skin care and products your skin can really take a beating.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a real non greasy moisturizer, look no further you have found it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about anything I put on my face, especially moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> The natural citrus scent, the texture, the way it leaves my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> the tangy citrus scent is all natural not perfumed.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and maybe thats why,</li>
            <li> but this product specifically states its for sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week so far and</li>
            <li> My son (21 yrs old) said he felt like throwing up just having to smell it when I opened it.  </li>
            <li> My facial moisturizer arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the product was really nice - not too thick and definitely not watery.</li>
            <li> Worked very well at moisturizing area right away, in a few days it went away.</li>
            <li> I also have had very problematic skin (typical breakouts) and this has helped so much!</li>
            <li> My jar also came half full.  </li>
            <li> Also, you only need to use a very small amount and it will absorb nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this product and my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t broken out more than usual.</li>
            <li> organic - this gave me the confidence that there would be no hidden chemical nasties or toxic additions.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why this product has such high reviews.</li>
            <li> I love how you only have to use a little for instant absorption and moisturization.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had extreme cold temperatures this week in the North East and my skin looks perfect, not dry</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and vibrant and very little is needed to spread out and cover the surface of the face.</li>
            <li> The container is small, but very light, and I do have some troubles getting the cap screwed on in the exact right spot all the time, but that&#x27;s honestly my only complaint!</li>
            <li> It is packaged well, smells DELISHOUS and really moisturizes dry skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  see difference yet, it&#x27;s thick and the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> I realized my skin only absorbs natural products, and this is &amp;#34;chicken soup for the skin&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> and it took several tries to get it right.</li>
            <li> For Normal, Sensitive, Dry &amp; Oily Skin - Paraben</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently moved away from highly processed and chemical laden facial products</li>
            <li> I was frustrated that I couldn&#x27;t find anything that I was happy with.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive especially during the winter in the northeast.</li>
            <li> and they want to know my secret :)</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and thick, then seems to melt and create a hydrating coating.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry desert</li>
            <li> Organity Organic Active Moisturizer is a luxurious product at a reasonable price for a generous 2 Oz.</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t have to worry about shady ingredients that are going to be absorbed into my body</li>
            <li> Thanks Organity and looking forward to trying other products you have!</li>
            <li> My face feels soft and moisturized all day long!</li>
            <li> I keep it refrigerated due to the fact that in AZ we are experiencing really high temperatures.</li>
            <li> As someone who has had skin cancer in the past, I am constantly looking for products that are organic because all the chemicals you put on your skin are absorbed through the skin.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a larger jar (this is pretty tiny) but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> The smell is really strong, its very sticky, and it burns really badly.</li>
            <li> Within a week of using it once daily, it cleared up multiple dry spots around my face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t moisturize all the time but the cold dry CT winters kind of force my hand.</li>
            <li> so I think this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I normally have trouble spots that I cannot conquer no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s completely normal because it doesn&#x27;t contain the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> it is light but completely hydrates my combination skin without leaving any heavy or greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li> The first time that I put it on I felt that it was a bit thick and tacky.  </li>
            <li> I get that it&#x27;s supposed to be all natural, but how does it have such a strong unpleasant smell?</li>
            <li> At first I was surprised by how small the bottle was, but a little goes a long-long way!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and creams and motions with alcohol, other harsh chemicals, fillers, and things I have never heard of dry my skin out completely.</li>
            <li> Just one application on a very dry area made an enormous difference.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to the size when I bought it, so I was a little surprised, but that&#x27;s on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, using it when I go to bed and sometimes in the morning (I still have a little of my old moisturizer I&#x27;m trying to use up).</li>
            <li> With this product, my skin stays soft and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A lot goes a long way</li>
            <li> It work very well and it is not to thick.</li>
            <li> To thick for me..makeup really won&#x27;t go on over it</li>
            <li> It was delayed, due to weather, but only by a day.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a very specific smell which takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> Makes my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face feeling sticky as if it does not fully dry after application.</li>
            <li> This lotion helped relieve that dry skin upon contact.  </li>
            <li> , I don’t have any dry patches, and I don’t have any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I even started using it on my elbows, as I suffered from dry patches on there and after just a couple of days, it seems to have cleared this up, so this is a bonus to</li>
            <li> My skin seems to have a love/hate relationship with moisturizers, so finding one that works consistently for me and doesn&#x27;t end up irritating my skin or breaking me out can be a challenge at times.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and with this moisturizer, my skin stayed moist (weird word) all day.</li>
            <li> I definitely find that using it once a day, even a small amount stays with me for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> She occasionally buys an estee lauder or some name brand cream, but she said this cream is very similar to it if not better.</li>
            <li> I actually have been using this as a primer under my make up as it smooths out my skin, making pores and imperfections less visible while allowing my make-up to go on without caking or streaking.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been very dry.</li>
            <li> this product not only leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated but gives me at least 12 hours of a no shine face!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Knowing how little to use, I then applied a very tiny amount to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> They may be expensive, but it SO worth it.</li>
            <li> I hope to see my skin continue to improve over the next few months.</li>
            <li> I have found that the trick is to wash your face and leave it a bit wet.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> A little also goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s organic, and a little goes a long way, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> This sticky feeling doesn&#x27;t go away and my face still feels dry and has uneven patches.  </li>
            <li> I use Organity&#x27;s Active Moisturizer every day under my makeup and every night before I go to bed</li>
            <li> I are very sensitive or we were unlucky and the one we got was too caustic (improper  saponification of the sodium hydroxide).  </li>
            <li> I think all the positive revievs are fake,  people that work for the company.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll use up what I have because it&#x27;s not worth it to return it at this point.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to moisturize your skin, after using it for a few days</li>
            <li> but I think one jar will last me at least 3-4 months so</li>
            <li> Thumbs up because It is made with no chemicals, perfumes nor any substances other than organic ones!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
            <li> look foward to exploring what other products this company has to offer!</li>
            <li> I think because I was comparing it to the moisturizer that I was previously using.</li>
            <li> I apply in the morning and evening every day and one jar typically lasts for around five months.</li>
            <li> ; cream settles; so you get less than that.  </li>
            <li> It does have a &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; smell, but that is a small price to pay for the fact that it is not chocked full of dangerous chemicals.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately I have use a lot+ of the product to cover my face (I have a normal sized face),   so for the quantity &amp; price &amp; smell &amp; feel I will look elsewhere for something to keep my face moist</li>
            <li> However, the product took a little bit to get use to the scent and the product leaves my skin sticky and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely picky when it comes to skin care having had some skin issues in the past that I&#x27;m still recovering from.</li>
            <li> and it felt a little on the tacky side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought skin care products online, so I was a little hesitant.</li>
            <li> I have been using Organity for a little over a week now.</li>
            <li> This is much less expensive, but the quality of this product far surpasses what I had been using.</li>
            <li> people can smudge any chemicals onto their face with no apparent reaction, but the build up of such chemicals will show up, sooner than they know and will translate in wrinkles, spots and other unpleasant issues for the skin</li>
            <li> I would put foundation over it which is a Chanel foundation, not cheap stuff.</li>
            <li> My skin feels firm immediately</li>
            <li> Have been using this moisturizer for  few days now.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like something that heavy on my skin during the day</li>
            <li> I needed protection from the harsh winter wind as I spend a lot of time outdoors either walking my dog or with my kids.</li>
            <li> A few of reasons why I dislike this product: 1.</li>
            <li> but I do not love it and do not see it being my everyday</li>
            <li> It is really heavy and its smell is not very pleasant</li>
            <li> But after reading the tip, I started over, applying just a small amount</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the scent, except I found it disagreeable to me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t tolerate the scent or the long time until it absorbs.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t tolerate the scent or the long time until it absorbs.  </li>
            <li> And i don&#x27;t hardly wear makeup.</li>
            <li> fact that they put the hard work into sourcing the ingredients is encouraging when a lot of the time you have no idea</li>
            <li> I read all the negative reviews and disagree with every one of them.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t understand why every organic cosmetics company uses citrus as their fragrance for their products, I have tried a few different ones and they all smell the same, they need to realize that it smells awful as a cosmetics fragrance.</li>
            <li> I had the irritation since late November and nothing else had worked.</li>
            <li> Thick, creamy, and IT WORKS.  </li>
            <li> The cream has a thick feeling to it</li>
            <li> , the thickness - yes, this is a thick, creamy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Smells bad and very sticky in my face even several hours after application. :(</li>
            <li> One review shouldn&#x27;t mean that it wont work for anyone else.  </li>
            <li> (very small)</li>
            <li> One tip Organity gives you is to use a very small amount to start with.</li>
            <li> .. thank you .... seriously.</li>
            <li> This product has been a life saver during this awfully cold and dry winter.</li>
            <li> extremely thick and creamy and smells tropical!</li>
            <li> The container was delivered with the seal broken.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it feels thick and sticky on my face.  </li>
            <li> My face gets so dried out by the cold and wind.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t greasy or too thin</li>
            <li> the weather is very cold and causes dry patches on my skin.  </li>
            <li> He hated using my former moisturizer because he said it made his face greasy (it did).</li>
            <li> I am sad that it didn&#x27;t work order for me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about trying this product because I have an oily complexion</li>
            <li> It seems expensive</li>
            <li> I felt like I was opening something expensive!</li>
            <li> It does not feel too bad on your skin if you can get over it smelling like window cleaner.</li>
            <li> the smell is a tag bit too orange-ginger-sweet for my liking, feels like I&#x27;m apply a food product to my face :(</li>
            <li> It has a terrible smell that is not the citrus smell as it claims.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product! The texture takes some getting used to and definitely give it some time to absorb before applying makeup. I&#x27;ve noticed a visibly smoother look to my skin and no greasy feel! I have oily sensitive skin and I am super happy with this product. Most moisturizers cause me to breakout. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about two weeks with no breakouts!</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that it is recommended that you stir this moisturizer once you get it and I did.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and both times it has left my face feeling very sticky.  I figured that perhaps I used too much so today I used it very sparingly and got the same result. (sticky face) It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is penetrating my skin at all but sitting right on top of it.  This sticky feeling doesn&#x27;t go away and my face still feels dry and has uneven patches.  I had a similar experience with another &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; moisturizer as well so maybe this is just how they are.  I will probably be sending this back and giving something else a try. &amp;#34;Ugh.....sigh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Makes my skin too dry. Don&#x27;t understand why this product has such high reviews.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer.Love the aroma therapy smell.Lemongrass scent gives a energetic feeling.</li>
            <li> It smelled like fish - ugh.</li>
            <li> 24 hour hydration without the oil&lt;br /&gt;slick.  This cream really packs a punch.&lt;br /&gt;Smells fresh with a hint of basil essence.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice whipped texture and hydrates&lt;br /&gt;really well.  It also helped speed&lt;br /&gt;up the healing of my sun burn.  I use it&lt;br /&gt;on top of my serum to seal in moisture&lt;br /&gt;and enhance it&#x27;s effects.  Absorbs really&lt;br /&gt;well without pulling that dissappearing act&lt;br /&gt;by midday and nourishes the skin.  Organically&lt;br /&gt;made and preserved with all natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;With organity, their products are not just organic,&lt;br /&gt;they are certified organic.</li>
            <li> It does not feel too bad on your skin if you can get over it smelling like window cleaner. Maybe if the smell was more pleasant I could try it again.</li>
            <li> The container was delivered with the seal broken.  The directions say to make sure that you stir before use, due to there being no chemicals to bind the cream together.  That&#x27;s great, but, even after mixing it up thoroughly, the lotion does not sink into your skin.  It stays on the surface of your skin, making it feel pasty and sticky.  Just very unnatural.  I tried this item two different times, thinking I just didn&#x27;t mix it up good, but no, the second time was no better.  I am sad that it didn&#x27;t work order for me.  I was excited about the fact that it was all organic and actually not harmful to your skin.   I would like to say though, that their customer service team is outstanding.  They have done everything to make right of the situation.. Maybe the lotion could work for you??  It just didn&#x27;t for me.  One review shouldn&#x27;t mean that it wont work for anyone else.  Based on the customer service alone, I will try to find another product from them, that might just work for me.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face feeling sticky as if it does not fully dry after application. I only use this when I am sure I am staying home.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this new product! My search is over. I have very sensitive skin, and everything causes a reaction. I can&#x27;t afford to spend a fortune, although seems I have trying everything &amp;#34; natural&amp;#34;. Wanted a product I could trust that didn&#x27;t have toxic chemicals or mystery ingredients that would cause a reaction.&lt;br /&gt;This smells great, mild, I&#x27;m also sensitive to smells- goes on smoothly and makes your skin feel amazing. I&#x27;ve had no issue with using under make- up. So excited- can&#x27;t wait for more products from them. I was frustrated that I couldn&#x27;t find anything that I was happy with. Finally!</li>
            <li> It was delayed, due to weather, but only by a day. No biggie. I love how this smells and feels on my skin. I wasn&#x27;t paying attention to the size when I bought it, so I was a little surprised, but that&#x27;s on me. I do love the product, since I am trying to get away from as many commercial products as possible. I would buy this again, and refer friends. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have read comments about the smell of this marvelous mosturaizer, I must say I like it! Thumbs up because It is made with no chemicals, perfumes nor any substances other than organic ones! I love the way it feels on my face, and its effect lasts all day long, I will reorder it! Tip..I keep it refrigerated due to the fact that in AZ we are experiencing really high temperatures. However,the feeling of cool mint on my face every morning or night is super!</li>
            <li> Loved this product, felt great on my skin.  Very smooth and light with a sweet citrus fragrance.  My skin absorbed it immediately and I was able to apply my make-up right afterwards.  Especially this time of year in the NE the weather is very cold and causes dry patches on my skin.  This lotion helped relieve that dry skin upon contact.  Glad I gave it a try!</li>
            <li> When I received this product, I felt it was very well packaged and secure. The product itself is in an attractive container, and inside it is protected by a peel off shield. The consistency of the product was really nice - not too thick and definitely not watery. The fragrance is really nice - it is very fresh and clean and reminded me of the smell of professional facial creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a week, and love that it is not greasy. It totally moisturizers and does not irritate the skin (my skin is sensitive and this is a great product for that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend giving this product a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Organity for about a week and I&#x27;ve already seen a noticeable difference in my skin. I tend to have sensitive skin and I was cautious at first, but I&#x27;m happy to report that I love the way it smells and have had no negative reactions. Quite the contrary, in fact: my skin is much smoother looking and seems to be more even-toned and healthy feeling.  My favorite thing about Organity is that it&#x27;s not greasy at all. It has a wonderful texture and absorbs into the skin quickly. With my regular moisturizer, I always felt that my skin looked shiny and felt greasy, even after it had been absorbed.  With Organity, my skin has a lovely texture and that embarassing shine is gone. Yay!    I am so happy with my results that I decided to try it on my 8 year old son who has very dry skin in the winter, especially on his face. He hated using my former moisturizer because he said it made his face greasy (it did). I had to always put it on his face whe he was sleeping because he would complain so much! Organity has gotten rid of his dry patches and his skin looks great. I am hopeful that there will be a body lotion coming soon!    Even my husband has jumped on the Organity band wagon. He loves it just as much as I do. I will definitely continue to use Organity and look forward to more products from this company.</li>
            <li> Thick, creamy, and IT WORKS.  I sample a lot of beatuty products each year.  This is a fantastic product.  It is packaged well, smells DELISHOUS and really moisturizes dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how it is organic so i don&#x27;t have to worry about shady ingredients that are going to be absorbed into my body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around - this stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> I like the mosturizer it firms skin inmediately only concern is fragance , but it goes away ..</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It is an organic product without fillers.  It makes my skin feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> Excellent love it, will buy it again..</li>
            <li> Love this new cream, after using it for a few days. Its light on my face and stays moist all day and with no greasy feeling. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a quality, organic product that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Thank you for an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> I love, love this stuff. It makes my skin feel so soft. It has a lemon kind of earthy smell and it is awesome! Will be buying when I run out.</li>
            <li> Update: After using this for about 5 months, I&#x27;m giving this product 3 stars, instead of 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten used to the smell - still not my favorite. Apparently it&#x27;s citrus, but I have a lot of organic citrus products and this smells more woodsy or Christmasy to me.  I use it sparingly. I like the ingredients, and that alone is worth more than 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t figure out why this has such good reviews. I can&#x27;t stand the smell. It reminds me of something you&#x27;d rub on the outside of your car to keep it shiny. I get that it&#x27;s supposed to be all natural, but how does it have such a strong unpleasant smell? UGH. I&#x27;m just using it up on my feet, won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer without making me greasy!</li>
            <li> I would rate this 3.5 out of 5. It did have some difference in my complexion. However, the product took a little bit to get use to the scent and the product leaves my skin sticky and shiny. I have used this for a week already. I think the product is ok for it price, but I will continue to search for other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product. My skin looks great after using it and I love the smell.  I absolutely love that Organity sends a follow up message with awesome skin care tips, I found them very useful!</li>
            <li> Love this! Will be buying again !</li>
            <li> This is an amazing, amazing face cream. I read all the negative reviews and disagree with every one of them. This is a luxury cream at an amazing price point. It smells fresh and vibrant and very little is needed to spread out and cover the surface of the face. It has a nice consistency. It leaves a light, protective moisturizing feel to the skin. My skin felt nourished and it literally started glowing after several uses. I just put three more jars in my shopping basket!</li>
            <li> Using this product for about a month now.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  Within a week of using it once daily, it cleared up multiple dry spots around my face.  I definitely find that using it once a day, even a small amount stays with me for the entire day.  Love it!  I&#x27;d been in search of a new moisturizer.  Will definitely buy again. :)</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It makes my skin feel so soft and smells awesome! I have had several people tell me that my skin seems to glow and they want to know my secret :) Organity moisturizer of course! Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. Im happy to finally find a moisturizer that I dont have to question when it comes to ingredients. Especially being newly pregnant and wanting safer options. I also have had very problematic skin (typical breakouts) and this has helped so much! Thanks, Organity!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is highly concentrated but absorbs immediately-my skin is hydrated and soft</li>
            <li> Recently tried a sample of this product after using Aveda for many years. This is much less expensive, but the quality of this product far surpasses what I had been using. It smells lovely and gives my skin a wonderful texture to work with. I even tried it on my daughter who has very sensitive skin and it worked quite well on her skin condition. I&#x27;d be happy to recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> extremely thick and creamy and smells tropical! I love this product and hope I can continue to afford it.. its worth the price and very hydrating.... you will fall in love with this creme too!! It goes on smooth and thick, then seems to melt and create a hydrating coating.My husband always tells me my face smells good!!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  The smell is so clean and organic - just like the ingredients.  It&#x27;s very light and works wonders on my skin - brighter and more moisture without oiliness.  My favorite moisturizer after years of trying different brands!</li>
            <li> Goes on light but dries a bit heavy. Odor a bit strong, takes a bit to get used to. I&#x27;m hoping it grows on me. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week. Giving it some time to see actual results.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Smells great! A lot goes a long way</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom for mother&#x27;s day and she absolutely loves it. She occasionally buys an estee lauder or some name brand cream, but she said this cream is very similar to it if not better. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I liked that all of the ingredients were natural. That is what attracted me to this moisturizer. It came with detailed instructions to not add too much. I tried that and my skin never felt moisturized. Even when I put on more than I was supposed to, it just felt sticky, almost tacky. I would put foundation over it which is a Chanel foundation, not cheap stuff. It was sticky even through the foundation.  It had a scent like Wintergreen. I found that my skin wasn&#x27;t really moisturized and in fact it stayed bright red after applying it. I stopped using it after two weeks and switched to a different moisturizer that stopped the redness and actually moisturized.  I have fair skin, if that makes any difference. Maybe someone with an olive complexion tone may not have a problem. It was drying for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely picky when it comes to skin care having had some skin issues in the past that I&#x27;m still recovering from. This moisturizer is the only product I have ever tried that I have been satisfied with on every front. It goes on easy, absorbs fast, is very light feeling on your face, and I swear it immediately brightens my skin once I put it on. We&#x27;ve had extreme cold temperatures this week in the North East and my skin looks perfect, not dry AT ALL! I normally have trouble spots that I cannot conquer no matter what I do. Also, you do not need a lot of product to get the job done, a little goes a long way which is always nice these days. I will be looking for more products in the future and would love something for my lips next!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Tried it on a whim and I am hooked. Not greasy or oily at all as many moisturizers are. Organity is light and absorbs fast and leaves the most pleasant scent lingering - not overpowering - AND it works.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin glow or something. I really like using it. A little goes a long way too. I will continue using this product. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. A little really does go a long way. I found putting a tiny smear in the palm of my hand and then mixing it with a couple drops of water makes it easiest to spread on my face evenly. I was also contacted by Jennifer from Organity&#x27;s customer service department just to see what I though of the product. Really wonderful customer service. Will absolutely buy again!</li>
            <li> Super customer service on the sellers&#x27; part, it is obvious that they stand by their product. Product is excellent too.&lt;br /&gt;There is a pleasant citrus smell in this face moisturizer, though it is one of its peculiarities, it actually tells me it is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;Some people can smudge any chemicals onto their face with no apparent reaction, but the build up of such chemicals will show up, sooner than they know and will translate in wrinkles, spots and other unpleasant issues for the skin, I used to be one of them. I realized my skin only absorbs natural products, and this is &amp;#34;chicken soup for the skin&amp;#34;! Although it took me a while to find this natural moisturizer, among the jingle-jungle of products, I will definitely make it a good part of my daily protocol for the skin from now on. It absorbs very well, nourishes the skin deep inside and stays there all day, all of which at a reasonable price. Yes, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! Got it to make a review on it and I love it....not greasy or heavy feeling!</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and with this moisturizer, my skin stayed moist (weird word) all day. Love this product, I will definitely get it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter in Law and she told me she loves this product. She also said because she has oily skin she does not use it every day. She commented on the fresh minty smell. I might have to try this one myself :-)</li>
            <li> A fabulous Organity Anti Aging &amp; Anti Wrinkle Facial Cream. My face feels 100% better than ever before. Looks like my pores have shrunk and repaired my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Apply just a small amount of our natural facial moisturizer after cleansing and it absorbs quickly, leaving you with SOFT, SMOOTH, YOUTHFUL SKIN and no oily residue. Our certified organic ingredients make it a perfect choice for men, women and children. Because our all natural moisturizer does not contain chemicals, it is suitable for dry, normal, oily and sensitive skin types and even if you have acne prone skin or other complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I love it! My skin feels firm immediately and I love that it&#x27;s not greasy. I plan to share with my mom and sis.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Organity Face Moisturizer for about one month now and I really like it. I noticed a difference the first week I started using it. My skin looked more hydrated and had a very clear, healthy looking tone; plumped up. It definitely has a very specific smell which takes a little getting used to however it&#x27;s grown on me and I kind of like it now. I&#x27;ve recently moved away from highly processed and chemical laden facial products so the fact that this product uses only natural ingredients without any fillers is the original reason I decided to try it.  The customer service at Organity is fabulous too.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. I put it on right after I wash my face. When I wash my face at night, my skin stills feels soft. I don&#x27;t need to use a lot so I think this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use Organity&#x27;s Active Moisturizer every day under my makeup and every night before I go to bed and it works great for both purposes as it is lightweight and not greasy, but also highly moisturizing. I love how rich and creamy the formula is and when applied it immediately melts into my skin and absorbs quickly. This product smells great and has an aromatherapeutic element to it which is both relaxing and uplifting and the scent does not bother me because it is all natural. I have combination skin and I have found that this moisturizer is extremely balancing and after using it for an extended period of time my skin is bright and clear, I don’t have any dry patches, and I don’t have any breakouts. This is the first moisturizer that has ever truly balanced my skin! I&#x27;m incredibly impressed with the customer service at Organity and can tell that they have an immense amount of pride in their product, hold themselves to to very high standard, and really care about the customer&#x27;s experience. I can honestly say that this moisturizer surpasses any moisturizer that I have used in the past and I always want to have a jar of it on hand! I&#x27;m excited for any future products from Organity because this moisturizer is truly wonderful!</li>
            <li> The Face Moisturizer was delivered protectively packaged and as described on product page.  We purchased this moisturizer in a promotion for testing and review,  This is such a high quality Organic face cream, with no artificial additives, and a wonderful fresh scent.  My skin feels amazingly smooth after application.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Luxurious USDA Organic Face Moisturizer - 100% All Natural Skin Care by Organity - Best Anti Aging &amp; Anti Wrinkle Facial Cream - For Normal, Sensitive, Dry &amp; Oily Skin - Paraben Free - 2oz Jar https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OPCBGYI/ref&#x3D;cm_sw_r_awd_M5M0vbZ8EJ4V4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re anything like me and love anything organic and healthy, this cream is what you&#x27;re looking for. I put it on after I showered and it made my skin feel super smooth and clean and non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in this cream is incredible! I have sensitive skin and creams and motions with alcohol, other harsh chemicals, fillers, and things I have never heard of dry my skin out completely. This cream does the exact opposite! The cream has a thick feeling to it but I think that&#x27;s because of all of the natural, real ingredients this company uses. It has a great clean smell and makes my face feel brightened and toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also loved organic creams because of the purpose they serve. They may be expensive, but it SO worth it. Taking care of your skin is something you should always do, keep it moisturized. This company has wonderful products with a full heart with everything they make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are so many uses for this cream such as your face after showering or when you wake up in the morning, shaving rashes, irritated skin, can treat symptoms of acne, and so many more. This cream is for people of all ages and genders and can also be a great gift for someone. It really does leave my skin feeling amazing every time I use it. I definitely recommend this cream because it is not harmful for your skin whatsoever, it is made with real ingredients, has so many benefits, and is the only moisturizer you will ever need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> The more I use this the more I love it!! Just put a damp cloth on your face first and apply. My face is healing every day. Looks great. Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I love how you only have to use a little for instant absorption and moisturization.  I use it after cleansing my face at night and after showering in the morning before applying makeup! Great product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really really nice. I was a bit surprised by the size of the container (very small) but a little goes a very long way. It moisturizes beautifully without being heavy and pore clogging. My skin is looking really fresh after using this. It feels like this product is helping to remove the first layer of skin that &amp;#34;dulls&amp;#34; your complexion. I like it and will most likely continue buying it!</li>
            <li> Have been using this moisturizer for  few days now. Have to say it works really well. Keeps my face so moisturized... The only thing is I had to scoop out the top layer.  Its normal considering the nature of the ingredients. Will def. buy again once this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I use it with natural oil. It work very well and it is not to thick.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all organic and listed at a great price. I have had it for almost a month and it seems to be working wonderful!</li>
            <li> I really love all the ingredients in this product and I love the smell.  Unfortunately it feels thick and sticky on my face.  I would use it as a night cream but I don&#x27;t like something that heavy on my skin during the day</li>
            <li> Great product. Great for sensitive skin. Works amazingly well on fine line especially.</li>
            <li> very sticky like honey.  I think all the positive revievs are fake,  people that work for the company.  I could not even put makeup on over this cream.  IT created a greasy slime, gross.  And i don&#x27;t hardly wear makeup.</li>
            <li> Of the many dozens of moisturizers tried through the years, none have worked as well as the Organity lotion.  Just one application on a very dry area made an enormous difference.  Their tagline, &amp;#34;Luxurious &amp; Effective&amp;#34; is 100% true; the bonus being it is certified organic.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works well but I don&#x27;t like the strong citrus smell, I don&#x27;t understand why every organic cosmetics company uses citrus as their fragrance for their products, I have tried a few different ones and they all smell the same, they need to realize that it smells awful as a cosmetics fragrance. Nobody wants to walk around smelling like fermented oranges all day.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used! Please let it surprise and pamper your face, your skin will thank you! I have been using this moisturizer more than 1 month. I have good skin and careful with what I use. Natural ingredients is a must! I like this moisturizer very much as it gives my face an invisible shield, quenching the thirst and improving my skin even more than other natural moisturizers I had used. It really softens the skin and evens the tone. Gently massage the face after applying the moisturizer, it is a super treat! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I can get used to the smell, but I do not like how it leaves my face sticky.</li>
            <li> Age 60. Did not find this product enough for my skin.  But the customer service blew me away!</li>
            <li> Originally I gave this a lower rating but have since changed my mind. Initially it didn&#x27;t seem as moisturizing as I thought it would be. I think because I was comparing it to the moisturizer that I was previously using. After using it for a bit, I love it! I recommended to a friend and she also loves it. We will both be purchasing this again! Great customer service as well!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. She tried on her wrist and  immediately she got  skin irritation and she also felt like sting sensation. I gave it a try in my wrist and it was fine but then I tried it in my forehead and I got the following side effects: irritation, dizziness and light headache. Though all the organic ingredients are fine with 0 scores from EWG. Either my wife and myself I are very sensitive or we were unlucky and the one we got was too caustic (improper  saponification of the sodium hydroxide).  Organity contacted us and  they gave us a full refund even though we did not ask for it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and makes skin feel nourished. I like that it&#x27;s organic! May need to mix up once you receive. That&#x27;s completely normal because it doesn&#x27;t contain the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is really heavy and its smell is not very pleasant</li>
            <li> This item arrived incredibly well packaged. I immediately felt a sense of care and pride from the company when I saw how well it was packaged. I felt like I was opening something expensive! The container is small, but very light, and I do have some troubles getting the cap screwed on in the exact right spot all the time, but that&#x27;s honestly my only complaint! I love the texture and the feel of this moisturizer very much, and I can tell this product is really good for my skin!</li>
            <li> Really like this moisturizer!  I have been looking for a cream without any harmful chemicals, parabens etc that was also USDA organic and this moisturizer fit the bill.  As a redhead with sensitive skin, I have tried many different creams - I have used this for a few weeks now and love how it feels on my skin - there is a citrus scent that is not unpleasant and it disappears within a few minutes.  As someone who has had skin cancer in the past, I am constantly looking for products that are organic because all the chemicals you put on your skin are absorbed through the skin.  So far, this moisturizer fits the bill - we need more certified organic products!!  Thank you Organity!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to make a big difference to me. Personally I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product ! I add some organic vitamin E oil. My skin looks so healthy . I will continue to use this product !</li>
            <li> Firstly, this arrived packaged in a wonderful box, which was like receiving a gift when I opened it. The pot itself is a good size, and with 2oz of moisturizer, there should be enough here to last me for several months - I have purchased other products before at a similar price point which were just 1oz, so I was very pleased to be getting twice the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What initially drew me to try this moisturizer was the fact it was USDA Certified organic - this gave me the confidence that there would be no hidden chemical nasties or toxic additions. I have had sensitive skin for a number of years and realized that many moisturizers I had tried in the past contained chemicals of one sort or another and were affecting my skin - some made me break out, while some left me with red patches. After doing much research, I realized that what I needed to do was cut out these chemicals and try something natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so let’s talk a little more about Organity - first of all the scent. Organity positions this as being a citrus-like scent and I agree, although there is also a hint of Wintergreen in there too, which I don’t mind at all because it’s quite minty and refreshing! The scent is not overly strong and after a few minutes, does fade. But hey, I happen to like the smell of citrus and mint, so I’m good with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the thickness - yes, this is a thick, creamy moisturizer. At first, I was quite surprised by this, but on reflection, it’s because they do not use any water in their ingredients. One tip Organity gives you is to use a very small amount to start with. Now I have to say I did not read this at first and applied quite a bit...and it felt a little on the tacky side. But after reading the tip, I started over, applying just a small amount and it absorbed nicely and did not leave any stickiness. They also recommend cleansing your face before applying and suggest a method to help absorbing is to place a warm, damp face cloth on your skin beforehand, which helps the cream sink in. So again, because you don’t have to use so much, the pot should last me a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for several days now, may face feels considerably smoother and definitely has a more healthy glow about it! I use this both in the morning and at night before bed, my face feels great in the morning and I have had no reactions since using (which is such a relief!). I even started using it on my elbows, as I suffered from dry patches on there and after just a couple of days, it seems to have cleared this up, so this is a bonus to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m really happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend to anyone looking to cut out chemicals, or who have drier skin as this has helped me with both of these! Thanks Organity and looking forward to trying other products you have!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m looking for a new organic moisturizer and the reviews are mostly quite good. I&#x27;m not really crazy about it, though, so my search is still on. The orange smell is too strong for me and it&#x27;s greasier than I&#x27;d like. But I&#x27;ll use up what I have because it&#x27;s not worth it to return it at this point.</li>
            <li> I like the results so far. My fine lines seems to be disappearing.</li>
            <li> Just began using this moisturizer and love the peace of mind knowing my skin is absorbing natural organic ingredients. The cream absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft and protected, without a greasy build up.  I&#x27;m so glad to have found this early in the winter as the season is so harsh on our skin.</li>
            <li> With learning more and more about all the bad stuff companies but into lotions and cosmetics I&#x27;m glad to have found this wonderful organic lotion.  I have sensitive skin and many lotions leave my face red and break out but this seems to work great and I haven&#x27;t had those issues.  This is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, I love it.  Thank you for making something that I feel good about putting on my skin!</li>
            <li> I love that this product is organic! I was expecting a larger jar (this is pretty tiny) but a little goes a long way.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t too appealing to me, but it is not offensive.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for the winter months. I&#x27;m more sensitive to smells than some people so the smell bothered me some but it wasn&#x27;t to the point that I could not wear the product.  It went on very smooth and was very easy to apply.  However, it is more greasy than the oil free moisturizer I normally wear.  I&#x27;m not usually one to wear make-up though so I do notice products that sit more heavily on my face that ones that are lighter.  All in all I do like the moisturizer but I do not love it and do not see it being my everyday go to moisurizer.</li>
            <li> Very good quality with a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is perfectly balanced-- it is light but completely hydrates my combination skin without leaving any heavy or greasy feeling behind. A little also goes a long way. I apply in the morning and evening every day and one jar typically lasts for around five months. The customer service is also outstanding. To notice a difference the first day was amazing. The second day even better. It&#x27;s mind boggling. I don&#x27;t ever remember such top notch customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought skin care products online, so I was a little hesitant. A friend recommended it, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I have to say that I really love this lotion. My skin is sensitive especially during the winter in the northeast. My face gets so dried out by the cold and wind. The Organity lotion feels so soothing and refreshing to my face. It&#x27;s thick and is absorbed surprisingly quickly. The scent is mild, pleasant, and citrus like. At first I was surprised by how small the bottle was, but a little goes a long-long way!</li>
            <li> great transaction-great product</li>
            <li> Very Nice so far.  Really early to tell but great so far!</li>
            <li> I needed a new face cream so I thought I would give this a try. I really like that it&#x27;s all natural. It&#x27;s got a great fresh scent, and gives a really nice moisturized feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a honest review.</li>
            <li> Organity Organic Active Moisturizer is a luxurious product at a reasonable price for a generous 2 Oz. size jar.  Made entirely from GMO-free nutrient-rich organic ingredients grown without pesticides, chemical fertilizers, growth hormones, or antibiotics, and containing no additives or fillers like water,  Organity Moisturizer is designed to reduce and repair the harm done to your skin by free radicals, to improve skin elasticity, and reduce fine lines &amp; wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a beautiful box gorgeous enough to give as a gift. The moisturizer cream itself is a light tan clay color with a soft consistency that makes it easy to draw up onto your fingertips for application.  The manufacturer states that you only need apply a LITTLE bit for it to be effective, and they are not kidding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experimented by applying some on my forearm before applying to my face and it took several tries to get it right. At first I used too much and the excess balled up on my arm (like tiny lint balls). Then I tried to rinse the excess off, but the water beaded up on my arm like it does when you wax a car, so I had to wash it off with soap and water. I experimented some more and then finally I applied just a VERY small amount, and this time I must have gotten something right because it didn&#x27;t ball up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing how little to use, I then applied a very tiny amount to my face and neck. This moisturizer has a strong scent that I really can&#x27;t describe -- other than to say that it didn&#x27;t seem citrus-like. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the scent, except I found it disagreeable to me. Meanwhile I waited for the moisturizer to absorb... and waited.... after about 20 minutes it had finally been absorbed, yet my skin remained tacky, sticky, and that scent still dominated my nostrils.  Luckily I tried this at bedtime because there was no way I could have applied makeup over this because of how tacky it remained.  In the morning I checked my forearm where I&#x27;d applied the moisturizer and could still smell the scent of it, so it didn&#x27;t dissipate. However, it had fully absorbed into my skin and my face and forearm no longer felt sticky at that point. The ingredients are at the top of the class, and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and organic is a huge plus in my opinion, so it may work well as a night moisturizer. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t tolerate the scent or the long time until it absorbs.  3 Stars, (it&#x27;s ok) because of quality of ingredients though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item received at a discounted price for purpose of my evaluation and honest review. As an Amazon shopper I rely on honest reviews when I make purchasing decisions, and pointing out negative features in products helps manufacturers improve their products.  I do notice that every review that is critical of this product is marked as &amp;#34;not helpful&amp;#34; and commented on by a company representative, but I promised to provide a honest review and that is what I am doing regardless of the consequences to my standing.oisturizer and could still smell the scent of it, so it didn&#x27;t dissipate.

            <li> First thing that caught my attention was the wonderful citrus scent, every time I&#x27;ve used it now I feel like I just got done with a facial at a spa.  You only need a small amount to moisturize your skin, after using it for a few days I can already tell the difference of how my skin looks and feels.  I live in a dry desert so it&#x27;s important for me to find a spectacular moisturizer. Without proper skin care and products your skin can really take a beating.  I love the fact that the ingredients are organic and is free of harmful chemicals.  I will definitely recommend and most of all will likely repurchase when I&#x27;m out and continue a healthy regime.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the Dewey affects it gives me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying it! I&#x27;m glad I picked this product. I like that it&#x27;s all organic and it makes my skin feel great. Well worth purchasing in my opinion. Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> Excellent cream it&#x27;s just too expensive.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a real non greasy moisturizer, look no further you have found it! I was really skeptical about trying this product because I have an oily complexion and I was amazed by the results! this product not only leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated but gives me at least 12 hours of a no shine face! make up stays longer and the results so far have been extraordinary.  Also, I love the smell and texture and the fact that it is certified organic and no animal testing.  I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends!</li>
            <li> Have used a few times love texture of cream and natural scent leaves skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome! My skin has always been very dry. Ever since I&#x27;ve started using Organity, my face has been smooth and feels so soft. I&#x27;m very picky about scents, but the citrus smell is refreshing! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.  I&#x27;m very picky about anything I put on my face, especially moisturizers.  This is everything promised.  Please don&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I love it. The natural citrus scent, the texture, the way it leaves my skin moisturized. I really appreciated the email I received w/ suggestions on usage. I did as suggested, &amp; look like I had a facial 😄</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this at all. Smells bad and very sticky in my face even several hours after application. :(</li>
            <li> I am a real buyer, not a plant (no pun intended)  fabulous product  ...i am over 50 .. cant deal with chemicals, need REAL cream for my skin .. thank you .... seriously.</li>
            <li> Perfect moisturiser for Winter in North-East!  I needed protection from the harsh winter wind as I spend a lot of time outdoors either walking my dog or with my kids. I found my skin was drying out and even getting itchy after circling the local lake. With this product, my skin stays soft and a little bit goes a long way. Plus I do not need to reapply during day.  I have no allergies, but it is nice to know it is all organic and the tangy citrus scent is all natural not perfumed.</li>
            <li> Started using moisturizer in mid January, works great and goes a long way. Absorbs in skin vey well, some moisturizers do not and skin looks white for awhile. I used it on a patch of &amp;#34;irritated&amp;#34; skin on my chin/neck area from shaving (yes, a male). Worked very well at moisturizing area right away, in a few days it went away. I had the irritation since late November and nothing else had worked.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I love the smell! Plus the consistency is just right, not too runny or too heavy, but best of all is the organic ingredients. I hope to see my skin continue to improve over the next few months. I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 weeks and I love it! It absorbs quickly so it doesnt feel at all greasy but stays on all day. My face feels soft and moisturized all day long! It has a pleasant citrus smell to it initially, then it does wear off... (If you are someone who prefers non scented lotion).&lt;br /&gt;Great, quality product at a fabulous price point! I&#x27;ve spent twice as much on moisturizers that were not half as good!</li>
            <li> This cream may or may not be wonderful, but you should be aware that this is a VERY TINY JAR and you will be getting about one big tablespoonful of cream.  Jar about the size of a ping pong ball; cream settles; so you get less than that.  At this price per ounce it had BETTER be &amp;#34;pure premium.&amp;#34;  In fact I will be expecting something in the nature of a MIRACLE!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using this for about 2 month and it makes my skin look beautiful and it also smells great. It is easy to apply and leaves your skin flawless, I would recommend this to my friends : )</li>
            <li> This product has been a life saver during this awfully cold and dry winter. It is deeply healing and leaves the skin smooth yet is non greasy. I Love the product and that it is also very affordable! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great product and it really works.</li>
            <li> Great product. I was looking for an organic moisturizer that wasn&#x27;t greasy or too thin and I have found it. It seems expensive but I think one jar will last me at least 3-4 months so in the end, the cost is very reasonable. I wish they would make more organic products such as shampoos and cosmetics.</li>
            <li> The smell is really strong, its very sticky, and it burns really badly. I have sensitive skin and maybe thats why, but this product specifically states its for sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> Customer service was great. I received a bottle with a faulty seal and they sent another bottle right away. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week so far and just like the instructions say, you really only need a tiny bit for your entire face. I&#x27;m enjoying this product and my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t broken out more than usual. I have hormonal acne and while I don&#x27;t expect this product to heal me entirely I know it isn&#x27;t causing any more damage than all the other chemical laden products out there. I trust more natural and organic products to help me with the symptoms of acne while I tackle the causes of it through diet and a healthier lifestyle.</li>
            <li> This product is not what I was expecting.  It isn&#x27;t as large as the picture shows at all.  It has a terrible smell that is not the citrus smell as it claims.  It is also a very dark color instead of the light color shown in the picture advertisement.  My jar also came half full.  I received this at a discounted rate for my unbiased and honest opinion.  I still paid way too much for this product.  My son (21 yrs old) said he felt like throwing up just having to smell it when I opened it.  Yes, it is that bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****I do have to say that the customer service from this company is excellent.  I received an email from them and they offered a refund.  I increased the stars from 1 to 3 for this reason.  They brought up a great point....the scent may appeal to others because we all have our own preferences.</li>
            <li> I have been using Organity for a little over a week now. And, I see a difference in the texture of my skin already! It is much smoother and brighter. I also tend to be very sensitive to face moisturizer. But, have had nothing but good results with this one! Great product!!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this moisturizer was the scent - a light citrus-y fragrance from natural essential oils that is not at all overwhelming, but rather pleasant and uplifting. The texture is rich and creamy and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy feel on the skin. I actually have been using this as a primer under my make up as it smooths out my skin, making pores and imperfections less visible while allowing my make-up to go on without caking or streaking. I would honestly love to see them come out with an actual primer..maybe with Broccoli Seed oil...hint hint..;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the pleasing scent and the hydrated, yet matte look this product provides, I was also quite pleased with the ingredients and the fact that they did not break out my skin. My skin seems to have a love/hate relationship with moisturizers, so finding one that works consistently for me and doesn&#x27;t end up irritating my skin or breaking me out can be a challenge at times. And though I&#x27;ve only used this for a short while, it hasn&#x27;t caused my skin any issues, in fact, my skin has been more radiant and dewey, which makes me very happy! I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a natural moisturizer that is soothing, hydrating, non-greasy, effective and affordable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sabrina&lt;br /&gt;chickweedandblush.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> **revised review A few of reasons why I dislike this product: 1. too many scents 2. related to my first reason- the smell is a tag bit too orange-ginger-sweet for my liking, feels like I&#x27;m apply a food product to my face :( 3. unfortunately I have use a lot+ of the product to cover my face (I have a normal sized face),   so for the quantity &amp; price &amp; smell &amp; feel I will look elsewhere for something to keep my face moist</li>
            <li> To thick for me..makeup really won&#x27;t go on over it so I can only use it at night and sometimes it burns a bit</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to using an organic product to help my aging skin. It does have so many wonderful ingredients. Unfortunately, due to my many skin allergies, when I put this cream on I must have an allergy to one of the ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Arrived swiftly, gorgeous looking, great customer service. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and recommend it mainly because of its&#x27; ingredients.  I take comfort in knowing that what my skin is absorbing is completely organic. It has a fresh smell too which I like.  I have tried other brands and didn&#x27;t care for the overwhelming fruity smell.  Also, you only need to use a very small amount and it will absorb nicely.</li>
            <li> Had been looking for USDA moisturizer and Organity fit my criteria best at a reasonable price. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> It feels like my skin wants this cream.  When I apply it at night, next morning the face look like satisfied with the rich supply.  I sincerely thanks to the team who invented this excellent product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t moisturize all the time but the cold dry CT winters kind of force my hand. This was recommended to me and I have to say it is excellent. It&#x27;s not greasy and does its job well. It has a pleasant slightly citrusy aroma and hasn&#x27;t caused my sometimes sensitive skin any issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that they put the hard work into sourcing the ingredients is encouraging when a lot of the time you have no idea what&#x27;s contained in products you absorb into your skin. It being a product entirely designed and manufactured in the US rounds out the package nicely in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s organic, and a little goes a long way, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying it again. While most reviewers seem to like the scent, I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a bit too…woodsy for my taste, and very strong (though I don&#x27;t normally wear perfume or scented lotions, so I might be hyper-sensitive). It also leaves my skin feeling sticky, or tacky. Because of these reasons, I only use it at night. As far as moisturizing is concerned, it seems to be doing a good job battling the dry Chicago winter air!</li>
            <li> The company has a wonderful line of communication.  They seem to really care how you, as a customer, feel about their products and I appreciate that.  I love the purity of the ingredients of the moisturizer.  It does have a &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; smell, but that is a small price to pay for the fact that it is not chocked full of dangerous chemicals.  The first time that I put it on I felt that it was a bit thick and tacky.  I have found that the trick is to wash your face and leave it a bit wet.  This allows the moisturizer to give you the coverage without any tacky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look foward to exploring what other products this company has to offer!</li>
            <li> My facial moisturizer arrived very promptly. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, using it when I go to bed and sometimes in the morning (I still have a little of my old moisturizer I&#x27;m trying to use up). I&#x27;ve noticed my skin becoming a ton clearer--more so than I&#x27;ve ever experience on an on going basis-- and my skin just looks healthier over all. Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Love this cream. I wear it under makeup. No greasy feel, very pleasant scent and it&#x27;s organic, so no nasty chemicals. Trying to go organic with what I put in and on my body. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  see difference yet, it&#x27;s thick and the smell is strong.</li>
