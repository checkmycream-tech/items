    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Really a great product!!!</li>
            <li>best &amp;#34;no morning breath&amp;#34; product out there.</li>
            <li>So ithought it was a awesome mouth wash until i just decided to look it up online</li>
            <li>awesome..</li>
            <li>I will no longer support P&amp;G and will do my best to inform others to stay away from their products.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked great for me.</li>
            <li>&#x27;re mouth greatly.</li>
            <li>The customer care people were pleasant and helped me obtain a refund.  </li>
            <li>This stuff wouldn&#x27;t be a good substitute for good practices.</li>
            <li>Granted, I can still taste this stuff in my mouth for a good hour or so after I use it, but</li>
            <li>Good results with no side effects.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t taste great, but I liked the idea it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product but maybe not for everyone.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean and my teeth look great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I thought to check the reviews!</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t all that pleasant, but I attribute that more to the hydrogen peroxide than anything.  </li>
            <li>Use at your own risk.</li>
            <li>but after I spit it out then it was just a nice minty taste.</li>
            <li>Kinda grosses me out, but it&#x27;s a fair price to pay for healthy teeth.</li>
            <li>for the taste bud, the SmartMouth uses some kind of Zinc formula and that adversely affects what you&#x27;ll be tasting for quite awhile.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an ingredient you will find if you want to make your own mouth wash or toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Okay, now for my positive experiences: I have been using this about three weeks now and am very impressed.</li>
            <li>I suppose that I should consider myself lucky since I have not yet lost the ability to taste food and that my teeth have not yet turned brown, as a number of customers have also experienced.</li>
            <li>If youhave gingivitis, brush better, get cleanings more often, or both.</li>
            <li>If this stuff is more concentrated, that could explain it.</li>
            <li>Or maybe the increase from 0.07% to 0.1% cetylpyridinum chloride is more than the mouth can handle (though I doubt it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>B0011TWVWE Healthy Gums Antigingivitis</li>
            <li>There are many out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now you&#x27;re going to notice it more because it&#x27;s reacted with the hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all around a more aggressive product.</li>
            <li>but I figured it was because I had started taking better care of my gums and the flossing was causing it.  </li>
            <li>For many years I thought I couldn&#x27;t find a solution to my problem</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I found this product</li>
            <li>Yes, the sore tooth feels better, but I can no longer taste food.  </li>
            <li>went on an overseas trip in January and enjoyed all the food I could.</li>
            <li>as for me personally, I love this rinse and use it twice a day as part of my dental health care.</li>
            <li>Again, like many others have noted, it feels as if tongue has been burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it will make a much better drain cleaner than a mouth rinse.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use it in the evening most days, just mornings, and I still don&#x27;t have plague buildup.  </li>
            <li>I have regained most of my sense of taste, and the metallic taste is mostly gone.  </li>
            <li>It would be really awesome to know prior to buying this product that it causes &#x27;temporary loss of taste.&#x27;</li>
            <li>It is better..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re able to handle the pain (if you feel any to begin with) and if you can&#x27;t, go use the non-alcohol one.</li>
            <li>I am scared after reading many reviews including reports of trips to the emergency room.</li>
            <li>If you read online there are many sites and news stories about how this product is hurting people</li>
            <li>I would love for this product/product line to be removed from the shelves.</li>
            <li>Okay, The first two rinses with this went quite well and were almost pleasant.</li>
            <li>took a chance on this product because I bought into the advertisement stating that it is the most effective way to keep a clean mouth months after a dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I loved it the first day.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle yet effective mouthwash, look elsewhere!</li>
            <li>So if you have a pretty good tolerance to Hydrogen Peroxide or any alcohol in your mouth, this is THE product to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice many of the symptoms the first couple of times of using it: lowered sense of taste and very strong flavor.</li>
            <li>I did not experience the other symptoms of burning and I followed the instructions perfectly</li>
            <li>(good news is that they will refund my $3.49!); I suggest everyone who has had the same experience should call and complain as well.</li>
            <li>Make sure to clean the tongue if any of the solution gets on it to avoid effecting the taste buds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this mouthwash 3 days ago thinking I was helping my very mild gingivitis.</li>
            <li>It does not matter how strong or salty it is.</li>
            <li>I think the mouthwash was too strong for my gums and exposed the dentin on my teeth leading to the sensitivity.</li>
            <li>As for my sense of taste, it&#x27;s still fine.</li>
            <li>I feel fine again.</li>
            <li>I bought this rinse because I had oral surgery yesterday, filled a prescription for Chlorhexidine (a rinse), and wanted to have something comparable at work.</li>
            <li>B003X0CXXQ PerioClear Organic Alcohol Free Mouthwash 16oz]].</li>
            <li>All this can be confirmed by checking it on Google.</li>
            <li>This product causes me great discomfort and possible harm to my tongue.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have gum disease but wanted to be preventive because I have crowns and know how important dental hygiene is with any dental work.</li>
            <li>Upon doing some research, it sounds like I&#x27;m not the only person who has experienced these reactions.</li>
            <li>It blows my mind that P&amp;G feel comfortable selling this product without a disclaimer on the bottle about the possibility of losing your sense of taste.</li>
            <li>I had my first cavity a week ago at age 25 and decided to improve my dental routine to avoid future ones; Crest Pro-Health seemed like an ideal product for doing so.</li>
            <li>I was excited to find something that would help reverse the gingivitis problems I&#x27;ve been dealing with</li>
            <li>Honestly, why world you try this when your normal mouth wash is already doing it&#x27;s job?</li>
            <li>So, now I have to decide how significant a part</li>
            <li>Not masked or covered up or burned, just clean.</li>
            <li>the cleanest teeth &amp; the two &#x27;6&#x27; pockets are now &#x27;5&#x27;, but where are the stains coming from, since my teeth are so clean???</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-health Clean Mint]]</li>
            <li>I figured that if the product worked well in keeping my teeth clean</li>
            <li>I bought this product to keep my mouth clean after my permanent crown fell out.</li>
            <li>By Sunday afternoon, I was experiencing pain at the top of my right jaw / bottom of my right ear whenever I yawned.</li>
            <li>The reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because there&#x27;s nothing special about CPC.</li>
            <li>Reserve this for special occasions like surgery or infection.</li>
            <li>If I could give it 0 stars, I most certainly would.</li>
            <li>Seriously guys, buy this rinse at your own risk... and trust me, the risk is great with this one.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a good product if used properly.)</li>
            <li>For the help I received, I rated the product better than I really wanted.  </li>
            <li>However, after I used it, my sense of taste was severely dulled for the rest of the day, and my full sense of taste didn&#x27;t return until the day AFTER that.</li>
            <li>This product is not bad, but it appears mny people have had an allergic reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li>Now, with that said, Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse- claimed to be Crest&#x27;s \\&quot;Most Advanced Rinse Ever\\&quot;- is COMPLETE GARBAGE!</li>
            <li>Then I thought let me do a quick google</li>
            <li>I just hope I can heal quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I have mild blistering on the inside of my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>now I just hope it heals quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel the burning sensation luckily</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I give it four stars is because it contains CPC, which is recognized by the FDA as very effective against bacteria, other microorganisms, and is shown to prevent gingivitis.</li>
            <li>and if I&#x27;ll be able to eat food normally again.</li>
            <li>Today my tongue is burning like I scolded it on very hot food.</li>
            <li>After reading that some people experienced dark stains, I stopped using the product instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine said it was ok except she has more work to do with the slight surface staining (that is mentioned on the label as easily removable).</li>
            <li>At first my mouth felt satisfyingly clean but side effects kicked in quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this last Sunday thinking it would help with plaque and looked pretty good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s reviews first!</li>
            <li>I tried this mouthwash for the first time and I will never use it again!</li>
            <li>Makes your mouth feel like you drank something too hot and burned your taste buds off!</li>
            <li>My teeth were feeling clean, but after about 10 days of consistent use (twice per day in the morning and bedtime)</li>
            <li>After one use I noticed a distinct foam that I was spitting out well after rinsing.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh even hours after using it.</li>
            <li>for the sores people claim they get, you may be more sensitive to the hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>at first I loss my taste but after how many minutes it&#x27;s already normal.</li>
            <li>but I thought if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I rarely ever write reviews</li>
            <li>I ordered white wine at a nice restaurant and believed it was champagne.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not much different than making your own mouth wash from hydrogen peroxide and water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two distinct issues in the use of this product.</li>
            <li>I am a young healthy person.</li>
            <li>But something just isn&#x27;t right about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My right cheek immediately began to swell up.</li>
            <li>so, no problem, right?  </li>
            <li>Quite literally, this mouthwash burned my tastes buds right off.</li>
            <li>The product does not seem safe for the general population!</li>
            <li>I first experienced a decline in my ability to taste things, which was accompanied by a burning sensation (as if I&#x27;d eaten a piece of hot pizza); I used it three or four times until one of my salivary glands on the left (in front of my ear at the top of my jaw joint) became extremely swollen and tender.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that after a few days using the rise, all the redness was gone!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why some people have reported horrible-side effects (an allergy or sensitivity maybe?), but I&#x27;ve experienced nothing out of the ordinary: no burning, no sores, no spots, and no loss of taste.</li>
            <li>A brand new bottle is always going to have a strong flavor at first.</li>
            <li>The product has a nice minty flavor and does make your mouth feel clean, however, it was not worth the problems it caused me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found the best way to controle this short of a dental cleaning is to put a little baking soda on your finger and rub the stain off.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, my right salivary gland in my cheek is clogged.</li>
            <li>I notice the more sugar I&#x27;ve had, the more foamy it is, so I attribute the foam to dead</li>
            <li>I have paired it with the toothpaste as well, and I can definitely tell that my mouth is cleaner and more fresh.</li>
            <li>I guess this is good if you&#x27;re trying to eat less, as it truly makes everything flavorless.</li>
            <li>This rinse was pleasant to use for a few days.  </li>
            <li>I decided to search online and see if anyone else had experienced these same things, and... here I am on Amazon where everyone else is complaining of the EXACT same difficulties!</li>
            <li>This is after its first use.</li>
            <li>I used this only once, and later that day I noticed I couldn&#x27;t taste the delicious cherries I had enjoyed only the night before - they simply taste like nothing.</li>
            <li>I first started using this product after I had some dental work.</li>
            <li>and it felt as if I had burnt it on hot food.</li>
            <li>The company is aware of these allergic reactions.</li>
            <li>I have always used a variety of Crest products and this is the first time I have ever had this problem.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Clinical Strength mouthwash for the last couple months, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The warning should be larger and more prominant.  </li>
            <li>Every symptom explained exactly.</li>
            <li>Did a google search and discovered that Crest is aware of this problem but sees no reason to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOPE.</li>
            <li>After the first two uses</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my tongue feel like it&#x27;s been burned, like when you drink something that&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li>The first 1/3 of my tongue started feeling as if it was scalded by hot water.</li>
            <li>The morning after I used this product my tongue felt like I had burned it on hot pizza or tea, but I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and used it 3-4 times before I realized that it was burning my tongue and tastebuds - I haven&#x27;t been able to properly taste food since.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re not horrible but definitely visable.</li>
            <li>I most definitely encourage anyone and everyone to avoid this product at all costs.</li>
            <li>My tongue feels like I burned it on some hot food.  </li>
            <li>I used this mouthwash for the first time and it burned and hurt like hell.</li>
            <li>I have a story similar to most everyone.</li>
            <li>I bought this instead of the regular crest pro health rinse thinking it would be better..</li>
            <li>My tongue feels like I scolded it on hot tea and the insides of my cheeks are burned in peeling.</li>
            <li>so this product works pretty darn well for</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at the local drug store and love it thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Do not EVER buy this mouth wash, my first time using it</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just the mint flavor of it</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing Crest!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t feel burning hot coffee or ice cubes, and I can&#x27;t taste the soup I&#x27;m eating (which I almost burnt myself with, but didn&#x27;t know until I swallowed</li>
            <li>how hot it was).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hopefully the more complaints they receive, the more they will realize that their products are harmful to their customers (even if it is a small percent).</li>
            <li>Gotta love big business.</li>
            <li>After I used the mouthwash, my tongue felt like I had burnt it on hot food.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever reviewed a product...</li>
            <li>As many others have noted, this product has a very significant side effect:  numbing of taste buds for several hours to several days.  </li>
            <li>Regular use is good overall hygiene ...</li>
            <li>&quot; I can barely taste anything that I eat or drink; most notably I can not taste anything with the first half of my tongue.</li>
            <li>But on third rinse I experienced of pain unlike any other mouthwash.</li>
            <li>- there are more and much more serious than staining.  </li>
            <li>This product claims to reduce plaque and gingivitis, however, dry mouth harbors more bacteria and promotes plaque and gingivitis.</li>
            <li>But I quickly dismissed it because I thought well, this stuff is marked as clinical so may be these symptoms are natural/normal.  </li>
            <li>I do rinse my mouth with water after I use the mouthwash because it is really strong and also leaves a white film...</li>
            <li>However, once you work part way through the bottle it isn&#x27;t such an intimidatingly strong flavor and it stops affecting your taste buds.</li>
            <li>certainly don&#x27;t want to continue with a product that is harmful.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that after completely discontinuing use and switching to Listerine, my mouth is almost back to normal (two days later).</li>
            <li>People need to stop trolling on products that work perfectly fine for those who actually need them and write reviews on those that pertain to them.</li>
            <li>So this morning was the beginning of my 3rd day on this product and after the first couple of days of just thinking it was working really well and keeping a clean feeling in my mouth</li>
            <li>am a really avereage person who doesn&#x27;t have sepecific allegy.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but I guess I&#x27;ll have to search elsewhere because the side effects are just too much to overcome.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how this stuff is legally sold in the US.</li>
            <li>This product is an absolute horror.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even leave my lips in place because it hurts too much.</li>
            <li>very badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>tasted like straight lard, no sensation of sweetness.</li>
            <li>and I expected more from them.  </li>
            <li>That whole side of my mouth feels swollen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Maybe they are using too much?</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not that much</li>
            <li>, I know some people fill up the whole cap</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s way too much.</li>
            <li>But let me tell you, MY WHOLE MOUTH/TONGUE IS ON FIRE.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is an intense product and so named &amp;#34;clinical.&amp;#34; It works as stated on the label.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 1-30-2014:&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 or maybe 5 days, the burning sensation finally went away and I could enjoy food again.</li>
            <li>This can&#x27;t be legal.</li>
            <li>There really just isn&#x27;t any plaque build-up when you use this.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m really wondering about this product now, so will be asking my dentist about what he&#x27;s heard.</li>
            <li>I also ready something about it</li>
            <li>very cautious with this product.</li>
            <li>After a month of use my teeth and gums are looking much healthier.</li>
            <li>Well today my whole tongue is tingling</li>
            <li>Swishing it around your mouth can cause an intense burning followed by a swollen/numb tongue.</li>
            <li>At first I figured this was normal</li>
            <li>Currently, it is marketed as safe for everyone and that is completely inappropriate and irresponsible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why a company would think it&#x27;s OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  </li>
            <li>Ok so I just started using this mouth wash due to my gingivitis issues.</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling actually clean.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Rinse 32 Fl Oz]]</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest Clinical rinse ( deep clean mint) since about March 2012</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and my teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>I picked up a bottle and within two hours of using it I noticed a complete loss of taste and my tongue felt as if I had scalded it with hot coffee.  </li>
            <li>I used it once last night to give it one last chance and my left parotid gland is now fairly swollen with some pain/sensation during chewing.</li>
            <li>I really hope things begin to tast normal again soon.</li>
            <li>Before using this product, I tried everything to keep my teeth clean for more than a few hours, including special toothpastes and using an expensive electric toothbrush and brushing after lunch (no time most days).</li>
            <li>Alarmed, I finally looked up the mouthwash and was horrified to read other reviews where people had experienced the same thing.</li>
            <li>It is the ONLY thing I was doing different except for flossing more often.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this stuff unless there is a specific reason, and only then, not for more than a week or so.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad to see I&#x27;m definitely not the only one.</li>
            <li>Hours later my breath still smells fresh.</li>
            <li>and I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li>If you have that problem, go for this one; if not, stick with your normal one.</li>
            <li>and I am wondering when will my taste buds return to normal.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as intense as some of the Listerine brands I had used in the past, and I actually enjoyed the peroxide foaminess that persisted for a minute after spitting it out.  </li>
            <li>I get the occasional rare canker sore</li>
            <li>I normally just rinse my mouth after eating a meal so throughout the day, I wouldn&#x27;t have to endure what you all are having to go through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CPC also wipes out the normal microbiota in your mouth not just plaque forming bacteria.</li>
            <li>I had only positive results and will buy it as long as it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li>I hope I can taste food and drink normally again by the New Year.</li>
            <li>I finally realized it happened right after using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Seemed fine to me because #1 alcohol wasn&#x27;t on the Active or Inactive Ingredient list, #2</li>
            <li>product contains hydrogen peroxide, which seems to be used in all the new &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; mouth washes.</li>
            <li>have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suspected that the mouth rinse was behind that and searched online to see if anyone else had experienced the same problems.</li>
            <li>The hydrogen peroxide you buy at the store is only 3% and it doesn&#x27;t bother my mouth (although it can burn somewhat when you first start).</li>
            <li>/&gt;After rinsing with this Crest rinse twice, my entire tongue felt like it had been burnt on hot coffee.</li>
            <li>And then I looked for a warning label and sure enough, in tiny letters at the bottom of the bottle above the UPC code it says that it could stain teeth.  </li>
            <li>I only fill the lid up to the first line</li>
            <li>I like it so far!</li>
            <li>A couple hours later I ate lunch, and the first sip of my soda tasted like poison.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first and last time tonight.</li>
            <li>roommates are having the EXACT same reaction.</li>
            <li>After using it for the second time I noticed my tongue felt as if it was burned by a hot liquid or food item; my lips ached and felt \\&quot;chapped.\\</li>
            <li>The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad I am not alone, but at the same time, I wonder how long it would take to get my taste back.</li>
            <li>In fact, once I forgot to brush my teeth one day because I was busy with the kids, and by that night I STILL did not have the fuzzy plague buildup near the gumline!</li>
            <li>Yes, like many others, after the first few times using it like other mouth wash/rinse solution (gargle and keep it in the mouth for a minute or so after brushing...)</li>
            <li>I tried eating something, and experienced a pain akin to someone repeatedly stabbing me in the jaw.</li>
            <li>If you want to burn your taste buds to the point that everything is tasteless this is a great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is foaming, but it is clear.  </li>
            <li>P&amp;G even admits it, thus you&#x27;ll find a warning to this effect on the rear label of every bottle of Crest Pro-Health no matter the tint of the mouthwash (yes, even the clear mouthwash contains this warning).  </li>
            <li>The mouthwash is clear -</li>
            <li>people complaining about it burning, it clearly state it contains Hydrogen Peroxide and since people reacts to it accordingly, stay clear of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d summarize the experience like so: a 30-second swishing will tingle the same as Listerine and will leave you with a filmy spittle thanks to the hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>My gums had started hurting from plaque and gingivitis since I couldn&#x27;t use anything but salt rinses at or near my wounds.  </li>
            <li>Vitis Orthodontic Mouthwash 500ml]], to see if that irritates you too, you may be allergic to all CPC mouth rinses and would have to use Listenine or all natural mouthwashes like Tom&#x27;s [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>so much so, I plan on switching to the entire Crest pro health line.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really seem to go away at all during the entire day when using it in the morning.  </li>
            <li>As far as \\&quot;losing taste\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised it hasn&#x27;t been pulled from the shelves.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have switched to Crest&#x27;s competitor&#x27;s product and so far, knock on wood (or my head)</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t this how class action lawsuits begin?</li>
            <li>I also developed mumps-like symptoms.</li>
            <li>My gums are sensitive now and my mouth tastes like peroxide.</li>
            <li>and I thought I was just hyper sensitive</li>
            <li>I do floss daily and use an electric toothbrush, waterpik,and this rinse, so my success might be the combination of everything I&#x27;m doing, but at my last visit, they could not find any plaque on my teeth, so they then made me eat this &#x27;tablet&#x27; that would expose the plaque, and still couldn&#x27;t find any!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It kind of made things worse.</li>
            <li>I love crest pro health original, but this made my mouth numb, and completely took away my sense of taste.</li>
            <li>pros of this product is that it does what it claims and the next morning, I have pretty decent breath and not the decay smell of dry arid mouth.</li>
            <li>I immediately dumped the remainder down the sink even though I hadn&#x27;t experienced such negative results (yet).  </li>
            <li>The first thing you eat or drink won&#x27;t have much taste, but it&#x27;ll start to have taste after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it left a white filmy residue after rinsing, which wasn&#x27;t anything I was too concerned with.</li>
            <li>but it instantly transforms into white hot foaming magma upon contact with the mucous membranes of your mouth.</li>
            <li>It barely stung, nowhere near an alcohol sting.  </li>
            <li>The product itself works great but the price for 237 ml is very expensive.</li>
            <li>The next day the pain was gone, but it took a couple days for things to return to normal.</li>
            <li>everything coming back normal and no one could figure it out...</li>
            <li>It finally occurred to me that it might be the new mouth wash (I&#x27;d bought a new toothbrush and toothpaste at the same time).  </li>
            <li>So I decided to use this because I have a new resolution for myself to thoroughly clean my teeth at least 1 time a day.</li>
            <li>So while yes my mouth is technically clean, I feel it is slight overkill to not only kill germs and bacteria</li>
            <li>short, if it works for you, it works really well, and I would check the ingredients for possible allergens or irritants.  </li>
            <li>did a little more research on the active ingredient</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if some other dental/ oral problems exist with the other reviewers, but all these people couldn&#x27;t be wrong or imagining these symptoms, so I will do more extensive research, just for my own knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Luckily I didn&#x27;t take it for too long, so hopefully the pain won&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li>If you are not sensitive to this mouthwash (apparently some are), I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Bought some of this stuff, thinking it was going to be amazing, boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li>Apparently CPC distorts your sense of taste for a while</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like, but I can tolerate, is the foaming action of the hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>Actually bought this in a local store thinking it would be a benefit over normal mouthwash.</li>
            <li>so this is a stark difference in my smile.  </li>
            <li>The better my dental hygiene regimen got, the worse my mouth felt.</li>
            <li>I am upset that there are this many poor reviews and the product is still being sold.  </li>
            <li>The taste is kind of weird</li>
            <li>Even worse, after using the product for 3 days I have lost most of my ability to taste and my tongue feels like it has been chemically burned.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I felt a slight tingling sensation on my tongue and gums.</li>
            <li>but later, when comparing the efficacy of Listerine v. Crest Pro-Health, I found some dental discussion boards and more than a few reviews which alleged that the blue mouthwash stained people&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li>This product also contains a higher percentage of the active ingredients found in regular mouth washes.</li>
            <li>Your mouth will have a distinctly clean feeling afterward - some say metallic taste - for at least an hour.</li>
            <li>, I realize it&#x27;s more of a numb, filmy feeling that I can&#x27;t really describe and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have to brush my teeth as long anymore, either, more like the recommended time (2 minutes) instead of 10 minutes (not good for the teeth).</li>
            <li>After a second use, I noticed pain in my parotid salivary glands (in front of the ear, near the back of the jaw).</li>
            <li>I very rarely feel strongly enough about a product, positively or negatively, to write a review on the internet.</li>
            <li>Apparently, a lot of the Crest Pro Health line has caused numerous problems in consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this product for only a couple days to address concerns about gingivitis, I had lost all sense of taste for salt or sweet (for the entire day, not just immediately following use), had a burned sensation on the front third of my tongue, and a whole mouth full of inflamed, gritty feeling and PAINFUL gums.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve stopped using the product, I&#x27;m just hoping the swelling goes down in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>I believe that the main problem is that some of the other people who are using this do not need clinical strength mouth.</li>
            <li>It alters the taste of food for me only very temporarily, for about an hour, but that&#x27;s not much different than when I use any other mouthwash.</li>
            <li>So as bad as it may seem at first, stick it out and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li>throwing the taste of foods off like most mouthwashes will do, but apparently I was wrong.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you&#x27;re a paid subject and have to use it the full 2 weeks it may in fact reverse gingivitis, but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li>My normal rinse is plain old yellow Listerine.</li>
            <li>I thought it might have been because I used a lot of it, but the 2nd time I used it, which was a small amount, the same thing happened and I spit it out right away.</li>
            <li>After a few days of using this product, noticed certain foods started to taste off.  </li>
            <li>Before I started using this I had persisted bad breathe and nothing would help it, mouth wash wise, not even the supposed</li>
            <li>If it is too intense for some people, that is no reason to assume that it is a bad product and take it away from those of us who need it and are extremely satisfied.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Really a great product!!!</li>
            <li> best &amp;#34;no morning breath&amp;#34; product out there.</li>
            <li> So ithought it was a awesome mouth wash until i just decided to look it up online</li>
            <li> awesome..</li>
            <li> I will no longer support P&amp;G and will do my best to inform others to stay away from their products.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked great for me.</li>
            <li> &#x27;re mouth greatly.</li>
            <li> The customer care people were pleasant and helped me obtain a refund.  </li>
            <li> This stuff wouldn&#x27;t be a good substitute for good practices.</li>
            <li> Granted, I can still taste this stuff in my mouth for a good hour or so after I use it, but</li>
            <li> Good results with no side effects.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t taste great, but I liked the idea it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product but maybe not for everyone.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels clean and my teeth look great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I thought to check the reviews!</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t all that pleasant, but I attribute that more to the hydrogen peroxide than anything.  </li>
            <li> Use at your own risk.</li>
            <li> but after I spit it out then it was just a nice minty taste.</li>
            <li> Kinda grosses me out, but it&#x27;s a fair price to pay for healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> for the taste bud, the SmartMouth uses some kind of Zinc formula and that adversely affects what you&#x27;ll be tasting for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an ingredient you will find if you want to make your own mouth wash or toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Okay, now for my positive experiences: I have been using this about three weeks now and am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I suppose that I should consider myself lucky since I have not yet lost the ability to taste food and that my teeth have not yet turned brown, as a number of customers have also experienced.</li>
            <li> If youhave gingivitis, brush better, get cleanings more often, or both.</li>
            <li> If this stuff is more concentrated, that could explain it.</li>
            <li> Or maybe the increase from 0.07% to 0.1% cetylpyridinum chloride is more than the mouth can handle (though I doubt it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> B0011TWVWE Healthy Gums Antigingivitis</li>
            <li> There are many out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now you&#x27;re going to notice it more because it&#x27;s reacted with the hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all around a more aggressive product.</li>
            <li> but I figured it was because I had started taking better care of my gums and the flossing was causing it.  </li>
            <li> For many years I thought I couldn&#x27;t find a solution to my problem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I found this product</li>
            <li> Yes, the sore tooth feels better, but I can no longer taste food.  </li>
            <li> went on an overseas trip in January and enjoyed all the food I could.</li>
            <li> as for me personally, I love this rinse and use it twice a day as part of my dental health care.</li>
            <li> Again, like many others have noted, it feels as if tongue has been burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it will make a much better drain cleaner than a mouth rinse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it in the evening most days, just mornings, and I still don&#x27;t have plague buildup.  </li>
            <li> I have regained most of my sense of taste, and the metallic taste is mostly gone.  </li>
            <li> It would be really awesome to know prior to buying this product that it causes &#x27;temporary loss of taste.&#x27;</li>
            <li> It is better..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re able to handle the pain (if you feel any to begin with) and if you can&#x27;t, go use the non-alcohol one.</li>
            <li> I am scared after reading many reviews including reports of trips to the emergency room.</li>
            <li> If you read online there are many sites and news stories about how this product is hurting people</li>
            <li> I would love for this product/product line to be removed from the shelves.</li>
            <li> Okay, The first two rinses with this went quite well and were almost pleasant.</li>
            <li> took a chance on this product because I bought into the advertisement stating that it is the most effective way to keep a clean mouth months after a dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I loved it the first day.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle yet effective mouthwash, look elsewhere!</li>
            <li> So if you have a pretty good tolerance to Hydrogen Peroxide or any alcohol in your mouth, this is THE product to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice many of the symptoms the first couple of times of using it: lowered sense of taste and very strong flavor.</li>
            <li> I did not experience the other symptoms of burning and I followed the instructions perfectly</li>
            <li> (good news is that they will refund my $3.49!); I suggest everyone who has had the same experience should call and complain as well.</li>
            <li> Make sure to clean the tongue if any of the solution gets on it to avoid effecting the taste buds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this mouthwash 3 days ago thinking I was helping my very mild gingivitis.</li>
            <li> It does not matter how strong or salty it is.</li>
            <li> I think the mouthwash was too strong for my gums and exposed the dentin on my teeth leading to the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> As for my sense of taste, it&#x27;s still fine.</li>
            <li> I feel fine again.</li>
            <li> I bought this rinse because I had oral surgery yesterday, filled a prescription for Chlorhexidine (a rinse), and wanted to have something comparable at work.</li>
            <li> B003X0CXXQ PerioClear Organic Alcohol Free Mouthwash 16oz]].</li>
            <li> All this can be confirmed by checking it on Google.</li>
            <li> This product causes me great discomfort and possible harm to my tongue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have gum disease but wanted to be preventive because I have crowns and know how important dental hygiene is with any dental work.</li>
            <li> Upon doing some research, it sounds like I&#x27;m not the only person who has experienced these reactions.</li>
            <li> It blows my mind that P&amp;G feel comfortable selling this product without a disclaimer on the bottle about the possibility of losing your sense of taste.</li>
            <li> I had my first cavity a week ago at age 25 and decided to improve my dental routine to avoid future ones; Crest Pro-Health seemed like an ideal product for doing so.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find something that would help reverse the gingivitis problems I&#x27;ve been dealing with</li>
            <li> Honestly, why world you try this when your normal mouth wash is already doing it&#x27;s job?</li>
            <li> So, now I have to decide how significant a part</li>
            <li> Not masked or covered up or burned, just clean.</li>
            <li> the cleanest teeth &amp; the two &#x27;6&#x27; pockets are now &#x27;5&#x27;, but where are the stains coming from, since my teeth are so clean???</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-health Clean Mint]]</li>
            <li> I figured that if the product worked well in keeping my teeth clean</li>
            <li> I bought this product to keep my mouth clean after my permanent crown fell out.</li>
            <li> By Sunday afternoon, I was experiencing pain at the top of my right jaw / bottom of my right ear whenever I yawned.</li>
            <li> The reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because there&#x27;s nothing special about CPC.</li>
            <li> Reserve this for special occasions like surgery or infection.</li>
            <li> If I could give it 0 stars, I most certainly would.</li>
            <li> Seriously guys, buy this rinse at your own risk... and trust me, the risk is great with this one.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a good product if used properly.)</li>
            <li> For the help I received, I rated the product better than I really wanted.  </li>
            <li> However, after I used it, my sense of taste was severely dulled for the rest of the day, and my full sense of taste didn&#x27;t return until the day AFTER that.</li>
            <li> This product is not bad, but it appears mny people have had an allergic reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li> Now, with that said, Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse- claimed to be Crest&#x27;s \\&quot;Most Advanced Rinse Ever\\&quot;- is COMPLETE GARBAGE!</li>
            <li> Then I thought let me do a quick google</li>
            <li> I just hope I can heal quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I have mild blistering on the inside of my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now I just hope it heals quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the burning sensation luckily</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I give it four stars is because it contains CPC, which is recognized by the FDA as very effective against bacteria, other microorganisms, and is shown to prevent gingivitis.</li>
            <li> and if I&#x27;ll be able to eat food normally again.</li>
            <li> Today my tongue is burning like I scolded it on very hot food.</li>
            <li> After reading that some people experienced dark stains, I stopped using the product instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine said it was ok except she has more work to do with the slight surface staining (that is mentioned on the label as easily removable).</li>
            <li> At first my mouth felt satisfyingly clean but side effects kicked in quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this last Sunday thinking it would help with plaque and looked pretty good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s reviews first!</li>
            <li> I tried this mouthwash for the first time and I will never use it again!</li>
            <li> Makes your mouth feel like you drank something too hot and burned your taste buds off!</li>
            <li> My teeth were feeling clean, but after about 10 days of consistent use (twice per day in the morning and bedtime)</li>
            <li> After one use I noticed a distinct foam that I was spitting out well after rinsing.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh even hours after using it.</li>
            <li> for the sores people claim they get, you may be more sensitive to the hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> at first I loss my taste but after how many minutes it&#x27;s already normal.</li>
            <li> but I thought if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I rarely ever write reviews</li>
            <li> I ordered white wine at a nice restaurant and believed it was champagne.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much different than making your own mouth wash from hydrogen peroxide and water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two distinct issues in the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I am a young healthy person.</li>
            <li> But something just isn&#x27;t right about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My right cheek immediately began to swell up.</li>
            <li> so, no problem, right?  </li>
            <li> Quite literally, this mouthwash burned my tastes buds right off.</li>
            <li> The product does not seem safe for the general population!</li>
            <li> I first experienced a decline in my ability to taste things, which was accompanied by a burning sensation (as if I&#x27;d eaten a piece of hot pizza); I used it three or four times until one of my salivary glands on the left (in front of my ear at the top of my jaw joint) became extremely swollen and tender.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that after a few days using the rise, all the redness was gone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why some people have reported horrible-side effects (an allergy or sensitivity maybe?), but I&#x27;ve experienced nothing out of the ordinary: no burning, no sores, no spots, and no loss of taste.</li>
            <li> A brand new bottle is always going to have a strong flavor at first.</li>
            <li> The product has a nice minty flavor and does make your mouth feel clean, however, it was not worth the problems it caused me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found the best way to controle this short of a dental cleaning is to put a little baking soda on your finger and rub the stain off.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, my right salivary gland in my cheek is clogged.</li>
            <li> I notice the more sugar I&#x27;ve had, the more foamy it is, so I attribute the foam to dead</li>
            <li> I have paired it with the toothpaste as well, and I can definitely tell that my mouth is cleaner and more fresh.</li>
            <li> I guess this is good if you&#x27;re trying to eat less, as it truly makes everything flavorless.</li>
            <li> This rinse was pleasant to use for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I decided to search online and see if anyone else had experienced these same things, and... here I am on Amazon where everyone else is complaining of the EXACT same difficulties!</li>
            <li> This is after its first use.</li>
            <li> I used this only once, and later that day I noticed I couldn&#x27;t taste the delicious cherries I had enjoyed only the night before - they simply taste like nothing.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product after I had some dental work.</li>
            <li> and it felt as if I had burnt it on hot food.</li>
            <li> The company is aware of these allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> I have always used a variety of Crest products and this is the first time I have ever had this problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Clinical Strength mouthwash for the last couple months, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The warning should be larger and more prominant.  </li>
            <li> Every symptom explained exactly.</li>
            <li> Did a google search and discovered that Crest is aware of this problem but sees no reason to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOPE.</li>
            <li> After the first two uses</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my tongue feel like it&#x27;s been burned, like when you drink something that&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li> The first 1/3 of my tongue started feeling as if it was scalded by hot water.</li>
            <li> The morning after I used this product my tongue felt like I had burned it on hot pizza or tea, but I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and used it 3-4 times before I realized that it was burning my tongue and tastebuds - I haven&#x27;t been able to properly taste food since.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not horrible but definitely visable.</li>
            <li> I most definitely encourage anyone and everyone to avoid this product at all costs.</li>
            <li> My tongue feels like I burned it on some hot food.  </li>
            <li> I used this mouthwash for the first time and it burned and hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> I have a story similar to most everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the regular crest pro health rinse thinking it would be better..</li>
            <li> My tongue feels like I scolded it on hot tea and the insides of my cheeks are burned in peeling.</li>
            <li> so this product works pretty darn well for</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at the local drug store and love it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Do not EVER buy this mouth wash, my first time using it</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just the mint flavor of it</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing Crest!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t feel burning hot coffee or ice cubes, and I can&#x27;t taste the soup I&#x27;m eating (which I almost burnt myself with, but didn&#x27;t know until I swallowed</li>
            <li> how hot it was).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hopefully the more complaints they receive, the more they will realize that their products are harmful to their customers (even if it is a small percent).</li>
            <li> Gotta love big business.</li>
            <li> After I used the mouthwash, my tongue felt like I had burnt it on hot food.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever reviewed a product...</li>
            <li> As many others have noted, this product has a very significant side effect:  numbing of taste buds for several hours to several days.  </li>
            <li> Regular use is good overall hygiene ...</li>
            <li> &quot; I can barely taste anything that I eat or drink; most notably I can not taste anything with the first half of my tongue.</li>
            <li> But on third rinse I experienced of pain unlike any other mouthwash.</li>
            <li> - there are more and much more serious than staining.  </li>
            <li> This product claims to reduce plaque and gingivitis, however, dry mouth harbors more bacteria and promotes plaque and gingivitis.</li>
            <li> But I quickly dismissed it because I thought well, this stuff is marked as clinical so may be these symptoms are natural/normal.  </li>
            <li> I do rinse my mouth with water after I use the mouthwash because it is really strong and also leaves a white film...</li>
            <li> However, once you work part way through the bottle it isn&#x27;t such an intimidatingly strong flavor and it stops affecting your taste buds.</li>
            <li> certainly don&#x27;t want to continue with a product that is harmful.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that after completely discontinuing use and switching to Listerine, my mouth is almost back to normal (two days later).</li>
            <li> People need to stop trolling on products that work perfectly fine for those who actually need them and write reviews on those that pertain to them.</li>
            <li> So this morning was the beginning of my 3rd day on this product and after the first couple of days of just thinking it was working really well and keeping a clean feeling in my mouth</li>
            <li> am a really avereage person who doesn&#x27;t have sepecific allegy.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but I guess I&#x27;ll have to search elsewhere because the side effects are just too much to overcome.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this stuff is legally sold in the US.</li>
            <li> This product is an absolute horror.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even leave my lips in place because it hurts too much.</li>
            <li> very badly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> tasted like straight lard, no sensation of sweetness.</li>
            <li> and I expected more from them.  </li>
            <li> That whole side of my mouth feels swollen.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Maybe they are using too much?</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that much</li>
            <li> , I know some people fill up the whole cap</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s way too much.</li>
            <li> But let me tell you, MY WHOLE MOUTH/TONGUE IS ON FIRE.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is an intense product and so named &amp;#34;clinical.&amp;#34; It works as stated on the label.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 1-30-2014:&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 or maybe 5 days, the burning sensation finally went away and I could enjoy food again.</li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be legal.</li>
            <li> There really just isn&#x27;t any plaque build-up when you use this.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m really wondering about this product now, so will be asking my dentist about what he&#x27;s heard.</li>
            <li> I also ready something about it</li>
            <li> very cautious with this product.</li>
            <li> After a month of use my teeth and gums are looking much healthier.</li>
            <li> Well today my whole tongue is tingling</li>
            <li> Swishing it around your mouth can cause an intense burning followed by a swollen/numb tongue.</li>
            <li> At first I figured this was normal</li>
            <li> Currently, it is marketed as safe for everyone and that is completely inappropriate and irresponsible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why a company would think it&#x27;s OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  </li>
            <li> Ok so I just started using this mouth wash due to my gingivitis issues.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling actually clean.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Rinse 32 Fl Oz]]</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Clinical rinse ( deep clean mint) since about March 2012</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and my teeth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> I picked up a bottle and within two hours of using it I noticed a complete loss of taste and my tongue felt as if I had scalded it with hot coffee.  </li>
            <li> I used it once last night to give it one last chance and my left parotid gland is now fairly swollen with some pain/sensation during chewing.</li>
            <li> I really hope things begin to tast normal again soon.</li>
            <li> Before using this product, I tried everything to keep my teeth clean for more than a few hours, including special toothpastes and using an expensive electric toothbrush and brushing after lunch (no time most days).</li>
            <li> Alarmed, I finally looked up the mouthwash and was horrified to read other reviews where people had experienced the same thing.</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY thing I was doing different except for flossing more often.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this stuff unless there is a specific reason, and only then, not for more than a week or so.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad to see I&#x27;m definitely not the only one.</li>
            <li> Hours later my breath still smells fresh.</li>
            <li> and I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> If you have that problem, go for this one; if not, stick with your normal one.</li>
            <li> and I am wondering when will my taste buds return to normal.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as intense as some of the Listerine brands I had used in the past, and I actually enjoyed the peroxide foaminess that persisted for a minute after spitting it out.  </li>
            <li> I get the occasional rare canker sore</li>
            <li> I normally just rinse my mouth after eating a meal so throughout the day, I wouldn&#x27;t have to endure what you all are having to go through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CPC also wipes out the normal microbiota in your mouth not just plaque forming bacteria.</li>
            <li> I had only positive results and will buy it as long as it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> I hope I can taste food and drink normally again by the New Year.</li>
            <li> I finally realized it happened right after using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Seemed fine to me because #1 alcohol wasn&#x27;t on the Active or Inactive Ingredient list, #2</li>
            <li> product contains hydrogen peroxide, which seems to be used in all the new &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; mouth washes.</li>
            <li> have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suspected that the mouth rinse was behind that and searched online to see if anyone else had experienced the same problems.</li>
            <li> The hydrogen peroxide you buy at the store is only 3% and it doesn&#x27;t bother my mouth (although it can burn somewhat when you first start).</li>
            <li> /&gt;After rinsing with this Crest rinse twice, my entire tongue felt like it had been burnt on hot coffee.</li>
            <li> And then I looked for a warning label and sure enough, in tiny letters at the bottom of the bottle above the UPC code it says that it could stain teeth.  </li>
            <li> I only fill the lid up to the first line</li>
            <li> I like it so far!</li>
            <li> A couple hours later I ate lunch, and the first sip of my soda tasted like poison.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first and last time tonight.</li>
            <li> roommates are having the EXACT same reaction.</li>
            <li> After using it for the second time I noticed my tongue felt as if it was burned by a hot liquid or food item; my lips ached and felt \\&quot;chapped.\\</li>
            <li> The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am glad I am not alone, but at the same time, I wonder how long it would take to get my taste back.</li>
            <li> In fact, once I forgot to brush my teeth one day because I was busy with the kids, and by that night I STILL did not have the fuzzy plague buildup near the gumline!</li>
            <li> Yes, like many others, after the first few times using it like other mouth wash/rinse solution (gargle and keep it in the mouth for a minute or so after brushing...)</li>
            <li> I tried eating something, and experienced a pain akin to someone repeatedly stabbing me in the jaw.</li>
            <li> If you want to burn your taste buds to the point that everything is tasteless this is a great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is foaming, but it is clear.  </li>
            <li> P&amp;G even admits it, thus you&#x27;ll find a warning to this effect on the rear label of every bottle of Crest Pro-Health no matter the tint of the mouthwash (yes, even the clear mouthwash contains this warning).  </li>
            <li> The mouthwash is clear -</li>
            <li> people complaining about it burning, it clearly state it contains Hydrogen Peroxide and since people reacts to it accordingly, stay clear of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d summarize the experience like so: a 30-second swishing will tingle the same as Listerine and will leave you with a filmy spittle thanks to the hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> My gums had started hurting from plaque and gingivitis since I couldn&#x27;t use anything but salt rinses at or near my wounds.  </li>
            <li> Vitis Orthodontic Mouthwash 500ml]], to see if that irritates you too, you may be allergic to all CPC mouth rinses and would have to use Listenine or all natural mouthwashes like Tom&#x27;s [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> so much so, I plan on switching to the entire Crest pro health line.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really seem to go away at all during the entire day when using it in the morning.  </li>
            <li> As far as \\&quot;losing taste\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised it hasn&#x27;t been pulled from the shelves.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have switched to Crest&#x27;s competitor&#x27;s product and so far, knock on wood (or my head)</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t this how class action lawsuits begin?</li>
            <li> I also developed mumps-like symptoms.</li>
            <li> My gums are sensitive now and my mouth tastes like peroxide.</li>
            <li> and I thought I was just hyper sensitive</li>
            <li> I do floss daily and use an electric toothbrush, waterpik,and this rinse, so my success might be the combination of everything I&#x27;m doing, but at my last visit, they could not find any plaque on my teeth, so they then made me eat this &#x27;tablet&#x27; that would expose the plaque, and still couldn&#x27;t find any!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It kind of made things worse.</li>
            <li> I love crest pro health original, but this made my mouth numb, and completely took away my sense of taste.</li>
            <li> pros of this product is that it does what it claims and the next morning, I have pretty decent breath and not the decay smell of dry arid mouth.</li>
            <li> I immediately dumped the remainder down the sink even though I hadn&#x27;t experienced such negative results (yet).  </li>
            <li> The first thing you eat or drink won&#x27;t have much taste, but it&#x27;ll start to have taste after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it left a white filmy residue after rinsing, which wasn&#x27;t anything I was too concerned with.</li>
            <li> but it instantly transforms into white hot foaming magma upon contact with the mucous membranes of your mouth.</li>
            <li> It barely stung, nowhere near an alcohol sting.  </li>
            <li> The product itself works great but the price for 237 ml is very expensive.</li>
            <li> The next day the pain was gone, but it took a couple days for things to return to normal.</li>
            <li> everything coming back normal and no one could figure it out...</li>
            <li> It finally occurred to me that it might be the new mouth wash (I&#x27;d bought a new toothbrush and toothpaste at the same time).  </li>
            <li> So I decided to use this because I have a new resolution for myself to thoroughly clean my teeth at least 1 time a day.</li>
            <li> So while yes my mouth is technically clean, I feel it is slight overkill to not only kill germs and bacteria</li>
            <li> short, if it works for you, it works really well, and I would check the ingredients for possible allergens or irritants.  </li>
            <li> did a little more research on the active ingredient</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if some other dental/ oral problems exist with the other reviewers, but all these people couldn&#x27;t be wrong or imagining these symptoms, so I will do more extensive research, just for my own knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Luckily I didn&#x27;t take it for too long, so hopefully the pain won&#x27;t last long!</li>
            <li> If you are not sensitive to this mouthwash (apparently some are), I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought some of this stuff, thinking it was going to be amazing, boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Apparently CPC distorts your sense of taste for a while</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like, but I can tolerate, is the foaming action of the hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> Actually bought this in a local store thinking it would be a benefit over normal mouthwash.</li>
            <li> so this is a stark difference in my smile.  </li>
            <li> The better my dental hygiene regimen got, the worse my mouth felt.</li>
            <li> I am upset that there are this many poor reviews and the product is still being sold.  </li>
            <li> The taste is kind of weird</li>
            <li> Even worse, after using the product for 3 days I have lost most of my ability to taste and my tongue feels like it has been chemically burned.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I felt a slight tingling sensation on my tongue and gums.</li>
            <li> but later, when comparing the efficacy of Listerine v. Crest Pro-Health, I found some dental discussion boards and more than a few reviews which alleged that the blue mouthwash stained people&#x27;s teeth.  </li>
            <li> This product also contains a higher percentage of the active ingredients found in regular mouth washes.</li>
            <li> Your mouth will have a distinctly clean feeling afterward - some say metallic taste - for at least an hour.</li>
            <li> , I realize it&#x27;s more of a numb, filmy feeling that I can&#x27;t really describe and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have to brush my teeth as long anymore, either, more like the recommended time (2 minutes) instead of 10 minutes (not good for the teeth).</li>
            <li> After a second use, I noticed pain in my parotid salivary glands (in front of the ear, near the back of the jaw).</li>
            <li> I very rarely feel strongly enough about a product, positively or negatively, to write a review on the internet.</li>
            <li> Apparently, a lot of the Crest Pro Health line has caused numerous problems in consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this product for only a couple days to address concerns about gingivitis, I had lost all sense of taste for salt or sweet (for the entire day, not just immediately following use), had a burned sensation on the front third of my tongue, and a whole mouth full of inflamed, gritty feeling and PAINFUL gums.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve stopped using the product, I&#x27;m just hoping the swelling goes down in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I believe that the main problem is that some of the other people who are using this do not need clinical strength mouth.</li>
            <li> It alters the taste of food for me only very temporarily, for about an hour, but that&#x27;s not much different than when I use any other mouthwash.</li>
            <li> So as bad as it may seem at first, stick it out and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> throwing the taste of foods off like most mouthwashes will do, but apparently I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you&#x27;re a paid subject and have to use it the full 2 weeks it may in fact reverse gingivitis, but it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> My normal rinse is plain old yellow Listerine.</li>
            <li> I thought it might have been because I used a lot of it, but the 2nd time I used it, which was a small amount, the same thing happened and I spit it out right away.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this product, noticed certain foods started to taste off.  </li>
            <li> Before I started using this I had persisted bad breathe and nothing would help it, mouth wash wise, not even the supposed</li>
            <li> If it is too intense for some people, that is no reason to assume that it is a bad product and take it away from those of us who need it and are extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> My gums are sensitive and just feel odd in general</li>
            <li> Maybe the other reviewers should consult their dental care professional about this, then give us all another review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Idk what to say other than wow..</li>
            <li> My gums are raw, I feel like my gums are receding, and my teeth often hurt so much</li>
            <li> Also use for only 30 seconds or less, and gently scrape your tongue with a wet toothbrush to remove any foam after rinsing with it.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there are so many negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> As long as you are only using this product once a day at night time it should not affect how things taste the next day.</li>
            <li> I tried it to see if it work work better than Listerine in controlling plaque that forms near a permanent retainer at the back of my bottom teeth, and after using this two nights the plaque was so bad it felt like i hadn&#x27;t brushed my teeth at all.</li>
            <li> This has actually been a common complaint online in many blogs.  </li>
            <li> If this is truly &amp;#34;Clinical&amp;#34; and with regular, appropriate use creates these painful side effects for so many people, Crest or the FDA needs to take this product off the shelves--or, at least leave in it the hands of dental professionals who know how to administer it properly for people who need such a harsh product.</li>
            <li> and apparently I am not alone.</li>
            <li> There was also a strange foamy, almost powdery white stuff in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I stopped after about 5 days, and within a few days, the sores healed and my tongue felt normal</li>
            <li> Try using it less frequently until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Moral of the story is this waste of $5 mouthwash is going straight down my drain.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not nearly as long for me as other reviewers are complaining about.</li>
            <li> If you could deal with the burning sensation on your tongue all day long, this product might just work for you as a weight control alternative.</li>
            <li> There was also a strange metallic chemical taste in my mouth throughout the day which seemed to be getting stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also have pink bumps on the very back of my tongue!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a four out of five instead of a five because of a couple of minor issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as you know that you can work through it and in the long run it&#x27;ll benefit the health of you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hydrogen peroxide as a mouthwash before, and it can be mildly irritating at first (though far less so than this stuff).</li>
            <li> On the 2nd night I began to experience a severe toothache in the lower half of my left jaw.</li>
            <li> As far as the burning tissue and loss of taste some people are noticing, I would suggest using it only once a day, in the morning, because you produce a lot less saliva at night to water it down.</li>
            <li> Between the pain and loss of taste, and the strange white stuff, I am not willing to take a chance by using it again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to think the ache and swelling on the left side of my mouth are due to this Crest mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I was also unable to chew without significant discomfort, in the form of a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I regularly rinse before going to bed, but since using this product I found that I have cottonmouth (extreme dry mouth) during the night and when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see that so many people had the same issue!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after 3 days and still can&#x27;t taste the difference between potato chips with french onion dip, a cheeseburger with all the toppings, or the cheesecake I tried last night,  everything tastes like plain boiled noodles, almost like cardboard but</li>
            <li> There are so many reports online from users experiencing the same thing it makes me sick.</li>
            <li> For those who have the same problem, I got some advice to suck on a sour candy in hopes that the gland will activate and unblock itself.</li>
            <li> I dumped the entire bottle down the drain and will probably never use another product from Crest again after this experience.</li>
            <li> I just poured the entire bottle down the sink and will not ever be using this again.</li>
            <li> My husband had a similar, less severe reaction but didn&#x27;t put it together until it happened to me.</li>
            <li> I sure hope there is no permanent damage to my taste, because this is pretty awful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a little over a week and only in the evening.</li>
            <li> I am going to flush it down the toilet.</li>
            <li> Things also just don&#x27;t quite taste the same, it&#x27;s definitely having a negative effect on my taste buds.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see all these negative reviews about this, since it has not happened to me.</li>
            <li> Spent over $400 on doctors and medications for what we thought was thrush.</li>
            <li> I carefully followed the directions for use on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> side-effect is not disclosed on the packaging and given the number of respondents complaining this does not seem to be affecting only a few.  </li>
            <li> My cheeks were burning and felt scaly and rough.</li>
            <li> a few days later was getting some relief from the pain...</li>
            <li> No, not really...</li>
            <li> A few months later (two days ago) I used it again.</li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning and the sores were so much worse and completely inflamed.</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing a metallic taste in my mouth, numbness of my tongue and a strange black spot on my tongue after just 2 days of use.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just start off I&#x27;ve only recently became an avid mouthwash user since I have a problem with bad breath.</li>
            <li> After two days of using this product, my tongue was numb throughout the day and my sense of taste significantly reduced.  </li>
            <li> In retrospect, I should have pushed over the Duane Reade store display to save myself and other unsuspecting customers from the unpleasantness that followed.</li>
            <li> (Not interested in carrying prescription mouthwash with me.)</li>
            <li> The aftertaste is expected since it is advertised as \\&quot;Clinical\\&quot;, which conveys to me that it&#x27;s stronger than your average rinse.</li>
            <li> There are other options.</li>
            <li> Though my ability to taste other flavors seem unchanged, I&#x27;ve stopped using it.</li>
            <li> burns, losing some to all sense of taste, teeth turning brown, among other problems.</li>
            <li> Medium spiciness tasted like my mouth was literally on fire, and other foods didn&#x27;t taste like how I remembered.</li>
            <li> I got small cracks and tiny blisters on the tip.</li>
            <li> After reviewing other stories here, seems that this needs to be pulled from the market.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with any other crest products.</li>
            <li> I was worried I might have messed my mouth up permanently before I read these other reviews ...</li>
            <li> I have used other Crest mouth washes with no problem.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed with the mouthwash again that night, hoping that, like every other mouthwash I&#x27;ve used, it would help heal the sores.</li>
            <li> My problems were certainly due to manufacturer error/negligence, not user error.</li>
            <li> I usually ended up spitting again a minute or two later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and some people say it takes a month.</li>
            <li> Not sure when I will get it back.</li>
            <li> The downside is, I regret not reading the other reviews before buying this product.</li>
            <li> My tongue felt numb, and it took a long time to go back to normal.</li>
            <li> I decided to google if other customers were experiencing this reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the sensitivity is related or if it is just a coincidence, but I&#x27;ve never had any tooth pain before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I never experienced any swollen glands, but I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not I experienced loss of taste because I only used this product in the evening right before bed.  </li>
            <li> Maybe hydrogen peroxide reacts with the active ingredient, cetylpyridinum chloride.</li>
            <li> Perhaps some folks just happen to be allergic to the active ingredient (Cetylpyridinuim chloride).</li>
            <li> In addition, plaque was worse overall on my upper teeth, including in places I&#x27;ve never had problems.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is CPC.</li>
            <li> After eating an Altoid the other day and noticing that I couldn&#x27;t taste it, I realized that something was not right.  </li>
            <li> Results were the same; by mid-day I started to have a lining of fuzzy plague building up on my teeth along the gumline that was hard to remove, even with my electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my tongue was slightly numb after using it, but that my breath remained fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I searched the internet to figure out what it could be and this pops up as a big complaint about this product.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the trade off.  </li>
            <li> I am totally surprised and confused, as I see my dentist or periodontist every 4 months, and they say I have the cleanest teeth ever-</li>
            <li> However,  after this period i was forced to stop when my left lower jaw bone gland began to swell</li>
            <li> Burnt my taste buds right off with only one use. :(</li>
            <li> Ended up dumping the rest of the bottle down the drain.</li>
            <li> I poured it down the drain and am still waiting for my tongue to heal.</li>
            <li> This went down the drain.</li>
            <li> I immediately dumped it down the drain.</li>
            <li> I never used it again, and in fact I poured it down the drain.</li>
            <li> If by \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; they mean \\&quot;will remove several layers of skin,\\</li>
            <li> everything went dull and flat.  </li>
            <li> After 2 days use (as directed on label), a large portion of my tongue felt as though it had been burned and my upper gums became lined with painful canker sores.</li>
            <li> Unlike a few other reviewers, I never noticed any chemical burns.  </li>
            <li> Within two days, my mouth and tongue developed numerous sores, and my tongue often tingled and began going numb.</li>
            <li> And not the typical burn from mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many mouthwash products and have never had such a horrible experience with any others,  including the ones with alcohol.</li>
            <li> less than 7 days.</li>
            <li> This seems odd for someone like myself who flosses every day, brushes twice a day and uses two types of mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> and it does stick in your mouth for about half an hour afterwards</li>
            <li> not quite that bland.  </li>
            <li> Not cold, CERTAINLY not anything salty, nothing but water and even with that it hurts extremely bad to move.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and have noticed a LOT of dark stain.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t detect hot or cold either.</li>
            <li> Teeth felt very clean; inside of bottom lip and insides of cheeks broke out in what looked like awful inflamed sores a few days after regular use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and haven&#x27;t had one problem at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why other people buy this product, but that&#x27;s my reason.</li>
            <li> I was freaking out thinking I had herpes or something, only to discover that this is a common side effect!</li>
            <li> And if you went to your Dentist after using this and haven&#x27;t been to one within 6 months, and they claimed your teeth needs cleaning, your teeth was dirty to begin with or they&#x27;re simply charging you money for a simple cleaning.</li>
            <li> But my symptoms were worse with swollen white tongue.</li>
            <li> This cleared those issues up within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a waste of $5+.</li>
            <li> destroying mouth washes.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was having trouble with receding gums.  </li>
            <li> After using for a few days, my gums are covered in ulcers.</li>
            <li> Additionally, my taste buds had gotten worse and I could only taste on the sides of my tongue.</li>
            <li> Same thing, and this time it was worse.</li>
            <li> What I can say, though, is that after using the product every evening for the past month or so, I have noticed dark stains between the gaps of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I would never buy this product again, it was too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that a bad reaction to Crest PH Clinical means you have poor oral hygiene, but if you do have poor oral hygiene, you may want to try the traditional route of brushing, flossing, and regular cleanings first.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other 1-star reviews said, this stuff has some nasty side effects.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I had a terrible experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Very odd.  </li>
            <li> I first used this after some dental work, and developed the WORST tooth ache and sore throat EVER.</li>
            <li> It felt like my tongue had been scalded badly with hot soup or coffee.</li>
            <li> Any kind of food tasted awful, and the mouth felt numb for a while after the rinse.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I switched to generously dipping the tooth brush in it and brushed the teeth and gums, in other words applying it where it was needed, it worked wonder, stopping gum bleeding in one or two applications.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really unfortunate that so many had bad experiences with this product.</li>
            <li> After using this product only a short while, my lower teeth turned an ugly brown and look rotted out.  </li>
            <li> After the fifth or sixth use, I developed a cluster of sores at the base of my gums in the deep pocket in the front of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I am heading to urgent care now to find out whether or not I need further treatment, to find out what exactly is wrong, and to have my symptoms documented.</li>
            <li> I also just noticed a small brown spot on one of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are having problems?</li>
            <li> All you have to do is run your tongue over your teeth and gums and keep spitting out until you feel no more sliminess.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> couple days after I stopped using the product, I started having tooth sensitivity to hot and cold foods when I would eat on one side of my mouth!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why this stuff is so caustic, but I have never had this experience with other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> decided to check Amazon reviews on this product to see what other people were saying about the weird thick foam left on mouth and tongue and see that mouth pain is VERY common with this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> As a physician I am shocked this is on the market, particularly when the bottle contains no warnings of these side effects.  </li>
            <li> Checked reviews of this product before totally freaking out and saw that it is common for things to taste weird while using this product.</li>
            <li> After one day of discontinuing use I am regaining normal sensation on the end of my tongue, though the mouth of painful gums persists.  </li>
            <li> The people writing reviews are pretty off base with their comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> horror stories of burns, sores and icky film baffle me.</li>
            <li> Wish I could rate negative.</li>
            <li> but I felt I needed to do at least something.</li>
            <li> Since this is a common problem I went ahead and called Crest and filed a complaint on it -</li>
            <li> It hurt horribly to eat (guess it was fortunate I couldn&#x27;t taste anyway).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quoting from the crest website after I submitted a complaint.</li>
            <li> After using my tounge is numb and my entire mouth throbs.</li>
            <li> an now it&#x27;s too late</li>
            <li> I have since called P&amp;G to file a complaint</li>
            <li> I also had deep pain along my jawline that made me think something was terribly wrong!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was due to this horrible product until a few days later.</li>
            <li> THEN I started to develop serious gum irritation and tooth pain.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And then the internet is flooded with reports of the toothpaste causing serious gum irritation and teeth pain.  </li>
            <li> To make it worse, I can hardly taste any food.</li>
            <li> Personally, I found out things were bad when I ate some buffalo wings.</li>
            <li> Too bad that&#x27;s not going to help the pain deep in my jaw.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it took me a few days to figure out</li>
            <li> It was incredibly painful for an entire day!</li>
            <li> Even if someone doesn&#x27;t rinse out all of their toothpaste, though, the risks should not include damaged taste buds and MULTIPLE PAINFUL ulcers.</li>
            <li> not a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> I attribute both to this awful, and more importantly, dangerous product.</li>
            <li> written a negative review before!</li>
            <li> My mouth and tongue have extreme pain now and food taste very weird.</li>
            <li> My tongue has completely become numb and it&#x27;s painful to eat/drink (even drinking water).</li>
            <li> Doing a bit of research on the web will show some folks symptoms are much worse than mine.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for about a week and have not experienced what others are saying.</li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any of the problems described by anyone else.</li>
            <li> My whole meal was absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worried about the stains, I decided to step up my game and try Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> and I have not experienced any of these side effects.</li>
            <li> Before the rest of my review, I have to say I have not experienced any burning or mouth sores or swelling.</li>
            <li> It foams up because of the hydrogen peroxide, which is annoying, but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> However, I am doubtful because I am convinced they only care about their profit and not the lives of those who they target.</li>
            <li> After using it for a day or two I noticed my mouth was numb and feeling raw</li>
            <li> I poured my bottle down the drain this morning after I woke up with painful damage to the inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I found that not only was the burning common with this product, but the terrible jaw / ear pain and swelling was as well.</li>
            <li> : Never left a negative review in my life, but this was just awful.</li>
            <li> Yes it tastes a little bad when swishing</li>
            <li> I continued using it for a day or so and then noticed raw areas on the inside of my cheek followed by a swollen and painful gland or lymphnode.</li>
            <li> and I got white sticky foam in my mouth followed by awful burning</li>
            <li> Needless to say, Crest and the FDA will be contacted afterwards.</li>
            <li> Then one day my mouth just got nasty, and I brushed and used the mouthwash and felt burning.</li>
            <li> Eating lunch seemed to exacerbate the discomfort, and when I went to the bathroom I noticed my left jaw was horribly swollen!</li>
            <li> Sadly, I doubt I can get them to pay for my sonicare and cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be finishing the bottle.</li>
            <li> the Warnings didn&#x27;t notify any weird symptoms.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the worst mouthwash there is.</li>
            <li> If I could give it 0 stars I would, but unfortunately amazon does not provide that option.</li>
            <li> It was weird and I rinsed with water and went on with my day.</li>
            <li> This product does something horrible, I only used it maybe three times and now I&#x27;m wondering when</li>
            <li> so I &#x27;researched&#x27; this product again, and have determined that it is causing stains; again, all these people couldn&#x27;t be wrong.</li>
            <li> This stuff is weird.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s weird, so</li>
            <li> Thought I had something wrong with my mouth and was going to go to the doctor until I read these reviews</li>
            <li> Food began tasting weird.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea what was wrong.  </li>
            <li> The rise leaves this weird slimy, foamy stuff in your mouth that takes a LOT of spitting to get rid of.</li>
            <li> We are all in the same tasteless, disgusting boat.</li>
            <li> That can put you at risk for secondary infections and serious I problems !!!!</li>
            <li> This is crazy how it&#x27;s still on shelves.</li>
            <li> After about four days of using it twice a day, I noticed my tongue was slightly numb</li>
            <li> I just started using it (didn&#x27;t buy on amazon) and found that my sense of taste is WAY off after using it and my tongue feels cold all day.</li>
            <li> Today my tongue is completely numb and I cannot taste ANYTHING.</li>
            <li> Words couldn&#x27;t describe how disappointed and angry</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a very weird tingly sensation in the joint of my jaw.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regarding the bad reviews - I wonder if there was a bad batch distributed, or if a batch was tampered with, or if the people using it may be allergic to an ingredient, perhaps to CPC antimicrobrials or something else in it.  </li>
            <li> Crest&#x27;s website has bad reviews as well.</li>
            <li> bad breathe</li>
            <li> This BURNS the inside of my cheeks so badly</li>
            <li> This is extremely painful and I might have to undergo oral surgery to remove the clog.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get a warning that my tongue was going to explode in to painful chemical burns.</li>
            <li> Of course I quit using it after I woke up to a swollen extremely painfully burned tongue.</li>
            <li> This mouth wash has a terrible taste, and is much worse than the cheaper alcohol based mouth washes.</li>
            <li> product is dangerous!</li>
            <li> Crazy!</li>
            <li> Scary, horrible product.  </li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff is DANGEROUS and should be BANNED by the FDA!</li>
            <li> They need to pull this crap from the shelves.</li>
            <li> I am a chef and this crap literally ruined my sense of taste.</li>
            <li> Then, I wake up this morning and my teeth are brown at the base, halfway up the tooth and between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> However, I truly feel that everyone should how how terrible and dangerous this product is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, Crest, take this crap and shove it someplace.</li>
            <li> STAINS VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE !</li>
            <li> I used the mouthwash again after my tongue started hurting and it stung very bad</li>
            <li> the stuff is very bad for you and has caused birth defects in test animal populations.</li>
            <li> WORST MISTAKE EVER, this mouth wash burns very badly and your mouth foams up for minutes afterwards (like an animal with rabies).  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed that the FDA is allowing this to be on shelves.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very dangerous!</li>
            <li> By this point, the tip of my tongue had begun to burn terribly.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely awful.  </li>
            <li> it was this product creating the horrible burning on my tongue.</li>
            <li> Tried to leave a review on the Crest clinical website and (shockingly) the review submission for this product is not working.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> It took me about a week of using it and googling the internet to realize that this stuff had a horrible reaction in my mouth.</li>
            <li> but this is so awful that I had to.</li>
            <li> It has now been three days since I stopped using this terrible product and my mouth</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible experience which I believe is connected to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse and Crest Pro-Health Clinical</li>
            <li> The taste is horrible</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are awful, awful products.  </li>
            <li> This product is TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> This is the worst mouthwash ever!</li>
            <li> After using this product once, I noticed a horrible chemical sensation on the tip of my tongue.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand these horrible reviews!</li>
            <li> Fiancee thought I had some sort of horrible disease and refused to share drinks with me.  </li>
            <li> I have a metallic taste in my mouth which makes all of my food taste terrible.  </li>
            <li> This mouthwash is the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful!!</li>
            <li> horrible product!!</li>
            <li> They said they&#x27;d had reports of complaints but were awfully cavalier and said to rinse with salt water.</li>
            <li> I have had the worst sore throat for 2 days now, and this morning I woke up</li>
            <li> As soon as I find out where to report it, I just reported this harmful crap to the FDA!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product and I have no idea how it managed to get FDA approval.</li>
            <li> It does make you spit nasty slimy stuff, like snot.</li>
            <li> this is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this horrible product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do not recommend this product. For the first time in my life, my right salivary gland in my cheek is clogged. This is after its first use. The next day, my left one is clogged. This is extremely painful and I might have to undergo oral surgery to remove the clog.</li>
            <li> I went to Walmart to try some different mouth rinse and I bought this. I used this before bed and I got white sticky foam in my mouth followed by awful burning and I just thought the product was doing its job. I used this again in the morning and same outcome. My mouth and tongue have extreme pain now and food taste very weird. DO NOT BUY THIS! THE FDA NEED TO PULL THIS!!!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review on Amazon before but am so horrified by what this demon&#x27;s spittle has done to my mouth that I felt compelled to do so. I had my first cavity a week ago at age 25 and decided to improve my dental routine to avoid future ones; Crest Pro-Health seemed like an ideal product for doing so. In retrospect, I should have pushed over the Duane Reade store display to save myself and other unsuspecting customers from the unpleasantness that followed. I used the mouth rinse once on Saturday night and once on Sunday morning. By Sunday afternoon, I was experiencing pain at the top of my right jaw / bottom of my right ear whenever I yawned. All day, it worsened. Not realizing that the mouth rinse was the culprit, I again used it on Sunday night and Monday morning. By this point, the tip of my tongue had begun to burn terribly. I suspected that the mouth rinse was behind that and searched online to see if anyone else had experienced the same problems. I found that not only was the burning common with this product, but the terrible jaw / ear pain and swelling was as well. The inflammation seems to stem from the lymph nodes or the parotid gland. I suppose that I should consider myself lucky since I have not yet lost the ability to taste food and that my teeth have not yet turned brown, as a number of customers have also experienced. I am heading to urgent care now to find out whether or not I need further treatment, to find out what exactly is wrong, and to have my symptoms documented. Needless to say, Crest and the FDA will be contacted afterwards. I am beyond enraged.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by my hygienist after she told me I was showing the beginnings of gum disease.  I picked up a bottle and within two hours of using it I noticed a complete loss of taste and my tongue felt as if I had scalded it with hot coffee.  As a physician I am shocked this is on the market, particularly when the bottle contains no warnings of these side effects.  Doing a bit of research on the web will show some folks symptoms are much worse than mine.  It would not surprise me if P&amp;G ended up with a suit against them for marketing this menace.</li>
            <li> After one try I can tell this mouthwash is different from all the others. Hours later my breath still smells fresh. Definitely will be buying again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I bought this rinse because I had oral surgery yesterday, filled a prescription for Chlorhexidine (a rinse), and wanted to have something comparable at work. (Not interested in carrying prescription mouthwash with me.) I don&#x27;t expect to use the Chlorhexidine forever and have the same expectation for the Crest PH Clinical rinse. I&#x27;m not sure why other people buy this product, but that&#x27;s my reason. My normal rinse is plain old yellow Listerine. As for the Crest PH Clinical, it contains Cetylpyridinium Chloride (CPC). Apparently CPC distorts your sense of taste for a while and I can attest to that, but it&#x27;s not nearly as long for me as other reviewers are complaining about. I&#x27;d summarize the experience like so: a 30-second swishing will tingle the same as Listerine and will leave you with a filmy spittle thanks to the hydrogen peroxide. Your mouth will have a distinctly clean feeling afterward - some say metallic taste - for at least an hour. The first thing you eat or drink won&#x27;t have much taste, but it&#x27;ll start to have taste after a few minutes. Anyone who uses mouth rinse on a regular basis is used to this effect already. Try drinking orange juice five minutes after swishing with Listerine. The difference is that this stuff lingers longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I give it four stars is because it contains CPC, which is recognized by the FDA as very effective against bacteria, other microorganisms, and is shown to prevent gingivitis. Those are what I am looking for in a post-operative oral rinse. I also like the minty taste and the addition of hydrogen peroxide. The aftertaste is expected since it is advertised as \\&quot;Clinical\\&quot;, which conveys to me that it&#x27;s stronger than your average rinse. The reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because there&#x27;s nothing special about CPC. It&#x27;s been around a while and a variety of products have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to use lower-strength mouthwash for daily use. Reserve this for special occasions like surgery or infection. If youhave gingivitis, brush better, get cleanings more often, or both. I&#x27;m not saying that a bad reaction to Crest PH Clinical means you have poor oral hygiene, but if you do have poor oral hygiene, you may want to try the traditional route of brushing, flossing, and regular cleanings first. This stuff wouldn&#x27;t be a good substitute for good practices.</li>
            <li> I got this after my last dental appointment to help reduce plaque and improve my gum health. I regularly rinse before going to bed, but since using this product I found that I have cottonmouth (extreme dry mouth) during the night and when I wake up in the morning. This product claims to reduce plaque and gingivitis, however, dry mouth harbors more bacteria and promotes plaque and gingivitis. I do not recommend this product. In fact, I am switching back to Listerine.</li>
            <li> For a couple days I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out why I can&#x27;t taste a thing!  I decided to research any reviews on this product since it&#x27;s the only item I&#x27;ve recently changed.  It is absolutely awful.  The roof of my mouth feels like I burnt it on pizza &amp; the tip &amp; sides of my tongue are sore.  So along with the blandness of everything I eat.. I urge anyone to not purchase!</li>
            <li> Regular use is good overall hygiene ...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it took me a few days to figure out it was this product creating the horrible burning on my tongue. I couldn&#x27;t taste food and my tongue burned constantly. Tried to leave a review on the Crest clinical website and (shockingly) the review submission for this product is not working. Can&#x27;t believe its on shelves. Terrible. Awful. Do not use unless you like the sensation of your tongue being on fire.</li>
            <li> After using this rinse with toothpaste a week. I am losing my taste sense.&lt;br /&gt;I am a really avereage person who doesn&#x27;t have sepecific allegy.&lt;br /&gt;This product is dangerous!</li>
            <li> So I decided to give this mouth wash a try and boy do I wish I had read it&#x27;s reviews first! The first time I used it, it left a white filmy residue after rinsing, which wasn&#x27;t anything I was too concerned with. I continued using it for a day or so and then noticed raw areas on the inside of my cheek followed by a swollen and painful gland or lymphnode. It was incredibly painful for an entire day! The next day the pain was gone, but it took a couple days for things to return to normal.</li>
            <li> After eating an Altoid the other day and noticing that I couldn&#x27;t taste it, I realized that something was not right.  I&#x27;ve been using this mouth wash for about a week now and have the same symptoms that everyone else is talking about - a burning tongue and loss of taste.  Who the hell tests this stuff before putting it on the market???</li>
            <li> Like many of the other 1-star reviews said, this stuff has some nasty side effects. Within two days, my mouth and tongue developed numerous sores, and my tongue often tingled and began going numb. It wasn&#x27;t catastrophic, but it was a constant source of irritation. I stopped after about 5 days, and within a few days, the sores healed and my tongue felt normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why this stuff is so caustic, but I have never had this experience with other mouthwashes. Even Crest&#x27;s regular Pro-Health Rinse I am a fan of. But something just isn&#x27;t right about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if it has to do with the hydrogen peroxide; tucked away under \\&quot;inactive ingredients\\&quot; is hydrogen peroxide (which is not an ingredient in the regular Pro-Health Rinse). I&#x27;ve used hydrogen peroxide as a mouthwash before, and it can be mildly irritating at first (though far less so than this stuff). I wonder what the concentration is; it&#x27;s not listed because hydrogen peroxide is an \\&quot;inactive\\&quot; ingredient (even though it probably contributes to the reversal of gingivitis). The hydrogen peroxide you buy at the store is only 3% and it doesn&#x27;t bother my mouth (although it can burn somewhat when you first start). If this stuff is more concentrated, that could explain it. Or maybe it&#x27;s something about the overall chemical composition. Maybe hydrogen peroxide reacts with the active ingredient, cetylpyridinum chloride. Or maybe the increase from 0.07% to 0.1% cetylpyridinum chloride is more than the mouth can handle (though I doubt it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever the case, this stuff doesn&#x27;t belong in a human mouth. Maybe if you&#x27;re a paid subject and have to use it the full 2 weeks it may in fact reverse gingivitis, but it&#x27;s not worth it. There are other options. If you have gingivitis, brush with (3%) hydrogen peroxide for a week or two; that did the trick for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked great for me. It left my mouth feeling actually clean. Not masked or covered up or burned, just clean. As for my sense of taste, it&#x27;s still fine. Granted, I can still taste this stuff in my mouth for a good hour or so after I use it, but I don&#x27;t \\&quot;clean\\&quot; my mouth then eat an hour later.( I use this after breakfast and after supper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The horror stories of burns, sores and icky film baffle me. Perhaps some folks just happen to be allergic to the active ingredient (Cetylpyridinuim chloride). It&#x27;s really unfortunate that so many had bad experiences with this product. I had only positive results and will buy it as long as it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Spent over $400 on doctors and medications for what we thought was thrush. Turns out it was this crest pro health toothpaste. After telling my son he said he had the same white mucus in his mouth. But my symptoms were worse with swollen white tongue. Never ever use this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I regularly use Listerine, but I had my wisdom teeth removed and did not want the alcohol in the Listerine to sting and burn my wounds. So I bought this, and it worked.  It barely stung, nowhere near an alcohol sting.  My gums had started hurting from plaque and gingivitis since I couldn&#x27;t use anything but salt rinses at or near my wounds.  This cleared those issues up within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is foaming, but it is clear.  I notice the more sugar I&#x27;ve had, the more foamy it is, so I attribute the foam to dead germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the bad reviews - I wonder if there was a bad batch distributed, or if a batch was tampered with, or if the people using it may be allergic to an ingredient, perhaps to CPC antimicrobrials or something else in it.  I know that I would have similar reactions w/ my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if it works for you, it works really well, and I would check the ingredients for possible allergens or irritants.  Try another CPC brand like Vitis[[ASIN:B007BDMWB4 Vitis Orthodontic Mouthwash 500ml]], to see if that irritates you too, you may be allergic to all CPC mouth rinses and would have to use Listenine or all natural mouthwashes like Tom&#x27;s [[ASIN:B00498F69Y Tom&#x27;s of Maine Spearmint Cleansing Mouthwash, 16-Ounce (Pack of 3)]] or [[ASIN:B00127OY1Q Jason Powersmile Mouthwash, Cinnamon Powermint, 16 Ounce]] or [[ASIN:B0011TWVWE Healthy Gums Antigingivitis Rinse- Peppermint Twist 16.90 Ounces]] or [[ASIN:B003X0CXXQ PerioClear Organic Alcohol Free Mouthwash 16oz]]. There are many out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, ask your dentists and dental hygienists! Mine said it was ok except she has more work to do with the slight surface staining (that is mentioned on the label as easily removable). My mouth also feels cleaner overall,so much so, I plan on switching to the entire Crest pro health line.</li>
            <li> I just won&#x27;t provide my opinion but what the dental hygienist said during my last dental cleaning.  \\&quot;Your home healthcare is excellent\\&quot;.  Good results with no side effects.</li>
            <li> So this morning was the beginning of my 3rd day on this product and after the first couple of days of just thinking it was working really well and keeping a clean feeling in my mouth, I realize it&#x27;s more of a numb, filmy feeling that I can&#x27;t really describe and it doesn&#x27;t really seem to go away at all during the entire day when using it in the morning.  Things also just don&#x27;t quite taste the same, it&#x27;s definitely having a negative effect on my taste buds.  I also just noticed a small brown spot on one of my teeth.  I feel like this product would probably work really well at reversing gingivitis after a few weeks or months.. but at what cost? I was excited to find something that would help reverse the gingivitis problems I&#x27;ve been dealing with but I guess I&#x27;ll have to search elsewhere because the side effects are just too much to overcome.</li>
            <li> I used this only once, and later that day I noticed I couldn&#x27;t taste the delicious cherries I had enjoyed only the night before - they simply taste like nothing. Though my ability to taste other flavors seem unchanged, I&#x27;ve stopped using it. I can&#x27;t believe the FDA allows this to be sold over the counter.</li>
            <li> It took me about a week of using it and googling the internet to realize that this stuff had a horrible reaction in my mouth. Immediately I lost my sense of taste but I didn&#x27;t realize it was the mouthwash. Then one day my mouth just got nasty, and I brushed and used the mouthwash and felt burning. Then I thought let me do a quick google and apparently I am not alone. This is crazy how it&#x27;s still on shelves. Perhaps some people don&#x27;t have this reaction. Use at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this on Amazon and I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but this is so awful that I had to. I don&#x27;t understand how this stuff is legally sold in the US. I have been experiencing a metallic taste in my mouth, numbness of my tongue and a strange black spot on my tongue after just 2 days of use. This is literally poison. P&amp;G should be ashamed for selling this and someone should check how the FDA approved this for sale to humans.</li>
            <li> Actually bought this in a local store thinking it would be a benefit over normal mouthwash. After one use I noticed a distinct foam that I was spitting out well after rinsing. After a second use, I noticed pain in my parotid salivary glands (in front of the ear, near the back of the jaw). Eating lunch seemed to exacerbate the discomfort, and when I went to the bathroom I noticed my left jaw was horribly swollen! I looked like I had the mumps! I looked in my mouth and could see the opening to the glands themselves seeming puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!! It is harmful, damaging and should not even be on the shelves.</li>
            <li> This product is an absolute horror. I used it for a day and a half and immediately started feeling excruciating pain in my mouth, particularly my gums and tongue. My gums feel like they are burning and stinging and when I looked in the mirror, there are white burn lines along my gums. The pain is constant and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be going away with anything. I can&#x27;t believe Crest is selling this product. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I dumped the entire bottle down the drain and will probably never use another product from Crest again after this experience. Very disappointed that the FDA is allowing this to be on shelves.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! I bought this from a local store and my mouth burns! And not the typical burn from mouthwash. I feel as though I have chemical burns on the inside of my mouth, on my gums and the inside of my lips. I can&#x27;t even leave my lips in place because it hurts too much. I&#x27;ve only used this product twice! Nothing is helping to soothe the pain. This product shouldn&#x27;t be sold!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very dangerous! I only wish I had read the reviews beforehand. I loved it the first day. I noticed that my tongue was slightly numb after using it, but that my breath remained fresh throughout the day. I thought that the benefits outweighed the drawbacks. However, after waking up on third day of use, I felt like someone had punched me in the jaw. I tried eating something, and experienced a pain akin to someone repeatedly stabbing me in the jaw. My right cheek immediately began to swell up. I knew what I was experiencing was a blocked salivary gland. I&#x27;m now on my second day of pain and trying to decide if I should see a doctor or not. For those who have the same problem, I got some advice to suck on a sour candy in hopes that the gland will activate and unblock itself. I plan on trying this when I work up the courage. This stuff should be recalled.</li>
            <li> I tried this mouthwash for the first time and I will never use it again! It numbed my taste buds for days after I used it and I couldn&#x27;t taste anything. It felt like my tongue had been scalded badly with hot soup or coffee. They need to pull this crap from the shelves. What a waste of $5+.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product after I had some dental work. I could not deal with the burn of regular alcohol since I had my gums cut into. It did not burn at all and made my teeth white from the peroxide, but every time I used it, I would spit out a slimy substance. I figured it was plaque or something similar. After about four days of using it twice a day, I noticed my tongue was slightly numb and it felt as if I had burnt it on hot food. I used the mouthwash again after my tongue started hurting and it stung very bad (This being a mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t burn) To make it worse, I can hardly taste any food. It does not matter how strong or salty it is. It has now been three days since I stopped using this terrible product and my mouth no longer hurts, but my taste is still gone. I hope it comes back soon. This product is the equivalent of getting a chemical peel done in your mouth. It should be removed from the market. I contacted Crest about this, but assume it will fall on deaf ears.</li>
            <li> This product does not even deserve one-star.  It not only removed 99% of the plaque off of my teeth, it removed 99% of sense of taste.  Began using Friday evening, notice that all my food tasted like wax and my tongue felt burned, by Sunday morning, I realized it was this rinse.  I quit using immediately.  I can&#x27;t believe this product even made it on the market.</li>
            <li> This product is not bad, but it appears mny people have had an allergic reaction to this product.  The company is aware of these allergic reactions. This has actually been a common complaint online in many blogs.  I too am one of the people who have had an allergic reaction to this product. I have always used a variety of Crest products and this is the first time I have ever had this problem.  The only side effect I had was loss of taste.  I did not experience the other symptoms of burning and I followed the instructions perfectly and I still lost my sense of taste. I have switched back to Crest 3D and have begun to regain my sense of taste.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a week and have not experienced what others are saying. Maybe they aren&#x27;t following the directions and that&#x27;s altering their experience? The bottle says to rinse out all tooth paste from mouth before use. So maybe some reaction happens if ya don&#x27;t?? As far as \\&quot;losing taste\\&quot; idk seems like ANYTIME you eat something after using mouthwash EVERYTHING tastes different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Clinical Strength mouthwash for the last couple months, and I absolutely love it. My mouth feels fresh even hours after using it. I have paired it with the toothpaste as well, and I can definitely tell that my mouth is cleaner and more fresh. I don&#x27;t have any issues with loss of taste or anything else that others have posted. I do rinse my mouth with water after I use the mouthwash because it is really strong and also leaves a white film... so, others may want to try that. I&#x27;ve had no problems and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Beware. Looks like harmless liquid but it instantly transforms into white hot foaming magma upon contact with the mucous membranes of your mouth. I used this as directed for 2 days. At first my mouth felt satisfyingly clean but side effects kicked in quickly. After 2 days use (as directed on label), a large portion of my tongue felt as though it had been burned and my upper gums became lined with painful canker sores. Nothing like a mouthful of sores to make you think that this product produces the very opposite of dental health.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was the only mouth rinse at the store that didn&#x27;t contain Cetylpyridinium chloride, which yellows my teeth very badly.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing with this Crest rinse twice, my entire tongue felt like it had been burnt on hot coffee. Food no longer tasted the same, and I was starting to freak out! I decided to search online and see if anyone else had experienced these same things, and... here I am on Amazon where everyone else is complaining of the EXACT same difficulties! Why is this product on store shelves?? DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!</li>
            <li> After using this product for only a couple days to address concerns about gingivitis, I had lost all sense of taste for salt or sweet (for the entire day, not just immediately following use), had a burned sensation on the front third of my tongue, and a whole mouth full of inflamed, gritty feeling and PAINFUL gums.  It finally occurred to me that it might be the new mouth wash (I&#x27;d bought a new toothbrush and toothpaste at the same time).  After one day of discontinuing use I am regaining normal sensation on the end of my tongue, though the mouth of painful gums persists.  I&#x27;m just grateful I didn&#x27;t get tooth staining as others have reported.  I just hope I can heal quickly.  BEWARE!</li>
            <li> The people writing reviews are pretty off base with their comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains hydrogen peroxide, which seems to be used in all the new &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; mouth washes. This is what causes the foamy nastiness upon rinsing. The hydrogen peroxide is also what is probably causing the brown spots on people&#x27;s teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you dont brush properly, or go for cleanings regularly, the hydrogen peroxide will react with the gunk on your teeth. You&#x27;ll be left with discolored buildup. It was already there. Now you&#x27;re going to notice it more because it&#x27;s reacted with the hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the sores people claim they get, you may be more sensitive to the hydrogen peroxide. This product also contains a higher percentage of the active ingredients found in regular mouth washes. It&#x27;s all around a more aggressive product. Try using it less frequently until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> After using this product only a short while, my lower teeth turned an ugly brown and look rotted out.  I&#x27;m a singer and a public speaker and this is so embarrassing.  All this can be confirmed by checking it on Google.</li>
            <li> The product itself works great but the price for 237 ml is very expensive. Recommend purchasing the larger size, which was what I thought I was purchasing. (my fault).</li>
            <li> Yes, like many others, after the first few times using it like other mouth wash/rinse solution (gargle and keep it in the mouth for a minute or so after brushing...) my taste buds went on strike.  Any kind of food tasted awful, and the mouth felt numb for a while after the rinse.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I switched to generously dipping the tooth brush in it and brushed the teeth and gums, in other words applying it where it was needed, it worked wonder, stopping gum bleeding in one or two applications.  Afterward brush with it, after tooth paste brushing, to protect the gums.  Make sure to clean the tongue if any of the solution gets on it to avoid effecting the taste buds.&lt;br /&gt;(I bought it locally, but just want to share my experience.  It is definitely a good product if used properly.)</li>
            <li> Dentist found stains in between my teeth and along gum line  last two visits over last eight months. All from this crest product. Google it and read for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;This product should be removed from the market!&lt;br /&gt;ZERO RATING.  HARMFUL. STAINS VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE !</li>
            <li> I am a chef and this crap literally ruined my sense of taste. I had a co workers cupcake and the icing tasted like straight lard, no sensation of sweetness. Assuring me he had put sugar in the icing, I had a piece of chocolate, again, no sweetness. I then ate an entire spoonful of sugar. NOTHING. Add to that it makes your mouth hurt all day and literally causes lesions on your gums. No no no no no no. Do NOT buy this, ever.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after my dentist said the pockets in my gums were getting too deep.  I was trying to prevent having to have an SRP.  After using it for a day or two I noticed my mouth was numb and feeling raw but I figured it was because I had started taking better care of my gums and the flossing was causing it.  Then I lost my sense of taste.  Then my entire left side of my face began to hurt.  Then, I wake up this morning and my teeth are brown at the base, halfway up the tooth and between the teeth.  My teeth are generally very white so this is a stark difference in my smile.  I searched the internet to figure out what it could be and this pops up as a big complaint about this product.  It is the ONLY thing I was doing different except for flossing more often.  And then I looked for a warning label and sure enough, in tiny letters at the bottom of the bottle above the UPC code it says that it could stain teeth.  My dentist says I will need to get another cleaning done and even then sometimes it won&#x27;t come off.  Now I have to pay out of pocket for another cleaning since I just had one.  She also said to get a sonicare and that may help a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if I could give this product ZERO STARS I would.  Crest has been a company I have trusted for years and I expected more from them.  The warning should be larger and more prominant.  It is written below the money back guarentee.  Sadly, I doubt I can get them to pay for my sonicare and cleaning.  If I had kept my reciept I could get my money back, but who keeps mouthwash receipts?</li>
            <li> I wish I seen the reviews before I purchased this product. I&#x27;ve used this twice, once last night and once this morning. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why I can&#x27;t taste anything. My taste hasn&#x27;t recovered. I decided to look on Amazon to see if it has to do with this product...seems I&#x27;m not alone. Every symptom explained exactly. Crest&#x27;s website has bad reviews as well.</li>
            <li> After two days of using this product, my tongue was numb throughout the day and my sense of taste significantly reduced.  I carefully followed the directions for use on the bottle.  Then, I decided to conduct a web search and found that several people were experiencing the same symptoms/problems.  I decided to discontinue using this mouth rinse and contacted P&amp;G&#x27;s customer care dept. via their website.  The customer care people were pleasant and helped me obtain a refund.  For the help I received, I rated the product better than I really wanted.  The product itself doesn&#x27;t warrant any stars at all.</li>
            <li> Really a great product!!! For many years I thought I couldn&#x27;t find a solution to my problem but I accidentally bought this one..at first I loss my taste but after how many minutes it&#x27;s already normal.I&#x27;m really glad I found this product and I will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> Used this two days in a row, morning and night, and can&#x27;t taste jack. Did a google search and discovered that Crest is aware of this problem but sees no reason to fix it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOPE. BUY SOMETHING ELSE. I&#x27;d like my tastebuds back please!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dental student and wanted to try this stuff. After the first two uses I noticed I had lost some of my taste. I used it once last night to give it one last chance and my left parotid gland is now fairly swollen with some pain/sensation during chewing. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be finishing the bottle.</li>
            <li> Alright, so, unlike some people, I only used this stuff for two days before I figured to check online for reviews. Apparently, a lot of the Crest Pro Health line has caused numerous problems in consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chemical burns, losing some to all sense of taste, teeth turning brown, among other problems. Personally, I found out things were bad when I ate some buffalo wings. Medium spiciness tasted like my mouth was literally on fire, and other foods didn&#x27;t taste like how I remembered. Ended up dumping the rest of the bottle down the drain. My gums are sensitive and just feel odd in general and I have mild blistering on the inside of my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, and it&#x27;s the last Crest product I buy. If I could give it 0 stars, I most certainly would.</li>
            <li> Yes, the sore tooth feels better, but I can no longer taste food.  Not worth the trade off.  I want my taste buds back.</li>
            <li> Wish I could rate negative. Burnt my taste buds right off with only one use. :(</li>
            <li> Bought this mouthwash 3 days ago thinking I was helping my very mild gingivitis. On the 2nd night I began to experience a severe toothache in the lower half of my left jaw. That whole side of my mouth feels swollen.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t attribute it to this mouthwash at all and have just been popping ibuprofen&#x27;s hoping it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to check Amazon reviews on this product to see what other people were saying about the weird thick foam left on mouth and tongue and see that mouth pain is VERY common with this mouthwash. I&#x27;m beginning to think the ache and swelling on the left side of my mouth are due to this Crest mouthwash. I just poured the entire bottle down the sink and will not ever be using this again. Do not buy this stuff. I cannot believe Crest has not been sued yet!</li>
            <li> I keep reading all these reviews of people saying their mouth and tongue burned, lost of taste and everything else. It&#x27;s odd, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and haven&#x27;t had one problem at all. Yes it tastes a little bad when swishing but after I spit it out then it was just a nice minty taste. It did not burn my tongue, mouth or cause any problems. My mouth feels clean and my teeth look great! I&#x27;m not sure why people are having problems? Maybe they are using too much? I only fill the lid up to the first line so it&#x27;s not that much, I know some people fill up the whole cap and that&#x27;s way too much. The slimy feel people are feeling I&#x27;m guessing is the peroxide because it sits on your teeth and gumline after you spit it out. All you have to do is run your tongue over your teeth and gums and keep spitting out until you feel no more sliminess. That&#x27;s what I do and then there is no residue on my teeth. I like it so far!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful. I&#x27;m surprised it hasn&#x27;t been pulled from the shelves. This stuff makes my tongue feel like it&#x27;s been burned, like when you drink something that&#x27;s too hot. I got small cracks and tiny blisters on the tip. Crazy!</li>
            <li> Before I start off with this review, I would like you to know that I am a regular Crest user.. I use their toothbrush, toothpaste, their whitening strips, etc. Also, I have NEVER IN MY LIFE written a negative review before! Simply because if  I didn&#x27;t like a product I would just toss it and not bother with it anymore. Now, with that said, Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse- claimed to be Crest&#x27;s \\&quot;Most Advanced Rinse Ever\\&quot;- is COMPLETE GARBAGE! I saw this product in a local drugstore and it immediately caught my eye with the CLINICAL labeling, so I took it and checked the ingredients and warnings in the store. Seemed fine to me because #1 alcohol wasn&#x27;t on the Active or Inactive Ingredient list, #2 the Warnings didn&#x27;t notify any weird symptoms. So I took the bottle home. After the first use, I felt a slight tingling sensation on my tongue and gums. But I quickly dismissed it because I thought well, this stuff is marked as clinical so may be these symptoms are natural/normal.  So, I continued to use the rinse the following day/night. I only used the rinse 3 times altogether. But let me tell you, MY WHOLE MOUTH/TONGUE IS ON FIRE. My tongue has completely become numb and it&#x27;s painful to eat/drink (even drinking water). There are sores on my inner cheeks and my lower gums burn like hell every time I run my tongue over it. Words couldn&#x27;t describe how disappointed and angry I am for this product. Seriously guys, buy this rinse at your own risk... and trust me, the risk is great with this one.</li>
            <li> I wish I could upload pictures of my tongue after three days of use. I didn&#x27;t even get a warning that my tongue was going to explode in to painful chemical burns. I just woke up one morning and couldn&#x27;t eat, sleep or move my tongue. It has been three days of this and still no relief. Of course I quit using it after I woke up to a swollen extremely painfully burned tongue. Nothing helps this. Not cold, CERTAINLY not anything salty, nothing but water and even with that it hurts extremely bad to move. My stomach acid is tearing my stomach apart because I can&#x27;t eat. There are no warnings that this could happen. My husband had a similar, less severe reaction but didn&#x27;t put it together until it happened to me. DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!! YOU WILL GET CHEMICAL BURNS!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mouth wash over the last two weeks and I have not experienced any of the problems described by anyone else. I believe that the main problem is that some of the other people who are using this do not need clinical strength mouth. Before I started using this I had persisted bad breathe and nothing would help it, mouth wash wise, not even the supposed bad breathe destroying mouth washes. If you have that problem, go for this one; if not, stick with your normal one. Honestly, why world you try this when your normal mouth wash is already doing it&#x27;s job? People need to stop trolling on products that work perfectly fine for those who actually need them and write reviews on those that pertain to them.</li>
            <li> I got this because I was having trouble with receding gums.  My teeth were always hurting. After using this I don&#x27;t have that problem, but did experience damage to my tastebuds. There was also a strange foamy, almost powdery white stuff in my mouth.  I was freaked out it might be dissolving some of my fillings! Never did figure out what it was. Between the pain and loss of taste, and the strange white stuff, I am not willing to take a chance by using it again.  Don&#x27;t buy this product. It is a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the worst mouthwash there is. I love crest pro health original, but this made my mouth numb, and completely took away my sense of taste. If I could give it 0 stars I would, but unfortunately amazon does not provide that option. Plus it tastes AWFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S: Never left a negative review in my life, but this was just awful.</li>
            <li> I bought this mouthwash from another retailer and started using it this morning. It didn&#x27;t taste great, but I liked the idea it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol so I stuck with it. When I spit it out, there were white stringy things all in my mouth... I guess this was some sort of reaction?? I have no idea. It was weird and I rinsed with water and went on with my day. A couple hours later I ate lunch, and the first sip of my soda tasted like poison. My whole meal was absolutely disgusting. I was actually worried I had been poisoned by the restaurant. Checked reviews of this product before totally freaking out and saw that it is common for things to taste weird while using this product. I will not be using this mouthwash anymore!</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible experience which I believe is connected to Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse and Crest Pro-Health Clinical Toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using another rinse and decided to try Crest Pro-Health Clinical Rinse.  The taste is horrible (you feel like you&#x27;re rinsing your mouth with Windex) and your mouth will burn afterwards but I thought if it works, it&#x27;s worth it.  Then I started to develop brown stains on the edges of my teeth.  I&#x27;m getting older so I attributed this to age.  The dentist was not overly concerned and he was able to get the stains off in my normal teeth cleaning, but a few weeks after the cleaning, back came the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried about the stains, I decided to step up my game and try Crest Pro-Health Clinical toothpaste.  THEN I started to develop serious gum irritation and tooth pain.  My gums are raw, I feel like my gums are receding, and my teeth often hurt so much I have to take pain medication.  I&#x27;m miserable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worried about my symptoms, I looked on the internet and found that Crest Pro-Health Clinical products were the culprit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Procter &amp; Gamble fully acknowledges that the rinse WILL cause the brown staining, although this warning is nowhere on the bottle.  I&#x27;m not sure why a company would think it&#x27;s OK for an oral rinse to stain teeth!  And that&#x27;s just one side affect - there are more and much more serious than staining.  I think I got off easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the internet is flooded with reports of the toothpaste causing serious gum irritation and teeth pain.  I don&#x27;t think this gum irritation is temporary, I think I&#x27;ve permanently damaged my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two new bottles of the rinse and two new tubes of the paste that are going into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awful, awful products.  Research them, and you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is an intense product and so named &amp;#34;clinical.&amp;#34; It works as stated on the label.  If it is too intense for some people, that is no reason to assume that it is a bad product and take it away from those of us who need it and are extremely satisfied.  FYI best &amp;#34;no morning breath&amp;#34; product out there.</li>
            <li> I got this from my local store and used it for 3 days. The first 1/3 of my tongue started feeling as if it was scalded by hot water. Everything tastes strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I am not alone, but at the same time, I wonder how long it would take to get my taste back. This product causes me great discomfort and possible harm to my tongue. It is ruining all my Christmas dinners and parties. I hope I can taste food and drink normally again by the New Year. Getting my fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1-30-2014:&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 or maybe 5 days, the burning sensation finally went away and I could enjoy food again. Since then, I have switched to Crest&#x27;s competitor&#x27;s product and so far, knock on wood (or my head), I have been OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on an overseas trip in January and enjoyed all the food I could. The downside of this? I gained about 5 lb. I had a sudden realization. If you could deal with the burning sensation on your tongue all day long, this product might just work for you as a weight control alternative.</li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be legal. We are all in the same tasteless, disgusting boat. Isn&#x27;t this how class action lawsuits begin?</li>
            <li> I saw that this product helps kill bacteria and fights gum disease so I decided to give it a try. WORST MISTAKE EVER, this mouth wash burns very badly and your mouth foams up for minutes afterwards (like an animal with rabies).  I used this mouth wash only twice and now the front portion of my tongue cannot taste ANYTHING. It&#x27;s been about 12 hours since I&#x27;ve used the mouth wash and I am wondering when will my taste buds return to normal. This product is TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> This is the worst mouthwash ever! After using for a few days, my gums are covered in ulcers. I was freaking out thinking I had herpes or something, only to discover that this is a common side effect!</li>
            <li> I started using this product around when I had to go to the dentist for some fillings and initially thought that maybe it was the shots that were affecting my taste.... but now. This product does something horrible, I only used it maybe three times and now I&#x27;m wondering when and if I&#x27;ll be able to eat food normally again. There are so many reports online from users experiencing the same thing it makes me sick. I rarely ever write reviews but I felt I needed to do at least something.</li>
            <li> I was researching on what could make me lose taste overnight. I then came across all of this and let me tell you how relieved I am to know I don&#x27;t have a brain tumor or Alzheimers!!  I just got this mouthwash 4 days ago and nothing has flavor! I swear I went on an eat-a-thon just to see if I could taste anything!! Thankyou for the reviews so I know what to do.....call the company and get a refund!! [[ASIN:B008I2IKF4 Crest Pro-Health Clinical Deep Clean Mint Rinse 32 Fl Oz]]</li>
            <li> It works like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen before to keep plaque from forming on your teeth. There really just isn&#x27;t any plaque build-up when you use this. As far as the burning tissue and loss of taste some people are noticing, I would suggest using it only once a day, in the morning, because you produce a lot less saliva at night to water it down. Also use for only 30 seconds or less, and gently scrape your tongue with a wet toothbrush to remove any foam after rinsing with it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now, and have noticed a LOT of dark stain. I have found the best way to controle this short of a dental cleaning is to put a little baking soda on your finger and rub the stain off. To get stain at the gumline I use a toothpick coated with baking soda. If it were not for the stain I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> After using this product once, I noticed a horrible chemical sensation on the tip of my tongue.  It wasn&#x27;t just a taste, I could feel it too.  Like licking a battery.  (Don&#x27;t do that). I also noticed what I thought were canker sores on my inside cheeks. In retrospect it could&#x27;ve been a burn.  Overall. not a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> The morning after I used this product my tongue felt like I had burned it on hot pizza or tea, but I hadn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t realize it was due to this horrible product until a few days later. I poured it down the drain and am still waiting for my tongue to heal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and used it 3-4 times before I realized that it was burning my tongue and tastebuds - I haven&#x27;t been able to properly taste food since. Since this is a common problem I went ahead and called Crest and filed a complaint on it - I used the number 1-800-285-9139. If you had the same problem definitely file a report so they know what is going on and we can get this product off the shelves!</li>
            <li> UPDATE 12/05/12: Dental appointment to check perio. pockets &amp; maintenance- still told that I have the cleanest teeth &amp; the two &#x27;6&#x27; pockets are now &#x27;5&#x27;, but where are the stains coming from, since my teeth are so clean??? They  (dentist, hygenist, perio. specialist) blamed it on my smoking but I remembered some reviews on this product that talked about brown stains especially between the teeth- so I &#x27;researched&#x27; this product again, and have determined that it is causing stains; again, all these people couldn&#x27;t be wrong. So, now I have to decide how significant a part this rinse is contributing to my lack of plaque, and weigh this against these stains- they&#x27;re not horrible but definitely visable.Until I can decide, I&#x27;ve stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t understand these horrible reviews! I have been using Crest Clinical rinse ( deep clean mint) since about March 2012 and I have not experienced any of these side effects. I am totally surprised and confused, as I see my dentist or periodontist every 4 months, and they say I have the cleanest teeth ever- I, too, had a plaque problem that has resulted in periodontal pockets, so I do have the scaling &amp; planing done every 4 months, but I also do everything my dentist advises, and while he did not specifically say to use this rinse, he did recommend Crest products. I&#x27;m wondering if some other dental/ oral problems exist with the other reviewers, but all these people couldn&#x27;t be wrong or imagining these symptoms, so I will do more extensive research, just for my own knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;But as for me personally, I love this rinse and use it twice a day as part of my dental health care. I do floss daily and use an electric toothbrush, waterpik,and this rinse, so my success might be the combination of everything I&#x27;m doing, but at my last visit, they could not find any plaque on my teeth, so they then made me eat this &#x27;tablet&#x27; that would expose the plaque, and still couldn&#x27;t find any!&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;m really wondering about this product now, so will be asking my dentist about what he&#x27;s heard. Maybe the other reviewers should consult their dental care professional about this, then give us all another review.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly don&#x27;t want to continue with a product that is harmful.</li>
            <li> As many others have noted, this product has a very significant side effect:  numbing of taste buds for several hours to several days.  Very odd.  Again, like many others have noted, it feels as if tongue has been burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This side-effect is not disclosed on the packaging and given the number of respondents complaining this does not seem to be affecting only a few.  Seems to be majority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ceased using the product.  Suggest others do as well.</li>
            <li> I have had the same experiences as everyone else regarding the sloughing off of the lining of my mouth and the loss of taste. I also developed mumps-like symptoms. It hurt horribly to eat (guess it was fortunate I couldn&#x27;t taste anyway). This has gone on for a week. I am going to flush it down the toilet. I think it will make a much better drain cleaner than a mouth rinse.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t understand it. The better my dental hygiene regimen got, the worse my mouth felt. My cheeks were burning and felt scaly and rough. I finally realized it happened right after using this mouthwash. I switched brands, and voila!, I feel fine again. If by \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; they mean \\&quot;will remove several layers of skin,\\&quot; then yes, it works as advertised. If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle yet effective mouthwash, look elsewhere!</li>
            <li> If you only rinse for the 30 seconds the bottle says to, your tongue and mouth won&#x27;t be burned.  I made this mistake once, and after I realized what the problem was, it didn&#x27;t happen again.  I only use this at night as it does seem to affect the way food tastes when used in the morning.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle, and my teeth feel so clean.  Not sure why there are so many negative reviews.  Also, the bottle says this may cause stains on your teeth, but that&#x27;s only because of inadequate brushing, they say it&#x27;s not permanent.</li>
            <li> Bought this from Wal-mart, used as directed on the back of the label.  Teeth felt very clean; inside of bottom lip and insides of cheeks broke out in what looked like awful inflamed sores a few days after regular use.  Fiancee thought I had some sort of horrible disease and refused to share drinks with me.  Stopped using product, sores healed after about 2-3 days. Scary, horrible product.  After reviewing other stories here, seems that this needs to be pulled from the market.</li>
            <li> If I could give it 0 stars I would. I used this for the first and last time tonight. I followed all instructions to the T and as soon as I started swishing the wash in my mouth excruciating pain began to radiate through my jaw and into my ears. Tons and tons of foam came out b which I continued to spit out for about 5 min. Its been an hour since I tried this stuff and I STILL have pain in the back of my jaw and lower ear area. I&#x27;ve used many mouthwash products and have never had such a horrible experience with any others,  including the ones with alcohol. I most definitely encourage anyone and everyone to avoid this product at all costs. I will be contacting the company ASAP come morning and on a side note,  I have had no problems with any other crest products.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I had a terrible experience with this product. Shortly after starting it I had a salivary gland infection and then I noticed increasing tooth sensitivity. I attribute both to this awful, and more importantly, dangerous product.</li>
            <li> I bought this last Sunday thinking it would help with plaque and looked pretty good. Today my tongue is burning like I scolded it on very hot food. I&#x27;m glad I thought to check the reviews! Luckily I didn&#x27;t take it for too long, so hopefully the pain won&#x27;t last long! But this is a horrendous product! Don&#x27;t buy it!!!</li>
            <li> I poured my bottle down the drain this morning after I woke up with painful damage to the inside of my mouth. I used it for two days and two nights, and no joke it&#x27;s like the stuff ate the flesh away on my lower front gums. I was worried I might have messed my mouth up permanently before I read these other reviews ... now I just hope it heals quickly. The product does not seem safe for the general population!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the second time last night.  I have a metallic taste in my mouth which makes all of my food taste terrible.  My tongue feels like I burned it on some hot food.  I wish I had read reviews before I purchased it.  I have used other Crest mouth washes with no problem.  I am upset that there are this many poor reviews and the product is still being sold.  I have never done a review for anything before but this product worries me.</li>
            <li> Before the rest of my review, I have to say I have not experienced any burning or mouth sores or swelling. I was surprised to see all these negative reviews about this, since it has not happened to me. Yes, it foams, but that is because it has hydrogen peroxide in it, which is there to kill bacteria. It alters the taste of food for me only very temporarily, for about an hour, but that&#x27;s not much different than when I use any other mouthwash. Otherwise, nothing has changed about my tastes for food. Okay, now for my positive experiences: I have been using this about three weeks now and am very impressed. Before using this product, I tried everything to keep my teeth clean for more than a few hours, including special toothpastes and using an expensive electric toothbrush and brushing after lunch (no time most days). Results were the same; by mid-day I started to have a lining of fuzzy plague building up on my teeth along the gumline that was hard to remove, even with my electric toothbrush.  And the dental hygenist always spends a lot of time removing plague from my teeth every 6 months. Since the fist day I used this product, I have not had even a speck of plaque, that I can feel, building up on my teeth.  I don&#x27;t even use it in the evening most days, just mornings, and I still don&#x27;t have plague buildup.  In fact, once I forgot to brush my teeth one day because I was busy with the kids, and by that night I STILL did not have the fuzzy plague buildup near the gumline! I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have to brush my teeth as long anymore, either, more like the recommended time (2 minutes) instead of 10 minutes (not good for the teeth). I wish I could let my kids use it, but it is not for kids under 12. The only thing I don&#x27;t like, but I can tolerate, is the foaming action of the hydrogen peroxide. Kinda grosses me out, but it&#x27;s a fair price to pay for healthy teeth. If you are not sensitive to this mouthwash (apparently some are), I highly recommend this product. I know I&#x27;m looking forward to my next dental visit!</li>
            <li> This product does the opposite as advertised. I tried it to see if it work work better than Listerine in controlling plaque that forms near a permanent retainer at the back of my bottom teeth, and after using this two nights the plaque was so bad it felt like i hadn&#x27;t brushed my teeth at all. In addition, plaque was worse overall on my upper teeth, including in places I&#x27;ve never had problems. My gums are sensitive now and my mouth tastes like peroxide. This went down the drain.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this after my last cleaning.  The hygienist told me I was a candidate for gum disease, which put the fear of dentures into me.  Unlike a few other reviewers, I never noticed any chemical burns.  This rinse was pleasant to use for a few days.  It wasn&#x27;t as intense as some of the Listerine brands I had used in the past, and I actually enjoyed the peroxide foaminess that persisted for a minute after spitting it out.  My teeth were feeling clean, but after about 10 days of consistent use (twice per day in the morning and bedtime) I noticed I wasn&#x27;t tasting anything.  Coffee, salt, soda, spices -- everything went dull and flat.  There was also a strange metallic chemical taste in my mouth throughout the day which seemed to be getting stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it about a week ago, and switched to Listerine Ultraclean.  I have regained most of my sense of taste, and the metallic taste is mostly gone.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this stuff unless there is a specific reason, and only then, not for more than a week or so.</li>
            <li> I very rarely feel strongly enough about a product, positively or negatively, to write a review on the internet. However, I truly feel that everyone should how how terrible and dangerous this product is. For background, I used this mouthwash a total of eight times. After the third or fourth use, I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t tasting food as well. I assumed I had burned my tongue on my morning coffee and kept using the mouthwash. After the fifth or sixth use, I developed a cluster of sores at the base of my gums in the deep pocket in the front of my mouth. I get the occasional rare canker sore so I wasn&#x27;t especially concerned. I rinsed with the mouthwash again that night, hoping that, like every other mouthwash I&#x27;ve used, it would help heal the sores. I woke up the next morning and the sores were so much worse and completely inflamed. Additionally, my taste buds had gotten worse and I could only taste on the sides of my tongue. Alarmed, I finally looked up the mouthwash and was horrified to read other reviews where people had experienced the same thing. I immediately dumped it down the drain. I am happy to report that after completely discontinuing use and switching to Listerine, my mouth is almost back to normal (two days later). In response to any rebuttals, YES, I thoroughly rinsed all of the toothpaste out of my mouth before using. My problems were certainly due to manufacturer error/negligence, not user error. Even if someone doesn&#x27;t rinse out all of their toothpaste, though, the risks should not include damaged taste buds and MULTIPLE PAINFUL ulcers. If this is truly &amp;#34;Clinical&amp;#34; and with regular, appropriate use creates these painful side effects for so many people, Crest or the FDA needs to take this product off the shelves--or, at least leave in it the hands of dental professionals who know how to administer it properly for people who need such a harsh product. Currently, it is marketed as safe for everyone and that is completely inappropriate and irresponsible.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth. It foams up because of the hydrogen peroxide, which is annoying, but not a big deal. However, after I used it, my sense of taste was severely dulled for the rest of the day, and my full sense of taste didn&#x27;t return until the day AFTER that. I thought it may have been a fluke, so I tried it the next week. Same thing, and this time it was worse. I never used it again, and in fact I poured it down the drain. In addition, this product contains cetylpyridinium chloride, which over time can actually STAIN your teeth! STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, Crest, take this crap and shove it someplace.</li>
            <li> Am reporting them to FDA . Burned my mouth after one time using !!!! Do not buy!!! How could this ever be approved????</li>
            <li> This stuff is weird. I just started using it (didn&#x27;t buy on amazon) and found that my sense of taste is WAY off after using it and my tongue feels cold all day. Whats up with that? I guess this is good if you&#x27;re trying to eat less, as it truly makes everything flavorless.</li>
            <li> I used this mouthwash for the first time and it burned and hurt like hell. I thought it might have been because I used a lot of it, but the 2nd time I used it, which was a small amount, the same thing happened and I spit it out right away. I think it is the hydrogen peroxide in this stuff. Then looking at the reviews, I decided to return it to walmart the day after I bought it. They accepted my return even though I had already used it. This stuff is awful!! I can&#x27;t believe Crest would make something like this. Back to Listerine Zero.</li>
            <li> It would be really awesome to know prior to buying this product that it causes &#x27;temporary loss of taste.&#x27; I&#x27;m quoting from the crest website after I submitted a complaint. I have a story similar to most everyone. I don&#x27;t have gum disease but wanted to be preventive because I have crowns and know how important dental hygiene is with any dental work. I&#x27;ve used it for a little over a week and only in the evening. I did notice the slime residue after spitting. I usually ended up spitting again a minute or two later. I don&#x27;t remember any buring when I began using the product but now it does burn. After using my tounge is numb and my entire mouth throbs. I noticed my loss of taste about four days ago when I tried to eat a peppermint lifesaver and I could only feel the texture and taste nothing. I really hope things begin to tast normal again soon. I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and some people say it takes a month. :(&lt;br /&gt;I did a little more research on the active ingredient.... turns out it&#x27;s in some household cleaners and insecticides. I also ready something about it is only intended for short term use...less than 7 days.</li>
            <li> So ithought it was a awesome mouth wash until i just decided to look it up online an just happen to click on the reviews because it had such low reviews an I was like mmh that&#x27;s weird, so I start reading the reviews an now it&#x27;s too late my tongue kinda burns an ihave a metallic taste in my mouth awesome..my advice throw it out or get a refund. Idk what to say other than wow..</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the regular crest pro health rinse thinking it would be better.. It is better.. Kills all the germs and your taste buds too! Thought I had something wrong with my mouth and was going to go to the doctor until I read these reviews and now I think I&#x27;ve found the problem, the mouthwash! Makes your mouth feel like you drank something too hot and burned your taste buds off! Also have pink bumps on the very back of my tongue! This stuff should be recalled!!</li>
            <li> Okay, The first two rinses with this went quite well and were almost pleasant. But on third rinse I experienced of pain unlike any other mouthwash. My tongue feels like I scolded it on hot tea and the insides of my cheeks are burned in peeling. There&#x27;s also a very weird tingly sensation in the joint of my jaw.  So while yes my mouth is technically clean, I feel it is slight overkill to not only kill germs and bacteria but also all living tissue in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I had been using [[ASIN:B003CP12O8 Crest Pro-health Clean Mint]] but later, when comparing the efficacy of Listerine v. Crest Pro-Health, I found some dental discussion boards and more than a few reviews which alleged that the blue mouthwash stained people&#x27;s teeth.  P&amp;G even admits it, thus you&#x27;ll find a warning to this effect on the rear label of every bottle of Crest Pro-Health no matter the tint of the mouthwash (yes, even the clear mouthwash contains this warning).  I immediately dumped the remainder down the sink even though I hadn&#x27;t experienced such negative results (yet).  I didn&#x27;t want to risk getting blue teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a chance on this product because I bought into the advertisement stating that it is the most effective way to keep a clean mouth months after a dental cleaning.  The mouthwash is clear - so, no problem, right?  The taste isn&#x27;t all that pleasant, but I attribute that more to the hydrogen peroxide than anything.  I figured that if the product worked well in keeping my teeth clean then I could eventually get accustomed to the taste.  Unlike other reviewers, I never experienced any swollen glands, but I can&#x27;t speak to whether or not I experienced loss of taste because I only used this product in the evening right before bed.  What I can say, though, is that after using the product every evening for the past month or so, I have noticed dark stains between the gaps of my teeth.  It looks as if my teeth are rotting!  This seems odd for someone like myself who flosses every day, brushes twice a day and uses two types of mouthwash.  The only rationale points back to the warning label (again) on every bottle of Crest Pro-Health.  Do a simple Google search and see for yourself the number of complaints related to the Pro-Health mouthwashes and tooth staining.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product is allowed to remain on the market.  I purchased it last week, and soon after, I knew something was off.  My mouth started burning for no reason.  Food began tasting weird.  Drinks all tasted carbonated.  I ordered white wine at a nice restaurant and believed it was champagne.  I had no idea what was wrong.  Then I remembered this mouthwash and knew it was the culprit.  Now I can only hope that the damage isn&#x27;t permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be very cautious with this product.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just start off I&#x27;ve only recently became an avid mouthwash user since I have a problem with bad breath. I have used Crest Mouthwash (the non-alcohol one that&#x27;s purple), Listerine, SmartMouth, and Crest Clinical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all if you have used SmartMouth, this product is quite similar to it in terms of taste and what it does to your taste buds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And people complaining about it burning, it clearly state it contains Hydrogen Peroxide and since people reacts to it accordingly, stay clear of it. I don&#x27;t feel the burning sensation luckily so this product works pretty darn well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the taste bud, the SmartMouth uses some kind of Zinc formula and that adversely affects what you&#x27;ll be tasting for quite awhile. I normally just rinse my mouth after eating a meal so throughout the day, I wouldn&#x27;t have to endure what you all are having to go through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros of this product is that it does what it claims and the next morning, I have pretty decent breath and not the decay smell of dry arid mouth. So if you have a pretty good tolerance to Hydrogen Peroxide or any alcohol in your mouth, this is THE product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at the local drug store and love it thoroughly. My teeth is still white (used their whitening strips like 3-4 years ago). Been using this mouthwash for almost 3 weeks now. Haven&#x27;t seen signs of my teeth turning brown as others had mentioned. And if you went to your Dentist after using this and haven&#x27;t been to one within 6 months, and they claimed your teeth needs cleaning, your teeth was dirty to begin with or they&#x27;re simply charging you money for a simple cleaning. Don&#x27;t blame Crest for that either. I thought that was ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product if you&#x27;re able to handle the pain (if you feel any to begin with) and if you can&#x27;t, go use the non-alcohol one. Simple as that.</li>
            <li> leaves a gross foam in your mouth and i lost my sense of taste, i can&#x27;t detect salt!! horrible product!!</li>
            <li> Iv been using this product for almost two weeks.  It seems to have slowed or stopped my gingivitis as my gums no longer bleed... However,  after this period i was forced to stop when my left lower jaw bone gland began to swell and my cheeks started to burn while eating..</li>
            <li> I bought this product after I noticed some redness and swelling around my gumline. I&#x27;m happy to say that after a few days using the rise, all the redness was gone! I don&#x27;t know why some people have reported horrible-side effects (an allergy or sensitivity maybe?), but I&#x27;ve experienced nothing out of the ordinary: no burning, no sores, no spots, and no loss of taste. I&#x27;m giving this a four out of five instead of a five because of a couple of minor issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The taste is kind of weird and it does stick in your mouth for about half an hour afterwards&lt;br /&gt;2) The rise leaves this weird slimy, foamy stuff in your mouth that takes a LOT of spitting to get rid of. It&#x27;s gross but tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product but maybe not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I went to the doctor because my mouth was burning and lost all taste..  I went thru multiple blood work tests, had an MRI on my brain, went to an ENT specialist.. everything coming back normal and no one could figure it out... I stopped using this product and a few days later was getting some relief from the pain... After research and seeing all the thousands of people affected the same way by this product.. I can&#x27;t understand why they are still selling it..</li>
            <li> If you want to burn your taste buds to the point that everything is tasteless this is a great product. Tastes similar to  Hydrogen Peroxide. It has been almost 1 day and still no taste.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this product, noticed certain foods started to taste off.  Got to the point where a simple glass of water started to taste foul.  Had to stop using.</li>
            <li> Ok so I just started using this mouth wash due to my gingivitis issues. Thinking that this would help? No, not really... It kind of made things worse. I was terrified I had mouth cancer.... Until I read the reviews as I lost all taste in my mouth... Not sure when I will get it back. Crest needs to take this OFF the shelves and market and stop fooling everyone...</li>
            <li> Bought some of this stuff, thinking it was going to be amazing, boy was I wrong. Do not EVER buy this mouth wash, my first time using it I noticed numbness of my tongue and it still hasn&#x27;t gone away after three days!</li>
            <li> I picked this up at the local walmart 5 days ago. At first I thought it was just the mint flavor of it throwing the taste of foods off like most mouthwashes will do, but apparently I was wrong.  I stopped using it after 3 days and still can&#x27;t taste the difference between potato chips with french onion dip, a cheeseburger with all the toppings, or the cheesecake I tried last night,  everything tastes like plain boiled noodles, almost like cardboard but not quite that bland.  That will be the last penny that crest ever gets from me for anything.</li>
            <li> So I decided to use this because I have a new resolution for myself to thoroughly clean my teeth at least 1 time a day. I use it at night before I go to bed I did notice many of the symptoms the first couple of times of using it: lowered sense of taste and very strong flavor. However, once you work part way through the bottle it isn&#x27;t such an intimidatingly strong flavor and it stops affecting your taste buds. After a month of use my teeth and gums are looking much healthier. As long as you are only using this product once a day at night time it should not affect how things taste the next day. A brand new bottle is always going to have a strong flavor at first. As long as you know that you can work through it and in the long run it&#x27;ll benefit the health of you&#x27;re mouth greatly. It&#x27;s not much different than making your own mouth wash from hydrogen peroxide and water. The glycerin is what makes the white stuff on your teeth after you rinse with it. It&#x27;s just there to help keep it on your teeth for longer it&#x27;s an ingredient you will find if you want to make your own mouth wash or toothpaste. So as bad as it may seem at first, stick it out and you will be pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to keep my mouth clean after my permanent crown fell out. I used it over the weekend without problem, but now I also lost my sense of taste. I even threw away my dinner thinking it was bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I am not nuts. The downside is, I regret not reading the other reviews before buying this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two distinct issues in the use of this product. I first experienced a decline in my ability to taste things, which was accompanied by a burning sensation (as if I&#x27;d eaten a piece of hot pizza); I used it three or four times until one of my salivary glands on the left (in front of my ear at the top of my jaw joint) became extremely swollen and tender. I was also unable to chew without significant discomfort, in the form of a burning sensation. Upon doing some research, it sounds like I&#x27;m not the only person who has experienced these reactions. Now that I&#x27;ve stopped using the product, I&#x27;m just hoping the swelling goes down in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I am a young healthy person. I don&#x27;t have adverse reactions to products. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with a dental product. I decided to try using this for a change and because it contains no ETOH. Immediate discomfort, numbness, loss of sensation and taste. The active ingredient is CPC. Look up toxicology the stuff is very bad for you and has caused birth defects in test animal populations. I am scared after reading many reviews including reports of trips to the emergency room. I called the number on the bottle. They said they&#x27;d had reports of complaints but were awfully cavalier and said to rinse with salt water. Too bad that&#x27;s not going to help the pain deep in my jaw. These people should be sued. Please don&#x27;t buy this. CPC also wipes out the normal microbiota in your mouth not just plaque forming bacteria. That can put you at risk for secondary infections and serious I problems !!!!</li>
            <li> (0 ZERO stars!) I first used this after some dental work, and developed the WORST tooth ache and sore throat EVER. I also had deep pain along my jawline that made me think something was terribly wrong! But, I didn&#x27;t know it was the rinse. A few months later (two days ago) I used it again. OMG!...I have had the worst sore throat for 2 days now, and this morning I woke up so hoarse I couldn&#x27;t even talk! This stuff is DANGEROUS and should be BANNED by the FDA! As soon as I find out where to report it, I just reported this harmful crap to the FDA! [...]</li>
            <li> This mouth wash has a terrible taste, and is much worse than the cheaper alcohol based mouth washes. Even worse, after using the product for 3 days I have lost most of my ability to taste and my tongue feels like it has been chemically burned. The pain on my tongue actually woke me up in the middle of the night, it felt like I went to sleep with acid in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a lingering foam that stays in your mouth after you use it. I try spiting it out but it continues to foam. This is a terrible product and I have no idea how it managed to get FDA approval. If you read online there are many sites and news stories about how this product is hurting people, Crest needs to stop selling these.</li>
            <li> I bought this mouthwash 4 days ago, and have been perfectly following the directions - 20ml rinsed for 30 seconds twice a day.  Like others I thought the burning sensation on my tongue was from burning my tongue on something.  Well today my whole tongue is tingling and I can&#x27;t taste anything.  I sure hope there is no permanent damage to my taste, because this is pretty awful.  Moral of the story is this waste of $5 mouthwash is going straight down my drain.  Thanks for nothing Crest!</li>
            <li> This BURNS the inside of my cheeks so badly I have to actually cup my face with my hands to alleviate the pain. It does make you spit nasty slimy stuff, like snot. Feels like you can never spit it all out. I&#x27;ve used it several times over the course of a year because my boyfriend uses it often and I thought I was just hyper sensitive but I&#x27;m glad to see I&#x27;m definitely not the only one. The pain is indescribable.</li>
            <li> WARNING: I used this product for 4 days, 2 times a day. Today my tongue is completely numb and I cannot taste ANYTHING. I can&#x27;t detect hot or cold either. I can&#x27;t feel burning hot coffee or ice cubes, and I can&#x27;t taste the soup I&#x27;m eating (which I almost burnt myself with, but didn&#x27;t know until I swallowed how hot it was).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My roommates are having the EXACT same reaction. After doing research I discovered we weren&#x27;t alone. How has this product not be recalled yet?</li>
            <li> Quite literally, this mouthwash burned my tastes buds right off. Swishing it around your mouth can cause an intense burning followed by a swollen/numb tongue. After using it for the second time I noticed my tongue felt as if it was burned by a hot liquid or food item; my lips ached and felt \\&quot;chapped.\\&quot; I can barely taste anything that I eat or drink; most notably I can not taste anything with the first half of my tongue. I can only hope and pray that I can regain my ability to taste. It blows my mind that P&amp;G feel comfortable selling this product without a disclaimer on the bottle about the possibility of losing your sense of taste. I will no longer support P&amp;G and will do my best to inform others to stay away from their products. I have since called P&amp;G to file a complaint (good news is that they will refund my $3.49!); I suggest everyone who has had the same experience should call and complain as well. Hopefully the more complaints they receive, the more they will realize that their products are harmful to their customers (even if it is a small percent). I would love for this product/product line to be removed from the shelves. However, I am doubtful because I am convinced they only care about their profit and not the lives of those who they target. Gotta love big business.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and stopped using it in about a week. The product has a nice minty flavor and does make your mouth feel clean, however, it was not worth the problems it caused me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After I used the mouthwash, my tongue felt like I had burnt it on hot food. I couldn&#x27;t taste food for several hours. At first I figured this was normal, that mint makes food taste &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; afterwards, but after a couple days I realized that I actually could not taste anything. My tongue felt numb, and it took a long time to go back to normal. I decided to google if other customers were experiencing this reaction. I was shocked to see that so many people had the same issue! After reading that some people experienced dark stains, I stopped using the product instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple days after I stopped using the product, I started having tooth sensitivity to hot and cold foods when I would eat on one side of my mouth! I was in severe pain whenever I would eat. I never had this problem before, and I have never had any cavities. I&#x27;m not sure if the sensitivity is related or if it is just a coincidence, but I&#x27;ve never had any tooth pain before I started using this product. I think the mouthwash was too strong for my gums and exposed the dentin on my teeth leading to the sensitivity. I would never buy this product again, it was too harsh for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever reviewed a product...this is terrible.  It&#x27;s been three days and I can&#x27;t taste anything and my tongue is burning.  Do NOT buy this horrible product.</li>
