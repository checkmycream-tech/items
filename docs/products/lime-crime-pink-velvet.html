            <li> Long lasting ..  </li>
            <li> It lasted me all day long even when i ate lunch and sooooooo pigmented.  </li>
            <li> However I will mark it down one star because it goes on very liquid-y at first which makes it difficult to apply</li>
            <li> This lipstick feels so dry on my lips.</li>
            <li> And honestly I had looked in to it quite a bit, so I was really, really disappointed.</li>
            <li> There is not another pink like it!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to try the other colors.</li>
            <li> and I would say my makeup skills are above average; but I have a hard time putting this on.</li>
            <li> I feel really guilty for having bought it because it&#x27;s just.. so mediocre.</li>

            <li> Beautiful shade of pink, I receive lots of compliments every time I wear it. Only reason I don&#x27;t gave it 5 stars is because it smears. I thought this lipstick was not supposed to move like the Chanel Ultra Wear lip color...</li>
