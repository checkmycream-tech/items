            <li> i think it is an ordinary mask, not too moisturize.</li>
            <li> Secret is not to immediately wash your face after taking the mask off, instead massage your face with the residual liquid from the packet and the used mask.</li>

            <li> Very refreshing on the face as well as making your skin feeling very revitalized. Have not used them enough yet to tell a difference in as far as changing facial adjustments</li>
            <li> Loveeee these masks!  They feel so refreshing as I wear them and wish I could use them everyday!  My face looks and feels amazing the next day after using them before bed.  The only issue is that they are too long for my round face, but other than that -- perfect!</li>
            <li> The mask is very moist and easy to apply to your face. It leaves the skin moistured. I had a very dry skin and after only 2 uses my facial skin is smoother and more moist. When I used it before sleep at night, I looked so refreshed after I wake up even though I only got 4 hours of sleep.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, lo recomiendo 100% al igual que el vendedor, me llego sin problemas y en las condiciones que el vendedor lo indicó. Gracias</li>
            <li> It is good mask for keep your face moisturize, but northing effect happened about brightening to my face.  ITs okay like normal mask..</li>

            <li> These masks are nice, but they don&#x27;t whiten. I put them in the fridge and use them on my face after my at home microdermabrasion and a hot shower, it moisturizes my face very well and closes my pores at the same time. I like them but in the future I will try something with collagen or just a plain moisturizing one. It&#x27;s worth buying once and trying. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry/normal/oily skin. I would hesitate recommending  this to someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i think it is an ordinary mask, not too moisturize. and the texture of mask is a little bit thick, as for whitening, i haven&#x27;t seen the effect. ,i only feel the essence of the mask couldn&#x27;t be absorbed by my skin perfectly. maybe i won&#x27;t think of repurchasing it again</li>
            <li> This product is good for relieving a headache or something but it doesn&#x27;t really do much to the face. I actually stopped using it because I noticed I get little break outs the next day after using it.</li>
            <li> This mask is very dry, checked expiration date is 2016 but it&#x27;s not mositured as it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to return or exchange but it doesn&#x27;t allow to do so.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like this mask at all. it is very dry and put for 1-2minutes,it didn&#x27;t work for the skin at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered these face masks from Amazon.com after the other cosmetics wholesaler was out of business. The mask size is just right for my small face and it makes my face smooth after using (but don&#x27;t leave it on overnight). Since I&#x27;ve being using the mask for about three months now (twice a week), it is not necessary bleach my face though. However, I still highly recommend it and will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mask which is great to use when it&#x27;s hot because it&#x27;s cooling. I gave it a 3 star rating because I didn&#x27;t notice any evening of my skintone. But it did give my face a nice glow. I would buy it again though.</li>

            <li> First mask I ever used and I love it! Put it in the refrigerator prior to using to make it nice and cool. So soothing. I&amp;#34;m African American and it brought life to my dull looking skin. I would say doesn&#x27;t necessarily brighten my skin but it made it look much smoother. Love it so far</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but not so good to me, my skin is very dry, so I will try another one, but is still a good stuff to the whom skin is not so dry, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I purchase this product and I love it. It is a way of obtaining spa therapy level care at home. Frugal me, I am always looking for ways to stay polished and healthy but without spending a lot.
