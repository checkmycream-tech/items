            <li> While this was not a complete deal breaker, the pedal itself was not usable.  </li>
            <li> It was cool but the little red eyes was broken off, when I received it in the mail.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> minimal pressure needed.</li>

            <li> It was putting a little power out for a sec, than just stop working.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> anyway I received a black skull pedal</li>
            <li> and they sent me a used black pedal .</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have bought not because one failed but</li>
            <li> they sent  the wrong color  and take awhile to write  back</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this pedal for anything other than practicing on fake skin.  </li>
            <li> Minimum effort to press its has a consistant flow and tough as nails.</li>
            <li> I was just disappointed when I saw all the scratches all over it.</li>

            <li> This product came with a few scratches on it, but other than that it works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Ok so yeah the quality is very good stainless steel plating apparently they did not have this product I stock and choose to ship it anyway I received a black skull pedal but it had scratch on the bottom plate idk if it was shipping or not but maybe next time bubble wrap should be used.. They said they would help or vide me a partial refund but haven&#x27;t heard back from then since communication skills I give neutral rating holiday week I know gets hectic but I do hope to here from them soon and I also hope this helps other shoppers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift my for brother-in-law. I am hoping that it works. I was impressed with how quickly I received it. *Here comes the BUT....* BUT when I took it out of the package I noticed scratches all over the skull. The color was the same as the pic. I was just disappointed when I saw all the scratches all over it. It does say NEW.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product .I ordered a new red skull pedal and they sent me a used black pedal . The leads to the pedal are very loose and come off easily.</li>
            <li> This foot pedal is a piece of junk. It has a short in it. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I give this item top rating! This is the second one I have bought not because one failed but because I husband gave the first one away to his nephew! Even though. He loved it!  Its so easy to use won&#x27;t use any other pedel thank u</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t do it  to your self ! I  got it  for my fiance  birthday n  they sent  the wrong color  and take awhile to write  back</li>
            <li> this product is exactly what i was looking for i would recommend it to any body what an awesome product</li>
            <li> i got this for a gift for my husband, he loves the design and the quality. def a great purchase</li>
            <li> My son has a shop and i thought it was cute so i bought it.  Works fine, but the plastic eyes had to be re-glued.</li>
            <li> i ordered this pedal as a spare for my fiancee and so far he has yet to use it so ill reply to what i think later.</li>
            <li> The peddle works great and looks great but it came with a light that doesn&#x27;t work. Shipped fast an for was inexpensive so all in all a good deal.</li>
            <li> got this as a surprise for my brother...it&#x27;s supposed to light up..but does&#x27;nt...works ok he says..but won&#x27;t last long,novelty item</li>
            <li> Since the first day it arrive at my house I plug it into my power supplier, it have not work since day one. It was putting a little power out for a sec, than just stop working.&lt;br /&gt; one of the cords was unplug off the pedal</li>
            <li> So far good it came with a missing eyes but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet post wen I do but looks great and received it pretty fast</li>
            <li> This is perfect! A switch that is pressure activated and has the capability of replacing the wires!!! I love it! I have thrown away numerous pedals because the wire would develope a short and it was not an easy fix. THIS IS FINALLY WHAT I NEED!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this product.  The red &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; fell out of the eyes and nose as soon as I picked the pedal up out of the box.  While this was not a complete deal breaker, the pedal itself was not usable.  I used it one time for five minutes and the pedal itself stuck consistently while the connection seemed to go in and out.  I would not say this product is at all safe to use while tattooing.  I would not recommend using this pedal for anything other than practicing on fake skin.  Upgrade before tattooing real skin.</li>
            <li> Happy with the foot switch and the quality of the product. Good service. Will use them again</li>
            <li> Works great.  One of the eye jewels/pieces has already come off but otherwise no complaints</li>
            <li> Very sensetive. Right now I am not having any kind of problems with wires or connections.&lt;br /&gt;Works 100% better than any conventional pedal. I love it and it is a better pedal than the one I had received with my tat kit.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for any beginner or professional.&lt;br /&gt;as for the ordering , it was received in a very short time and it was in perfect shape and it was the one I had ordered</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had was the clamp broke but since I fixed it it has been a work horse</li>
            <li> I got 2 one for me and a friend both were well made look really cool and work excellent Worth every penny if I needed more I&#x27;d buy these every time</li>
            <li> Yea it works, but the red plastic lens of the eyes and stuff come off and some of it wasnt even in the box. LOL. He was literally a one eyed bandit.</li>
            <li> Its nice for the what you pay. one of the eye lences came off soon as we unwrapped took it out the box.</li>
            <li> Until when u open the package and everything start to fall off the foot pedal u might well just get a regular silver one the design is all gone</li>
            <li> fast shipping great job would buy again a !!!!</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this footswitch, unlike my past pedals where you step on them to turn them on or off this pedal works off of pressure, it won&#x27;t run if u raise your foot off of it. That&#x27;s important to me because I like to keep my foot on it during my work. When I use other pedals its irratiating to have to step on it off and on off and on, I highly recommend this footswitch to anybody and everybody!!</li>
            <li> We were VERY pleased with this purchase!! This pedal is VERY nice, solid, and bigger than we thought it would be!! Very pleased  with this and would recommend to others!!</li>
            <li> Cheap works seller sux</li>

            <li> Haveing my cake and eating it too. Not only the most awsome looking pedal I ever saw. But very functional. Minimum effort to press its has a consistant flow and tough as nails. Great quick shipping</li>
            <li> This is a good pedal for the money, sure there are much better ones out there, but this is a good one.</li>
            <li> Cheap... Stopped working after not to many uses.</li>
            <li> It looks nice but so flat dat sometimes foot slides off. Works better with no shoes</li>
