            <li>She loved</li>

            <li>It does not hold much, which is perfect since my kids use it all of the time, plus, it is super cute!  </li>
            <li>Reminds me of the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s when many ladies had a mirrored tray on their dressing table with matching brush and comb and the tasseled perfume bottle</li>

            <li>Overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I could not say more about this perfume bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This glass bottle for perfume is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love the style of this bottle.  </li>
            <li>Put your favorite scent in it or make a signature scent and have a unique aroma self created.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t come on too strong and doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you&#x27;ve bathed in it after 2 squirts.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The lid doesn&#x27;t fit the bottle correctly so it leaks.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the mist-</li>
            <li>My grandkids filled this with perfume for their Mom for her birthday.  </li>

            <li>It the top broke the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted one of these &amp; it was worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cool.</li>
            <li>The color is true to itself.</li>
            <li>My wife liked it, not wow, but OK.</li>
            <li>The fact that there is a storage cap (for when you&#x27;re not using) is perfect for Moms with small kids!</li>

            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>service from the seller was first class too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This bottle is pretty and it works.</li>
            <li>A little higher than I would have like to pay, but it works quite well and looks really nice.  </li>
            <li>Now the whole fabric covered tube is soaked with perfume.</li>
            <li>This was a gift and very well received.</li>

            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so beautiful and well made and looks far more expensive that it actually cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent if you are not looking for something with time period Victorian authenticity.</li>
            <li>Allows me to capture fragrances of perfumes in older bottles whose tubing clogged.</li>

            <li>I really love using this to get ready everyday!</li>
            <li>It has worked perfectly, but as one revieer stated alreadh, the little straw inside the sprayer is way to long so a little snip is needed.  </li>
            <li>I bought this perfume bottle for my granddaughter who wanted something &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; on her new vanity table.</li>
            <li>I buy body spray from a Bath and Body Works and thier new bottles</li>
            <li>All the others I looked at were too small but this was exactly the right size and pretty to look at too.</li>
            <li>yrs old  </li>
            <li>The bottle is really a lot smaller than I thought it was-</li>
            <li>Received on time and was exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li>Very pretty but small.</li>

            <li> the only problem though is that is reeeeaallyyy small</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> So sad to spend money on something poorly made.</li>
            <li> Perfume is always seeping out and it&#x27;s very frustrating.</li>

            <li> Really pleased with the overall quality</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my roommate. She loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time and came with everything she needed minus a fancy smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. It immediately started leaking at the connection site when it was sprayed. Now the whole fabric covered tube is soaked with perfume. Piece of crap!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty and functional. The funnel was not included in mine but the opening was sufficient to fill up with cologne. I would suggest using some paper towels underneath to catch any incidental spillage. Really pretty and elegant.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, I bought it as a prop for a film but it doesn&#x27;t work as good as it looks.</li>

            <li> although  i would have like more of a choice  there was only one to choose from&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my granddaughter was so pleased  she love it  she  11  yrs old  so she really&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t know beautiful  they were in the past&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but i was really happyn to find that one  thanks</li>
            <li> Fun perfume holder!  It looks like the photo and works fine so far.</li>

            <li> This is a nice bottle &amp; works well. Had a perfume bottle sprayer break. Bought this Geti bottle. It comes with a small funnel &amp; it&#x27;s perfect for my dressing table. Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Beautiful atomizer but not built well. Perfume is always seeping out and it&#x27;s very frustrating. Would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> Looks like something my grandma would have in her bathroom.  S, if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing, here you go.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bottle for my sister as a gift.  I thought since purple is her favorite color that it would be awesome.  It is a beautiful design for the bottle my sister loves it.</li>

            <li> My wife liked it, not wow, but OK. for what she is going to use it for. It did get me a big kiss</li>
            <li> The perfect Absinth spritzer!</li>
            <li> The lid doesn&#x27;t fit the bottle correctly so it leaks.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume bottle for my granddaughter who wanted something &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; on her new vanity table. She loves it and I was very pleased with the bottle and the way it was delivered.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t spray!!! Tried the recommendation of getting the air bubbles out but it still doesn&#x27;t work. Bummer. Otherwise cute bottle....</li>
            <li> Decent if you are not looking for something with time period Victorian authenticity.</li>
            <li> a friend of mine wears scented oils and want something pretty, this was the perfect idea. She&#x27;s had it about a year and she loves it</li>
            <li> Very pretty, works well.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my niece.  She liked it very much, thought it was really attractive. I thought the quality was also excellent.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful, petite perfume sprayer.  In use it to put my essential cryst water in to spray in my home.  It has worked perfectly, but as one revieer stated alreadh, the little straw inside the sprayer is way to long so a little snip is needed.  Overall very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I could not say more about this perfume bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so beautiful and well made and looks far more expensive that it actually cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service from the seller was first class too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a gift for a very good friend and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> Pretty and just the right amount of perfume.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the sprayer on my Bath &amp; Body Works perfume stopped working. Unfortunately, the perfume from them is now hermetically sealed, so I had to stab the perfume bottle a few times to be able to pour it in. The bottle is really a lot smaller than I thought it was- It about fits in your hand- so I had to seal up the stab wounds to save it for later. I enjoy the mist- it doesn&#x27;t come on too strong and doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you&#x27;ve bathed in it after 2 squirts. I love how it looks, as well, and plan on getting a lot of nice products to go around it.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful perfume bottle, and it is now sitting on my vanity, holding my favorite perfume. I am so very pleased that I bought it.... thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I really love using this to get ready everyday! The fact that there is a storage cap (for when you&#x27;re not using) is perfect for Moms with small kids! I found that you have to cut the straw inside to thread the atomizer onto the glass bottle (otherwise its spring loaded) but no big deal. I&#x27;ve always wanted one of these &amp; it was worth it!</li>
            <li> Ordered as gift for my teenage daughter - and it&#x27;s absolutely adorable!!  Great quality, item looks just like the picture.  Shipped in pieces, so we had to put together - not a big deal, though was expecting to be in one piece.  Daughter has put body spray in it and uses daily.  Shipped fast and within time frame promised.</li>
            <li> This is much prettier than the photo.  I received it quickly; it was packaged well; and, it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles--One cap stays on bottle --the other bottle cap keeps popping off--so I can not use it</li>
            <li> So lady like. Delicate and useful. Put your favorite scent in it or make a signature scent and have a unique aroma self created. Every Lady should have one.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my teen daughter.  It is a beautiful bottle - picture does not do it justice.  The purple color is just as it appears.</li>
            <li> My grandkids filled this with perfume for their Mom for her birthday.  Very cute gift for the kids to give Mom!</li>
            <li> Not as practical as I would like. It does not spray enough. However, it matches my bedroom decor, purple and victorian.  I buy body spray from a Bath and Body Works and thier new bottles are garbage. have way through the bottle they stop spraying.</li>
            <li> These are adorable on top of my daughters vanity. She loves spraying it!</li>
            <li> This bottle is pretty and it works. That&#x27;s all I could ask for and all I expected. I have been using it for about a month and haven&#x27;t had any problems.</li>
            <li> Very cute. Functional. Worth the money.  My daughter likes it. We put body spray in it instead of actual perfume.</li>
            <li> A little higher than I would have like to pay, but it works quite well and looks really nice.  Adds that girly touch to the vanity.</li>
            <li> Picture says it all and functions perfectly. Allows me to capture fragrances of perfumes in older bottles whose tubing clogged.</li>
            <li> Beautiful.  My granddaughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works, I got it for my daughter.</li>
            <li> its really cute! I bought it for my sisters birthday and she loved it. the only problem though is that is reeeeaallyyy small</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised and on-time.  Worked great for our homemade perfume making project.  We would definitely buy these perfume bottles again.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Beautiful bottle</li>
            <li> Broke a bottle of perfume that I had just received and although I managed to save most of it I didn&#x27;t have a suitable container. All the others I looked at were too small but this was exactly the right size and pretty to look at too. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now and am really pleased. It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This has worked perfectly for the 6 months (several times a day) we have used it.  It does not hold much, which is perfect since my kids use it all of the time, plus, it is super cute!  We always feel so fancy.  Great price too (when we bought it).</li>
            <li> great little bottle, thanks--she loves it</li>
            <li> I looked for an atomizer for about 3 months every where with no luck until i happened on it them with amazon. Sooo happy!</li>
            <li> This glass bottle for perfume is lovely.  I had a defective bottle of perfume that opened and poured into this bottle.  The atomizer works and a nice mist comes out.  I love the style of this bottle.  It is sturdy and attractive.  I will keep reusing this bottle for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> like the bottle&lt;br /&gt;like the shape&lt;br /&gt;like how it work&lt;br /&gt;love the spray&lt;br /&gt;love the color&lt;br /&gt;very very happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ike very happy with purchase thanks</li>
            <li> i should take the one star off,the pump works for one day ,i will never order this ,</li>
