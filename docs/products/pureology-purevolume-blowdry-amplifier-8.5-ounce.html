            <li>This is the best volumizing product I have ever found.</li>

            <li>It also smells really good.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is really great and makes it easy to just blow &amp; go</li>
            <li>I use it with another product for curly hair, and it&#x27;s a great combination for my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair from frizzing and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Not sticky, it&#x27;s a very light.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say that I got that much more volume.  </li>
            <li>The more I used the funkier the after feel of the residue.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love the Pureology purevolume blowdry amplifier.</li>
            <li>I love pureology..</li>
            <li>I have been using Pureology purevolume for many years and will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li>I love the volume it provides for me.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love all the pureology products...especially this one.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky, does not smell as good, and makes my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, because my stylist uses it on herself and all the reviews were quite good.  </li>
            <li>My hair now looks great the same day I wash it!!</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff I have ever used when I round brush my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for several years now and it works great with my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light hold gel that adds volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>I do recommend going lighter on the amount of product used because I found that if I use too much it makes my hair kind of crunchy.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it gives just the right about of volume I need.</li>
            <li>It makes me hair feel full and my curls stay.</li>
            <li>I have very straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes that this amplifier plus the shampoo/conditioner will work even better.  </li>
            <li>May be best for people with thin hair to add body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve contacted the seller and they sent me an E-mail with a return address to ship it back at my own expense...</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and this product gives it volume, strength and apparent thickness.  </li>
            <li>My very fine hair likes Pureology products in general.  </li>
            <li>I have very soft baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>It gives body to my fine, soft, humidity-susceptible hair.</li>
            <li>Applied dime size amount, at first.  </li>
            <li>This actually did give me some more body and volume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, adds lots of volume; just takes very little to work.</li>
            <li>It provides nice soft volume for my long highlighted/glazed hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, short, layered hair</li>
            <li>Overall I like the smell and feel like it really protects my fine hair</li>
            <li>really?????  </li>
            <li>My hair has no body and this product really helps with body, holding curls, etc.</li>
            <li>When I use too much I feel like I have residue build-up.</li>
            <li>When I stand up straight, I usually like what I see (the volume is amazing)</li>
            <li>I have fine long hair and did not like how this product performed.</li>
            <li>Pureology products are pricey, but they really work, and are worth every penny to those of us with fine, thinning hair, they are ultra concentrated, so a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down like most products do</li>
            <li>It makes my fine thin hair loo s much better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying money for quality products, but this new formula has cheapened this product and I will be looking into other companies for better products.</li>
            <li>highly recommend--I also use the shampoo and conditioner&lt;</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair &amp; this product gives great volume with a little control.</li>
            <li>and I give my hair one more little spritz of hairspray just to hold it all in place.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and even though I use a small amount, my hair feels flatter and sticky.</li>
            <li>This actually does add a little more volume to my hair!</li>
            <li>The bottle indicates that this is a new formula.</li>
            <li>Then, when I&#x27;m ready to start styling my hair, I apply pure volume blow dry amplifier and spray the pieces of hair</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle considering I use about a dime to nickle size, so it will last you quite a while.  </li>
            <li>It works really well and does not weigh my hair down, but has a funny texture when I use it.  </li>
            <li>This is good, but it takes very little or my hair is way too heavy and gummy.  </li>
            <li>Just recently I feel like my hair is becoming extremely dried out because of this product.</li>
            <li>My hair has thinned out in the past few years and I needed more volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to blow dry with pure volume thickening spray and dry using a round brush.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend for fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair.</li>

            <li> I have fine, thin hair that is just past my shoulders</li>
            <li> Bought this item thru Amazon thinking I can save a few bucks vs. buying it at my local hair salon here in Honolulu.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not quite giving me the volume that I expected.  </li>
            <li> I also take a small amount of Kenra platinum texturizing taffy and use it to sculpt and separate, then I bend over and spray my hair with the Brocato hairspray and allow it to dry for several seconds.</li>
            <li> With this product a LITTLE goes a long way</li>
            <li> As with all their products, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, which I appreciate.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products but none of them worked as well for me as Pureology.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either not a genuine product or it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf too long or something</li>
            <li> After everything is dry, I pick up pieces of hair and spray the roots with Brocato firm holding hairspray and use it as a rootboost, then I curl my hair and style it.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and thought this product might have extended my straightening, but I felt it weighted my hair down.</li>
            <li> and it still weighed down my hair.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair feel weighed down even when I only used a very small amount</li>
            <li> This new product is horrible and nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> I got a little volume at the roots</li>
            <li> I was given a few samples of this Amplifier and the matching Shampoo and Conditioner for Volume.</li>
            <li> gummy sticky and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> it is expensive</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have curly hair and thought this product might have extended my straightening, but I felt it weighted my hair down. May be best for people with thin hair to add body.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that I got that much more volume.  I have fine, thin hair that is just past my shoulders and it still weighed down my hair.  I got a little volume at the roots but it didn&#x27;t last.  Left a funky, residue-ish feel to my hair.  Applied dime size amount, at first.  Graduated to quarter sized amount in graduations.  The more I used the funkier the after feel of the residue.  Would not recommend for fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel weighed down even when I only used a very small amount</li>
            <li> I was given a few samples of this Amplifier and the matching Shampoo and Conditioner for Volume. I LOVE it. My hair has thinned out in the past few years and I needed more volume. I have tried other products but none of them worked as well for me as Pureology. My hair now looks great the same day I wash it!! With this product a LITTLE goes a long way so even tho it is expensive it will last you a long time if you don&#x27;t over use it.</li>
            <li> I have fine, short, layered hair I&#x27;m always searching for hair products that will help provide volume and fullness. Pureology products are pricey, but they really work, and are worth every penny to those of us with fine, thinning hair, they are ultra concentrated, so a tiny bit goes a long way. I like to combine products for maximum effect, so I start by shampooing with their volumizing shampoo and conditioner. Then, when I&#x27;m ready to start styling my hair, I apply pure volume blow dry amplifier and spray the pieces of hair I&#x27;m ready to blow dry with pure volume thickening spray and dry using a round brush. After everything is dry, I pick up pieces of hair and spray the roots with Brocato firm holding hairspray and use it as a rootboost, then I curl my hair and style it. I also take a small amount of Kenra platinum texturizing taffy and use it to sculpt and separate, then I bend over and spray my hair with the Brocato hairspray and allow it to dry for several seconds. When I stand up straight, I usually like what I see (the volume is amazing) and I give my hair one more little spritz of hairspray just to hold it all in place. Sounds like a lot of work......but if you need to create the illusion of having tons of hair, this is the way to go. I truly love their products!!</li>
            <li> This is the best volumizing product I have ever found. I have thin, fine hair. This product makes my hair look and feel fuller and makes styling easier.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It makes my fine thin hair loo s much better.</li>
            <li> This new product is horrible and nothing like the original. It is very sticky, does not smell as good, and makes my hair look greasy. The bottle indicates that this is a new formula. I wish I could send it back. I don&#x27;t mind paying money for quality products, but this new formula has cheapened this product and I will be looking into other companies for better products.</li>
            <li> Great quality just as always on Pureology products!</li>
            <li> I have fine/thin hair.  This is the best stuff I have ever used when I round brush my hair.  It makes me hair feel full and my curls stay. It also smells really good.  One bottle will last you about 4 months if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have very soft baby fine hair. This actually did give me some more body and volume. It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down like most products do</li>
            <li> highly recommend--I also use the shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;It also helped the fly away hairs that I get in the winter</li>
            <li> I love the Pureology purevolume blowdry amplifier. I have used it for several years now and it works great with my hair. Smells awesome! Downside pureology products do not work well with everyone&#x27;s hair. If it works with your hair, then it&#x27;s a perfect fit!</li>
            <li> Bought this item thru Amazon thinking I can save a few bucks vs. buying it at my local hair salon here in Honolulu. Well the saying &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; applies to this purchase.  It&#x27;s either not a genuine product or it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf too long or something b/c instead of adding volume to my hair, it made it sticky and flat.  I&#x27;ve contacted the seller and they sent me an E-mail with a return address to ship it back at my own expense...really?????  The cost to ship it back is just not worth it.  I will never buy any product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is good, but it takes very little or my hair is way too heavy and gummy.  It&#x27;s good, adds lots of volume; just takes very little to work.</li>
            <li> It provides nice soft volume for my long highlighted/glazed hair.  I use a round brush to style and it has enough umph to hold the shape I&#x27;m trying to achieve, with keeping my hair touchably soft all day.  This is a large bottle considering I use about a dime to nickle size, so it will last you quite a while.  I use this along with the Pureology hydrate shampoo and conditioner.  As with all their products, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pureology products for several years from their shampoo, conditioner and purevolume blowdry. Love it!</li>
            <li> gummy sticky and hard to work with. I have fine long hair and did not like how this product performed. it is like a liquid gel</li>
            <li> I love pureology..It works really well and does not weigh my hair down, but has a funny texture when I use it.  Overall I like the smell and feel like it really protects my fine hair and it is not so &amp;#34;fly-away&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My hair has no body and this product really helps with body, holding curls, etc.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and this product gives it volume, strength and apparent thickness.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 2 years and will not be switching products any time soon! It gives body to my fine, soft, humidity-susceptible hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. Just recently I feel like my hair is becoming extremely dried out because of this product. Maybe they changed their formula?! I&#x27;m thinking of changing brands.</li>
            <li> I have been using Pureology purevolume for many years and will continue to buy this product. I love the volume it provides for me. I have fine hair and it gives just the right about of volume I need. Not sticky, it&#x27;s a very light. I love it.</li>
            <li> My very fine hair likes Pureology products in general.  This one does not work well for me requiring additional products to provide volume in addition to this.  So I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> This product from Pureology is one of my favorites. It&#x27;s a light hold gel that adds volume to my hair. I use it with another product for curly hair, and it&#x27;s a great combination for my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  My only suggestion is to use sparingly (about the size of a nickel) for shoulder length hair.  When I use too much I feel like I have residue build-up.</li>
            <li> I love all the pureology products...especially this one. I put it on after washing my hair and then blow dry. It keeps my hair from frizzing and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Not what I was hoping for. I have very fine hair, and even though I use a small amount, my hair feels flatter and sticky. I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This actually does add a little more volume to my hair! I have very straight, fine hair. I do recommend going lighter on the amount of product used because I found that if I use too much it makes my hair kind of crunchy. I&#x27;m currently finishing up some shampoo and conditioner from another brand, but I plan on going back to Pureology once I&#x27;m done. I have high hopes that this amplifier plus the shampoo/conditioner will work even better.  The smell is also great!</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair &amp; this product gives great volume with a little control. It is really great and makes it easy to just blow &amp; go</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, which I appreciate.  Smells fine and works great!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair alittle thicker</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, because my stylist uses it on herself and all the reviews were quite good.  However, it&#x27;s not quite giving me the volume that I expected.  It could be my fault; maybe I&#x27;m not using enough of the product.  Or maybe I&#x27;m not working it into the roots properly.</li>
