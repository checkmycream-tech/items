            <li>This review is 100% my own opinion of the item.</li>
            <li>but now that she has the hang of it, she finds it very easy to use to remove her blackheads.  </li>
            <li>but this made the extraction quick and painless and sore free!!!</li>
            <li>The handle is very comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>This is better than using my fingers, more sanitary and will not leave scars.  </li>
            <li>This is a much more sanitary way to extract pimples and should minimize scarring.</li>
            <li>Overall, this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and feels like it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>The side I like the most is the one that has a rounded edge.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to purchase another to have in my travel bag :)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure how it worked because it came with no instructions.  </li>
            <li>It is made really well and extremely easy to keep clean, I have been using it for about a week now and really impressed, it does not hurt &amp;#34;like</li>
            <li>My teenager uses this tool and seems to be quite pleased.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase, but I gave it 4 stars for the lack of directions.</li>
            <li>I received this ZitstiK Blackhead Acne Pimple remover tool and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product to remove my blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li>We extract all kind of dirt and oil and keep my nose looking shiny, smooth, and unclogged.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to get this and give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the navy grip is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to use this!  </li>
            <li>so I was disturbingly excited to get one of these things for myself!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this!</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and can be stored almost anywhere.</li>
            <li>Easy to spot when I throw it in my make up bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an easy tool to use, easy to disinfect and easy to carry in a makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>I makes it so easy and painless.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold, works easy to pop zits without squeezing or tearing the skin.  </li>
            <li>This tool arrived quickly and well packaged!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean with rubbing alcohol in order to sanitze it in between uses.</li>
            <li>Great to use for a facial without going to the spa</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a ton more clogged pores since and have had way too much fun with this thing.  </li>
            <li>The tool has a no slip grip design and is a comfortable length to hold.  </li>
            <li>The textured handle keeps it in your hand securely.</li>
            <li>Quickly and easily removed my blackhead.</li>
            <li>The handles texture makes it excellent for gripping and the two different heads gives you different options depending on it &amp;#34;job&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who has a significant problems</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s effective!</li>
            <li>This will also help with keeping germs and bacteria to a minimum as you can properly clean the tool.  </li>
            <li>There was an easy learning curve and it definitely works easier on parts of the face right up against a bone or cartilage (ie, nose and forehead are easier than cheeks), and it&#x27;s even more effective if you self-steam your face a bit ahead of time.</li>
            <li>The utensil works best on parts of your body with a hard background but the wire loop end is great for those harder to reach spots like your nose.</li>
            <li>but so far it has cleaned up well and seems to be holding up to the moist bathroom environment nicely.</li>
            <li>The product itself is designed very nicely, with a nice textured grip through the middle and two ends with different types of pore extractors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to clean and very lightweight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m introducing more bacteria to the surrounding pores (although that does present more opportunities to use the comedone extractor, hmmm...).  </li>
            <li>Its super easy to clean and very lightweight, Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone looking for better skin.</li>
            <li>I love the spa facials that include extractions, but certainly cannot afford them on a regular basis and now I can do my own.</li>
            <li>So much cleaner and sanitary then trying to use your fingers!!</li>
            <li>, they said it was much better to use a tool rather than your oily fingers to get rid of blackheads and pimples on the sensitive face skin.  </li>
            <li>it would have been nice to have just a set of simple tips and tricks to read through before I got started.  </li>
            <li>I find this product to be superior to it&#x27;s competitors because this tool doesn&#x27;t require nearly as much pressure as my prior sticks.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The tool is not painful to use and really does get the job done.</li>
            <li>; It&#x27;s a simple product to use, but I&#x27;m a directions person :-)</li>
            <li>I love the two ends that are different extractors depending on the blemish that you have.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must have to everyone!</li>
            <li>I love the different ends on this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  sturdy and a pretty navy color.</li>
            <li>This ZitstiK works so much better than the traditional using your fingernails to squeeze out all of the nastiness in your pores.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have ever used a tool like this</li>
            <li>I also love how little it is and the easy griping on the sides.</li>
            <li>Also, in case other people see it, you can say it&#x27;s some kind of sewing tool.</li>
            <li>This utensil has two ends, one with a flat loop and one with more of a wire loop.</li>
            <li>I found that the flat end look works great when moved across a chin or forehead for extracting unknown blemishes.</li>
            <li>It is a well designed tool that has two different shaped ends, one is an angled loop which I find works best for white heads and the other end is flatter</li>
            <li>The middle portion of the utensil is textured for easy maneuvering.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s blackheads or whiteheads, this is a great way to extract without irritating your skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to &amp;#34;relieve&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I found the flatter of the two extractors worked really well around the crease of my nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to remove them with this tool.</li>
            <li>This stick does not require as much pressure as others to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to get the blackheads and oils to release.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with big pores that constantly get clogged - not so much pimples, more just blackhead/clogged pores.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and has a textured grip to prevent slipping.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended that I try one of these little handy tools and after receiving a promotional discount to write a review, I figured that I had nothing to lose and only gain.</li>
            <li>It looks like a professional instrument you would use at the spa!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other similar tools and this works much better.</li>
            <li>most of the ones I have used in the past did&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I found that the Zitstik is easy to use and will help remove the blackheads that she has been having trouble removing.</li>
            <li>It does leave a tiny little red mark on my sensitive skin but it quickly goes away and is much better than a zit that would last for days.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from adult onset acne and the pimples I have</li>
            <li>It is much easier to use if it is used after cleaning your face when your pores are bigger, according to my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Naturally the day it came</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and will definitely be packed in my cosmetic bag for here on out!</li>
            <li>Skin is a little red after use, but that fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Generally, I use my fingernails to squeeze and dig at blackheads, pimples or clog pores - I&#x27;m then left with a large red, irritated and very unattractive lump on my face afterward.</li>
            <li>Since it was my first time using an extractor, it did take me a little while to figure out which end to use where and how much pressure to apply.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other products without success.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I need it to do without over bruising my skin or creating a big red mark afterward.</li>
            <li>The tool is easy to hold, it has two different extracting options and takes up little space in my already cramped bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>I also use this to gently exfoliate dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to fit in my makeup bag</li>
            <li>I only give this 4 stars because it did not come with instructions on exactly how to use it, although it is not extremely difficult once you give it a few tries,  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve already got an inflamed pimple, this tool won&#x27;t work, but I believe it really does prevent acne by getting the pores unclogged early so they don&#x27;t get infected and can shrink back down.</li>
            <li>I was shocked at how effective this item is!</li>
            <li>I was a little scared at first, but once figuring out how to use it(which was very simple)</li>
            <li>This tool is so easy to use to get rid of those ugly little blackheads and my skin looks so much better since I&#x27;m not making scars.</li>
            <li>With a little pressure, this tool quickly removed my blemishes and I was left with minimal redness.</li>

            <li> I found the flatter of the two extractors worked really well around the crease of my nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to remove them with this tool.</li>
            <li> This stick does not require as much pressure as others to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to get the blackheads and oils to release.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with big pores that constantly get clogged - not so much pimples, more just blackhead/clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has a textured grip to prevent slipping.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended that I try one of these little handy tools and after receiving a promotional discount to write a review, I figured that I had nothing to lose and only gain.</li>
            <li> It looks like a professional instrument you would use at the spa!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar tools and this works much better.</li>
            <li> most of the ones I have used in the past did&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I found that the Zitstik is easy to use and will help remove the blackheads that she has been having trouble removing.</li>
            <li> It does leave a tiny little red mark on my sensitive skin but it quickly goes away and is much better than a zit that would last for days.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from adult onset acne and the pimples I have</li>
            <li> It is much easier to use if it is used after cleaning your face when your pores are bigger, according to my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Naturally the day it came</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and will definitely be packed in my cosmetic bag for here on out!</li>
            <li> Skin is a little red after use, but that fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Generally, I use my fingernails to squeeze and dig at blackheads, pimples or clog pores - I&#x27;m then left with a large red, irritated and very unattractive lump on my face afterward.</li>
            <li> Since it was my first time using an extractor, it did take me a little while to figure out which end to use where and how much pressure to apply.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products without success.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to do without over bruising my skin or creating a big red mark afterward.</li>
            <li> The tool is easy to hold, it has two different extracting options and takes up little space in my already cramped bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> I also use this to gently exfoliate dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to fit in my makeup bag</li>
            <li> I only give this 4 stars because it did not come with instructions on exactly how to use it, although it is not extremely difficult once you give it a few tries,  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve already got an inflamed pimple, this tool won&#x27;t work, but I believe it really does prevent acne by getting the pores unclogged early so they don&#x27;t get infected and can shrink back down.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how effective this item is!</li>
            <li> I was a little scared at first, but once figuring out how to use it(which was very simple)</li>
            <li> This tool is so easy to use to get rid of those ugly little blackheads and my skin looks so much better since I&#x27;m not making scars.</li>
            <li> With a little pressure, this tool quickly removed my blemishes and I was left with minimal redness.</li>
            <li> I centered it around a pore that I wasn&#x27;t quite sure was clogged Or just large, pushed in and down a little, and out popped a little black head!  </li>
            <li> It does leave a little red horseshoe shaped indent on my skin, which at first I was not happy about, but to compare I also popped a pimple with my fingers and realized it leaves a whole area red and for a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is stainless or not</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s black heads under his eyes near his cheekbones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually submit reviews, but I would highly recommend this stik.</li>
            <li> It does it well with not much pain or redness left.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so my teenage son could tend to his hormone explosions without the damage that happens due to squeezing.</li>
            <li> That being said once you get the hang of this little tool you will never go back to squeezing and prodding your faced with your fingers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try one of these little gadgets and finally have one.  </li>
            <li> Not really much to say about it, it pops blackheads and zits.</li>
            <li> There is not much pressure required, and the handle is non slip so there is no worry there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to store anywhere.</li>
            <li> It works on other areas of your face as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about this little tool slipping out of my hand and causing scarring when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I might be using it wrong, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
            <li> It works well and helps you avoid infection by keeping your filthy hands off of your face. :)</li>
            <li> Since turning 30, I&#x27;ve been having horrible breakouts and wasn&#x27;t too sure what to do about it since I hadn&#x27;t battled acne since a teen.  </li>
            <li> This little tool gets the blackheads out without doing a lot of damage to the surrounding tissue.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended I try this little tool</li>
            <li> I think a little irritation is worth it if it means I get rid of the ugly blackheads, but some may find this off-putting.</li>
            <li> So keep your secret and obsess over your skin in private.</li>
            <li> When I received it I had no idea how to use it because there weren&#x27;t any instructions, but after a few google searches I figured it out.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any need to press extremely hard to get them to come out.  </li>
            <li> I never even had a pimple until my late 20&#x27;s, so I didn&#x27;t even have a clue what I was doing.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been having issues with blackheads lately.</li>
            <li> I have always been a little weird about acne.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t need to work very hard to take care of blemishes, and is not tearing his face up with his fingers.</li>
            <li> I hate when I get blackheads especially around my nose because I can never get them without making a sore</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan! I&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with big pores that constantly get clogged - not so much pimples, more just blackhead/clogged pores. I love the spa facials that include extractions, but certainly cannot afford them on a regular basis and now I can do my own. The product itself is designed very nicely, with a nice textured grip through the middle and two ends with different types of pore extractors. There was an easy learning curve and it definitely works easier on parts of the face right up against a bone or cartilage (ie, nose and forehead are easier than cheeks), and it&#x27;s even more effective if you self-steam your face a bit ahead of time. If you&#x27;ve already got an inflamed pimple, this tool won&#x27;t work, but I believe it really does prevent acne by getting the pores unclogged early so they don&#x27;t get infected and can shrink back down. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I never knew such a product existed! This thing is about the size of two tweezers laid end to end. Also, in case other people see it, you can say it&#x27;s some kind of sewing tool. I accidentally left this in my kitchen after opening the mail when it arrived and had to flub that when my husband asked about it. Hey, you don&#x27;t want everyone knowing your bidness. So keep your secret and obsess over your skin in private.</li>
            <li> This tool arrived quickly and well packaged! It looks like a professional instrument you would use at the spa! The tool is sturdy and has a ridged area for your grip. I am very impressed with the quality of our ZitstiK :)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tol for anyone who is prone to getting blackheads. I tend to have breakouts due to hormonal fluctuations and I really hate those clogged pores. This tool is so easy to use to get rid of those ugly little blackheads and my skin looks so much better since I&#x27;m not making scars.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is I wish it came with &amp;#34;directions.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s a simple product to use, but I&#x27;m a directions person :-) it works great. I love the two ends that are different extractors depending on the blemish that you have. It&#x27;s super easy to clean and very lightweight. Whether it&#x27;s blackheads or whiteheads, this is a great way to extract without irritating your skin.</li>
            <li> This tool is great. I get breakouts when I have my period every month. This is better than using my fingers, more sanitary and will not leave scars.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to use. It&#x27;s small enough to store anywhere. Great Buy! I would highly recommend to anyone looking for better skin.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use tool for those stubborn blackheads!! I hate when I get blackheads especially around my nose because I can never get them without making a sore (GROSS) but this made the extraction quick and painless and sore free!!! It is small enough to fit in my makeup bag so I can bring it with me everywhere and can use as needed. The handles texture makes it excellent for gripping and the two different heads gives you different options depending on it &amp;#34;job&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who has a significant problems it&#x27;s black heads under his eyes near his cheekbones. The skin is so tender there that squeezing the blackheads with fingernails just tears up his skin. This little tool gets the blackheads out without doing a lot of damage to the surrounding tissue.  I&#x27;ve tried other similar tools and this works much better.</li>
            <li> Grossly addicting!  Since turning 30, I&#x27;ve been having horrible breakouts and wasn&#x27;t too sure what to do about it since I hadn&#x27;t battled acne since a teen.  A friend recommended I try this little tool and I have to say that it&#x27;s worked wonders.  Since it was my first time using an extractor, it did take me a little while to figure out which end to use where and how much pressure to apply.  It doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to &amp;#34;relieve&amp;#34; my pores of the nasty little blackheads that were causing my breakouts.  It does leave a tiny little red mark on my sensitive skin but it quickly goes away and is much better than a zit that would last for days.  This is an absolute must have to everyone!</li>
            <li> I might be using it wrong, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
            <li> Sorry, bought this as a gift for my granddaughter in another state, so I can&#x27;t give it a review. I clicked &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; because I had to hit something to post this statement &amp; didn&#x27;t want to say anything bad about a product I&#x27;ve never used.</li>
            <li> I love the different ends on this. Not really much to say about it, it pops blackheads and zits. It does it well with not much pain or redness left.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to use this!  I suffer from adult onset acne and the pimples I have now are so much worse than  what I had in adolescence.  This tool should help to keep the discoloration  at a minimum when I pop them as I have found that my skin takes longer to heal than when I was younger.  This will also help with keeping germs and bacteria to a minimum as you can properly clean the tool.  Using my fingers isn&#x27;t the best way to keep from spreading around my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  It took her a day to two to figure out how to use it but now that she has the hang of it, she finds it very easy to use to remove her blackheads.  She has not yet tried it on a zit but she has removed 3 or 4 blackheads since she got it.  She loves use this instead of trying to squeeze the blackheads out using her fingers.  It is much easier to use if it is used after cleaning your face when your pores are bigger, according to my daughter.  I definitely recommend getting one for anyone who has blackheads and/or zits.  It is easy to hold and can be stored almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> Was just the thing my daughter was looking for.  Does the job without breaking or damaging skin - leaves no marks/scars. Easy to use and has a textured grip to prevent slipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s effective!</li>
            <li> This does remove blackheads and helps remove zits, just as advertised. It is easy to clean with rubbing alcohol in order to sanitze it in between uses. However, it does leave my skin a bit irritated. I think a little irritation is worth it if it means I get rid of the ugly blackheads, but some may find this off-putting. I consider this an essential tool in my skincare arsenal.</li>
            <li> Generally, I use my fingernails to squeeze and dig at blackheads, pimples or clog pores - I&#x27;m then left with a large red, irritated and very unattractive lump on my face afterward. The Zitstik eliminates the digging and squeezing. With a little pressure, this tool quickly removed my blemishes and I was left with minimal redness. I found the flatter of the two extractors worked really well around the crease of my nose. Using it kind of like a paddle, helped to extract (push) my clogged pores. This is a much more sanitary way to extract pimples and should minimize scarring. The tool is easy to hold, it has two different extracting options and takes up little space in my already cramped bathroom cabinet. Happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Great to use for a facial without going to the spa</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those freaks who loves watching the pimple popping videos on YouTube so I was disturbingly excited to get one of these things for myself!  Naturally the day it came I had nothing to extract... or so I thought!  I centered it around a pore that I wasn&#x27;t quite sure was clogged Or just large, pushed in and down a little, and out popped a little black head!  Ahh!  I&#x27;ve found a ton more clogged pores since and have had way too much fun with this thing.  It does leave a little red horseshoe shaped indent on my skin, which at first I was not happy about, but to compare I also popped a pimple with my fingers and realized it leaves a whole area red and for a lot longer.  Not to mention when I use my fingers I&#x27;m introducing more bacteria to the surrounding pores (although that does present more opportunities to use the comedone extractor, hmmm...).  Overall, this thing is awesome.</li>
            <li> I ordered this blackhead remover for my daughter. She gets blackheads often. She said it works well on her blackheads. It&#x27;s much easier to remove them with this tool.</li>
            <li> I have never used a ZitstiK before so I was very excited to get this and give it a try.  I had actually been looking forward to getting one since seeing it on the Doctors show, they said it was much better to use a tool rather than your oily fingers to get rid of blackheads and pimples on the sensitive face skin.  I only give this 4 stars because it did not come with instructions on exactly how to use it, although it is not extremely difficult once you give it a few tries,  it would have been nice to have just a set of simple tips and tricks to read through before I got started.  That being said once you get the hang of this little tool you will never go back to squeezing and prodding your faced with your fingers.  I</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try one of these but could never find one in the store. So as soon as I saw it I jumped on it. It works wonderfully and feels like it will last a lifetime. If you don&#x27;t know how to use it go on youtube and search! Lots of tutorials.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this! It works perfectly! The side I like the most is the one that has a rounded edge. It doesn&#x27;t cut into your skin at all. It&#x27;s  sturdy and a pretty navy color. Easy to spot when I throw it in my make up bag. I think I&#x27;m going to purchase another to have in my travel bag :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure how it worked because it came with no instructions.  Figured it out, and guess what??? Happiest husband in the world.  He loved me popping his blackheads before, now genius!!</li>
            <li> Just tried this Zitstik and it worked great! Quickly and easily removed my blackhead. It also worked on my pimples. The handle is very comfortable to hold and I love the color! I have tried other products without success. This stick does not require as much pressure as others to remove blackheads. I don&#x27;t usually submit reviews, but I would highly recommend this stik.</li>
            <li> So much cleaner and sanitary then trying to use your fingers!! It is made really well and extremely easy to keep clean, I have been using it for about a week now and really impressed, it does not hurt &amp;#34;like most of the ones I have used in the past did&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an easy tool to use, easy to disinfect and easy to carry in a makeup bag.  Perfect so I am not tempted to squeeze using my fingers.  It is a well designed tool that has two different shaped ends, one is an angled loop which I find works best for white heads and the other end is flatter and I use it for blackheads. The tool has a no slip grip design and is a comfortable length to hold.  I find it is best to use after showering or after applying warm washcloth to the area to soften my skin.  I also use this to gently exfoliate dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> According to my teens:  works well.  Comfortable to hold, works easy to pop zits without squeezing or tearing the skin.  Skin is a little red after use, but that fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple product to use.  I like the two ends that are different extractors depending on the blemish that you have. Its super easy to clean and very lightweight, Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have fingernails so a product like this is perfect for me. I have never used a utensil for blackhead removal just Biore strips which can get expensive. I was shocked at how effective this item is! This utensil has two ends, one with a flat loop and one with more of a wire loop. I found that the flat end look works great when moved across a chin or forehead for extracting unknown blemishes. The utensil works best on parts of your body with a hard background but the wire loop end is great for those harder to reach spots like your nose. The middle portion of the utensil is textured for easy maneuvering. Very impressed with this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try one of these little gadgets and finally have one.  It&#x27;s really a gross thing to want... but it&#x27;s awesome. Haha. It works well and helps you avoid infection by keeping your filthy hands off of your face. :)</li>
            <li> My teenager uses this tool and seems to be quite pleased. He doesn&#x27;t need to work very hard to take care of blemishes, and is not tearing his face up with his fingers. There is not much pressure required, and the handle is non slip so there is no worry there. The tool is not painful to use and really does get the job done.</li>
            <li> My friend suggested that I try a ZitstiK to help with blackheads. When I received it I had no idea how to use it because there weren&#x27;t any instructions, but after a few google searches I figured it out. It&#x27;s easy to use and the navy grip is very comfortable. It doesn&#x27;t take much pressure to get the blackheads and oils to release. It has two different sizes on each end for ample use and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. I am pleased with my purchase, but I gave it 4 stars for the lack of directions.</li>
            <li> very good quality, I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I have always been a little weird about acne. I never even had a pimple until my late 20&#x27;s, so I didn&#x27;t even have a clue what I was doing. A friend recommended that I try one of these little handy tools and after receiving a promotional discount to write a review, I figured that I had nothing to lose and only gain. I was a little scared at first, but once figuring out how to use it(which was very simple) I fell in love! I makes it so easy and painless. I was amazed! I also love how little it is and the easy griping on the sides. I now have it in my purse at all times!</li>
            <li> POOR QUALITY BOTH IN THE BODY AND ONE END</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to do without over bruising my skin or creating a big red mark afterward. Very sturdy and will definitely be packed in my cosmetic bag for here on out!</li>
            <li> I received this ZitstiK Blackhead Acne Pimple remover tool and love it. I cleaned it then enter to town on my husband&#x27;s back. It was wonderful. I didn&#x27;t have to use my fingers and this tool worked like a charm. It didn&#x27;t bother him like my fingers do. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> This blackhead remover works exceptionally well at removing blackheads.  There isn&#x27;t any need to press extremely hard to get them to come out.  It works on pimples as well as blackheads.  This ZitstiK works so much better than the traditional using your fingernails to squeeze out all of the nastiness in your pores.  The gripped handle of the ZitstiK is really great.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about this little tool slipping out of my hand and causing scarring when I use it.  This is the first time that I have ever used a tool like this and I must say, I&#x27;m hooked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and helpful review.  This review is 100% my own opinion of the item.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this item? It works would be the easiest description. I purchased this so my teenage son could tend to his hormone explosions without the damage that happens due to squeezing. I like the solid feel, no flimsy here. The textured handle keeps it in your hand securely. I am not sure if this is stainless or not but so far it has cleaned up well and seems to be holding up to the moist bathroom environment nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this product to remove my blackheads on my nose. Each night after my shower, I get up close and person with my mirror and my ZitstiK. We extract all kind of dirt and oil and keep my nose looking shiny, smooth, and unclogged. It works on other areas of your face as well. i use it on my forehead, nose, and cheeks. I find this product to be superior to it&#x27;s competitors because this tool doesn&#x27;t require nearly as much pressure as my prior sticks.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been having issues with blackheads lately. She has tried various products and although some have worked, they do not remove all of the blackheads. I decided to try to this product on her to see if it will help. I found that the Zitstik is easy to use and will help remove the blackheads that she has been having trouble removing. I am very happy with the Zitstik and will be getting one for myself :)</li>
