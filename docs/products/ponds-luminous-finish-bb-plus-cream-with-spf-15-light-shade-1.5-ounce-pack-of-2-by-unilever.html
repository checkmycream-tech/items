    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best BB Cream foundation for the price.  </li>
            <li>but I call this a best buy in any catagory.  </li>
            <li>This is the best BB I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>Great item, great price, great transaction!  </li>
            <li>This BB cream makes my skin beautiful and protects it from the sun.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This BB Cream is great.</li>
            <li>Its perfect for fairer skin, not too orangey like most fair BB&#x27;s I have tried.</li>
            <li>I mix the light and the medium together to get my perfect shade.  </li>
            <li>It has great coverage, nice creamy consistency, and makes me glow.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so very many.  </li>
            <li>It feels non-greasy and blends very easily into my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping with perfect packaging - extremely satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>I am devastated that it&#x27;s been discontinued; I&#x27;m in the process of stocking up on as many of these as I can find!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for better!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I read through what others had to say about this product, and hopefully my review will help you make the choice as well!</li>
            <li>Most people don&#x27;t associate PONDS with foundation products, but trust me, if they keep it up, they may take over!</li>
            <li>; This is not a joke--it&#x27;s happened more than once!</li>
            <li>Great color, easy to blend, not greasy.</li>
            <li>I prefer the light colored product as it&#x27;s a good match for my fair skin and freckles too.  </li>
            <li>great BB cream; goes on smoothly, nice light coverage</li>
            <li>Also I between light and medium so can&#x27;t use either with good results</li>
            <li>Besides that I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed any toning, but it says you&#x27;ll have more toned skin in 2 weeks, so I&#x27;ll just have to wait and see.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many BB &amp; CC creams and this is my favorite, no contest.</li>
            <li>I wish more people knew about it.</li>
            <li>Way better than any MAC, Benefit I have ever purchased as I don&#x27;t feel caked on at all.</li>
            <li>Love this bb cream.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many foundations, BB, and CC creams.  </li>
            <li>First, it smells good.  </li>
            <li>It  goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>I was waiting to receive this bb cream,, I ordered the light shade, what I received was the medium shade and expired bb cream...</li>
            <li>Just fresh faced!</li>
            <li>This is smooth, creamy, just the right shade for me &amp; covers light blemishes &amp; discolored areas on my face.</li>
            <li>so finding this priced right on Amazon made my day!</li>
            <li>The price is right too!</li>
            <li>It is hard to find but Amazon always has it for an excellent price.</li>
            <li>but at the same time people comment that they&#x27;re amazed at how good my skin looks without any make-up.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it though; shipping was fast, and I love amazon.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly without feeling greasy or leaving a shiny finish.</li>
            <li>I laugh, and say &amp;#34;It&#x27;s all the makeup!&amp;#34; and the friend inevitably leans in, squints, and says, &amp;#34;Wow, that must be some good makeup, I can&#x27;t even see it.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It also lasts all day and is super lightweight and therefore buildable.</li>
            <li>I read that this was good coverage by some other reviews, but it&#x27;s light coverage.</li>
            <li>I tried pretty much every BB in stores, and came to Amazon looking to find something different with great reviews.</li>
            <li>It is really too light for my skin shade</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great low maintenance solution for this busy mom.</li>
            <li>Its natural looking, which I love.</li>
            <li>Ponds, by far, is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>As I squeeze it out, the container is made so that you get an amount in your hand that is not gushy but just right without having to measure it.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I think it&#x27;s actually good for my skin, when I take it off at the end of the day my skin feel softer and less irritated.</li>
            <li>Cream w/SPF is one of my favorites as it covers my uneven skin tones better than most BB products out there and at a price I find very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>and it really lasts all day into the evening which makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s unfortunate because I think it&#x27;s excellent.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily like a lotion and it blends like magic.</li>
            <li>I have tried more than half a dozen brands of BB cream and this is by far my favorite product.  </li>
            <li>This product has diminished my dark spots from acne scars so amazingly well that I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>The other big thing I also noticed about this product is that you seem to get more product than most of its competitors.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Second, it has a light creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>It blends into my very pale/yellowish complexion very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s life-changing, really.</li>
            <li>I like this BB cream because it is thick and has good coverage.</li>
            <li>like I have with other products, which is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Possibly more expensive BB&#x27;s are better</li>
            <li>I purchased more shortly after my first purchase since I knew I&#x27;d be using this EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and smooths out the pores.</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive and hasn&#x27;t had any problems with this product yet.</li>
            <li>This product is not available in stores near me yet, which I find surprising seeing that other PONDS products are?</li>
            <li>The color is very nice for pale yellow tones (ivory), would probably work for super pale red tones too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this anymore in any store near me.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and  so far no irritation</li>
            <li>I also trust it as my main SPF because I don&#x27;t like the smell or feel of regular sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I usually wear this particular product in the winter as I live in New England and the winter weather seems a lot more harsh on the face</li>
            <li>This is my favorite BB Cream &amp; I have tried at least 5 different brands.</li>
            <li>Fabulous as a base for makeup or on its own.</li>
            <li>, I have sensitive, irritated, inflamed skin prone to raw red breakouts--this BB cream goes on like silk, dries quickly, blends in with my skintone and hides all the red and mattes all the pimples.</li>
            <li>Coverage is comparable to the Revlon BB cream I used to use-- barely there, just enough to look a little more polished, plus it has zinc oxide in it, which helps reduce blackheads and adds a little SPF.  </li>
            <li>People are ALWAYS telling me how good my skin is looking--and I have bad skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this BB cream because it is thick and has good coverage.</li>
            <li> Ponds Luminous Finish BB Plus Cream w/SPF is one of my favorites as it covers my uneven skin tones better than most BB products out there and at a price I find very reasonable.  I usually wear this particular product in the winter as I live in New England and the winter weather seems a lot more harsh on the face and I have the added SPF protection.  I usually put it on first thing in the morning and it really lasts all day into the evening which makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth.  I prefer the light colored product as it&#x27;s a good match for my fair skin and freckles too.  The other big thing I also noticed about this product is that you seem to get more product than most of its competitors.  As I squeeze it out, the container is made so that you get an amount in your hand that is not gushy but just right without having to measure it.  I found the product not carried in all stores so finding this priced right on Amazon made my day!</li>
            <li> No need for foundation. Very pleased with the results. Will buy again</li>
            <li> great BB cream; goes on smoothly, nice light coverage</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the texture of this product. I guess I was ordering something different. It is really too light for my skin shade so all four I ordered are sitting on my shelf probably never going to be used. I use Ponds cold cream and was hoping this would be like it except with SPF.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This BB Cream is great. It feels non-greasy and blends very easily into my fair skin. It doesn&#x27;t cover all skin defects but diminishes spots and patchiness. I use a concealer with it to hide dark spots and under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I was waiting to receive this bb cream,, I ordered the light shade, what I received was the medium shade and expired bb cream...I gonna return the item</li>
            <li> This BB cream makes my skin beautiful and protects it from the sun.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BB Cream &amp; I have tried at least 5 different brands. This is smooth, creamy, just the right shade for me &amp; covers light blemishes &amp; discolored areas on my face. It lasts all day. I sometimes wear just the BB Cream or if I&#x27;m going out, just a little foundation over this. The price is right too!</li>
            <li> I suspect that Pond&#x27;s has discontinued this BB cream so this may be the only place that you can buy it.  That&#x27;s unfortunate because I think it&#x27;s excellent.  First, it smells good.  Second, it has a light creamy texture.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything when I wear it.  It doesn&#x27;t come off on clothes or pillow cases.  It blends into my very pale/yellowish complexion very well.  At the end of the day, I still have a dewy, airbrushed appearance as a result of using this cream.  I also trust it as my main SPF because I don&#x27;t like the smell or feel of regular sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve tried so very many.  When I wear this, it looks like I&#x27;m not wearing anything but at the same time people comment that they&#x27;re amazed at how good my skin looks without any make-up.  It&#x27;s a great low maintenance solution for this busy mom.</li>
            <li> I read that this was good coverage by some other reviews, but it&#x27;s light coverage. You can layer it a bit to make it thicker, but if you have a blemish you&#x27;ll have to apply some concealer. Besides that I love this stuff. The color is very nice for pale yellow tones (ivory), would probably work for super pale red tones too. It&#x27;s very soft and smooths out the pores. My face is very sensitive and hasn&#x27;t had any problems with this product yet. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and I haven&#x27;t noticed any toning, but it says you&#x27;ll have more toned skin in 2 weeks, so I&#x27;ll just have to wait and see. The picture is showing the thickness and coverage of the BB cream.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many BB &amp; CC creams and this is my favorite, no contest. Great color, easy to blend, not greasy. Fabulous as a base for makeup or on its own. I am devastated that it&#x27;s been discontinued; I&#x27;m in the process of stocking up on as many of these as I can find!</li>
            <li> This is thick. Color does seem to blend in well. However it doesn&#x27;t work well for dry skin (too hard to rub in) . Also I between light and medium so can&#x27;t use either with good results</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best BB Cream foundation for the price.  Possibly more expensive BB&#x27;s are better but I call this a best buy in any catagory.  Regretfully, it appears they stopped selling it in local stores.</li>
            <li> Very good. I like it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this anymore in any store near me. This product has diminished my dark spots from acne scars so amazingly well that I&#x27;m hooked. I use it daily like a lotion and it blends like magic. Love it! I wish more people knew about it. Way better than any MAC, Benefit I have ever purchased as I don&#x27;t feel caked on at all. Just fresh faced!</li>
            <li> Love this bb cream. Its natural looking, which I love. It  goes on smooth and easy. I do have sensitive skin and  so far no irritation</li>
            <li> Its is out of code in June 2015 and I just purchase about 2 months ago.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have tried so many foundations, BB, and CC creams.  Ponds, by far, is my favorite.  I mix the light and the medium together to get my perfect shade.  It is hard to find but Amazon always has it for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I have tried more than half a dozen brands of BB cream and this is by far my favorite product.  Absorbs quickly without feeling greasy or leaving a shiny finish.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB I&#x27;ve tried. Its perfect for fairer skin, not too orangey like most fair BB&#x27;s I have tried. It has great coverage, nice creamy consistency, and makes me glow. I couldn&#x27;t ask for better! I also have not had any issues with break-outs like I have with other products, which is fantastic! I tried pretty much every BB in stores, and came to Amazon looking to find something different with great reviews. I am so glad I read through what others had to say about this product, and hopefully my review will help you make the choice as well! Most people don&#x27;t associate PONDS with foundation products, but trust me, if they keep it up, they may take over! This product is not available in stores near me yet, which I find surprising seeing that other PONDS products are? I don&#x27;t mind it though; shipping was fast, and I love amazon. I purchased more shortly after my first purchase since I knew I&#x27;d be using this EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> Great item, great price, great transaction!  Very fast shipping with perfect packaging - extremely satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> People are ALWAYS telling me how good my skin is looking--and I have bad skin. I laugh, and say &amp;#34;It&#x27;s all the makeup!&amp;#34; and the friend inevitably leans in, squints, and says, &amp;#34;Wow, that must be some good makeup, I can&#x27;t even see it.&amp;#34; This is not a joke--it&#x27;s happened more than once! I&#x27;m 23, I have sensitive, irritated, inflamed skin prone to raw red breakouts--this BB cream goes on like silk, dries quickly, blends in with my skintone and hides all the red and mattes all the pimples. It&#x27;s life-changing, really. Plus, I think it&#x27;s actually good for my skin, when I take it off at the end of the day my skin feel softer and less irritated. It also lasts all day and is super lightweight and therefore buildable. Skip your MAC primer. Skip your NARS liquid foundation. Skip your BENEFIT tinted moisturizer. Just use POND&#x27;S Luminous Finish BB cream for a light, full-coverage and a natural-looking makeup base. $10 bucks vs. $90, it&#x27;s worth a shot. [I have an oily-outlined, dry-centered face (combination skin), prone to dark spots and acne. I am very, very pale (alabaster), with thin black hair and hazel eyes. If this sounds like you, you&#x27;ve gotta get this stuff.]</li>
            <li> Coverage is comparable to the Revlon BB cream I used to use-- barely there, just enough to look a little more polished, plus it has zinc oxide in it, which helps reduce blackheads and adds a little SPF.  Smell is a little bad, but really no big deal, and it dissipates after rubbing the cream in.  This will stay in my daily makeup routine.</li>
