            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with periodically using a glycolic or lactic acid mask/peel (once every 1-2 weeks) rather than incorporating glycolic acid into my day-to-day routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>Love Peter Thomas Roth</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy I found something that blends the best of science and nature to support combination, sensitive, acne-prone skin to stay clear.</li>
            <li>I am glad I maid the change.</li>

            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>i love this product!&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>My pores always look so much better after washing.  </li>
            <li>I love his peel pads as well.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get more from you when mine ends</li>
            <li>but it can get more on the dryer side as we head into winter.  </li>
            <li>I have much better luck with the cream version of glycolic cleansers.  </li>
            <li>Well I am sure not all men.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, my brother really likes this cleanser and says it sure beats the heck out of his over the counter Nivea for Men, LOL.  </li>
            <li>Very rich lather.  </li>
            <li>This diminishes the oil significantly which is so nice.  </li>
            <li>face wash creates a nice foam and my face feel really clean.  </li>
            <li>I have combination acne prone skin, and I use this with a Buff Puff sponge and it leaves my skin feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have rosacea, it&#x27;s great for everything from oily days to normal days.  </li>
            <li>My skin is also brighter and becoming even which I love.</li>
            <li>most importantly, it is the best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used for reducing pores.  </li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling clean and exfoliated!</li>
            <li>not irritating to skin at all, rinses off easily, excellent product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin smooth and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>Excellent for sensitive skin that is acne prone,  it took about a week to see real results, but it has been almost 2 months</li>
            <li>I was looking online and ran across a blogger who had sistic acne and strongly recommended his acne wash...</li>
            <li>also you must use a strong  sun block to protect your skin during day time.</li>
            <li>To counter this I used the Proactive refining mask, which is antibacterial, and it was fine.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser sooo much!!  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in the appearance of my pores and blackheads</li>
            <li>My skin has been so smooth since I started using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and the color is evening out.</li>
            <li>this product is great for someone who has breakout, white head blackheads, pimples.</li>
            <li>Amazon is not authorized to sell Peter Thomas Roth products, but I think this is a genuine bottle of the face wash.</li>
            <li>Gentle, non drying but effective.</li>
            <li>Her recommended routine was wash with the Salcylic Acid, use toner with salcylic acid, put on Clindamycin gel, then oil free sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet effective on my skin.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean and fresh after use.</li>
            <li>perfect to use when the skin is congesting and becoming dull, over use will cause keratosis or hyper pigmentation around the mouth area.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth, and clean, and there is no odor - it just smells clean.  </li>
            <li>My original purchase was with the Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid 10% Hydrating</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Albeit a bit dry i am happy with the cleaning results.</li>
            <li>Skin is clean though.</li>
            <li>Im 38 and Have tried so many products over the years, but this one is so far the most efective and fastest  result that I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product is a bit drying but as long as you use a good moisturizer you will be fine.</li>
            <li>Even though the instructions say to clean gently with fingers, I use a microfiber washcloth to get more exfolation</li>
            <li>works as it says and more, Cleans thoroughly  and yet gentle to skin.</li>
            <li>The only suggestion I have is to have a good moisturizer after using this coz</li>
            <li>This wash has helped to reduce the number of breakouts and helps heal them quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores and oily skin, no acne but blackheads,  and this product is amazing, just after few days I can see great results; my pores are smaller and not so many blackheads , I use water based fondations</li>
            <li>I originally bought this facial wash a couple months before my wedding to make sure I had a nice clear complexion.  </li>
            <li>I saw PTR wash in a Bride&#x27;s magazine (getting married!)</li>
            <li>highly recommended !!!</li>
            <li>which is a good thing when you have dry skin like me!)  </li>
            <li>I have bought this product many times and it is always clear.  </li>
            <li>I will now try some of Roth&#x27;s other products, as I am impressed that just a &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; has such an effect.</li>
            <li>and it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>First of all, the product got here quickly.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling smooth, soft, and clean.  </li>
            <li>Since then I haven&#x27;t suffered a single new blemish, and my skin feels great and looks smoother.  </li>
            <li>Wow...I noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>The price seems high, but the bottle is huge and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>This particular brand is a great consistency and doesn&#x27;t dry you out too much.  </li>
            <li>The long term benefits to your skin are amazing.  </li>
            <li>My gauge of a good product always boils down to having a reaction to it.</li>
            <li>While I strongly prefer to use all natural products on my skin, none of them ever worked for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good skin for most of my life but over the past two years my skin has done a complete 360.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.  </li>
            <li>This new face wash is most likely the reason my facial skin looks more even toned, blemish free and &#x27;glowing&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clean and fresh, and my breakouts and cystic acne is completely nonexistent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even remember the last time I was able to go without foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li>So much so that when my parents came to visit, they noticed the difference in my skin and asked me to get it for them too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and can see this bottle will last me a year, maybe more.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last me a while.</li>
            <li>I have to say at first blush</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with since this is the first acid-based cleaner I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this facial wash.</li>
            <li>Ever since I have been using as part of my regime (it was the first thing I changed 3+ years ago)</li>
            <li>Yesterday 2 different people told me my face was glowing and that my skin looked fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Safe for teenagers too and only bit is needed each time of usage</li>
            <li>your skin is more prone to drying, I would recommend using only once per day until you are used to it.</li>
            <li>One the few good cleaners on the market.</li>
            <li>It clean the face and leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and the bottle is huge and will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li>My esthetician recommended I start using PTR glycolic products and I&#x27;m happy to say that using this cleanser day and night (wash twice at night, first with hands only, second time with Clairsonic Mia), followed by the PTR glycolic hydrating gel, my skin has been completely clear for over a year!  </li>
            <li>Leaves it clean and clear.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and clear.</li>
            <li>Takes make up off completely, leaves my skin refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>I use a good facial sunscreen (oil-free) by Neutrogena on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Seems to last long and face does feel clean and nice glow afterwards.</li>
            <li>It was worth the price and works better than other Glycolic Acid washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This wash gets my face super clean and gently exfoliates without turning red from irritation.</li>
            <li>At night I use a mild face wash by neutrogena followed by Obagi Clear.</li>
            <li>I have fairly large pores, clogging, scars and cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by an esthetician who said that I had large pores and needed something like this to keep the skin turning over?</li>
            <li>I have fairly large pores on my nose</li>
            <li>and it left my skin very smooth and soft but...</li>
            <li>so much I thought it deserved comment.</li>
            <li>My skin was much softer after washing my face with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon</li>
            <li>The texture of my skin changed and I was getting so much acne.</li>
            <li>Had to give it to my sister, my face was very irritated by it.</li>
            <li>I ready like  the Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic acid wash.  </li>
            <li>It can be too drying otherwise, then I use the gentle foaming wash they make.</li>
            <li>You will definitely need an oil free moisturizer with a suncreen.</li>
            <li>This product severely irritated my eyes, you really have to be cautious about rinsing it off your face.</li>
            <li>Rinse really, really well, and</li>
            <li>everything you can imagine, HUNDREDS of dollars spent on acne treatments that just didn&#x27;t work), and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have used glycolic cleansers for over 8 years and they are fabulous for deep cleaning and not drying you out.</li>
            <li>It came with a very distinct yellow color.  </li>
            <li>I tends to break you out in first couple of day of use but as ur skin gets used to it will tingle less and work better as your skin gets even over time.</li>
            <li>This clear face cleaner, is gentle and leaves my face clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I think the % of glycolic acid was just too low to make a significant difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product,I will not used any other face wash</li>
            <li>will trying something a little stronger now as I am older and need a bit more help. ;)</li>
            <li>Secondly, it is a huge bottle, and will last a very long time and when you smell it, it smell clean not mediciney.  </li>
            <li>have more or less gone away.</li>
            <li>I have previously used Mario Badescu and feel like it has given me better results.</li>
            <li>I think this gel based glycolic cleanser by Peter Thomas Roth may be better suited for oily skin or a man since typically they have tougher skin.....</li>
            <li>This particular cleanser in the gel form was too drying for my skin.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use a moisturizer your face is going to feel really tight and make more oil as a result.</li>
            <li>its highly recommended.........</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>one should use a little on there face, rub into the face, leave on for 30 secs or more.</li>
            <li>If I feel I need a little more moisture, I use the PTR Glycolic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>really cleared up my 17 year old daughters face as well.</li>
            <li>I needed something to help clear congested pores, and this really helps.  </li>
            <li>I tried many products hoping to get clear even skin and was not lucky.</li>
            <li>This, coupled with Clinique Dramatically Different moisturizing gel keeps my skin soft and keeps my acne pretty much under control.</li>
            <li>This wash foams really nicely, so you only need to use a little at a time.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m looking into a night cream, and new 3% retinol...</li>
            <li>She tried all sorts of different active ingredients to tackle adult acne and finally had someone tell her that glycolic acid was a good way to go.  </li>
            <li>For the price I expected more and won&#x27;t be reordering in the future.  </li>
            <li>Right after washing, you&#x27;ll face feels fresh and tingly, a little bit taut from scrubbing.</li>
            <li>so you get the true long term benefits deep down in your skin rather than over the counter products that are more surface based.  </li>
            <li>This keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stated on the back of the bottle, which I neglected to see at first.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more and maybe try some other Peter Thomas Roth products.  </li>
            <li>Leaves it soft, and normal.  </li>
            <li>It was just okay in my opinion in comparison to other similar washes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly the same thing !</li>
            <li>Other than that, my face feels clean.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne-prone skin that is also very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I honestly love this product, It cleans deep down and gets rid of all the blackheads too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gotten comments on how clear my skin looks.</li>
            <li>marked improvement in the texture of skin,</li>
            <li>but if you might have sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;use 1-2 times a week to start out with.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nowhere near what it used to be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use once a day.</li>
            <li>I dont think this would be for sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help w breakouts, but did make my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have had cystic/nodular acne since I was 13 years old.  </li>
            <li>I still have oily skin, so I have no trouble with dryness.  </li>
            <li>Even at 50-years-old I suffer from adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it does not have a strong perfume smell to it as does usually irritates my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not tight or oily feeling like some cleaners do.  </li>
            <li>My cystic acne is gone, my pores look smaller, and for the first time I actually have even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it there was a bit of a tingle, and especially so when used with the moisturizer I bought at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It does dry you out a little, but it&#x27;s ok for me because I have oilier skin.</li>
            <li>But you will see a major difference !</li>
            <li>The only problem is that my skin is very sensitive to sunlight now, I always wear sunblock but I&#x27;ll probably need to wear a hat for the rest of the summer as well.</li>
            <li>Very pleased...a little truely does go a long way so the size of the bottle will last some time.</li>
            <li>so she only uses it twice a week now with moisturizer and her skin is clear and</li>
            <li>The only thing that keeps my face clear is birth control pills.  </li>
            <li>without overstripping my sensitive facial skin.  </li>
            <li>I only use once a day because it can make your skin sensitive.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Start using it already, face does not dry after washing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exfoliating properties really helped my dark spots.  </li>
            <li>Other brands work better and at least you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It really keeps that top layer of dead skin removed so that you don&#x27;t get black heads and dull looking skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I absolutely love PTR products.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with periodically using a glycolic or lactic acid mask/peel (once every 1-2 weeks) rather than incorporating glycolic acid into my day-to-day routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> Love Peter Thomas Roth</li>
            <li> I no longer peel and my skin feels more even.</li>

            <li> I love any peter thomas roth item</li>
            <li> favorite product for washing face.</li>
            <li> The redness is going away, my face is getting smoother with better tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I found something that blends the best of science and nature to support combination, sensitive, acne-prone skin to stay clear.</li>
            <li> I am glad I maid the change.</li>
            <li> Love this all in one.</li>
            <li> and I love.</li>
            <li> love this stuff and the moisturizer.</li>

            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> i love this product!&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> My pores always look so much better after washing.  </li>
            <li> I love his peel pads as well.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get more from you when mine ends</li>
            <li> but it can get more on the dryer side as we head into winter.  </li>
            <li> I have much better luck with the cream version of glycolic cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Well I am sure not all men.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, my brother really likes this cleanser and says it sure beats the heck out of his over the counter Nivea for Men, LOL.  </li>
            <li> Very rich lather.  </li>
            <li> This diminishes the oil significantly which is so nice.  </li>
            <li> face wash creates a nice foam and my face feel really clean.  </li>
            <li> I have combination acne prone skin, and I use this with a Buff Puff sponge and it leaves my skin feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have rosacea, it&#x27;s great for everything from oily days to normal days.  </li>
            <li> My skin is also brighter and becoming even which I love.</li>
            <li> most importantly, it is the best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used for reducing pores.  </li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling clean and exfoliated!</li>
            <li> not irritating to skin at all, rinses off easily, excellent product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin smooth and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> Excellent for sensitive skin that is acne prone,  it took about a week to see real results, but it has been almost 2 months</li>
            <li> I was looking online and ran across a blogger who had sistic acne and strongly recommended his acne wash...</li>
            <li> also you must use a strong  sun block to protect your skin during day time.</li>
            <li> To counter this I used the Proactive refining mask, which is antibacterial, and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser sooo much!!  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in the appearance of my pores and blackheads</li>
            <li> My skin has been so smooth since I started using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and the color is evening out.</li>
            <li> this product is great for someone who has breakout, white head blackheads, pimples.</li>
            <li> Amazon is not authorized to sell Peter Thomas Roth products, but I think this is a genuine bottle of the face wash.</li>
            <li> Gentle, non drying but effective.</li>
            <li> Her recommended routine was wash with the Salcylic Acid, use toner with salcylic acid, put on Clindamycin gel, then oil free sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It feels smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet effective on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean and fresh after use.</li>
            <li> perfect to use when the skin is congesting and becoming dull, over use will cause keratosis or hyper pigmentation around the mouth area.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth, and clean, and there is no odor - it just smells clean.  </li>
            <li> My original purchase was with the Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid 10% Hydrating</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Albeit a bit dry i am happy with the cleaning results.</li>
            <li> Skin is clean though.</li>
            <li> Im 38 and Have tried so many products over the years, but this one is so far the most efective and fastest  result that I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product is a bit drying but as long as you use a good moisturizer you will be fine.</li>
            <li> Even though the instructions say to clean gently with fingers, I use a microfiber washcloth to get more exfolation</li>
            <li> works as it says and more, Cleans thoroughly  and yet gentle to skin.</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I have is to have a good moisturizer after using this coz</li>
            <li> This wash has helped to reduce the number of breakouts and helps heal them quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have large pores and oily skin, no acne but blackheads,  and this product is amazing, just after few days I can see great results; my pores are smaller and not so many blackheads , I use water based fondations</li>
            <li> I originally bought this facial wash a couple months before my wedding to make sure I had a nice clear complexion.  </li>
            <li> I saw PTR wash in a Bride&#x27;s magazine (getting married!)</li>
            <li> highly recommended !!!</li>
            <li> which is a good thing when you have dry skin like me!)  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product many times and it is always clear.  </li>
            <li> I will now try some of Roth&#x27;s other products, as I am impressed that just a &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; has such an effect.</li>
            <li> and it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> First of all, the product got here quickly.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling smooth, soft, and clean.  </li>
            <li> Since then I haven&#x27;t suffered a single new blemish, and my skin feels great and looks smoother.  </li>
            <li> Wow...I noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> The price seems high, but the bottle is huge and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> This particular brand is a great consistency and doesn&#x27;t dry you out too much.  </li>
            <li> The long term benefits to your skin are amazing.  </li>
            <li> My gauge of a good product always boils down to having a reaction to it.</li>
            <li> While I strongly prefer to use all natural products on my skin, none of them ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good skin for most of my life but over the past two years my skin has done a complete 360.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.  </li>
            <li> This new face wash is most likely the reason my facial skin looks more even toned, blemish free and &#x27;glowing&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clean and fresh, and my breakouts and cystic acne is completely nonexistent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even remember the last time I was able to go without foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li> So much so that when my parents came to visit, they noticed the difference in my skin and asked me to get it for them too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and can see this bottle will last me a year, maybe more.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last me a while.</li>
            <li> I have to say at first blush</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with since this is the first acid-based cleaner I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this facial wash.</li>
            <li> Ever since I have been using as part of my regime (it was the first thing I changed 3+ years ago)</li>
            <li> Yesterday 2 different people told me my face was glowing and that my skin looked fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Safe for teenagers too and only bit is needed each time of usage</li>
            <li> your skin is more prone to drying, I would recommend using only once per day until you are used to it.</li>
            <li> One the few good cleaners on the market.</li>
            <li> It clean the face and leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and the bottle is huge and will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended I start using PTR glycolic products and I&#x27;m happy to say that using this cleanser day and night (wash twice at night, first with hands only, second time with Clairsonic Mia), followed by the PTR glycolic hydrating gel, my skin has been completely clear for over a year!  </li>
            <li> Leaves it clean and clear.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and clear.</li>
            <li> Takes make up off completely, leaves my skin refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> I use a good facial sunscreen (oil-free) by Neutrogena on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Seems to last long and face does feel clean and nice glow afterwards.</li>
            <li> It was worth the price and works better than other Glycolic Acid washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This wash gets my face super clean and gently exfoliates without turning red from irritation.</li>
            <li> At night I use a mild face wash by neutrogena followed by Obagi Clear.</li>
            <li> I have fairly large pores, clogging, scars and cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by an esthetician who said that I had large pores and needed something like this to keep the skin turning over?</li>
            <li> I have fairly large pores on my nose</li>
            <li> and it left my skin very smooth and soft but...</li>
            <li> so much I thought it deserved comment.</li>
            <li> My skin was much softer after washing my face with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon</li>
            <li> The texture of my skin changed and I was getting so much acne.</li>
            <li> Had to give it to my sister, my face was very irritated by it.</li>
            <li> I ready like  the Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic acid wash.  </li>
            <li> It can be too drying otherwise, then I use the gentle foaming wash they make.</li>
            <li> You will definitely need an oil free moisturizer with a suncreen.</li>
            <li> This product severely irritated my eyes, you really have to be cautious about rinsing it off your face.</li>
            <li> Rinse really, really well, and</li>
            <li> everything you can imagine, HUNDREDS of dollars spent on acne treatments that just didn&#x27;t work), and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have used glycolic cleansers for over 8 years and they are fabulous for deep cleaning and not drying you out.</li>
            <li> It came with a very distinct yellow color.  </li>
            <li> I tends to break you out in first couple of day of use but as ur skin gets used to it will tingle less and work better as your skin gets even over time.</li>
            <li> This clear face cleaner, is gentle and leaves my face clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I think the % of glycolic acid was just too low to make a significant difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product,I will not used any other face wash</li>
            <li> will trying something a little stronger now as I am older and need a bit more help. ;)</li>
            <li> Secondly, it is a huge bottle, and will last a very long time and when you smell it, it smell clean not mediciney.  </li>
            <li> have more or less gone away.</li>
            <li> I have previously used Mario Badescu and feel like it has given me better results.</li>
            <li> I think this gel based glycolic cleanser by Peter Thomas Roth may be better suited for oily skin or a man since typically they have tougher skin.....</li>
            <li> This particular cleanser in the gel form was too drying for my skin.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use a moisturizer your face is going to feel really tight and make more oil as a result.</li>
            <li> its highly recommended.........</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> one should use a little on there face, rub into the face, leave on for 30 secs or more.</li>
            <li> If I feel I need a little more moisture, I use the PTR Glycolic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> really cleared up my 17 year old daughters face as well.</li>
            <li> I needed something to help clear congested pores, and this really helps.  </li>
            <li> I tried many products hoping to get clear even skin and was not lucky.</li>
            <li> This, coupled with Clinique Dramatically Different moisturizing gel keeps my skin soft and keeps my acne pretty much under control.</li>
            <li> This wash foams really nicely, so you only need to use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m looking into a night cream, and new 3% retinol...</li>
            <li> She tried all sorts of different active ingredients to tackle adult acne and finally had someone tell her that glycolic acid was a good way to go.  </li>
            <li> For the price I expected more and won&#x27;t be reordering in the future.  </li>
            <li> Right after washing, you&#x27;ll face feels fresh and tingly, a little bit taut from scrubbing.</li>
            <li> so you get the true long term benefits deep down in your skin rather than over the counter products that are more surface based.  </li>
            <li> This keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stated on the back of the bottle, which I neglected to see at first.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more and maybe try some other Peter Thomas Roth products.  </li>
            <li> Leaves it soft, and normal.  </li>
            <li> It was just okay in my opinion in comparison to other similar washes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s exactly the same thing !</li>
            <li> Other than that, my face feels clean.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne-prone skin that is also very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I honestly love this product, It cleans deep down and gets rid of all the blackheads too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gotten comments on how clear my skin looks.</li>
            <li> marked improvement in the texture of skin,</li>
            <li> but if you might have sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;use 1-2 times a week to start out with.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nowhere near what it used to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use once a day.</li>
            <li> I dont think this would be for sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help w breakouts, but did make my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have had cystic/nodular acne since I was 13 years old.  </li>
            <li> I still have oily skin, so I have no trouble with dryness.  </li>
            <li> Even at 50-years-old I suffer from adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it does not have a strong perfume smell to it as does usually irritates my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not tight or oily feeling like some cleaners do.  </li>
            <li> My cystic acne is gone, my pores look smaller, and for the first time I actually have even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it there was a bit of a tingle, and especially so when used with the moisturizer I bought at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It does dry you out a little, but it&#x27;s ok for me because I have oilier skin.</li>
            <li> But you will see a major difference !</li>
            <li> The only problem is that my skin is very sensitive to sunlight now, I always wear sunblock but I&#x27;ll probably need to wear a hat for the rest of the summer as well.</li>
            <li> Very pleased...a little truely does go a long way so the size of the bottle will last some time.</li>
            <li> so she only uses it twice a week now with moisturizer and her skin is clear and</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps my face clear is birth control pills.  </li>
            <li> without overstripping my sensitive facial skin.  </li>
            <li> I only use once a day because it can make your skin sensitive.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Start using it already, face does not dry after washing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s exfoliating properties really helped my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Other brands work better and at least you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It really keeps that top layer of dead skin removed so that you don&#x27;t get black heads and dull looking skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and use it every other day or so</li>
            <li> I use it every other day since i have sensitive skin and use retinol gel for acne.  </li>
            <li> You use so little of it when washing your face beacause it foams very well, so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> The only place that there is some minor discomfort is my forehead.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of this wash as it&#x27;s pretty thick</li>
            <li> The bottle last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman in my early 30s</li>
            <li> Once my face gets clearer I plan to reduce this to once per day and eventually to a few times per week as it makes your skin sensitive, especially if you go in the sun a lot.  </li>
            <li> This face wash left my skin very dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I used it for only two days and my skin erupted with thousands of tiny little white heads (and</li>
            <li> This wash helped clear my face within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this face wash, but unfortunately it was too harsh for my ultra-sensitive skin (related sidebar: lupus sucks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as long as I use moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Though they are a little more expensive than drug store brands, they are concentrate so a dime sized amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is that for the size,  it is a little bit on the pricy end for a facial wash.</li>
            <li> and since I already have dry skin to begin with, this didn&#x27;t make it any easier.</li>
            <li> Feel dry after washing face.</li>
            <li> must use a moisturizer, because your skin can become a bit dry.</li>
            <li> It cleans your skin without stripping it or leaving it dry.</li>
            <li> my skin does not feel dry after washing.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t dry my skin out one bit.</li>
            <li> I had break outs and my skin became dry</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have recently been the victim of adult acne ever since I went off birth control.</li>
            <li> Helped clear up a small cyst that I was told I would have to have surgically</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a glycolic acid toner in the past and it helped, so I decided to give up my old regimen because it was not working.  </li>
            <li> My pores are noticeably smaller and no longer dark.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry, rough and flaky now after using it</li>
            <li> We started using this product 2 months ago and there is still half a bottle left between the two of us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed, but not every skin product is suitable for every skin type.</li>
            <li> Only need a small amount, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, the recipent had this on her wish list and had used this product in the past, so apparently, she likes it.</li>
            <li> Dryness has been minimal</li>
            <li> As expected It was cheaper than the store</li>
            <li> I have had the same complaint with several other products in this line as well.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. will be using and keeping in my regimene</li>
            <li> This was a gift, so I am not sure of the actual use of the product.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> I started with the gel at night, every other night increasing to every night after a week and cleansing my face twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Some of the darker spots on my face have slightly faded, but not fine lines are any different.  </li>
            <li> If I get a breakout it used to last 2 weeks on my skin, now there usually gone in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Unlike other product that help acne (I do not believe this is targeted towards that market)</li>
            <li> I use this every other time or washing my face.</li>
            <li> Other products have resulted in some peeling after which lets me know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> It stings a bit on any broken skin or blemishes, but always leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Peter&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Roth(PTR for short) is a thick gel glycolic</li>
            <li> No amount of moisturizer seemed to remedy that either, so I stopped using this less than a week after I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have slight acne marks and a few breakouts ..</li>
            <li> I mean very tiny, not like the usual whitehead you can pop) on my forehead and chin.</li>
            <li> The BCP cleared up anything cystic and imflamed, but I NOTHING would get rid of these little clogged pores.</li>
            <li> This is just to say dont give up if you have a little IB.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> This face wash is clearing up little breakouts I was having due to the warmer weather and my excessively oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a little lower in price</li>
            <li> I added this product to my regimen a few weeks ago, using it at night along with a 10% benzoyl peroxide wash in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this, and got this a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> it cleans all makeup off and it not too harsh or drying</li>
            <li> They only made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bee using this for a little over a month and have seen very little difference.  </li>
            <li> but I do think this has helped tame the breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I still have a few small bumps</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using together and just seen very little difference.  </li>
            <li> This product did not disappoint, it cleared up the few whiteheads I had within 3 days and after 3 weeks my skin is smoother and softer!</li>
            <li> and I notice a small improvement in the complexion of my skin.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use it my complexion begins to look dull.</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what I believe after trying this product.</li>
            <li> and I use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> I went back to using it 6 months ago desperate not to be dealing with acne at my age.</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts at least six months and does wonders for a mans complexion.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m also using this slowly to help my skin adjust.</li>
            <li> My skin can be just ridiculous at times.</li>
            <li> Used the PTR chamomile facial wash, I was really disappointed with the results, as my acne flared up.</li>
            <li> It really gets every bit of makeup off which I was shocked!!</li>
            <li> and my skin was progressively getting worse.  </li>
            <li> I saw a dramatic decrease in breakouts, and breakouts cleared up faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They made my skin bumpy and it looked clear inside but TERRIBLE in sunlight because of the texture.  </li>
            <li> I hated my skin and would use makeup every single day to hide from the world.</li>
            <li> I stopped taking them 2 months ago and 1 month later my face started breaking out horribly when my period came.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try it.</li>
            <li> This product was either expired or fake.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is when I sent it back for my refund...</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily skin and still get terrible pimples at age 36 :(</li>
            <li> I was having these horrible little breakouts with tinny pimples and a lot of clogged pores that where not inflamed.</li>
            <li> Nothing terrible, just little pimples where the clogged pores used to be.</li>
            <li> I lovvvvve PTR products but found this one to be disappointing.</li>
            <li> bad for acne</li>
            <li> A week ago my period came and it was really bad</li>
            <li> It is the bad type when I get it; the cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> I am givin four stars because of two ingredients sodium chloride and sodium laureth sulfate pore-clogging ingredients :(</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m horrible at keeping my hands out of my face).</li>
            <li> I used it as directed for over a month, and all it did was make my skin INSANELY oily.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is great on my combination skin. Leaves it clean and clear. I love PTR!!</li>
            <li> This product was also introduced to me at my sister&#x27;s house.  This clear face cleaner, is gentle and leaves my face clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  The bottle was individually sealed in shrink wrap.  This was a gift, so I am not sure of the actual use of the product.  However, the recipent had this on her wish list and had used this product in the past, so apparently, she likes it.</li>
            <li> I love this product it works....</li>
            <li> without overstripping my sensitive facial skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  People don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m 40!  It is awesome.</li>
            <li> Amazing! It really gets every bit of makeup off which I was shocked!! My face feels great after. Albeit a bit dry i am happy with the cleaning results. A little goes a long way. will be using and keeping in my regimene</li>
            <li> I use it as an exfoliator and facial wash.  I use it every other day.  My skin looks amazing. Very gentle.  Only need a small amount, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product. I use it with my clairsonic</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what I believe after trying this product. I was really excited as I&#x27;ve heard from many, including the review below, about how great this exfoliant wash is. I used it for only two days and my skin erupted with thousands of tiny little white heads (and I mean very tiny, not like the usual whitehead you can pop) on my forehead and chin. My skin is extremely dry, rough and flaky now after using it and since I already have dry skin to begin with, this didn&#x27;t make it any easier. I&#x27;m really disappointed, but not every skin product is suitable for every skin type.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I am so happy with this product that I had to share my experience.  I have fairly large pores, clogging, scars and cystic acne.  I&#x27;ve used a glycolic acid toner in the past and it helped, so I decided to give up my old regimen because it was not working.  I was using salycilic acid face wash and retinol night cream and my skin was progressively getting worse.  After 3 days of using this face wash along with Reviva glycolic acid night cream my skin looks soooo much better.  Almost all of the clogging is GONE.  My cystic acne is gone, my pores look smaller, and for the first time I actually have even skin tone.  Extremely happy with this product!  I can&#x27;t even remember the last time I was able to go without foundation or concealer. The only problem is that my skin is very sensitive to sunlight now, I always wear sunblock but I&#x27;ll probably need to wear a hat for the rest of the summer as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy in my mid 30s, and unfortunately I still get acne breakouts from time to time, mostly around my hairline and on my forehead.  I added this product to my regimen a few weeks ago, using it at night along with a 10% benzoyl peroxide wash in the morning.  Since then I haven&#x27;t suffered a single new blemish, and my skin feels great and looks smoother.  I&#x27;ve never bothered to take the time to review a skin care product before, but I like this one so much I thought it deserved comment.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as murad for me, but it is a good wash.</li>
            <li> I love this wash! My skin has been so smooth since I started using it. So much so that when my parents came to visit, they noticed the difference in my skin and asked me to get it for them too! It was recommended to me by an esthetician who said that I had large pores and needed something like this to keep the skin turning over? I don&#x27;t know what that means but my skin looks great!</li>
            <li> I was having these horrible little breakouts with tinny pimples and a lot of clogged pores that where not inflamed. The BCP cleared up anything cystic and imflamed, but I NOTHING would get rid of these little clogged pores. They made my skin bumpy and it looked clear inside but TERRIBLE in sunlight because of the texture.  I tried this stuff and within a week they are 95% gone. My skin is smooth and the color is evening out. I use it once each night before bed for a minute like the bottle says. The price seems high, but the bottle is huge and lasts quite a while. I will definitly be buying this again!!  ps. One word of warning. I did have an initial breakout that lasted about 3 or 4 days. Nothing terrible, just little pimples where the clogged pores used to be. To counter this I used the Proactive refining mask, which is antibacterial, and it was fine. This is just to say dont give up if you have a little IB. Its just all the gunk in your skin coming out and it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I keep this face wash in the shower and use it several times a week. It stings a bit on any broken skin or blemishes, but always leaves my skin so soft. I bought this to get my skin used to glycolic acid so I can do some facial peels. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and can see this bottle will last me a year, maybe more. Considering that, it&#x27;s  great value as well.</li>
            <li> My skin was much softer after washing my face with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I also used on my neck to ward off any dryness.</li>
            <li> Excellent for sensitive skin that is acne prone,  it took about a week to see real results, but it has been almost 2 months and I am starting to run low and I use it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and clearer. Dryness has been minimal but I&#x27;m also using this slowly to help my skin adjust.</li>
            <li> Feel dry after washing face. I must apply toner and moisturizer immediately. Other than that, my face feels clean. It&#x27;s a big size face wash, I bet it will last for awhile</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as I&#x27;ve been told that glycolic face wash is beneficial for aging skin and PTR is the best.  I did like it and it left my skin very smooth and soft but...I am a retina user and it is not recommened to use both.  It&#x27;s stated on the back of the bottle, which I neglected to see at first.  I wish I had known this as after using it 2x a day my skin becoame red and peeled.  Now I\\&quot;m starting to use it 1x a week and that seems to be ok for now.</li>
            <li> This product did not disappoint, it cleared up the few whiteheads I had within 3 days and after 3 weeks my skin is smoother and softer!</li>
            <li> Product is great! Takes make up off completely, leaves my skin refreshed and clean.  I follow with the Acne Cleasing pads...Great products!!</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash. I have sensitive skin and use it every other day or so and it does not seem to be bothering my skin or making me peel. I have noticed a huge difference in the appearance of my pores and blackheads have more or less gone away. It was worth the price and works better than other Glycolic Acid washes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bee using this for a little over a month and have seen very little difference.  My original purchase was with the Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid 10% Hydrating Gel- I&#x27;ve been using together and just seen very little difference.  I started with the gel at night, every other night increasing to every night after a week and cleansing my face twice a day.  The only place that there is some minor discomfort is my forehead.  Some of the darker spots on my face have slightly faded, but not fine lines are any different.  :(  I do feel some tightness after cleasning my face and still feel a need for a toner.  My face looks a tad brighter.</li>
            <li> I wash my face in the morning with this product.  I like the way my skin feels after I use it and I notice a small improvement in the complexion of my skin.  I have been using it now for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling nice and clean and does a good job of removing make up.  Not tight or oily feeling like some cleaners do.  Will get this again.</li>
            <li> Order arrived as promised and in good condition. Peter&lt;br /&gt;Thomas Roth(PTR for short) is a thick gel glycolic&lt;br /&gt;concentrated foaming face wash- you don&#x27;t need alot-&lt;br /&gt;maybe a dime size or smaller to begin with!! Since I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;been using PTR going on several weeks now I have seen&lt;br /&gt;a marked improvement in the texture of skin, brigthness&lt;br /&gt;and clarity- brown and age spots are starting to become&lt;br /&gt;less noticeable-No problem with sensitivity since I have been using different types of glycolic cleansers&lt;br /&gt;over the years but if you might have sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;use 1-2 times a week to start out with. I use PTR&lt;br /&gt;cleanser using either my hands, microfiber wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;or my mia clarisonic facial brush. Am pleased with this&lt;br /&gt;product. Good Price.&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks, Amazon</li>
            <li> I absolutely love PTR products.  Though they are a little more expensive than drug store brands, they are concentrate so a dime sized amount goes a long way.  This face wash is clearing up little breakouts I was having due to the warmer weather and my excessively oily skin.  This diminishes the oil significantly which is so nice.  I use a good facial sunscreen (oil-free) by Neutrogena on a daily basis.  Great combination.</li>
            <li> I love this product. You can feel it working and it results in smoother skin immediately after use. It does not dry out my skin at all. My skin feels very clean and fresh after use.</li>
            <li> Used the PTR chamomile facial wash, I was really disappointed with the results, as my acne flared up. I am back to using the glycolic acid and after two days my skin is already clearing up. I am happy again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as long as I use moisturizer. Helped clear up a small cyst that I was told I would have to have surgically removed.&lt;br /&gt;It really cleared up my 17 year old daughters face as well. We tried everything and this is the only thing that has made a difference. She said it dries her skin out so she only uses it twice a week now with moisturizer and her skin is clear and not dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will trying something a little stronger now as I am older and need a bit more help. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to use a tiny bit. We started using this product 2 months ago and there is still half a bottle left between the two of us. Great for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and oily skin, no acne but blackheads,  and this product is amazing, just after few days I can see great results; my pores are smaller and not so many blackheads , I use water based fondations (cream based Laura mercier and Olay 7 in 1 moisturizer ... I just changed my skin make up and routine. I am givin four stars because of two ingredients sodium chloride and sodium laureth sulfate pore-clogging ingredients :( bad for acne</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like this product, it make me allergy!!! i don&#x27;t know why!! it just make me diaspointed!! i will never buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> Start using it already, face does not dry after washing. but I can&#x27;t see any change of my skin. may not buy it again</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this face wash, but unfortunately it was too harsh for my ultra-sensitive skin (related sidebar: lupus sucks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wash generated a lot of redness and inflammation for me. I&#x27;ve had better luck with periodically using a glycolic or lactic acid mask/peel (once every 1-2 weeks) rather than incorporating glycolic acid into my day-to-day routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good skin for most of my life but over the past two years my skin has done a complete 360. The texture of my skin changed and I was getting so much acne. I tried many products hoping to get clear even skin and was not lucky. I hated my skin and would use makeup every single day to hide from the world. I decided to try this cleanser because of all the good reviews and thankfully I&#x27;ve seen results. It was not an overnight change so don&#x27;t expect miracles to suddenly appear. I&#x27;ve been using it for a bout a month already and notice a big difference. I still have some acne but it&#x27;s nowhere near what it used to be. If I get a breakout it used to last 2 weeks on my skin, now there usually gone in 2 days. My skin is also brighter and becoming even which I love. The product is a bit drying but as long as you use a good moisturizer you will be fine.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, smooth transaction. I would purchase again and would recommend. Also the item was just as described online.</li>
            <li> this product is great for someone who has breakout, white head blackheads, pimples. one should use a little on there face, rub into the face, leave on for 30 secs or more. rinse. in 3 days u see a difference. must use a moisturizer, because your skin can become a bit dry. its highly recommended......... my skin looks awesome :}</li>
            <li> Been using the product for years.  It is really a great once-a-week chemical exfoliant.  The bottle last a very long time.  I highly recommend it.  Wash for one minute, or leave on for 10 minutes.  It really keeps that top layer of dead skin removed so that you don&#x27;t get black heads and dull looking skin.  Even turned my husband on to it.  He loves it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman in my early 30s and I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since I started getting my period.  The only thing that keeps my face clear is birth control pills.  I stopped taking them 2 months ago and 1 month later my face started breaking out horribly when my period came. A week ago my period came and it was really bad I had a lot bumps, spots and scabs (I&#x27;m horrible at keeping my hands out of my face). I started using this wash last week, twice a day and I leave it on for about 5 minutes each time before I wash it off.  And I kid you not, within 3 days I started seeing improvement in my spots.  Even my boyfriend took notice.  I did a side by side photo comparison of my face from the beginning of the week to the end of the week and the difference is night and day.  I still have a few small bumps so I don&#x27;t think this alone will control your acne, but it&#x27;s exfoliating properties really helped my dark spots.  Once my face gets clearer I plan to reduce this to once per day and eventually to a few times per week as it makes your skin sensitive, especially if you go in the sun a lot.  I used this product along with Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel toner and I moisturize with Cetaphil moisturizer 30 spf.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of this wash as it&#x27;s pretty thick so I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last me a while.</li>
            <li> Heard great things about this product.  Use it twice daily with my Clarisonic and it does a great job cleansing my skin.  Haven&#x27;t noticed a tightening of my skin (I&#x27;m 63), but I do like the way my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended I use something with Glycolic acid.  So I gave this a try instead of paying a fortune at her office.  I am soooo pleased!  My pores are noticeably smaller and no longer dark.  My skin is clean and fresh, and my breakouts and cystic acne is completely nonexistent. Haven&#x27;t had a flare up in months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle lasts a long time.  I bought this bottle in mid June and still have about 1/3 of the bottle left (I use it every night)-it&#x27;s September currently.  So I won&#x27;t need to reorder until sometime in October. I will definitely be reordering!!!</li>
            <li> Love Peter Thomas Roth</li>
            <li> This face wash has done wonders for my skin. I no longer peel and my skin feels more even. I think it helps my products work better but that could just be me.</li>
            <li> Great price and service!</li>
            <li> Amazon is not authorized to sell Peter Thomas Roth products, but I think this is a genuine bottle of the face wash.</li>
            <li> I purchased because of all the good reviews. It seems to work good and isn&#x27;t over drying as some reviews stated. Supposed to work well as anti aging wash. I&#x27;m 33 so I can&#x27;t tell yet but I will continue to use. Seems to last long and face does feel clean and nice glow afterwards.</li>
            <li> not irritating to skin at all, rinses off easily, excellent product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Had to give it to my sister, my face was very irritated by it.</li>
            <li> Wow...I noticed a difference right away.  I was skeptical to try it. My face feels clean and clear. I actually saw improvement in my skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel or see any impact. Skin is clean though.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne-prone skin that is also very sensitive. This wash helped clear my face within a few weeks. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use once a day.</li>
            <li> My go to cleanser. I love any peter thomas roth item but this wash is my fave! I dont think this would be for sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> I lovvvvve PTR products but found this one to be disappointing. I think the % of glycolic acid was just too low to make a significant difference on my skin. I used it as directed for over a month, and all it did was make my skin INSANELY oily. Didn&#x27;t help w breakouts, but did make my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I ready like  the Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic acid wash.  It clean the face and leaves it very soft. Product came earlier then said it would.</li>
            <li> Gentle, non drying but effective.</li>
            <li> This wash foams really nicely, so you only need to use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, and got this a few days ago.  I have to say at first blush it&#x27;s pretty great.  I am 48 and have always had good skin.  However, the signs of age, have begun to creep up.  I looked at Amazon, and looked at products based on the ratings.  This brand got excellent ratings and I thought I would take a chance, although I had never heard of it.  First of all, the product got here quickly.  Secondly, it is a huge bottle, and will last a very long time and when you smell it, it smell clean not mediciney.  The first time I tried it there was a bit of a tingle, and especially so when used with the moisturizer I bought at the same time.  My skin felt smooth, and clean, and there is no odor - it just smells clean.  Today was the 3rd day and when I looked in the mirror my skin was glowing and shiny (which is a good thing when you have dry skin like me!)  I would and am recommending this to my friends.</li>
            <li> favorite product for washing face. it cleans all makeup off and it not too harsh or drying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a week and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference. The redness is going away, my face is getting smoother with better tone. I&#x27;m not as blotchy. I imagine my skin will continue to improve, this is just the beginning! I started out using twice a day, morning &amp; night. I too was doing the salcylic acid routine and even asked my dermatologist what I can do about the acne and redness (I&#x27;m 34, don&#x27;t want to deal with acne anymore) &amp; she prescribed Clindamycin. Her recommended routine was wash with the Salcylic Acid, use toner with salcylic acid, put on Clindamycin gel, then oil free sunscreen. Ugh, my face was being bombarded with product! How could it not react?? I saw PTR wash in a Bride&#x27;s magazine (getting married!) and decided to give it a shot. Very pleased...a little truely does go a long way so the size of the bottle will last some time. It&#x27;s like buying 2 or 3 off the store shelf, it&#x27;ll add up and equal the price of this. It&#x27;s worth it! And if you don&#x27;t like it I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this facial wash a couple months before my wedding to make sure I had a nice clear complexion.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it since!  My face stays clear, and I stay happy!</li>
            <li> One the few good cleaners on the market. Cleans well without over drying. The glycolic acid is a plus for acne prone skin. The bottle will last you for months and months to come. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I struggled with acne for nearly two decades and have spent thousands of dollars on treatments and products. My esthetician recommended I start using PTR glycolic products and I&#x27;m happy to say that using this cleanser day and night (wash twice at night, first with hands only, second time with Clairsonic Mia), followed by the PTR glycolic hydrating gel, my skin has been completely clear for over a year!  While I strongly prefer to use all natural products on my skin, none of them ever worked for me. They only made my skin worse. I&#x27;m happy I found something that blends the best of science and nature to support combination, sensitive, acne-prone skin to stay clear. Thank God for this product!</li>
            <li> This product was either expired or fake.  It came with a very distinct yellow color.  I have bought this product many times and it is always clear.  The worst part is when I sent it back for my refund...I didn&#x27;t get my refund.</li>
            <li> This glycolic acid cleaner is effective and I believe I will continue to purchase it.  Don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with since this is the first acid-based cleaner I&#x27;ve purchased. Even though the instructions say to clean gently with fingers, I use a microfiber washcloth to get more exfolation and then I follow it with a good retinol solution before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have had cystic/nodular acne since I was 13 years old.  This wash has helped to reduce the number of breakouts and helps heal them quickly.  I still have oily skin, so I have no trouble with dryness.  I will now try some of Roth&#x27;s other products, as I am impressed that just a &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; has such an effect.</li>
            <li> I am now a Lover of all PTR facial products! I have slight acne marks and a few breakouts .. I was looking online and ran across a blogger who had sistic acne and strongly recommended his acne wash... The acne wash did wonders !!! I recommend it if you have breakouts .. In one night my breakouts were gone!!! No lie!!! The glycolic wash leaves my skin radiant and bright its unbelieveable !! I recommend using the glycolic wash 2-3 times a week to see if it dries your skin .. But you will see a major difference ! Love it!</li>
            <li> 50+ and my skin is still an issue.  I used PTR decades ago and forgot about it. I went back to using it 6 months ago desperate not to be dealing with acne at my age. It cleans your skin without stripping it or leaving it dry. I am glad I maid the change. Won&#x27;t be changing it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It feels great on my skin and washes off easily. It even takes off mascara. Love this all in one.</li>
            <li> Favorite face wash! Wish it was a little lower in price but I have been using for a couple of years now and I love.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this facial wash. I have seen a great improvement in my skin. I will purchase again, this will be a staple item for me!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this stuff for about a year now and loves it.  She tried all sorts of different active ingredients to tackle adult acne and finally had someone tell her that glycolic acid was a good way to go.  This particular brand is a great consistency and doesn&#x27;t dry you out too much.  She says she had to start with once a day to make sure she didn&#x27;t have a reaction, but now uses it twice!</li>
            <li> This is one of my go-to face cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get two benefits from using products with glycolic acid:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Increased cell production (chemical exfoliation)&lt;br /&gt;2) Decrease in acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Helps with the signs of aging.  Any women over the 35 cares about that.  I&#x27;m 50.  I definitely care.  I have been using this product for 3+ years as part of my skin regime and I believe it has help keep my skin looking younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Even at 50-years-old I suffer from adult acne.  It is the bad type when I get it; the cystic acne.  Ever since I have been using as part of my regime (it was the first thing I changed 3+ years ago) I saw a dramatic decrease in breakouts, and breakouts cleared up faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash creates a nice foam and my face feel really clean.  Unlike other product that help acne (I do not believe this is targeted towards that market) my skin does not feel dry after washing.  It feels smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all my friends and my daughter uses it regularly as well.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling smooth, soft, and clean.  I am in my mid-30s with semi-sensitive acne-prone dehydrated skin.  This is a very good product and the bottle is huge and will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and the glycolic acid is the only thing that keeps acne away. I have VERY oily skin and still get terrible pimples at age 36 :( love this stuff and the moisturizer. I only use once a day because it can make your skin sensitive.</li>
            <li> I use this every other time or washing my face. It can be too drying otherwise, then I use the gentle foaming wash they make. Excellent cleansing and detoxifying feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  It is gentle yet effective on my skin.  The smell isn&#x27;t so great but that&#x27;s not why I bought it either.</li>
            <li> My skin can be just ridiculous at times. So I decided to try this after seeing some reviews elsewhere. You will definitely need an oil free moisturizer with a suncreen. I use this once a day. At night I use a mild face wash by neutrogena followed by Obagi Clear. I have post acne scars with hyperpigmentation. If you don&#x27;t use a moisturizer your face is going to feel really tight and make more oil as a result. You don&#x27;t want that. My face already feels a lot softer.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I use it at night and it works perfectly while I sleep. I wake up in the mornings and my face looks 100% better.</li>
            <li> This is great!!  Yesterday 2 different people told me my face was glowing and that my skin looked fantastic!  2 girlfriends at different times.  The only thing I had changed in my facial routine was adding this face wash about 2 weeks ago.  And I don&#x27;t wear foundation or concealer- This new face wash is most likely the reason my facial skin looks more even toned, blemish free and &#x27;glowing&#x27;.  I will definitely purchase more and maybe try some other Peter Thomas Roth products.  I am almost 49, and if this face wash has helped my aging skin, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I have combination acne prone skin, and I use this with a Buff Puff sponge and it leaves my skin feeling very clean.  I still get pimples but I do think this has helped tame the breakouts.  This product is not too drying either.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this stuff works amazingly. I&#x27;ve even gotten comments on how clear my skin looks. It does dry you out a little, but it&#x27;s ok for me because I have oilier skin. Best to use it with a ProX brush or some kind of brush. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> works as it says and more, Cleans thoroughly  and yet gentle to skin. Safe for teenagers too and only bit is needed each time of usage</li>
            <li> Im 38 and Have tried so many products over the years, but this one is so far the most efective and fastest  result that I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended !!!</li>
            <li> Just like in the store but cheaper! Love this product</li>
            <li> This face wash left my skin very dry and itchy. My teenage daughter then tried it and same thing. Husband tried it and he&#x27;s stuck to using it, but nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> I have previously used Mario Badescu and feel like it has given me better results. This product severely irritated my eyes, you really have to be cautious about rinsing it off your face. Other products have resulted in some peeling after which lets me know it&#x27;s working. Have not had any peeling with this product yet.</li>
            <li> i love this product!&lt;br /&gt;its perfect to use when the skin is congesting and becoming dull, over use will cause keratosis or hyper pigmentation around the mouth area. Keep it away from corner of eyes also for the same reason. I tends to break you out in first couple of day of use but as ur skin gets used to it will tingle less and work better as your skin gets even over time.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser sooo much!!  I needed something to help clear congested pores, and this really helps.  Didn&#x27;t dry my skin out one bit. Leaves it soft, and normal.  My pores always look so much better after washing.  I apply the cleanser all over, then either use washcloth or clarisonic, and spend some time to be thorough.  Rinse really, really well, and I am very pleased.  I love his peel pads as well.  Now, I&#x27;m looking into a night cream, and new 3% retinol...and whatever else fits my need.</li>
            <li> this is the best mens face wash I have found anywhere. It makes your skin smooth and feel healthy. A bottle lasts at least six months and does wonders for a mans complexion.</li>
            <li> Love this product,I will not used any other face wash</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have recently been the victim of adult acne ever since I went off birth control. This wash gets my face super clean and gently exfoliates without turning red from irritation. This, coupled with Clinique Dramatically Different moisturizing gel keeps my skin soft and keeps my acne pretty much under control. If I feel I need a little more moisture, I use the PTR Glycolic moisturizer. This has been the best product I&#x27;ve found for my adult acne (I&#x27;ve tried proactiv, cetaphil, Clinique, everything you can imagine, HUNDREDS of dollars spent on acne treatments that just didn&#x27;t work), and I absolutely love it. It makes a great body wash too!&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is more prone to drying, I would recommend using only once per day until you are used to it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! You use so little of it when washing your face beacause it foams very well, so it lasts a long time! Leaves face feeling clean and exfoliated!</li>
            <li> Nothing to rave about. It was just okay in my opinion in comparison to other similar washes.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  Very rich lather.  I use it every other day since i have sensitive skin and use retinol gel for acne.  Def helps.</li>
            <li> I honestly love this product, It cleans deep down and gets rid of all the blackheads too.</li>
            <li> It did not work well on my skin.. I had break outs and my skin became dry i would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower several times a week and it keeps my skin smooth and glowing. If I don&#x27;t use it my complexion begins to look dull.</li>
            <li> This is NOT for maturing skin. Heck, I&#x27;m only 39 with combination skin, and this left me parched. No amount of moisturizer seemed to remedy that either, so I stopped using this less than a week after I bought it.</li>
            <li> As expected It was cheaper than the store and it&#x27;s exactly the same thing ! I&#x27;ll get more from you when mine ends</li>
            <li> My gauge of a good product always boils down to having a reaction to it. Good to know that this glycolic acid wash, I have none whatsoever, I didn&#x27;t break out or had rashes. Right after washing, you&#x27;ll face feels fresh and tingly, a little bit taut from scrubbing. I also like that it does not have a strong perfume smell to it as does usually irritates my sensitive skin. The only suggestion I have is to have a good moisturizer after using this coz it dries your skin otherwise and you will feel it the next day. You will see your skin peel without a good moisturizer to counter it  also you must use a strong  sun block to protect your skin during day time. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is that for the size,  it is a little bit on the pricy end for a facial wash.</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth has good quality products that are cosmeceutical over cosmetic so you get the true long term benefits deep down in your skin rather than over the counter products that are more surface based.  I have used glycolic cleansers for over 8 years and they are fabulous for deep cleaning and not drying you out. The long term benefits to your skin are amazing.  This particular cleanser in the gel form was too drying for my skin.  I have combination skin but it can get more on the dryer side as we head into winter.  I have much better luck with the cream version of glycolic cleansers.  I think this gel based glycolic cleanser by Peter Thomas Roth may be better suited for oily skin or a man since typically they have tougher skin..... Well I am sure not all men.  Anyway, my brother really likes this cleanser and says it sure beats the heck out of his over the counter Nivea for Men, LOL.  My brother is in his 40&#x27;s and his female friends are all raving over his skin now.</li>
            <li> If you have rosacea, don&#x27;t use this or only use it infrequently.  It will cause a flare-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have rosacea, it&#x27;s great for everything from oily days to normal days.  It never dries out my skin and, most importantly, it is the best facial wash I&#x27;ve ever used for reducing pores.  I have fairly large pores on my nose and I&#x27;ve never had anything that diminished their appearance like this wash.  Do they magically disappear and give me flawless skin?  No, of course not.  Nothing will.  But they&#x27;ve caused enough of a difference that my partner and friends have actually commented about how different my skin looks.  That&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for months now and can&#x27;t honestly say I am pleased with the results.  For the price I expected more and won&#x27;t be reordering in the future.  I have had the same complaint with several other products in this line as well.  Other brands work better and at least you get what you pay for.</li>
