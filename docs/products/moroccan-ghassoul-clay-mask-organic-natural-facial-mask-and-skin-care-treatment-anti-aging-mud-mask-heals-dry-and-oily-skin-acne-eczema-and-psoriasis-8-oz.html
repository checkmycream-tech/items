            <li>/&gt;So, for the scores, I will give the product itself 5 out of 5, but I think the company for its packaging and presentation of the product will get a 4 – I wish there was a seal, and the product would be pre-mixed to be able to use it faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for that clean smooth feeling</li>
            <li>It was super easy to mix up.</li>
            <li>Anything that comes from Morocco, made from Moroccan natural soil, plants or clay found there must be of exceptional quality.</li>
            <li>The clay is rich in minerals that help with skin’s circulation, texture to cleansing but without pulling moisture.</li>
            <li>Ghassoul clay is rich in minerals, and works to detoxify and tone your skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin looked and felt so clean after this.</li>
            <li>very unpolluted, unadulterated mix that will provide you a peace of mind that you are using something that you can be sure will not make your skin react or make you absorb chemicals you don’t want.</li>
            <li>I could use this one product to help my skin’s needs and to suit my “going on right now” issues like a blemish on my nose!  </li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling fresh, smooth, and clean.  </li>
            <li>I was surprise, delighted, overwhelmed and take back to get these results at home.</li>
            <li>but I do plan on buying it very soon :)</li>
            <li>I liked now natural it</li>
            <li>Then, I added too much powder, so I needed more water.</li>
            <li>I left it on a good 20 - 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I am very happy to ditch some of the products that I usually buy for my hair for this all-natural clay mask!</li>
            <li>I am very happy to ditch some of the products that I usually buy for my hair for this all-natural clay mask!</li>
            <li>I have done a lot to make my face that more youthful glow and feeling of being soft, smooth, and youthful all in one is here.</li>
            <li>One way is to do it quickly, just mixing with your shampoo on the palm of your hand, just before applying the mask.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, after just one use I saw a huge improvement!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling firm and gives your skin a nice smooth surface for adding your favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>What makes this mud mask unique is not that it&#x27;s a powder, which allows you to create your own individual masks but that it can also be used as soap, skin conditioner, shampoo, and as a body mask.  </li>
            <li>I ended up adding a bit more shampoo as I thought the consistency was a bit too lumpy at first because I put too much clay powder.</li>
            <li>I think the hair mask worked, and it was quite easy to use really.</li>

            <li>At first I added too much water, so I needed to add more powder.</li>
            <li>The Moroccan Ghassoul Clay Mask is an amazing weekly mask made from organic clay found deep within the Ancient Atlas Mountains of Morocco.  </li>
            <li>Worth buying to have a spa day at home.</li>
            <li>You rarely find the clay in powder form</li>
            <li>I make my own and buy them for different ailments.</li>
            <li>It is actually quite great, because it can be used as a mask for hair, as a facial mask, or a full body mask.</li>
            <li>not dry but more moisture to them</li>
            <li>I would appreciate to be able to avoid having to go through this extra step of mixing, and be able to just open my container with the mask, and be able to apply it directly on the skin, without have to first mix it with something.</li>

            <li>However, Zakias Morocco included an instructional sheet with their product and it made me aware of two things.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely try to use this product more for masks on my face, and on my body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely try to use this product more for masks on my face, and on my body.</li>
            <li>I adore this form of application because I don’t have to worry about the product drying out and I can add it to other ingredients and make my own customized mask.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to banish acne!!  </li>
            <li>skin was soft and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>When a product is based on something coming from clean natural environment, you can rest assured that what you will be using does not have any chemicals that would harm you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was able to use the clay to make my own facial masks to even giving my hands a little rejuvenation treatment.</li>
            <li>the pure product alone will always beat any (all salt) mix that is advertised as an all-in-one product.</li>
            <li>After washing, very silky</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>I received the above product(s) free of charge from Zakia’s Morocco.  </li>
            <li>I received the above product(s) free of charge from Zakia’s Morocco.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;But this product really lacks instructions.</li>
            <li>It is not indicated how much water is needed to mix with the powder.</li>
            <li>This is a country that I have never visited, and I haven’t really heard much about it.</li>
            <li>This clay is very versatile.</li>
            <li>This is what women of Morocco have used for probably thousands of years before modern chemical based cosmetics were invented.</li>
            <li>The jar doesn’t tell you how much to make, so I had to experiment.</li>
            <li>do wish the product told you how much liquid to add (ie.</li>
            <li>this is a must purchase, Thanks Zakia&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Just, this is something expected from most products, and this particular product did not have this</li>
            <li>After rinsing it off, I was completely red, like a sunburn (but not painful).</li>
            <li>It was really easy to wash off (much easier than any other mask I’ve used).</li>
            <li>The clay actually encourages moisture to build and this is why you see it in many facial masks.</li>
            <li>So, that’s just my main issue – my two cents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only seven more days left for this giveaway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Only seven more days left for this giveaway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This extra step requires me to get a spoon, a bowl, have my water ready, and this is just not practical for me right now with my time constraints.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s gentle to my sensitive acne prone face.</li>
            <li>I really like that natural earthy</li>
            <li>or so then I do right back to being drier than before.</li>
            <li>It was definitely a new product that I got.</li>
            <li>and I always like how gentle it is at removing dead skin cells to build-up, and it’s irritation free.</li>
            <li>particular mask is made of organic natural clay from the Ancient Atlas Mountains of Morocco.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package, the clay looked very much like what you would expect clay from Morocco look like – the color was the color of brown wood mixed with sand.</li>
            <li>First, in order to have multiple purposes, it needs to be in powder form.</li>
            <li>I’m pretty amazed by the almost instant results.</li>
            <li>You can actually see the differents after the first use.</li>
            <li>They also carry products like Argan Oil, black soap, and they have free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I reapply get the same results but this time I did my whole body and waited around 30 minutes</li>
            <li>and I WAS SURPRISED on the results.</li>
            <li>Acts as a mask and natural exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the result.</li>
            <li>My skin after the mask came off was so soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>and that was a relief because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have so far used it as a hair mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This mask retails for $10.99 on Amazon, so I highly recommend purchasing it now before it goes back up in price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>me, now that I have a small baby, my two blogs, a huge house to take care of, I really have to consider the time I spend in the shower, so every second is valuable, and I have to do things as quickly as I possibly can.</li>
            <li>Finally had a nice, creamy (yet thin) paste that I could apply to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, I think for our crazy modern world of not churning your own butter, buying pre-made and pre-cooked bread, using microwave to reheat and cook, we would be looking at some customers not satisfied as they have to go that extra step to have the product ready with the mixing and the dissolving.</li>

            <li>I even tested it out on my hair by mixing a little in my normal shampoo and it really helped remove all the residual residue from all the hair products that I use so now</li>
            <li>I rubbed the shampoo with the clay powder together until the clay mixed completely with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have trouble getting the right combination of water and powder and feel like I am wasting product.</li>
            <li>My skin felt very soft and the bumps had really improved (less noticeable and smaller).</li>
            <li>This mask has a very strong effect, when  you apply product first it gives a little tightening and tingling but don&#x27;t afraid there is no harsh even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The clay powder is not limited to the face, but you can spot treat blemishes to even areas of the body.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this one,it cleans pores,refreshes and makes my skin breath again but does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>and now I can barely see any of those tiny bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li>Being able to add other ingredients like oils to boost up the moisture for hands and feet (I even added a little to an avocado to produce a mask) is not something that can be done with other products.  </li>
            <li>I had far less redness on my skin and my face felt incredibly soft.</li>

            <li> /&gt;So, for the scores, I will give the product itself 5 out of 5, but I think the company for its packaging and presentation of the product will get a 4 – I wish there was a seal, and the product would be pre-mixed to be able to use it faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for that clean smooth feeling</li>
            <li> It was super easy to mix up.</li>
            <li> Anything that comes from Morocco, made from Moroccan natural soil, plants or clay found there must be of exceptional quality.</li>
            <li> The clay is rich in minerals that help with skin’s circulation, texture to cleansing but without pulling moisture.</li>
            <li> Ghassoul clay is rich in minerals, and works to detoxify and tone your skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin looked and felt so clean after this.</li>
            <li> very unpolluted, unadulterated mix that will provide you a peace of mind that you are using something that you can be sure will not make your skin react or make you absorb chemicals you don’t want.</li>
            <li> I could use this one product to help my skin’s needs and to suit my “going on right now” issues like a blemish on my nose!  </li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling fresh, smooth, and clean.  </li>
            <li> I was surprise, delighted, overwhelmed and take back to get these results at home.</li>
            <li> but I do plan on buying it very soon :)</li>
            <li> I liked now natural it</li>
            <li> Then, I added too much powder, so I needed more water.</li>
            <li> I left it on a good 20 - 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to ditch some of the products that I usually buy for my hair for this all-natural clay mask!</li>
            <li> I am very happy to ditch some of the products that I usually buy for my hair for this all-natural clay mask!</li>
            <li> I have done a lot to make my face that more youthful glow and feeling of being soft, smooth, and youthful all in one is here.</li>
            <li> One way is to do it quickly, just mixing with your shampoo on the palm of your hand, just before applying the mask.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, after just one use I saw a huge improvement!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling firm and gives your skin a nice smooth surface for adding your favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> What makes this mud mask unique is not that it&#x27;s a powder, which allows you to create your own individual masks but that it can also be used as soap, skin conditioner, shampoo, and as a body mask.  </li>
            <li> I ended up adding a bit more shampoo as I thought the consistency was a bit too lumpy at first because I put too much clay powder.</li>
            <li> I think the hair mask worked, and it was quite easy to use really.</li>

            <li> At first I added too much water, so I needed to add more powder.</li>
            <li> The Moroccan Ghassoul Clay Mask is an amazing weekly mask made from organic clay found deep within the Ancient Atlas Mountains of Morocco.  </li>
            <li> Worth buying to have a spa day at home.</li>
            <li> You rarely find the clay in powder form</li>
            <li> I make my own and buy them for different ailments.</li>
            <li> It is actually quite great, because it can be used as a mask for hair, as a facial mask, or a full body mask.</li>
            <li> not dry but more moisture to them</li>
            <li> I would appreciate to be able to avoid having to go through this extra step of mixing, and be able to just open my container with the mask, and be able to apply it directly on the skin, without have to first mix it with something.</li>

            <li> However, Zakias Morocco included an instructional sheet with their product and it made me aware of two things.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely try to use this product more for masks on my face, and on my body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely try to use this product more for masks on my face, and on my body.</li>
            <li> I adore this form of application because I don’t have to worry about the product drying out and I can add it to other ingredients and make my own customized mask.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to banish acne!!  </li>
            <li> skin was soft and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> When a product is based on something coming from clean natural environment, you can rest assured that what you will be using does not have any chemicals that would harm you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was able to use the clay to make my own facial masks to even giving my hands a little rejuvenation treatment.</li>
            <li> the pure product alone will always beat any (all salt) mix that is advertised as an all-in-one product.</li>
            <li> After washing, very silky</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> I received the above product(s) free of charge from Zakia’s Morocco.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;But this product really lacks instructions.</li>
            <li> It is not indicated how much water is needed to mix with the powder.</li>
            <li> This is a country that I have never visited, and I haven’t really heard much about it.</li>
            <li> This clay is very versatile.</li>
            <li> This is what women of Morocco have used for probably thousands of years before modern chemical based cosmetics were invented.</li>
            <li> The jar doesn’t tell you how much to make, so I had to experiment.</li>
            <li> do wish the product told you how much liquid to add (ie.</li>
            <li> this is a must purchase, Thanks Zakia&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Just, this is something expected from most products, and this particular product did not have this</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off, I was completely red, like a sunburn (but not painful).</li>
            <li> It was really easy to wash off (much easier than any other mask I’ve used).</li>
            <li> The clay actually encourages moisture to build and this is why you see it in many facial masks.</li>
            <li> So, that’s just my main issue – my two cents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only seven more days left for this giveaway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This extra step requires me to get a spoon, a bowl, have my water ready, and this is just not practical for me right now with my time constraints.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s gentle to my sensitive acne prone face.</li>
            <li> I really like that natural earthy</li>
            <li> or so then I do right back to being drier than before.</li>
            <li> It was definitely a new product that I got.</li>
            <li> and I always like how gentle it is at removing dead skin cells to build-up, and it’s irritation free.</li>
            <li> particular mask is made of organic natural clay from the Ancient Atlas Mountains of Morocco.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package, the clay looked very much like what you would expect clay from Morocco look like – the color was the color of brown wood mixed with sand.</li>
            <li> First, in order to have multiple purposes, it needs to be in powder form.</li>
            <li> I’m pretty amazed by the almost instant results.</li>
            <li> You can actually see the differents after the first use.</li>
            <li> They also carry products like Argan Oil, black soap, and they have free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I reapply get the same results but this time I did my whole body and waited around 30 minutes</li>
            <li> and I WAS SURPRISED on the results.</li>
            <li> Acts as a mask and natural exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the result.</li>
            <li> My skin after the mask came off was so soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> and that was a relief because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have so far used it as a hair mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural clay is</li>
            <li> I am not sure how fresh the product is really.</li>

            <li> This mask retails for $10.99 on Amazon, so I highly recommend purchasing it now before it goes back up in price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> me, now that I have a small baby, my two blogs, a huge house to take care of, I really have to consider the time I spend in the shower, so every second is valuable, and I have to do things as quickly as I possibly can.</li>
            <li> Finally had a nice, creamy (yet thin) paste that I could apply to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, I think for our crazy modern world of not churning your own butter, buying pre-made and pre-cooked bread, using microwave to reheat and cook, we would be looking at some customers not satisfied as they have to go that extra step to have the product ready with the mixing and the dissolving.</li>

            <li> I even tested it out on my hair by mixing a little in my normal shampoo and it really helped remove all the residual residue from all the hair products that I use so now</li>
            <li> I rubbed the shampoo with the clay powder together until the clay mixed completely with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting the right combination of water and powder and feel like I am wasting product.</li>
            <li> My skin felt very soft and the bumps had really improved (less noticeable and smaller).</li>
            <li> This mask has a very strong effect, when  you apply product first it gives a little tightening and tingling but don&#x27;t afraid there is no harsh even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The clay powder is not limited to the face, but you can spot treat blemishes to even areas of the body.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this one,it cleans pores,refreshes and makes my skin breath again but does not dry it out.</li>
            <li> and now I can barely see any of those tiny bumps on my skin.</li>
            <li> Being able to add other ingredients like oils to boost up the moisture for hands and feet (I even added a little to an avocado to produce a mask) is not something that can be done with other products.  </li>
            <li> I had far less redness on my skin and my face felt incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> It dried pretty quickly too (around 10 minutes for entire face to dry with a THIN layer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> People live quite simply, there isn’t too much heavy production going on, the nature is quite unpolluted.</li>
            <li> So, I have decided to make the mask quick in the shower, and I just put a splash of shampoo, and then added approximately the same amount of the clay powder.</li>
            <li> It took 10-15 min to dry and my skin wasn&#x27;t red after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And this mask is very affordable (compared to some other little packs of products out there</li>
            <li> And this mask is very affordable (compared to some other little packs of products out there</li>
            <li> You can also treat your hair by making a loose putty consistency and it will help you regain luster back and also re-balance your scalps health.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing after use is definitely a must, though, otherwise skin will dry out!  </li>
            <li> Just remember not to leave it on too long after it dries.</li>
            <li> jar doesn’t say how long to leave on the mask.</li>
            <li> It tends to dry out blemishes and make them disappear faster.  </li>
            <li> It took 30-45 min to dry.</li>
            <li> Then you can let it dry.</li>
            <li> all dry feeling regardless of what I do it only last for a few hours</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in my knees, elbows and heals of my feet</li>
            <li> On the plus side though, since I did have to keep adding in water and powder, I ended up making enough of the mask for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lately, I’ve been having some type of keratosis pilaris on my face due to allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, my portion of clay powder was a bit too much, and I made a bit of a mess in the shower.</li>
            <li> I noticed less acne after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> little at a time....</li>
            <li> I poured out about two tablespoons then used distilled water pouring a little at a time then mixing with my fan brush</li>
            <li> You are basically shaving your face with a little pressure.</li>
            <li> Dermaplaning removes dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use the mask, you simply apply a THIN layer to your face and/or body (if you’d like).</li>
            <li> I am not going to lie, I have not liked loose powder products in the past.</li>
            <li> It is not indicated how long you should let the mask set, just until dry.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it , I made a thick paste, and put a thick layer on my face and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Usually I feel some sort of tingling.</li>
            <li> Then I applied the mix as I usually do my shampoo, and rinsed it off.</li>
            <li> I usually use washcloth to remove the mask off as it can be hard to wash off just using water.</li>
            <li> When you apply the healing clay start and does not just stop there it goes on and on for days at least on my skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say about this product.</li>
            <li> it will be something I do at least once a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair after this mask felt like it usually feels after I use expensive shampoo on my hair.</li>
            <li> until you get thin consistency</li>
            <li> I use the thin, fan like make-up brush.</li>
            <li> , I put a thin layer (transparent layer) on my face and shoulders.</li>
            <li> When I was done, I rinsed with cold water to close my pores and then applied my face serum and moisturizer as usual.</li>

            <li> After washing, very silky</li>
            <li> I AM A BLIEVER in the Moroccan Ghassoul clay mask OMG (Oh My GOODNESS) and it is truly goodness that you skin gets. I have done a lot to make my face that more youthful glow and feeling of being soft, smooth, and youthful all in one is here. When you apply the healing clay start and does not just stop there it goes on and on for days at least on my skin. I have very dry skin in my knees, elbows and heals of my feet all dry feeling regardless of what I do it only last for a few hours or so then I do right back to being drier than before. I reapply get the same results but this time I did my whole body and waited around 30 minutes then wash off my body from shoulders to toes and I WAS SURPRISED on the results. My thighs felt as if I had a SPA treatment and heals look like they did 10 years ago not dry but more moisture to them I was surprise, delighted, overwhelmed and take back to get these results at home. My skin feels like I had an all day spa treatment done away from home. I cannot say more than this about this wonderful product and the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moroccan Ghassoul gave me this product for review.</li>
            <li> Smooth, silky, and makes your skin feel fantastic! Worth buying to have a spa day at home.</li>
            <li> This is the best clay mask I&#x27;ve ever used. I also wrote about it, you can read (but it&#x27;s written Turkish:()  http://ozgete.blogspot.com.tr/2015/01/zakias-ghassoul-kil-maskesi-zakias.html This mask has a very strong effect, when  you apply product first it gives a little tightening and tingling but don&#x27;t afraid there is no harsh even on sensitive skin. It worked very well.</li>
            <li> Zakia’s Morocco, Moroccan Ghassoul Clay Powder-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Atlas Mountain produces a clay that you have probably heard of called Ghassoul or Rhassoul. The clay is rich in minerals that help with skin’s circulation, texture to cleansing but without pulling moisture. The clay actually encourages moisture to build and this is why you see it in many facial masks. The Ghassoul Clay from Zakia’s Morocco, comes in powder form, which I love. I adore this form of application because I don’t have to worry about the product drying out and I can add it to other ingredients and make my own customized mask. The clay powder is not limited to the face, but you can spot treat blemishes to even areas of the body. Ghassoul Clay helps rejuvenate the skin and I always like how gentle it is at removing dead skin cells to build-up, and it’s irritation free. You can also treat your hair by making a loose putty consistency and it will help you regain luster back and also re-balance your scalps health. Things like an over-dry scalp to dandruff tend to correct themselves to even over production of oil, with Ghassoul Clay powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict-&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I love it! Let me just get that out of the way because I already loved this clay before but you are giving it to me in powder form? So, I pay for the lava clay and that is it? I’m so there and I was able to use the clay to make my own facial masks to even giving my hands a little rejuvenation treatment. Being able to add other ingredients like oils to boost up the moisture for hands and feet (I even added a little to an avocado to produce a mask) is not something that can be done with other products.  I could use this one product to help my skin’s needs and to suit my “going on right now” issues like a blemish on my nose!  You rarely find the clay in powder form and I see it like when you buy herbs/spices for your kitchen, the pure product alone will always beat any (all salt) mix that is advertised as an all-in-one product. No fillers or anything else with Zakia’s Morocco Ghassoul Clay powder and finally being able to make my own masks to fit my needs no matter the problem, weather, stress level, is something I seek!  You can use it as a spot treatment too for pimples, blackheads, or any surprises you wake up! I received the above product(s) free of charge from Zakia’s Morocco.

            <li> My wife loves this product - great facial mask - leaves your skin feeling relaxed and refreshed. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Lovely pampering product. Easy to use.....just add a bit of water....little at a time....until you get thin consistency you like....then spread on with a make-up brush. I use the thin, fan like make-up brush. It works perfect. I use this product everywhere. Face...Neck....décolletage...Upper arms, Legs....just anywhere you want. Leaves skin feeling firm and gives your skin a nice smooth surface for adding your favorite moisturizer. Treat yourself. We all deserve a bit of pampering.....the nice thing about this is that you are in privacy of your own home. Easy clean up too. Just rinse brush and glass bowl of your choice out after each use. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling fresh, smooth, and clean.  Acts as a mask and natural exfoliator.  It tends to dry out blemishes and make them disappear faster.  Moisturizing after use is definitely a must, though, otherwise skin will dry out!  Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I am not going to lie, I have not liked loose powder products in the past. I have trouble getting the right combination of water and powder and feel like I am wasting product. However, Zakias Morocco included an instructional sheet with their product and it made me aware of two things. First, in order to have multiple purposes, it needs to be in powder form. Second, the sheet had measuring directions based on the uses of the product. (I needed this, sadly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the mask as instructed and discovered that it spread smoothly and hardened within the designated time. I could feel it tightening, but I did not actually feel anything else. Usually I feel some sort of tingling. I was pleasantly surprised by the result. I had far less redness on my skin and my face felt incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> The Moroccan Ghassoul Clay Mask is an amazing weekly mask made from organic clay found deep within the Ancient Atlas Mountains of Morocco.  Ghassoul clay is rich in minerals, and works to detoxify and tone your skin.  The clay is a light brown color, and has a powdery consistency. To use you simply mix the clay with water, and then apply.  You can use this mask on your face as well as your body.  Rinse the mask off after it dries, and then enjoy your clean and healthy skin. I like to do a Ghassoul Clay Mask once a week. Love the way it leaves my skin feeling and I love that it is all natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has some good effect on the skin</li>
            <li> This mud mask cleans very good. Draws out impurities great.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best mask I have every used, my skin is so soft, and looks resilient after each use. I LOVE what it does!</li>
            <li> Came shrink wrapped. Directions on the back. I love masks. I make my own and buy them for different ailments. I have heard alot about this clay. It was super easy to mix up. I poured out about two tablespoons then used distilled water pouring a little at a time then mixing with my fan brush Til I got a creamy consistency. Left my mask on for 20 minutes. I felt a tightening effect. I dermaplaned my skin before hand and used an organic apple cider vinegar toner. Dermaplaning can be done at home using the Tinkle brand eyebrow razor which u can purchase off Amazon or ur local beauty store. Dermaplaning removes dead skin cells. You are basically shaving your face with a little pressure. This helps the mask work more thoroughly. I could feel this mask pulling the yuck out of my skin. My skin after the mask came off was so soft and glowing. I had used coconut oil on my face and unfortunately for me I broke out. I know everyone says it is great for acne prone skin but not mine. I read I need to mix my organic coconut oil with castor oil!!  Well this helped in one use. I am thrilled with this. I cant wait to use it on my hair. This is a staple now in my mask collection. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to banish acne!!  I am impressed!! I have to say this and my pineapple papaya enzyme mask and my homemade pumpkin enzyme mask are my favorites!!  I will use this once a week or more to keep my acne away!!  Great product great price!! Will buy again. Also there are alot of masks in this jar. I am a raving fan!</li>
            <li> This product works well</li>
            <li> This clay mask works great. It leaves my skin so smooth. I would make it thin/watery to use it on my face because the mask pulls your skin as it dries out. I usually use washcloth to remove the mask off as it can be hard to wash off just using water.</li>
            <li> This product is great over all. Just remember not to leave it on too long after it dries. Your face ends up tightening and can leave you feeling like you had botox. Nothing negative to say about this product. It&#x27;s gentle to my sensitive acne prone face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a friend and she absolutely loved it. I have yet to try this product myself but given how good Zakia&#x27;s products are, I am confident that this clay mask must be a wonderful product. I gave this product 4 stars out of 5 only because I have not tried it but I do plan on buying it very soon :)</li>
            <li> Love this. Easy to use and it&#x27;s a good sized container.  Can be used on body not just on face so it&#x27;s multi use.  No reactions to the product whatsoever and that was a relief because I have sensitive skin.  Will be reordering it after its used up.</li>
            <li> My skin looked and felt so clean after this. I love this product. It was easy to use and you can&#x27;t beat the refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> This product is really great, if correctly used.&lt;br /&gt;My skin was soft and clean afterwards. I noticed less acne after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product really lacks instructions. It is not indicated how much water is needed to mix with the powder. It is not indicated how long you should let the mask set, just until dry.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it , I made a thick paste, and put a thick layer on my face and shoulders. It took 30-45 min to dry. After rinsing it off, I was completely red, like a sunburn (but not painful). It lasted 30 min, after that my skin came back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;On my second attempt, I put a thin layer (transparent layer) on my face and shoulders. It took 10-15 min to dry and my skin wasn&#x27;t red after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Instructions :&lt;br /&gt;- 2 to 3 tbsp of water for 1 tbsp of clay ( quantity for face mask and shoulders)&lt;br /&gt;- let the mask set for 10 to 15 minutes maximum</li>
            <li> I have received Ghassoul Clay Mask recently made by Zakia’s Morocco!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really interested in Moroccan goodies, for sure! This is a country that I have never visited, and I haven’t really heard much about it. What I know is that the nature there is amazing. They have deserty climate, and a lot of sand. People live quite simply, there isn’t too much heavy production going on, the nature is quite unpolluted. Anything that comes from Morocco, made from Moroccan natural soil, plants or clay found there must be of exceptional quality. So many times you purchase a product, and you have no idea where the origin of the product is. When a product is based on something coming from clean natural environment, you can rest assured that what you will be using does not have any chemicals that would harm you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular mask is made of organic natural clay from the Ancient Atlas Mountains of Morocco. When I opened the package, the clay looked very much like what you would expect clay from Morocco look like – the color was the color of brown wood mixed with sand. I liked now natural it looked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed some issues with the product itself for me. The mask came in a nice package, that was shrink-wrapped. It was definitely a new product that I got. However, once I opened the lid, there was no seal on the package, and that to me maybe an issue in that I am not sure how fresh the product is really. I think I would prefer to have a package with an additional seal on it. That’s what we are used to seeing in North America these days anyways. Just, this is something expected from most products, and this particular product did not have this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue for me was the application of the product. This clay is very versatile. It is actually quite great, because it can be used as a mask for hair, as a facial mask, or a full body mask. I have so far used it as a hair mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several ways to apply the hair mask. One way is to do it quickly, just mixing with your shampoo on the palm of your hand, just before applying the mask. That’s what I did. Another way is to mix the mask of clay with tepid water, and form a clay-like paste, and only then apply it to your hair. I didn’t pick this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, now that I have a small baby, my two blogs, a huge house to take care of, I really have to consider the time I spend in the shower, so every second is valuable, and I have to do things as quickly as I possibly can. So, I have decided to make the mask quick in the shower, and I just put a splash of shampoo, and then added approximately the same amount of the clay powder. Unfortunately for me, my portion of clay powder was a bit too much, and I made a bit of a mess in the shower. That was easy to rinse off though with the water. I rubbed the shampoo with the clay powder together until the clay mixed completely with the shampoo. I ended up adding a bit more shampoo as I thought the consistency was a bit too lumpy at first because I put too much clay powder. Then I applied the mix as I usually do my shampoo, and rinsed it off. The hair after this mask felt like it usually feels after I use expensive shampoo on my hair. I went ahead and used a conditioner on my rinsed hair because I like my hair a bit smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven’t tried to apply the clay on my face or body yet, but I definitely will. This product seems of great quality, it is and feels very natural, which is wonderful. This is what women of Morocco have used for probably thousands of years before modern chemical based cosmetics were invented. Natural clay is very unpolluted, unadulterated mix that will provide you a peace of mind that you are using something that you can be sure will not make your skin react or make you absorb chemicals you don’t want. This is the way to treat your body and hair, and a wonderful thing it is that we are all going back to our roots, and to mother nature to seeknatural solutions for beauty and health!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One point I wanted to raise with this product though – even though the product seems great that it is a one product for hair and body treatments, I suffer from lack of time with my beauty routine. The best way to apply this clay is in the form of a mix, where you have to mix the clay with some water, or shampoo for a hair mask. I would appreciate to be able to avoid having to go through this extra step of mixing, and be able to just open my container with the mask, and be able to apply it directly on the skin, without have to first mix it with something. This extra step requires me to get a spoon, a bowl, have my water ready, and this is just not practical for me right now with my time constraints. So, I think for our crazy modern world of not churning your own butter, buying pre-made and pre-cooked bread, using microwave to reheat and cook, we would be looking at some customers not satisfied as they have to go that extra step to have the product ready with the mixing and the dissolving. So, that’s just my main issue – my two cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely try to use this product more for masks on my face, and on my body. I think the hair mask worked, and it was quite easy to use really. I am very happy to ditch some of the products that I usually buy for my hair for this all-natural clay mask! And this mask is very affordable (compared to some other little packs of products out there, we won’t name them, they know who they are!) This mask retails for $10.99 on Amazon, so I highly recommend purchasing it now before it goes back up in price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the scores, I will give the product itself 5 out of 5, but I think the company for its packaging and presentation of the product will get a 4 – I wish there was a seal, and the product would be pre-mixed to be able to use it faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is to be applied weekly for toning, detoxifying, and rejuvenating.

The opinion expressed is my honest opinion, this is what I really think about it.</li>
            <li> I knew clays before.I wanted to try this one,it cleans pores,refreshes and makes my skin breath again but does not dry it out.With adding couple drops of Argan oil it becomes a nourishing mask.I have oily,mature,dehydrated skin so this is an ideal choice.I really like that natural earthy scent.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend this product.</li>
            <li> Most of you know about my obsession with Masks of all kinds but I especially love a good mud mask!  There is just some sort of satisfaction that comes from the feeling as the mask dries, like you can feel it drawing all the impurities out of your pores!&lt;br /&gt;This Moroccan Ghassoul Clay Mask by Zakia&#x27;s Morocco is a perfect example of an awesome mud mask.  What makes this mud mask unique is not that it&#x27;s a powder, which allows you to create your own individual masks but that it can also be used as soap, skin conditioner, shampoo, and as a body mask.  Talk about a product that multi-tasks!&lt;br /&gt;I use the Moroccan Ghassoul Clay Mask by Zakia&#x27;s Morocco once a week and it leaves my skin feel rejuvenated, clean, toned and detoxed!  It has also helped made my skin look and feel more smooth.  I even tested it out on my hair by mixing a little in my normal shampoo and it really helped remove all the residual residue from all the hair products that I use so now it will be something I do at least once a month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive some of these products complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I’ve been having some type of keratosis pilaris on my face due to allergic reaction. I wanted to try this Moroccan Ghassoul Clay Powder to see if it would help to heal and eliminate the bumps. Sure enough, after just one use I saw a huge improvement! I used it three nights in a row and now I can barely see any of those tiny bumps on my skin. I’m really happy about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, you can’t just apply a powder to your face. You have to create a paste with it. Although the jar says to use water, I like to use Rosewater myself. The jar doesn’t tell you how much to make, so I had to experiment. At first I added too much water, so I needed to add more powder. Then, I added too much powder, so I needed more water. Finally had a nice, creamy (yet thin) paste that I could apply to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the product told you how much liquid to add (ie. one part powder, two parts liquid); this would be a lot easier and more convenient. On the plus side though, since I did have to keep adding in water and powder, I ended up making enough of the mask for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use the mask, you simply apply a THIN layer to your face and/or body (if you’d like). I only applied it to my face and neck (after initially washing, of course). Then you can let it dry. As it dries, it does tighten the skin quite a bit, but not to the point where it’s uncomfortable or pulling the skin. It dried pretty quickly too (around 10 minutes for entire face to dry with a THIN layer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar doesn’t say how long to leave on the mask. I left it on a good 20 - 30 minutes. It was really easy to wash off (much easier than any other mask I’ve used). When I was done, I rinsed with cold water to close my pores and then applied my face serum and moisturizer as usual. My skin felt very soft and the bumps had really improved (less noticeable and smaller). I’m pretty amazed by the almost instant results.oticeable and smaller). I’m pretty amazed by the almost instant results.</li>
            <li> Woke up with a blemish gone how awesome is that. This is a great mask. You can actually see the differents after the first use. If you&#x27;re looking for that clean smooth feeling this is a must purchase, Thanks Zakia&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The scent has a mineral smell to it. Feels nice on the skin and seems to leave your skin with a healthy glow</li>
            <li> I can not get the jar opened!</li>
