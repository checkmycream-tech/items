            <li>MK Jasmine is now my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments about the fragrance and inquiries of what fragrance it was....</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Better price than purchasing at Macys, or Ulta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>awhile my favorite perfume was Juicy Coutoure Viva La Juicy, but this perfume has taken its spot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a very clean but not overpowering smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with his original scent!</li>
            <li>Love it... arrived in original packaging and safely packed.</li>
            <li>I like the nice and gentle floral scent of this perfume; it does not have an overpowering scent and can be used confidently even during the day.</li>
            <li>At first the scent is so nice when you spray it on</li>
            <li>Amazing, soft, lovely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fresh, so clean, SOOO youthful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite scent for sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alot of perfume for the price, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Its original.</li>
            <li>This is such a good deal rather than buying it from Macys or JCPenneys.</li>
            <li>It is just described and shipping was fast :)</li>
            <li>Its a sweet smell, but not a sickley sweet.</li>
            <li>Anyone will be delighted to have this as a present,</li>
            <li>another man actually committed that I smelled good.</li>
            <li>I have Michael Kors Glam Jasmine and Sporty Citrus---they are both clean, crisp fragrances that aren&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Christmas will be a success.</li>
            <li>I just got a small sample of this and it smells beautiful.</li>
            <li>The price is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>I immediately had to have it because it smelled amazing &amp; lasted a long time on my wrist!</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my hot new favorite scents!</li>
            <li>I bought exactly what she told me to buy.  </li>
            <li>This stuff should have a warning sign, &amp;#34;warning: all men will do what ever you ask and will most likely never leave your side once you wear this!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>But it was exactly what was desired and requested.</li>
            <li>Arrived today, in original packaging and very well packed for shipping, love this scent, will have to try some other Michael Kors now!</li>
            <li>Fast arrival and quality product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know as it was a gift.</li>
            <li>I wear it all the time and get compliments left and right!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re expecting a product that actually has the clean, fresh, romantic scent of jasmine- forget it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to buy this product from our local beauty store and I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>Use it sparingly its potent Parfume (not like a EU de toilette) a little dab will do the trick for hours.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>like my perfumes to be loud, and floral and this is exaclty what it is.</li>
            <li>but then slowly I started to like this one better.</li>
            <li>Scent is exactly the same as more expensive bottles in store......</li>
    </ol>
