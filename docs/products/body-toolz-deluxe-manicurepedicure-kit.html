            <li>&quot; this is more questions than I have received in 10 years of business.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve known better...</li>

            <li>thank you,  always satisfied customer</li>
            <li>This kit is very good, the quality and presentation are nice and are elegant for few money, I recommended it thanks for all!!!!</li>
            <li>My husband needed to replace a fine quality set which was lost in traveling.</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t stand those cheap toe nail clippers that won&#x27;t cut a man-sized toe nail.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing wimpy or cheap about the tools in this kit.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered as a replacement for the kit I carry in my purse</li>
            <li>/&gt;The products are decently made; nothing stellar, but probably as good as one could expect for the price of</li>
            <li>Clippers and scissors don&#x27;t cut cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Good quality and enough items.</li>
            <li>The nail file was good for only two times and then I threw it away.</li>
            <li>Item was received quickly.</li>
            <li>MUCH better quality than expected for the price....looked at sets that were lesser quality at higher cost and am amazed at what an incredible bargain these were!!</li>
            <li>It is fine, but I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li>The implements vary in quality, some seem really well-made and some feel really cheap.</li>
            <li>This review is actually based on the Deluxe manicure/pedicure kit, but I think it&#x27;s relevant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>None of it is worth a damn.  </li>
            <li>Had everything you could want and the price was right.</li>
            <li>None of them have loose joints, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the exact text from the email I received in response to 5 questions about the products:&lt;br /&gt;\\</li>
            <li>Zipper broke first time I used it.    </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t check the measurements first.  </li>
            <li>This set has been terrific, and I am taking better care of my nails and feet than ever before because I have it.    </li>
            <li>This is way too large to carry</li>
            <li>Product is pure garbage..</li>
            <li>however i do wish it would have also included a large nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>Everything in it is very high quality and</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this set.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 one as a gift which was very well received.</li>
            <li>I needed something but did not want to pay much for it.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have use for some of the item but for the price it was very well done.</li>
            <li>which you already have and probably of better quality than the other sets include).</li>
            <li>It is nice to have everthing together in the small case.</li>
            <li>The tools seem to be a decent quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find stainless steel for $19.</li>
            <li>Very convenience for the home and also for travelling, a complete set to keep your needs in this aspect of taking care of your nails</li>
            <li>A great amount of hand strength was required just to clip the nails and the results were very poor.  </li>
            <li>: the toenail clipper (the big plier looking ones) bring fairly easy, not the actual plier part put the piece that makes it spring back into place.</li>
            <li>It has everything we need except a large toenail clipper which we just bought from a local store.  </li>
            <li>This is not a stainless steel, but cheap Chinese plated carbon steel that rusted in 2 days!  </li>
            <li>The quality is professional and so was the service.                                                </li>
            <li>In mine, the clippers/cutters are so dull, they won&#x27;t even cut finger/toe nails without basically crushing them.</li>
            <li>This product broke after only a couple uses, did not return because I was so busy during Christmas holidays.  </li>
            <li>everything works, and the alignment of the cutting edges is accurate enough to get clean cuts.</li>
            <li>(Apparently you are required to have completed a training course before you buy products to maintain personal hygiene).  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Arrived earlier than expected which just added to the overall pleasure this experience was!!</li>
            <li> The clippers just broke my nails off, leaving sharp crooked edges that needed to be filed.  </li>
            <li> One of the nippers does not re-open when you squeeze it closed, despite having a double spring designed to push it back open, so you have to pull it back open, which is awkward.  </li>
            <li> Can not be sterilized (again, this is not stainless steel)  4.</li>
            <li> It is so small, it must for young children/infants or little oriental hands.</li>
            <li> the scissors are not as sharp as they could be - you may want to sharpen them yourselves if you know how.  </li>
            <li> i appreciate the fact the bodytoolz are packaged in this neat little case,  i spent 2 days on line trying to find a mani/pedi set with everything i needed</li>
            <li> The Attractive Carrying Case turned out to be smelly, dusty and poor quality artificial pouch.  </li>
            <li> In all of my years in the cosmetology profession I have never seen anything like that happen to stain less steel.</li>
            <li> I dropped it to 2 stars after I wrote the company asking for some additional information on the kit, and received a nasty response saying I had asked too many questions and should just return the product since I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing!  </li>
            <li> few issues:  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk.  </li>
            <li> It is compact and convenient to carry in briefcase for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I have had this manicure set for quite a few months.  </li>
            <li> heavily recommend</li>
            <li> as he says, \\&quot;heavy duty.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The latches on the nippers are quite stiff, and difficult to open and close.  </li>
            <li> The case was too small</li>
            <li> Ordered this for the pedicure tools but they are small and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> so the tools were hard to remove and replace.</li>
            <li> Toolzz are dull and can not be sharpened (poor quality steel...</li>
            <li> They nail clippers are very dull &amp; does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Not even the file is tough.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality item.    </li>
            <li> The quality is extrememly poor.  </li>
            <li> Truly a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I hate wimpy tweezers that flex together at the fingers when squeezed.</li>
            <li> The quality is horrible.</li>

            <li> This review is actually based on the Deluxe manicure/pedicure kit, but I think it&#x27;s relevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these recently for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products are decently made; nothing stellar, but probably as good as one could expect for the price of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few issues:  the scissors are not as sharp as they could be - you may want to sharpen them yourselves if you know how.  The latches on the nippers are quite stiff, and difficult to open and close.  One of the nippers does not re-open when you squeeze it closed, despite having a double spring designed to push it back open, so you have to pull it back open, which is awkward.  There is also essentially no documentation of kit contents or usage (the box has a list of items included, but it doesn&#x27;t entirely match what&#x27;s there, not does it identify which thing is which).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on products alone, I&#x27;d have given it 3 stars - maybe even 4 taking into account price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I dropped it to 2 stars after I wrote the company asking for some additional information on the kit, and received a nasty response saying I had asked too many questions and should just return the product since I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing!  (Apparently you are required to have completed a training course before you buy products to maintain personal hygiene).  Here&#x27;s the exact text from the email I received in response to 5 questions about the products:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot; this is more questions than I have received in 10 years of business. It seems to me you purchased some kits which you have no idea of their purpose and use. Rather than go through this entire list you may return these items\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Acceptable quality but not problem-free, good price, surly customer support.</li>
            <li> Nice product, item was shipped within 1 hour of purchase.  That was the quickest shipment I have ever experienced before.  Came in the time frame it was suppose to come in.  Great job by seller!!!!</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s the best kit that she has been able to find for her nails. Good quality and enough items.</li>
            <li> The finger nail clipper is immediately caught my attention. It is so small, it must for young children/infants or little oriental hands.</li>
            <li> Poor quality item.    Zipper broke first time I used it.    The toe-nail clipper was not sharpened.    Made in Pakisten.</li>
            <li> It is fine, but I haven&#x27;t used it much.</li>
            <li> Sight-unseen purchases are always a risk, and in the case of the Body Toolz kit, I wish I had seen it before buying. The implements vary in quality, some seem really well-made and some feel really cheap. Good news: everything works, and the alignment of the cutting edges is accurate enough to get clean cuts. Some of the \\&quot;scissor\\&quot; jointed tools bind but I think I can adjust and oil them to fix that. None of them have loose joints, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk.  In mine, the clippers/cutters are so dull, they won&#x27;t even cut finger/toe nails without basically crushing them.</li>
            <li> Bought this for teenage boy&#x27;s gift. He liked it. Need I say more? The tools seem to be a decent quality. It should last him a long time.</li>
            <li> MUCH better quality than expected for the price....looked at sets that were lesser quality at higher cost and am amazed at what an incredible bargain these were!! Arrived earlier than expected which just added to the overall pleasure this experience was!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find stainless steel for $19. I should&#x27;ve known better... The quality is horrible. Could not return. It is cheaper to throw it away than ship it back.  1. Beware!!!! This is not a stainless steel, but cheap Chinese plated carbon steel that rusted in 2 days!  2. Toolzz are dull and can not be sharpened (poor quality steel... It is similar to sharpening wood)  3. Can not be sterilized (again, this is not stainless steel)  4. The Attractive Carrying Case turned out to be smelly, dusty and poor quality artificial pouch.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is even legal to misrepresent products like this.</li>
            <li> This is a well constructed item and I have no problems with any of the components being flimsy (like some tweezers).  I originally ordered as a replacement for the kit I carry in my purse but I didn&#x27;t check the measurements first.  This is way too large to carry but it is a great replacement for the home kit.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect item for us Diabetics. Why pay others to take care of your feet??? Do it yourself!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Body Toolz individually packaged before.  I thought these would be the same quality.  These are not even close.  The quality is extrememly poor.  It feels like these tools are just stamped with the name brand. The clippers just broke my nails off, leaving sharp crooked edges that needed to be filed.  A great amount of hand strength was required just to clip the nails and the results were very poor.  I would not have paid a dollar for this set.  Truly a disappointment.  I really wanted to like this set.</li>
            <li> This kit is very good, the quality and presentation are nice and are elegant for few money, I recommended it thanks for all!!!!</li>
            <li> beautifully made set in a leather case with everything one would need. I bought 2 one as a gift which was very well received.</li>
            <li> Tools work great and look great. My husband needed to replace a fine quality set which was lost in traveling. We are pleased to have chosen this set (without the razor, comb, toothbrush, etc. which you already have and probably of better quality than the other sets include). It is compact and convenient to carry in briefcase for everyday use.</li>
            <li> good kit over all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;negative: the toenail clipper (the big plier looking ones) bring fairly easy, not the actual plier part put the piece that makes it spring back into place. the filer is so-so, after like 10 uses it wasn&#x27;t as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;everything else good.</li>
            <li> The nail file was good for only two times and then I threw it away. The case was too small so the tools were hard to remove and replace. The cuticle pusher was not useable.</li>
            <li> I have had this manicure set for quite a few months.  I needed something but did not want to pay much for it.  This set has been terrific, and I am taking better care of my nails and feet than ever before because I have it.    I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this product body toolz and manicure/pedicure kit.The quality is professional and so was the service.                                                Keith</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift to a patient in rehab and she just loved it. It was a very nice set. Had everything you could want and the price was right. Shipping was fast too</li>
            <li> This product broke after only a couple uses, did not return because I was so busy during Christmas holidays.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> If there were no stars I would giv it that.  They nail clippers are very dull &amp; does not work at all. I will NEVER again purchase anything from that brand again. This product belongs in a dollar store with the price of .75 cents U.S. currency. Never buy anything from Pakistan. Product is pure garbage..</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have use for some of the item but for the price it was very well done. heavily recommend</li>
            <li> Item was received quickly. Very satisfied with the quality of the item.</li>
            <li> I sent this set to my father for his birthday and he loves it.  Everything in it is very high quality and as he says, \\&quot;heavy duty.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for the pedicure tools but they are small and hard to work with. Probably be okay for kids feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kit for a couple months now, and it is of excellent quality. I hate wimpy tweezers that flex together at the fingers when squeezed. I also can&#x27;t stand those cheap toe nail clippers that won&#x27;t cut a man-sized toe nail. There&#x27;s nothing wimpy or cheap about the tools in this kit. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> When these utensils were placed in the sanitizer solution they began to rust.  In all of my years in the cosmetology profession I have never seen anything like that happen to stain less steel.</li>
            <li> None of it is worth a damn.  For anything.  Clippers and scissors don&#x27;t cut cleanly.  Not even the file is tough.  All bling no bang.</li>
            <li> i am very pleased with this product the quality seems to meet my expectations and the price as well.  i appreciate the fact the bodytoolz are packaged in this neat little case,  i spent 2 days on line trying to find a mani/pedi set with everything i needed however i do wish it would have also included a large nail clipper.  anyway i am very satisfied with this product.  i will be referring friends to amazon.com as well as bodytoolzs.           thank you,  always satisfied customer</li>
            <li> I like this set, I purchase it for a gift, did not get feed by yet but I gave it 5 stars because I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;The price was good also.</li>
            <li> Very convenience for the home and also for travelling, a complete set to keep your needs in this aspect of taking care of your nails</li>
            <li> Just what my wife wanted. She now has everything needed to do the job of maintaining her nails. Everything in one well made kit.</li>
            <li> If you like to carry with you on your travel package. It is goog enought. I recommended for thay pourposes</li>
