            <li>I love that this comes in a glass bottle that has a pump.  </li>
            <li>So glad I was asked to review this product.</li>
            <li>But my skin looks healthy and radiant after I put this serum on.</li>
            <li>I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion...</li>
            <li>The bags under my eyes stopped being so &amp;#34;baggy&amp;#34;, my skin tone was becoming brighter and had a healthier look.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it works...</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of vitamin c serums, this one is a bit better in the aspect that it is made with Vegan HYALURONIC ACID and Organic and cruelty free vitamin c.  </li>
            <li>I was also glad it was oil free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had people ask me if I&#x27;m using a new makeup,that my skin looks good.</li>
            <li>I realize that it&#x27;s meant to reduce your fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>It helps fill in my wrinkles and smooths my fine lines.</li>
            <li>First off this Vitamin C Serum is the best smelling facial product I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>, I got lucky once, many years ago,  Sally Hansen Serum was no longer being sold at the store &amp; they had it for 75% off.</li>
            <li>The collagen helpsgive me newer smooth skin..</li>
            <li>very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;i received this product for a discount for my honest and unbiased opinions on it.</li>
            <li>favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>I did review this product for free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I was provided this product for free to test and review.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li>I also really liked the fact that this has a pump, makes it easier to control how much your using.</li>
            <li>Looks like also well fit for man&#x27;s oily face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive trying something online since I have had so many allergic reactions from products I have purchased locally in the stores, salons and cosmetic counters, but I am very glad I listened to someone&#x27;s recommendation and read the reviews on Amazon and made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether this serum will actually help my &amp;#34;wisdom lines&amp;#34;, but as a nurse, I know that Vitamin C is good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>First of all, this product is very easy and quick to use - one pump, a quick application, and I am ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Never got lucky like that again.  </li>
            <li>love to lay out, don&#x27;t want to have my face look older</li>
            <li>It is non sticky and super absorbent.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>First, I would like to comment on the fact that this product is made in the USA, which is important to me.  </li>
            <li>After just a short amount f time my face seems more vibrant and alive and it feels great..</li>
            <li>This product is unique in that it is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that comes with a pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li>It tightens up your skin in such an amazing way .</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a</li>
            <li>It glides on your skin and is totally absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The product package is a nice size for storage in a cosmetic bag or left at home.</li>
            <li>I received my Vitamin C Facial Serum and really liked using it.</li>
            <li>The serum seems like it is going to be sticky, but you just have to wait for it to be absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>It is a bit sticky once you first put in on, but dries quickly and any makeup goes on with out issues.</li>
            <li>This product also doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or sticky like other products have, and it just feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>But she was so insistent that she also needed help with her &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; so I allowed her to use it right along side me, to humor her.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Their is none of the serum left &amp;#34;sitting&amp;#34; on your skin, it is completely absorbed into your skin where it will give the most benefit and results.  </li>
            <li>But I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>a very unusual smell</li>
            <li>I was happy to find an affordable serum that was made w/Vitamin C &amp; other natural ingredients as well.  </li>
            <li>I am just an avid online shopper who relies on online reviews for my shopping decisions.</li>
            <li>Because of our age difference,  this was a first for us.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to review this product for free thanks to the distributor.</li>
            <li>pretty improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was greatly excited when it did not cause any problems with my skin.</li>
            <li>Once it absorbs it leaves your skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>And I was also a little concerned because she has super sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t want to have her break out or have any kind of reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Every</li>
            <li>With continued use it diminishes fine lines and wrinkles for younger looking skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very smooth to the touch and feeling fresh from the inside without the heavy or oily feel of it on your skin.  </li>
            <li>It was a bonus when I saw it had a pump, makes it easier to control how much you use, &amp; you really don&#x27;t need much of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much healthier my sisters face looked.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t yet a woman of a &amp;#34;certain age&amp;#34; you can also gain the benefits of heading off the wrinkles before they&#x27;re too noticeable and keep your skin looking young &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>I really recommend you try this serum.  </li>
            <li>skin feeling very soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes it so much easier when applying the serum.</li>
            <li>like my skin was absorbing what I put on it, &amp; not just feeling like I&#x27;m putting a layer on my face.</li>
            <li>Plus you really don&#x27;t need much of it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anybody but with all new products,skin test it first.</li>
            <li>I especially like that this serum absorbs into your skin quickly and thoroughly</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry..</li>
            <li>This serum is light and soft on my skin and at the same time keeps it hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product. .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other serums and I&#x27;ve liked them well enough.  </li>
            <li>My skin defenitely feels smoother, although it&#x27;s still too early to notice a real noticeable changes.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t oily and I was able to apply my makeup over it after it dried.</li>
            <li>Within a few days I could see a marked difference in how soft &amp; healthy my face looked.</li>
            <li>Keep your natural beauty longer!</li>
            <li>Used your vitamin C serum and wow!  </li>
            <li>It is not to thick or to watery, went on very smooth &amp; wasn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product since I have never followed a strict facial regimen; now that I am &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; in years, I am anxious to try new products!</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s happier and that makes the whole change internal as well as external.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing what it&#x27;s meant to do so far</li>
            <li>or I would have kept using my old brand.</li>
            <li>like my skin was absorbing what I put on it, &amp; not just putting a layer on my face, you know the feeling when putting on body lotion, this is totally different, it&#x27;s like it was telling me &amp;#34;i&#x27;m working&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a product yet really where I actually felt</li>
            <li>This has my face feeling soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident in in believing that this product will slowly start showing changes.</li>
            <li>it literally made me brighten, even my mood, which made me feel pretty all by itself!&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t been using this serum for very long, but i can already tell that it&#x27;s working to rejuvenate my skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products in the past that have bothered my skin.</li>
            <li>My face looks more even and less blotchy than usual, and that is with using only this serum - no other makeup.  </li>
            <li>This serum is thin in consistency and absorbs very quickly.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The serum seems like it is going to be sticky, but you just have to wait for it to be absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> It is a bit sticky once you first put in on, but dries quickly and any makeup goes on with out issues.</li>
            <li> This product also doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or sticky like other products have, and it just feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> But she was so insistent that she also needed help with her &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; so I allowed her to use it right along side me, to humor her.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Their is none of the serum left &amp;#34;sitting&amp;#34; on your skin, it is completely absorbed into your skin where it will give the most benefit and results.  </li>
            <li> But I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> a very unusual smell</li>
            <li> I was happy to find an affordable serum that was made w/Vitamin C &amp; other natural ingredients as well.  </li>
            <li> I am just an avid online shopper who relies on online reviews for my shopping decisions.</li>
            <li> Because of our age difference,  this was a first for us.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to review this product for free thanks to the distributor.</li>
            <li> pretty improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was greatly excited when it did not cause any problems with my skin.</li>
            <li> Once it absorbs it leaves your skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> And I was also a little concerned because she has super sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t want to have her break out or have any kind of reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Every</li>
            <li> With continued use it diminishes fine lines and wrinkles for younger looking skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very smooth to the touch and feeling fresh from the inside without the heavy or oily feel of it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It was a bonus when I saw it had a pump, makes it easier to control how much you use, &amp; you really don&#x27;t need much of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much healthier my sisters face looked.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t yet a woman of a &amp;#34;certain age&amp;#34; you can also gain the benefits of heading off the wrinkles before they&#x27;re too noticeable and keep your skin looking young &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li> I really recommend you try this serum.  </li>
            <li> skin feeling very soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes it so much easier when applying the serum.</li>
            <li> like my skin was absorbing what I put on it, &amp; not just feeling like I&#x27;m putting a layer on my face.</li>
            <li> Plus you really don&#x27;t need much of it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anybody but with all new products,skin test it first.</li>
            <li> I especially like that this serum absorbs into your skin quickly and thoroughly</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry..</li>
            <li> This serum is light and soft on my skin and at the same time keeps it hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product. .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other serums and I&#x27;ve liked them well enough.  </li>
            <li> My skin defenitely feels smoother, although it&#x27;s still too early to notice a real noticeable changes.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t oily and I was able to apply my makeup over it after it dried.</li>
            <li> Within a few days I could see a marked difference in how soft &amp; healthy my face looked.</li>
            <li> Keep your natural beauty longer!</li>
            <li> Used your vitamin C serum and wow!  </li>
            <li> It is not to thick or to watery, went on very smooth &amp; wasn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product since I have never followed a strict facial regimen; now that I am &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; in years, I am anxious to try new products!</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s happier and that makes the whole change internal as well as external.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing what it&#x27;s meant to do so far</li>
            <li> or I would have kept using my old brand.</li>
            <li> like my skin was absorbing what I put on it, &amp; not just putting a layer on my face, you know the feeling when putting on body lotion, this is totally different, it&#x27;s like it was telling me &amp;#34;i&#x27;m working&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a product yet really where I actually felt</li>
            <li> This has my face feeling soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident in in believing that this product will slowly start showing changes.</li>
            <li> it literally made me brighten, even my mood, which made me feel pretty all by itself!&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t been using this serum for very long, but i can already tell that it&#x27;s working to rejuvenate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products in the past that have bothered my skin.</li>
            <li> My face looks more even and less blotchy than usual, and that is with using only this serum - no other makeup.  </li>
            <li> This serum is thin in consistency and absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying store brand anti-aging creams since my early 20&#x27;s,I&#x27;m 39, I prefer serums but your lucky if you find a store brand, &amp; all the brand names we know are so expensive</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother but it is to early to notice dramatic changes, but I&#x27;m confident in this product &amp; feel I will slowly start seeing changes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for very long, maybe 2 weeks, but I have noticed that my skin feels &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; and looks brighter.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned there is no better way to reverse the signs of aging than using a quality Vitamin C serum twice per day under your moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I shop very frequently on Amazon and do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.  </li>
            <li> If there is anything that I would change, it would be that the serum is a bit thin and dispenses really fast from the pump.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I also like that after I scrub my face, the serum doesn&#x27;t sting like other serums sometimes do.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other vitamin C serums before, but they came in glass amber bottle.</li>
            <li> Any dark spots and lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear alot of makeup, and I do not have the time to mess with fancy formulas to give me a &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; face.  </li>
            <li> My face is brighter and feels tight.</li>
            <li> I do not expect immediate results from this serum, and will have to use it for a long time to see some serious results.</li>
            <li> The serum isn&#x27;t heavy</li>
            <li> i had three kids in three years, and haven&#x27;t slept since then, so my poor face definitely needs all the help it can get!</li>
            <li> I usually use vitamin C serums twice a day-</li>
            <li> I am very anxious to see what the results will be after a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> but when I saw it&#x27;s components I became alarmed and wanted to alert anyone who may have cold sores or related (HSV 1, 2 , etc).</li>
            <li> This stuff works at least for me .</li>
            <li> I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
            <li> I like this product because, It&#x27;s not too thick or too watery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit thick, but not so uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have to admit,vitamin  serum has become my guilty pleasure.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t wear alot of makeup, and I do not have the time to mess with fancy formulas to give me a &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; face.  But I like this product very much.  First of all, this product is very easy and quick to use - one pump, a quick application, and I am ready to go.  This product also doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy or sticky like other products have, and it just feels good on my skin.  My face looks more even and less blotchy than usual, and that is with using only this serum - no other makeup.  I don&#x27;t know whether this serum will actually help my &amp;#34;wisdom lines&amp;#34;, but as a nurse, I know that Vitamin C is good for your skin.  I also appreciate that the serum is made in the USA and in a FDA facility.  Definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special note:  I was provided a sample for review and testing at a discounted price.  I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just an avid online shopper who relies on online reviews for my shopping decisions. I shop very frequently on Amazon and do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.  Have a Blessed Day!</li>
            <li> great stuff... After just a short amount f time my face seems more vibrant and alive and it feels great.. I got this free to review and sooo happy I did</li>
            <li> This product is really awesome.  It glides on your skin and is totally absorbed.  Their is none of the serum left &amp;#34;sitting&amp;#34; on your skin, it is completely absorbed into your skin where it will give the most benefit and results.  It leaves my skin feeling very smooth to the touch and feeling fresh from the inside without the heavy or oily feel of it on your skin.  I also use a bit of it on the back of my hands.  I am very anxious to see what the results will be after a few weeks of use.  I purchased this as a promotion for sharing my opinion of the product.  I am very pleased with the product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is a wonderful product for women of all ages. I realize that it&#x27;s meant to reduce your fine lines and wrinkles but it also brightens, moisturizes and nourishes your skin too.  When I received the offer to buy this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion I was more than up for the challenge.  I was determined that if it wasn&#x27;t a great product, then I would say just that and nothing would&#x27;ve influenced me to do otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;My younger sister ( by 11 yrs ) was visiting when this arrived in the post. She is a beautiful woman who insists she looks &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; &amp; she doesn&#x27;t.  But she was so insistent that she also needed help with her &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; so I allowed her to use it right along side me, to humor her.&lt;br /&gt;I doubted that I would see any results with my own complexion let alone hers. And I was also a little concerned because she has super sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t want to have her break out or have any kind of reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Every morning &amp; evening we apply Cynergy&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum side-by-side (my niece between us with a tiny bottle of baby lotion.) Because of our age difference,  this was a first for us.  And here we are bonding over an anti-aging serum!&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when not only did MY skin begin to show results but so did hers!! Within a few days I could see a marked difference in how soft &amp; healthy my face looked. The bags under my eyes stopped being so &amp;#34;baggy&amp;#34;, my skin tone was becoming brighter and had a healthier look. I could not believe that I was seeing results so fast.&lt;br /&gt;However, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much healthier my sisters face looked. I&#x27;m not referring to the elusive wrinkles, her face was practically glowing, she just radiates health! Which of course she can see so she&#x27;s happier and that makes the whole change internal as well as external.&lt;br /&gt;Why wait until you HAVE to use a &amp;#34;wrinkle cream&amp;#34;? With Cynergy &#x27;s Best Vitamin C Serum you&#x27;ll have a product that is safe touse, and really does reduce fine lines, age spots and return vitality to your skin. If you aren&#x27;t yet a woman of a &amp;#34;certain age&amp;#34; you can also gain the benefits of heading off the wrinkles before they&#x27;re too noticeable and keep your skin looking young &amp; fresh. Keep your natural beauty longer!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and makes my face feel tighter and yet softer skin.  I was a bit apprehensive trying something online since I have had so many allergic reactions from products I have purchased locally in the stores, salons and cosmetic counters, but I am very glad I listened to someone&#x27;s recommendation and read the reviews on Amazon and made this purchase.  I was also very pleased that the serum is made in the US.  The product package is a nice size for storage in a cosmetic bag or left at home.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to comment on the fact that this product is made in the USA, which is important to me.  It has both a pleasant texture and fragrance.  More importantly, it works...I have noticed since using it that my skin is brighter and some of my enlarged pores seem to have improved, along with a reduction of wrinkles around my eyes, mouth and neck.  I use it all over my face and throat.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received my Vitamin C Facial Serum and really liked using it. I washed my skin before use and applied all over, and then I applied again at bedtime. I was impressed with how my skin felt afterwards it was very smooth and felt tighter. I love the pump it comes in it makes it east access so you can control the amount of serum you get. It wasn&#x27;t oily and I was able to apply my makeup over it after it dried.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a really good  Vitamin C serum and I think I&#x27;ve found it!  I&#x27;ve tried other serums and I&#x27;ve liked them well enough.  I haven&#x27;t been using this for very long, maybe 2 weeks, but I have noticed that my skin feels &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; and looks brighter.  I especially like that this serum absorbs into your skin quickly and thoroughly and it does not leave your face feeling sticky. If there is anything that I would change, it would be that the serum is a bit thin and dispenses really fast from the pump.  Other than that it&#x27;s great!  I also like that after I scrub my face, the serum doesn&#x27;t sting like other serums sometimes do.  And for those that wear make up, you can do so with confidence. This serum does not interfere in any way with make up application.  I really recommend you try this serum.  It seems to be doing what it&#x27;s meant to do so far and I can&#x27;t wait to see more results with continued use!</li>
            <li> I have to admit,vitamin  serum has become my guilty pleasure.I had already used another brand of vitamin c serum but his one has become my favorite.It helps fill in my wrinkles and smooths my fine lines.Especially around my mouth.The collagen helpsgive me newer smooth skin..I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin tone looks more even and te brown spots are lighter.I&#x27;ve had people ask me if I&#x27;m using a new makeup,that my skin looks good.I&#x27;m happy to tell them no and tell them what I am using.I&#x27;m so glad I received this to review or I would have kept using my old brand.And while it was good,this one is better.I can see why it was voted one of the best beauty products in 2015.And that it was made in the U.S is even better.I recommend this product for anybody but with all new products,skin test it first.I&#x27;ve had no problems with it but everybody is different so it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry..The serum isn&#x27;t heavy but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.I totally recommend it to everybody</li>
            <li> what a wonderful smell this has! definitely a refreshing, citrus-y kind of fragrance. it literally made me brighten, even my mood, which made me feel pretty all by itself!&lt;br /&gt;i haven&#x27;t been using this serum for very long, but i can already tell that it&#x27;s working to rejuvenate my skin. i had three kids in three years, and haven&#x27;t slept since then, so my poor face definitely needs all the help it can get! very satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;i received this product for a discount for my honest and unbiased opinions on it.</li>
            <li> Skin is getting better.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure I have not used this product yet but when I saw it&#x27;s components I became alarmed and wanted to alert anyone who may have cold sores or related (HSV 1, 2 , etc). L Arginine will stimulate an outbreak in people carrying these viruses, and even if it&#x27;s dormant, and including applied topically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And by the way, fix the formula, don&#x27;t shoot the messenger by downvoting me, &amp;#34;Best Vitamin C Serum&amp;#34; shills ! I&#x27;m doing you and your potential customers a favor here! )</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:58c667d04d0556253399b1c70a049afe]] I have tried lots of vitamin c serums, this one is a bit better in the aspect that it is made with Vegan HYALURONIC ACID and Organic and cruelty free vitamin c.  So it is made with wonderful products.&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave a sticky or greasy feeling&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling very soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very runny&lt;br /&gt;Hard to get the pump started&lt;br /&gt;Has a very unusual smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an anti aging serum, it does it&#x27;s job, it is just not one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> I love Vitamin C serums.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned there is no better way to reverse the signs of aging than using a quality Vitamin C serum twice per day under your moisturizer.  This product is unique in that it is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that comes with a pump dispenser.  It  dispenses the perfect amount without dripping and having to worry about spills.  I&#x27;m guessing this sealed system will increase the shelf life because it keeps the air out and prevents contamination by bacteria.  This serum is thin in consistency and absorbs very quickly.  With continued use it diminishes fine lines and wrinkles for younger looking skin.  I purchased this product during a promotion for trial and to share my opinion and experience.</li>
            <li> We all know Vitamin C is good for our bodies &amp; I have been seeing more &amp; more about it in skin products, in magazines &amp; on TV. I was happy to find an affordable serum that was made w/Vitamin C &amp; other natural ingredients as well.  It was a bonus when I saw it had a pump, makes it easier to control how much you use, &amp; you really don&#x27;t need much of it. Another plus-- USA &amp; FDA approved! My skin feels smoother but it is to early to notice dramatic changes, but I&#x27;m confident in this product &amp; feel I will slowly start seeing changes. It is not to thick or to watery, went on very smooth &amp; wasn&#x27;t sticky. I&#x27;ve never used a product where I actually felt like my skin was absorbing what I put on it, &amp; not just putting a layer on my face, you know the feeling when putting on body lotion, this is totally different, it&#x27;s like it was telling me &amp;#34;i&#x27;m working&amp;#34; lol.. I was also glad it was oil free, i already deal with the oily T-zone shiny face. I have been buying store brand anti-aging creams since my early 20&#x27;s,I&#x27;m 39, I prefer serums but your lucky if you find a store brand, &amp; all the brand names we know are so expensive, I got lucky once, many years ago,  Sally Hansen Serum was no longer being sold at the store &amp; they had it for 75% off. Never got lucky like that again.  I lived in FL &amp; I love to lay out, don&#x27;t want to have my face look older then I am. I am very happy I found this, great price compared to all the others and I would definitely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to review this product for free thanks to the distributor. I was very excited to try this product since I have never followed a strict facial regimen; now that I am &amp;#34;up&amp;#34; in years, I am anxious to try new products! I applied this product as directed, and I immediately felt the results! My skin, especially around my eyes, felt moisterized and rejuvinated! Highly recommend this product. . So thankful I was able to test this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a week now and have noticed my skin has more even looking tone. Any dark spots and lines are less noticeable. I have sensitive skin and was greatly excited when it did not cause any problems with my skin. I have tried so many other products in the past that have bothered my skin. It is a bit sticky once you first put in on, but dries quickly and any makeup goes on with out issues. I liked that at the end of the day, my skin did not have a oily feel. I was also happy to see that it is made in the US. I am looking forward to continuing to use this product. I did review this product for free for my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> First off this Vitamin C Serum is the best smelling facial product I have ever used!  The scent is also not overpowering at all.  I have purchased other vitamin C serums before, but they came in glass amber bottle. I love that this comes in a glass bottle that has a pump.  It makes it so much easier when applying the serum. The serum seems like it is going to be sticky, but you just have to wait for it to be absorbed into the skin. Once it absorbs it leaves your skin super soft.  I definitely recommend!  *I was provided this product for free to test and review.</li>
            <li> I received this Vitamin C Serum at a deeply discounted price. I like this product because, It&#x27;s not too thick or too watery. It goes on smooth &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. I haven&#x27;t found a product yet really where I actually felt like my skin was absorbing what I put on it, &amp; not just feeling like I&#x27;m putting a layer on my face. I also really liked the fact that this has a pump, makes it easier to control how much your using. Plus you really don&#x27;t need much of it. My skin defenitely feels smoother, although it&#x27;s still too early to notice a real noticeable changes. I&#x27;m confident in in believing that this product will slowly start showing changes. I would recommend for others to try this Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male and after two weeks of using this product, I feel my skin&#x27;s got pretty improved.&lt;br /&gt;There have not been problems. Looks like also well fit for man&#x27;s oily face.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit thick, but not so uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These are a nice quality product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works at least for me . It tightens up your skin in such an amazing way . It&#x27;s brilliant.</li>
            <li> Used your vitamin C serum and wow!  I can already see a difference in my skin around my eyes and mouth. Love it! So glad I was asked to review this product.</li>
            <li> This serum is light and soft on my skin and at the same time keeps it hydrated throughout the day. I usually use vitamin C serums twice a day- once in the morning after bath and once before going to bed. It is non sticky and super absorbent. I do not expect immediate results from this serum, and will have to use it for a long time to see some serious results.But my skin looks healthy and radiant after I put this serum on. I will definitely buy again.  This serum came in good condition and the delivery was prompt. I did not have any problem with the product.  Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am an avid online shopper and do rely on online reviews for my online shopping decisions. I do not believe in giving dishonest or biased reviews.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion... This is a great serum. This has my face feeling soft and moist. My face is brighter and feels tight. I have started using this with my night regimen.</li>
