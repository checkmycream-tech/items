            <li>One of the best in the Naturals world.</li>
            <li>excellent pdt&lt;br /&gt;true</li>
            <li>works great</li>
            <li>This product works by reducing the amount of hair you lose and it does a GREAT job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great conditioner that does the job it’s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>excellent, well pleased, no complaints</li>
            <li>Smells great, refreshing!</li>
            <li>Good, high-quality conditioner with good results.</li>
            <li>Couple with or without the matching shampoo, I’m happy with it and recommend it to anyone looking for a thickening shampoo for fine and/or thinning hair while doing good things for the environment, animals and oneself.</li>
            <li>Nice body.  </li>
            <li>This is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner, love this brand!</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist always compliments me on the healthy condition of my hair every time I go in for a hair cut.  </li>
            <li>I also tried using more of this conditioner -</li>
            <li>Great price and leaves my hair soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, natural product.</li>
            <li>The conditioner rinsed out easily, leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a strong smell, but nothing pungent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutral: Both this conditioner and its shampoo had a strong scent that reminded me of patchouli even though it does not contain any (perhaps it was the cedarwood and/or cloves?).</li>
            <li>Luckily the Full Volume Shampoo is so nice that I no longer have to use conditioner.</li>
            <li>I do not know if this product has really helped me grow or thicken my hair, but I am very pleased with the conditioning it gives.  </li>
            <li>good for me ingredients, and very important, actually works!</li>
            <li>&quot; If you like earthy scents, you might enjoy this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>:) I use as leave in after shower and as dries leaves my hair soft and very smooth</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, my hair has not been this soft, shiny and full of body in 20 years.</li>
            <li>I tried this product that I originally ordered from another large health food website (which has a lower price), but on that site I would have to purchase $49 to receive free shipping, and their shipping was not always the quickest.  </li>
            <li>I ended uo loving this conditioner more than I expected!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, not to heavy, feels like it rinses off nice and clean, leaves hair soft and tangle free</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells heavenly if you love the scent of natural oils, which I do.  </li>
            <li>I have thrown out many bottles of natural and organic conditioners because my hair felt like straw after using their conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle on thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft, smooth, lustrous and shiny.  </li>
            <li>: I like Andalou Naturals products as they tend to get low hazard scores from the EWG database (http://www.ewg.org/skindeep) by using safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have added this product to my subscribe and save to save a little more money, but to know I also do not have to spend $49 to have this shipped free.</li>
            <li>and I do seem to be losing less hair, however the main reason I gave it 5 stars is because I have had extremely itchy scalp for years and after trying tons of things this has worked best.</li>
            <li>Regardless, this strong scent did not dissipate and always left me feeling</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>After three months of use, I can say that it really works.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the past 3 years and have been very pleased with the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: The scent was really too much for me.</li>
            <li>I still have so much come out every day</li>
            <li>As with other natural/organic shampoos, I notice that optimum benefits come with regular use.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and leaves my natural curls soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Certified organic, cruelty free, Non-GMO, gluten free and made without the typical, traditional cancer causing chemicals, this conditioner works at the hair follicle from the hair’s root to trip.</li>
            <li>This was after I pre-conditioned with coconut oil and used 2x the normal amount of leave-in conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything and was most recently a WEN user until it started to dry out my hair after using for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>I have curly, slightly thinning hair, this helps smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I developed an allergy to alcohol and started using Andalou products because they are all natural.  </li>
            <li>I find this conditioner to work well after shampooing with my natural shampoo bar.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>results with frequent use</li>
            <li>My hair comes out thicker, soft and glossy.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this conditioner would help smooth my hair and tame my flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Not only did it have a strong scent but this conditioner really dried out my hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft but not flat.  </li>
            <li>, a little goes pretty far so doesn&#x27;t feel wasteful.</li>

            <li> If my hair has oil from a few days since my last shampoo or if I&#x27;ve worked in the yard, I use a little Andlou Naturals age defying shampoo to get the worst out, then it takes very little a second time to make sure it is totally clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not a fan of the Age Defying duo, because they smell so powdery.</li>
            <li> I decided to stop using hair products with questionable chemicals in them, however I could not find a product that provided the same cleaning and conditioning the major brands did.  </li>
            <li> I havent noticed any changes in my hair per say, but its just thick enough and smell isnt too off-putting.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, wavy, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> I leave the conditioner on for a few minutes while I bathe</li>
            <li> Last week I switched to a new conditioner and within 3 days I was miserable with itching and had clumps of hair falling out again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful conditioner.  Great price and leaves my hair soft and healthy looking.  Nice body.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> When purchasing the shampoo, always get the conditoiner.  It strengthens your hair to actually reduce breakage and loss.  I notice a lot fewer hairs in my brush.  It&#x27;s a great, natural product.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to alcohol and started using Andalou products because they are all natural.  I ended uo loving this conditioner more than I expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just reordered Andalou Age Defying Conditioner. I leave the conditioner on for a few minutes while I bathe and my hair has the texture and softness it had decades ago. If my hair has oil from a few days since my last shampoo or if I&#x27;ve worked in the yard, I use a little Andlou Naturals age defying shampoo to get the worst out, then it takes very little a second time to make sure it is totally clean. Otherwise, one time is enough. It is more expensive than anything I ordinarily use, but it has lasted for longer than much bigger bottles. I recently purchased it again through Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> So I bought this for hair loss and I do seem to be losing less hair, however the main reason I gave it 5 stars is because I have had extremely itchy scalp for years and after trying tons of things this has worked best. Last week I switched to a new conditioner and within 3 days I was miserable with itching and had clumps of hair falling out again. So I&#x27;m back using it and will not switch again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big big fan of Andalou products! Luckily the Full Volume Shampoo is so nice that I no longer have to use conditioner. I&#x27;m really not a fan of the Age Defying duo, because they smell so powdery. I can&#x27;t say that I saw a difference, so I just don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells heavenly if you love the scent of natural oils, which I do.  It leaves hair soft, smooth, lustrous and shiny.  I&#x27;ve recently begun using this in conjunction with Kiss My Face Every Day Shampoo, and am very happy with results.</li>
            <li> BEST conditioner ever. I have tried everything and was most recently a WEN user until it started to dry out my hair after using for a couple of years. This stuff is amazing, my hair has not been this soft, shiny and full of body in 20 years.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so I have yet to see a difference but I will still give it (4) stars.  Hopefully this will help my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, love this brand! good for me ingredients, and very important, actually works! Smells great, refreshing! works great, a little goes pretty far so doesn&#x27;t feel wasteful. I have curly, slightly thinning hair, this helps smooth it out. :) I use as leave in after shower and as dries leaves my hair soft and very smooth/no frizz.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, not to heavy, feels like it rinses off nice and clean, leaves hair soft and tangle free</li>
            <li> This is really nice.  I havent noticed any changes in my hair per say, but its just thick enough and smell isnt too off-putting.</li>
            <li> I find this conditioner to work well after shampooing with my natural shampoo bar. It keeps my hair hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on thinning hair.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> excellent, well pleased, no complaints</li>
            <li> Good, high-quality conditioner with good results. I have been using it for about a year. It has a bit of a strong smell, but nothing pungent.</li>
            <li> I waited to review the conditioner to see if it lives up to what it claims to do. After three months of use, I can say that it really works. It leaves my hair soft but not flat.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and makes my hair smooth. So far so good</li>
            <li> This product works by reducing the amount of hair you lose and it does a GREAT job.  It took about a month to start working but I swear it&#x27;s reduced my hair loss (e.g. in the shower) by 70%.  Worth every penny and leaves my natural curls soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 years and have been very pleased with the shampoo and conditioner.  I have very long, thick, wavy, color treated hair.  I decided to stop using hair products with questionable chemicals in them, however I could not find a product that provided the same cleaning and conditioning the major brands did.  I do not know if this product has really helped me grow or thicken my hair, but I am very pleased with the conditioning it gives.

I have added this product to my subscribe and save to save a little more money, but to know I also do not have to spend $49 to have this shipped free.</li>
            <li> Caveat: Different hair, different results. This review is based on my experience. I have long, wavy hair that is both fine and thin. I was hoping this conditioner would help smooth my hair and tame my flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I like Andalou Naturals products as they tend to get low hazard scores from the EWG database (http://www.ewg.org/skindeep) by using safe ingredients. The conditioner rinsed out easily, leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: Both this conditioner and its shampoo had a strong scent that reminded me of patchouli even though it does not contain any (perhaps it was the cedarwood and/or cloves?). Regardless, this strong scent did not dissipate and always left me feeling \\&quot;off.\\&quot; If you like earthy scents, you might enjoy this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not only did it have a strong scent but this conditioner really dried out my hair. It felt like straw and my flyaways were out of control. This was after I pre-conditioned with coconut oil and used 2x the normal amount of leave-in conditioner afterwards. I also tried using more of this conditioner - nothing seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: The scent was really too much for me. Plus, it left my hair feeling dry and rough. On to the next product . . .</li>
            <li> One of the best in the Naturals world.</li>
            <li> could feel tingling but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair. I still have so much come out every day</li>
            <li> excellent pdt&lt;br /&gt;true results with frequent use</li>
            <li> Renew. Repair. Regenerate. These are the words on the front bottom of the bottle and I believe that is what it does. Certified organic, cruelty free, Non-GMO, gluten free and made without the typical, traditional cancer causing chemicals, this conditioner works at the hair follicle from the hair’s root to trip. I definitely notice the difference whether I use it with the conditioner or not. My hair comes out thicker, soft and glossy. As with other natural/organic shampoos, I notice that optimum benefits come with regular use. I vary the use of my shampoo/conditioners and still it works. I like that my hair doesn’t acquire a greasy feel and limp look to it just hours after use unlike some traditional shampoos I’ve used for the same job.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great conditioner that does the job it’s supposed to do. Couple with or without the matching shampoo, I’m happy with it and recommend it to anyone looking for a thickening shampoo for fine and/or thinning hair while doing good things for the environment, animals and oneself.</li>
