            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Thank you for an amazing product!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still in perfect shape despite many household moves, my kids, and time.  </li>
            <li>Maybe good for storing make up color themes,</li>
            <li>Good seller...</li>
            <li>Holds everything I need to get ready every morning!  :D  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m replacing it because it yellowed with age and doesn&#x27;t look nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing organizer that fits perfectly on my bathroom counter without taking up too much space.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy that I chose this particular cosmetic organizer.</li>
            <li>This product is sturdy and has many compartments.</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many make-up organizers over time and none of them compare to this one.</li>
            <li>I love this costmetic organizer.</li>
            <li>Love it, strong plastic.</li>
            <li>amazed how many bottles I could fit on this display...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an amazing organizer that looks good on any vanity or sink, and will last literally decades.</li>
            <li>It fits on the desk or in the cabinet and everything is easy to locate.</li>
            <li>This is pretty handy - I don&#x27;t have to dig around to find a makeup item.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Can hold many brushes&lt;br /&gt;Rounded corners for clean, comfortable look</li>
            <li>I am always pleased when products arrive quickly.  </li>
            <li>The only things I would have liked is more space for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Great to have makeup organized and plenty of room too - and fits on my limited space counter with my mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was delighted to find this same model for sale on Amazon, and snapped it up.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product overall, and definitely pleased with the shipping.  </li>
            <li>The product has smooth edges, but doesn&#x27;t hold very much.  </li>
            <li>This organizer serves my makeup storage needs very adequately; it has enough storage sections of divided sizes and heights to accommodate most makeup products and tools.</li>
            <li>I am using it in another way right now</li>
            <li>This item is exactly what you order.  </li>
            <li>This has so many compartments in it that I can easily stack all my everyday makeup that I use.  </li>
            <li>Although it is a good quality product it had too many small holes, more for lipstick and little objects and not enough large for eye shadow and blush.  </li>
            <li>This really helps.  </li>
            <li>The color is kind of strange too, like an eggshell or yellow cream color.</li>
            <li>They keep  everything very handy and organized--also the old one has many other uses such as paint brush storage and small  workshop items as well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this specifically for the non sharp edges so as to protect my daughter&#x27;s vanity from becoming scratched.  </li>
            <li>It shipped faster than expected but it was cheap plastic looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size for all the daily needs of a woman - 12 shallow wells for lipstick and concealer sticks or nail clippers; 8 deeper wells for eyeliner pencils, tweezers, mascara tubes, makeup brushes and emery boards; and three larger wells at the front for compacts, foundation, eyeshadows and other necessities.  </li>
            <li>There are many slots to insert the long pencil eye liners and shadows, other slots for lipstick and mascara, brushes.</li>
            <li>Large enough for all of my makeup though.</li>
            <li>I bought this exact makeup organizer in the early 1980s, and have used it every single day for for over 30 years.  </li>
            <li>I keep a couple of small pots of face cream in two of the larger wells, and can fit all my compacts in the other one by standing them on their sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product came sooner than delivery date, I recommend this product to anyone that is into make-up. This product is sturdy and has many compartments. I love it!!!!</li>

            <li> I am a nail polish junkie...&lt;br /&gt;Change my color every other day!&lt;br /&gt;Was amazed how many bottles I could fit on this display...</li>
            <li> My counter in the bathroom was a mess.  So bad, I did not even know what I had.  This really helps.  Everything stands out.  It does not take up a lot of space.  Gives you different spaces, different widths.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for years--and it looked like it. They keep  everything very handy and organized--also the old one has many other uses such as paint brush storage and small  workshop items as well.</li>
            <li> Great organizer.  Great gift for daughters and granddaughters. Get one for home and one for dorm room. Great for all ages.</li>
            <li> This is pretty handy - I don&#x27;t have to dig around to find a makeup item.  Everything is neat and organized and in plain view.</li>
            <li> Although it is a good quality product it had too many small holes, more for lipstick and little objects and not enough large for eye shadow and blush.  I am using it in another way right now and like it a lot.  I put my unopened lotion bottles in it and my razors and extra brushes.  It serves this purpose on a shelf well.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what you order.  I love it and would recommend to anyone.  This is a great buy!</li>
            <li> It shipped faster than expected but it was cheap plastic looking. Large enough for all of my makeup though. The color is kind of strange too, like an eggshell or yellow cream color.</li>
            <li> The perfect make up organizer.  I bought this to sit on my vanity and its a great size.  Not too large or too small, keeps my make up organized where I can see everything at once.  Will work well on a dresser or bathroom counter as well.</li>
            <li> Was so happy to get this!  It&#x27;s an amazing organizer that fits perfectly on my bathroom counter without taking up too much space.  Holds everything I need to get ready every morning!  :D  Thank you for an amazing product!  &amp;#60;3</li>

            <li> Have tried many make-up organizers over time and none of them compare to this one. There are many slots to insert the long pencil eye liners and shadows, other slots for lipstick and mascara, brushes. and still plenty of room for blushes and liquid foundation. Definitely recommend for the &amp;#34;neat freaks&amp;#34; out there.</li>
            <li> I love this costmetic organizer. It fits on the desk or in the cabinet and everything is easy to locate. Great price.</li>
            <li> This has so many compartments in it that I can easily stack all my everyday makeup that I use.  It&#x27;s made of study plastic but lightweight.  I keep mine under my cabinet when not using and place it on sink when I am.  The only things I would have liked is more space for eyeshadow. Besides that, it&#x27;s one of the best organizational items I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> Love it, strong plastic. well made, The only thing is it can be bigger.</li>
            <li> Great space-saver and organizer!</li>
            <li> I am always pleased when products arrive quickly.  I purchased this specifically for the non sharp edges so as to protect my daughter&#x27;s vanity from becoming scratched.  The product has smooth edges, but doesn&#x27;t hold very much.  Expensive for such a small item.  Maybe good for storing make up color themes, one for each theme.  I am pleased with the product overall, and definitely pleased with the shipping.  Good seller...&lt;br /&gt;dimensions&lt;br /&gt;12\\&quot; long&lt;br /&gt;6\\&quot; deep&lt;br /&gt;5\\&quot; tall in the back&lt;br /&gt;2\\&quot; tall in the front&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Can hold about a dozen lip colors&lt;br /&gt;Can hold many brushes&lt;br /&gt;Rounded corners for clean, comfortable look&lt;br /&gt;Can hold a few compacts in the small front cups&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Small for my make up collection&lt;br /&gt;Only one color, would like to see other colors options (petty personal preference really not a con)</li>
