    <ol>
            <li> I used this during the summer to help get rid of discoloration.  It is working slowly, I like the earthy scent.  I may purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and heals wounds on the spot..</li>
            <li> I Always used this cream one of my classmate introduced me when I was in College and it Always Helped my face from breaking out and made my face smooth I used this one and Fair and lovely cream love it both!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I never stick to products that dont work. I cant tell you how many half used items I&#x27;ve just tossed.  This is cheap  I figure what the h I&#x27;ll try it.  It got rid of some redness from acne scars at first then it kept treating my combo skin. I do a little in the morning and at night.  The sandlewood scent is a plus!  I do a dab and leave it to dry on a zit and its gone almost overnight.  NEVER has something worked this well on my skin. hate that the price keeps increasing cause of dr. oz other than that no complaints.  BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Could not really see a difference in my skin. I don&#x27;t know if it takes a while to show or maybe I did not use it long enough. I have not use it in a few weeks. May try it again</li>
            <li> I noticed this cream (I&#x27;m pale, but I&#x27;m also yellow and red toned) makes me look yellow. So much so that people comment on how I look like I have jaundice. That&#x27;s hindered me from using it anymore to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guy, the smell makes me smell like a chick, so eh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is okay. I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. But I suppose if you are a bit tanner, it wouldn&#x27;t stain your skin. This of course has turmeric in it, which is good but I&#x27;d rather opt for something else.</li>
            <li> Do not waste  your  money. This cream does not work!! It does not clear any of the dark marks on my complexion.</li>
            <li> I got this 2 weeks ago and made me break out. Now, I&#x27;m still trying to clear my face. I used to have severe acne and got clear. Now I&#x27;m battling it again. It may work for some but it didn&#x27;t work for me. It smells very flowery too.</li>
            <li> Great  for facial complexion. Have not really had facial acne since using this product for over 20 years. Outstanding.</li>
            <li> Vicco Tumeric is a good healing product for the skin, and not expensive.Tumeric is in all cases a healthy product.</li>
            <li> VICCO TUMERIC VANISHING CREAM is THE BEST Thing that EVER happened to My Face. I am a Skin Care Addict. LITERALLY!!! I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING &amp; I MEAN EVERYTHIIIIIIIIIIIING!!  But THIS Cream FAR surpasses them ALL!!  It smells AMAZING. Gorgeous Aromatherapy for Your FACE.  &#x3D;Its EXTREMELY POWERFUL yet VERY gentle for ALL SKIN TYPES &amp; CONDITIONS. It absorbs perfectly into Your Skin IMMEDIATELY. &amp;#34;Vanishing Cream&amp;#34; is a PERFECT explanation.  It instantly calms Your Skin down &amp; Tones it beautifully.  I have VERY Sensitive &amp; NOT2mention VERY Oily Skin. THIS HAS CHANGED MY COMPLEXION ENTIRELY!!!  It&#x27;s PHENOMENAL!!  I can&#x27;t say ENOUGH about it!!  My Mother In Law gave it to Me. Her Best Friend is a Very Well Respected Ayervedic Esthetician. I was sceptics at 1st BECAUSE I&#x27;ve tried COUNTLESS Skin Care Products. But I&#x27;m AMAZED.  &#x3D;I found it on Amazon for My Best Friend who is having chronic skin problems &amp; can NOT believe The Price!!! EXTREMELY AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE!!!  ~Now THIS is an UNBELIEVABLE  Company NOT OUT 2Rip ANYONE off in ANY Way Shape or Form!!!  I was EXPECTING it to be VERY Expensive...BASED on it&#x27;s incredible performance &amp; benefits. NEVER EXPECTED IT TO B SOOOOOOOO CHEAP!!!  I&#x27;m absolutely dumbfounded &amp; shocked in THE MOST POSITIVE WAY POSSIBLE!!!  &#x3D;I wish EVERY Company had THESE Standards!!  ~THIS CREAM &amp; It&#x27;s COMPANY is #1 HANDS DOWN, W/O A DOUBT THE BEST I&#x27;VE EVER ENCOUNTERED!!! IN MY LIFE!!!  &#x3D;YOU WILL NOT EVEN REMOTELY B DISAPPOINTED IN ANY WAY!!!! NOT EVEN IN THE TINIEST BIT!!!  ....NI KNOW WHAT I&#x27;M TALKING ABOUT!! ...I&#x27;ve gone to THE EXTREME in THE PAST.  Now I don&#x27;t have to!! I got it ALL right in THIS Tube!! :D</li>
            <li> If you are prone to shaving bumps, this is a good product.  I would tend to have sensitive skin, and after shaving, be red, and have bumps.  If I put this cream on it prevents them.  Turmeric is a natural anti-inflammatory, so this just makes sense.  It pulls heat away from the skin.  A cheaper, healthier alternatives to many chemical products.</li>
            <li> the smell doesnt bother me, i like it. this product lightened my red spots on my face from squeezing pimples lol. ew i know, before i used the cream my pimples were already gone, what the cream did was even out my tone, and lighten the red spots to match my skin color. its a good product ladies.</li>
            <li> Meet the requirements .....</li>
            <li> Tubes [2] are very small but for the price - that&#x27;s ok! Received it earlier than expected and as long as prices are not hiked exaggeratedly, I should keep purchasing the product. We&#x27;ll have to see how it goes from here.</li>
            <li> This VICCO product is usually very good, and I purchase it often locally, but I threw away this particular order.  I received 1.76 ounces instead of the 2.12 ounces that was listed for sale, 20 percent less than was ordered, according to the manufacturer&#x27;s label which shows 50 grams. (2.12 ounces is 60 grams).  Manufacturer&#x27;s label also says &amp;#34;FOR SALE ONLY IN INDIA, MAURITIUS AND SAARC COUNTRIES&amp;#34;, but I am in the USA.  Manufacturers label also lists ingredients that are totally different from the US version that I buy locally for lower net price.  Because of these issues, I decided to not trust this particular shipment so discarded it.  BUYER BEWARE.</li>
            <li> like this cream, and it feels very soothing to skin.  strong, but pleasant, smell shortlived.  have not used long enough to comment on long term effects.</li>
            <li> otherwise i am still experimenting if it has any effect. I guess it does since i see my pimple reduce quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a month since i got cream im now seeing a big difference in my skin, im not as oily as i used to be my acne is under control and the dark spots are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i also had real bad chafeing on my thighs vicco helped with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i use a drying cream if i feel a zit coming on. but my skin so smooth and soft, the next time i order it will be more that one tube. it smells great to me,  it come unscented.&lt;br /&gt; I recommend this to anybody who dealing with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Soft smooth zit free skin gives a beautiful even tone to skin</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on brown spots</li>
            <li> Smells great but not effective</li>
            <li> Tried many cream, ointments and such to clear my skin condition--even some prescribed and none worked. This seems to be clearing up my problem!! Thank- You!!</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully on my face--and at a bargain price.</li>
