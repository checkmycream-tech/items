            <li>Though it is a very nice balm.</li>
            <li>Amazing lip balm!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done both successfully.</li>
            <li>This product would be good for layering, maybe apply before wearing lipstick.</li>
            <li>always feel good.</li>

            <li>one of my favorite lip balms/chapsticks of all time!  </li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my lips!</li>
            <li>Very good, and It&#x27;s worth to have a 2-pack.</li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;ve just exfoliated your lips and they are smooth, this product would be great to use.</li>
            <li>Not as amazing as I had hoped from DHC.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of like vaseline except a bit thicker and smoother.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear lipstick, Chapstick, any kind of gloss, anything like vasoline, cortisone,  carmax, lip toners.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s fragrance-free and leaves a nice sheen without ever being sticky.</li>
            <li>I have been a DHC user for many years and have loved just about everything I have ordered and tried.</li>
            <li>Have tried many others but this is really the best</li>
            <li>Chapstick would be more effective.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lip balm I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I used to have no problem with lipsticks until I was in my 30&#x27;s, I especially loved mattes, but must have developed atopic dermatitis along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>This is the best lipstick I have used so far.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent.</li>
            <li>very smooth and soothing to the lips</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the best, but I really like it and the shape of it is cool.</li>
            <li>I love DHC.</li>
            <li>Perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li>So glad I searched the day I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe 3 months at most if used sparingly.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased the 2 pack.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s a cream, maybe more of a gloss.</li>
            <li>i love that there&#x27;s no scent or taste to it</li>
            <li>It is helpful for my lip,early I bought it in store,this time I bought on amazon,just ok ,so I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this lip cream...</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Smooth with a nice, not-too-shiny glow.</li>

            <li>I wish that it smelled better though because it smells like crayons to me.</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>like it preserves lips and has a lovely shine</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this lip cream.</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm that I always gets when I&#x27;m in Japan.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best lip treatment I&#x27;ve ever used - and I&#x27;ve tried all of them over the years, from the lowly Vaseline and Aquafor, to the higher-end stuff that costs $20+ a tube.  </li>
            <li>Wow, the best lip gloss ever, smooth, creamy.</li>
            <li>I love the waxy feeling of these lip balms.</li>
            <li>Most important, the product works well to moisturize with no tingle and without having to reapply often</li>
            <li>This very simple, elegant lip cream hydrates beautifully.</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips smooth, moisturized, and healthy, without having to be re-applied every two minutes.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly and was just what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Hands down best lip balm.</li>
            <li>Product arrived fine.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s really worth the money, but I really love it hahah.</li>
            <li>I like how it feelsâ€“a bit waxy and smooth.</li>

            <li>Smooth lip balm.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free, not oily on the lips</li>
            <li>Very happy with the easy to use slender lipstick design for my small purse.</li>
            <li>As mentioned, the rich formula has mammoth staying power.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>Love this lip cream it really works.</li>
            <li>I think I am one of those people that has &amp;quot;problem lips,&amp;quot; and that I may never find a balm that I really, truly love.</li>
            <li>That says a lot, considering that I have a box full of lip balms/treatments that haven&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li>but this is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>The first time I got this, I just adored it; great moisture that lasted long and seemed like it stood up to the heat</li>
            <li>The first application was so smooth</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more!</li>
            <li>so when I smile a lot, they tend to get chapped.</li>
            <li>Still hunting for the right one.</li>
            <li>It has great moisture and is also a great base for lipsticks.</li>
            <li>But if you use sparingly, it won&#x27;t do much to your lips!</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used this product.  </li>
            <li>still like regular Chapstick better...</li>
            <li>I like the fact that there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; or fragrance- just plain and simply good.</li>
            <li>I think these really seal in the moisture and protect from outside exposures with the strong barrier.</li>
            <li>Gets used up fast because of its material, so</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like their products and read the reviews for this one</li>
            <li>Not oily at all, and at a reasonable price though.</li>
            <li>This works really well as a lip balm.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very soothing with no scent.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the cold Minneosta weather.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Expected better I guess.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have this, its very soft and creamy, very moisturizing!  </li>
            <li>just ok, doesn&#x27;t last long on your lips, gives a nice sheen, not very moisturizing</li>
            <li>will definitely be purchasing more in the future!!</li>
            <li>and it really moisturize your lips with a soft touch!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this</li>
            <li>I attribute it to the high percentage of lanolin and lanoline oil in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as the case goes, it is extremely sturdy and able to take all sorts of bouncing and jostling in my purse.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and gives my lips a healthy sheen.</li>
            <li>It glides on so smoothly and lasts longer than any other chap sticks or creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But I have super dry lips</li>
            <li>My lips were so chapped, I was exfoliating allot more than usual.  </li>
            <li>At first, I hated the smell, but it is the best lip cream out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It moisturizes and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li>was looking for a product to last longer and provide intense moisture.  </li>
            <li>Instead, my lips remained soft all day.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed that sometimes even if I do not put it on, my lips are still soft.</li>
            <li>Keeps lips soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I have used that did not leave my lips dry after 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>really hydrates my dry / chapped lips</li>
            <li>and it really nourishes my dry lips for hours.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and lips, so moisturizing is a real priority.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give full 5 stars is because it is much smaller than I had expected.</li>
            <li>This Lip Cream has seemed to totally repair my lips and make them soft again with no cracks.  </li>
            <li>This balm in a stick is heavy enough to feel creamy and protective, yet light enough to go either under or over lip stick or stain.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is kind of small, one tube usually lasts me for 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly dry lips all the time, in any climate, and this product keeps them consistently soft and plump without having to reapply often.</li>
            <li>My lips are always dry and frequently chapped.</li>

            <li> I attribute it to the high percentage of lanolin and lanoline oil in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as the case goes, it is extremely sturdy and able to take all sorts of bouncing and jostling in my purse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and gives my lips a healthy sheen.</li>
            <li> It glides on so smoothly and lasts longer than any other chap sticks or creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I have super dry lips</li>
            <li> My lips were so chapped, I was exfoliating allot more than usual.  </li>
            <li> At first, I hated the smell, but it is the best lip cream out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and lasts pretty long.</li>
            <li> was looking for a product to last longer and provide intense moisture.  </li>
            <li> Instead, my lips remained soft all day.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that sometimes even if I do not put it on, my lips are still soft.</li>
            <li> Keeps lips soft and moist.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product I have used that did not leave my lips dry after 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li> really hydrates my dry / chapped lips</li>
            <li> and it really nourishes my dry lips for hours.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and lips, so moisturizing is a real priority.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give full 5 stars is because it is much smaller than I had expected.</li>
            <li> This Lip Cream has seemed to totally repair my lips and make them soft again with no cracks.  </li>
            <li> This balm in a stick is heavy enough to feel creamy and protective, yet light enough to go either under or over lip stick or stain.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is kind of small, one tube usually lasts me for 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry lips all the time, in any climate, and this product keeps them consistently soft and plump without having to reapply often.</li>
            <li> My lips are always dry and frequently chapped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a neurotic number of lip balms, and I have a few second favorites, but I seriously can&#x27;t LIVE without this stuff.</li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, stays on and is super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> However, it works so well that I&#x27;d rather pay $60 dollars a year for a product that works reliably rather than $30 dollars every few months trying something new in hope of a cure.</li>
            <li> two or three hours after you put them on, they wore off and left your lips dry (even when you were not drinking or eating).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long-lasting, odor and tasteless and works magic when applied before bed each night.</li>
            <li> I used to use this for long when I was in Japan.</li>
            <li> I use DHC lip cream for a long time, and it keeps my lips</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not my concern, as long as my lips are moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it has strange smell which I can not take at all.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would end the days of severe dry lips.</li>
            <li> My lips would peel, bleed and get so dry that I would apply a lip product every 10 min or so.</li>
            <li> This product works so well for my dry lips, it does not cake up on lips.</li>
            <li> My lips were peeling and very dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this product is that fact that one tube only last about 6-8 weeks, which is a real bummer.  </li>
            <li> This is probably the only lip balm that I&#x27;ve tried that works in harsh winters.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times daily, and it&#x27;s lasted about three weeks at this point, with plenty to go.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the narrow tube, I like the tube the same size as the container.</li>
            <li> Nice base for lipstick.</li>
            <li> After less than a month, I was able to wear matte lipstick again, something I had previously given up as impossible for my lip texture.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll use for layering and I&#x27;ll use it on my cuticles and moisturizing other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands that &amp;#34;medicate&amp;#34; and then leave your lips drier than before you used the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lipstick-like applicator also makes it convenient to carry in your purse or pocket for daytime use, but, don&#x27;t worry, you will not have to apply it frequently as is necessary with ordinary lip balms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad days when my lips are super dry and chapped (like bleeding) and this helps alot-</li>
            <li> This product is very thick but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Ware this everyday.</li>
            <li> Winter is the worst, with the low humidity, but any time of the year, if I so much as touch any product to my lips, they start peeling a couple days later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I am a chapstick fanatic, it was the only lip chap I could use for my lips because it is so thick.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a huge change and would recommend this to anyone who suffers with dry skin in the cold weather.</li>
            <li> This product contains a generous amount of Lanolin and very little &#x27;junk&#x27; filler.</li>
            <li> solution to use this without gagging from the smell was to add a small drop of peppermint or lavender oil.</li>
            <li> but it seems just an ordinary chapped lip sort of item.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 10yrs</li>
            <li> I ordered this product toward the end of a very long, cold winter.</li>
            <li> Moisture and subtle shine ,luv!</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This lip cream works well as a base before applying your lipstick.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love DHC. This lip balm gives your lip a bit shine and mega moisture.  I used to use this for long when I was in Japan. Amazing lip balm!</li>
            <li> Gets used up fast because of its material, so I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s really worth the money, but I really love it hahah.</li>
            <li> The first time I got this, I just adored it; great moisture that lasted long and seemed like it stood up to the heat well...&lt;br /&gt;But mine is now starting to smell almost like mildew and spoiled milk. I don&#x27;t know if it was because of the heat, but I&#x27;m in California, you can&#x27;t avoid it, especially when you&#x27;re supposed to be walking around with this in your pocket or purse.&lt;br /&gt;My solution to use this without gagging from the smell was to add a small drop of peppermint or lavender oil.</li>
            <li> These give great sheen and have no scent.  Perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to try it.  My lips were so chapped, I was exfoliating allot more than usual.  Now that I have this, its very soft and creamy, very moisturizing!  So glad I searched the day I bought it.  Really good stuff!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give full 5 stars is because it is much smaller than I had expected. This won&#x27;t last long. Maybe 3 months at most if used sparingly. But if you use sparingly, it won&#x27;t do much to your lips! This lip cream is great though. I am glad I purchased the 2 pack. It is best when used before sleeping. It moisturizes and lasts pretty long. But I have super dry lips so when I smile a lot, they tend to get chapped. This isn&#x27;t the best, but I really like it and the shape of it is cool. I like how it feelsâ€“a bit waxy and smooth. It isn&#x27;t like a cream texture. It is kind of like vaseline except a bit thicker and smoother. I like it overall... Just wish it was a bit longer.</li>
            <li> No problem with shipping but do not care for product at all.</li>
            <li> I really like their products and read the reviews for this one but it seems just an ordinary chapped lip sort of item.  And, I didn&#x27;t get 2 either.</li>
            <li> It was just so-so.  did not keep my lips moisturized.  Still hunting for the right one.</li>
            <li> So moisturizing. I love it</li>
            <li> Just purchased this lip cream of the 2nd time. Very happy with the easy to use slender lipstick design for my small purse. Most important, the product works well to moisturize with no tingle and without having to reapply often</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that it&#x27;s a cream, maybe more of a gloss. I was looking for a product that would end the days of severe dry lips. My lips would peel, bleed and get so dry that I would apply a lip product every 10 min or so. My lips would even burn. This product is very thick but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. It didn&#x27;t penetrate through the layers of skin. This product would be good for layering, maybe apply before wearing lipstick. Also, if you&#x27;ve just exfoliated your lips and they are smooth, this product would be great to use. Nevertheless, I like the ingredients and I&#x27;ll keep this, I&#x27;ll use for layering and I&#x27;ll use it on my cuticles and moisturizing other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> Ware this everyday. Great under lipstick</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used this product.  Met all my expectations.  Would definitely recommend this product to all my friends.  Nice base for lipstick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s O.K.  Just didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a product to last longer and provide intense moisture.  This wasn&#x27;t it. I feel like i need to reapply after 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to my Bert&#x27;s Bees.  Chapstick would be more effective.</li>
            <li> This very simple, elegant lip cream hydrates beautifully. It has a very light scent. Unlike other brands that &amp;#34;medicate&amp;#34; and then leave your lips drier than before you used the product.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite lip balms/chapsticks of all time!  i was on accutane for a several months and my lips got so chapped and none of the lip balms/chapsticks that i tried out were keeping my lips moisturized.  then a friend recommended DHC to me and after even ONE day, i was hooked!  i love that there&#x27;s no scent or taste to it and it immediately provides great moisture.  will definitely be purchasing more in the future!!</li>
            <li> I use DHC lip cream for a long time, and it keeps my lips always feel good. Very good products.</li>
            <li> I am a chapstick fanatic, it was the only lip chap I could use for my lips because it is so thick. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this but I was wrong. It is very thick, stays on and is super moisturizing. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lip balm I&#x27;ve used. It stays put and does a good job at keeping my lips moisturized. This is probably the only lip balm that I&#x27;ve tried that works in harsh winters. It&#x27;s not tacky to use in spring or summer time either.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great...it actually works.</li>
            <li> Use this several times daily.</li>
            <li> It is helpful for my lip,early I bought it in store,this time I bought on amazon,just ok ,so I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried this, please do.  It is a smoothing lip cream.</li>
            <li> This product works so well for my dry lips, it does not cake up on lips. I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent line of cosmetic products; my wife loves all of their products which are the mainstay of her cosmetic repertoire.</li>
            <li> Not as amazing as I had hoped from DHC.  But it works; it&#x27;s a lip balm. I&#x27;ll use them but probably not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product toward the end of a very long, cold winter. My lips were peeling and very dry. The first application was so smooth and I noticed a huge change and would recommend this to anyone who suffers with dry skin in the cold weather.</li>
            <li> very smooth and soothing to the lips</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this lip cream...It glides on so smoothly and lasts longer than any other chap sticks or creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Love the product, it keeps my lips moistened throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s not moisturizing at all. Save your money and by some carmex. It also tastes like rubber/gloves</li>
            <li> Excellent lip protection at a very reasonable price! Enriched with lanolin and olive oil, this lip protection goes beyond a balm. It&#x27;s long-lasting, odor and tasteless and works magic when applied before bed each night. It&#x27;s lipstick-like applicator also makes it convenient to carry in your purse or pocket for daytime use, but, don&#x27;t worry, you will not have to apply it frequently as is necessary with ordinary lip balms. As mentioned, the rich formula has mammoth staying power. (One caution: do not leave it in your car during warmer months; it will melt)</li>
            <li> At first, I hated the smell, but it is the best lip cream out there.&lt;br /&gt;I stack this lip cream all the time!</li>
            <li> Great as always!!!! 4th time ordering!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this lip cream it really works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a decade. It keeps my lips smooth, moisturized, and healthy, without having to be re-applied every two minutes. Love it.</li>
            <li> great great lip cream! i have been using it for years and it really moisturize your lips with a soft touch! Not oily at all, and at a reasonable price though.</li>
            <li> just ok, doesn&#x27;t last long on your lips, gives a nice sheen, not very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I bike all year and run outside in all weather. When I travel, this lip cream goes with me before I pack a toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;My lips are fabulous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this product. I was looking for a healing, lip improving product. I&#x27;m not convinced this is it. Though it is a very nice balm. Smooth with a nice, not-too-shiny glow. Product arrived fine. Not melted.</li>
            <li> Smooth lip balm.  will order it again</li>
            <li> This Lip Cream has seemed to totally repair my lips and make them soft again with no cracks.  Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This works really well as a lip balm. Keeps my lips hydrated and shiny. I wish that it smelled better though because it smells like crayons to me.</li>
            <li> If this cures my cracked, split ,bleeding bottom lip, I will buy a million of &#x27;em! I can&#x27;t wear lipstick, Chapstick, any kind of gloss, anything like vasoline, cortisone,  carmax, lip toners. I&#x27;ve tried olive oil, lotion, water soaked cloth. Nothing. Winter is the worst, with the low humidity, but any time of the year, if I so much as touch any product to my lips, they start peeling a couple days later. I used to have no problem with lipsticks until I was in my 30&#x27;s, I especially loved mattes, but must have developed atopic dermatitis along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will see with this product. I will be updating!</li>
            <li> I think I am one of those people that has &amp;quot;problem lips,&amp;quot; and that I may never find a balm that I really, truly love. This one, however, is the only one that I have EVER used until it&#x27;s gone, and then reordered again and again! That says a lot, considering that I have a box full of lip balms/treatments that haven&#x27;t worked for me. I like that it&#x27;s fragrance-free and leaves a nice sheen without ever being sticky. I literally have one of these everywhere: in my purse, in my nightstand, in the kitchen, in my desk at work. LOVE!</li>
            <li> its verygood my GF like a lot!</li>
            <li> Moisture and subtle shine ,luv!</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive...still like regular Chapstick better...</li>
            <li> Not what I had in mind.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my constant chapped lips. It goes on just like a lip balm and it&#x27;s very soothing with no scent. It&#x27;s long lasting and gives my lips a healthy sheen. I have tried various chapsticks and aquaphor but this is my absolute favorite. Will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> Love it! Perfect for the cold Minneosta weather. Thank-you!</li>
            <li> This is the best lipstick I have used so far. I have very dry lips and I have tried a lot of products before but all of them had the same problem: two or three hours after you put them on, they wore off and left your lips dry (even when you were not drinking or eating). This is the first product I have used that did not leave my lips dry after 2-3 hours. Instead, my lips remained soft all day. Now I use it every night before I go to sleep and every morning before putting on make ups, and I have noticed that sometimes even if I do not put it on, my lips are still soft. That&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.  Thanks so much. It arrived very quickly and was just what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This lip cream works well as a base before applying your lipstick. The lines appear softer.</li>
            <li> really hydrates my dry / chapped lips</li>
            <li> like it preserves lips and has a lovely shine</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this lip cream. The sale price is a great deal. I have been a DHC user for many years and have loved just about everything I have ordered and tried.</li>
            <li> This product contains a generous amount of Lanolin and very little &#x27;junk&#x27; filler. I have incredibly dry lips all the time, in any climate, and this product keeps them consistently soft and plump without having to reapply often. I&#x27;ve tried a neurotic number of lip balms, and I have a few second favorites, but I seriously can&#x27;t LIVE without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my lips!</li>
            <li> Great lip cream.  Keeps lips soft and moist.  Will keep this as a permanent staple in my daily cleaning and makeup routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 10yrs and it is superior  to all the others. Never greasy .it glides on.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm that I always gets when I&#x27;m in Japan. It&#x27;s fragrance free, not oily on the lips and it really nourishes my dry lips for hours. Have tried many others but this is really the best</li>
            <li> Hands down best lip balm. I&#x27;ve had bad days when my lips are super dry and chapped (like bleeding) and this helps alot-actually in 2 days my lips were fully recovered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on a bit shiny but that&#x27;s not my concern, as long as my lips are moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of small, one tube usually lasts me for 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> i bought this Lip cream which is made in Japan before. I prefer the Japanese one. This one is no as oil as the Japanese one.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best lip treatment I&#x27;ve ever used - and I&#x27;ve tried all of them over the years, from the lowly Vaseline and Aquafor, to the higher-end stuff that costs $20+ a tube.  This is definitely superior to all of them - after about a week of using it 24/7, my lips stopped splitting and healed up, only requiring a prophylactic &amp;#34;dose&amp;#34; before bed to maintain my progress.  After less than a month, I was able to wear matte lipstick again, something I had previously given up as impossible for my lip texture.  Truly a miracle worker!  I attribute it to the high percentage of lanolin and lanoline oil in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the case goes, it is extremely sturdy and able to take all sorts of bouncing and jostling in my purse.  The only bad thing about this product is that fact that one tube only last about 6-8 weeks, which is a real bummer.  However, it works so well that I&#x27;d rather pay $60 dollars a year for a product that works reliably rather than $30 dollars every few months trying something new in hope of a cure.</li>
            <li> Wow, the best lip gloss ever, smooth, creamy.</li>
            <li> My lips are always dry and frequently chapped. I keep this lip balm at my desk and in my purse. Great product!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product when I visited my sister in Boston, MA. It has great moisture and is also a great base for lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I love the waxy feeling of these lip balms. The packaging makes it truly a dream to apply lip balm. I think these really seal in the moisture and protect from outside exposures with the strong barrier.</li>
            <li> Expected better I guess. Kinda feels just like Vaseline.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best lip care stick I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used them all. I have dry skin and lips, so moisturizing is a real priority. This balm in a stick is heavy enough to feel creamy and protective, yet light enough to go either under or over lip stick or stain. I&#x27;ve done both successfully. I like the fact that there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; or fragrance- just plain and simply good. I use it a few times daily, and it&#x27;s lasted about three weeks at this point, with plenty to go. And you get two in this package!</li>
            <li> Good product. Moisturize lips. But it has strange smell which I can not take at all.</li>
            <li> It caused allergy on my lip.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  I use as overnight treatment</li>
            <li> I keep one in my car and one in my purse.  A great balm for anytime of day or night.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and shines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and have no complaints. Keeps lips moist and is perfect for preventing bleeding lipstick lines. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Very good, and It&#x27;s worth to have a 2-pack.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the narrow tube, I like the tube the same size as the container.</li>
            <li> Scentless and moisturizing. These remind me of creamy vaseline.</li>
    </ol>
