            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I thought it would be too oily for my skin, but it absorbs immediately and leaves your face beautifully primed for flawless makeup application.</li>
            <li>and it just wasn&#x27;t good for my skin.</li>
            <li>broke my skin out; i kid u not, everything seems to no matter how &#x27;good&#x27; its suppose to be</li>
            <li>Amazing for your skin</li>
            <li>liked the lightness.</li>
            <li>Leave skin very smooth with an uplifting shine.</li>
            <li>i have been a Murad customer for many years, I especially&lt;br /&gt;like Hydrate/Protection, it conditions and maintain hydrated&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Murad Perfecting Serum for years and haven&#x27;t found any product I like better or use more often.</li>
            <li>Love this serum.</li>
            <li>Great product I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>liked the way the product  was easily absorbed into my skin and didn&#x27;t lay on it in an oily sheen.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling so smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>On my second bottle and loving it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and also recommend buying it on Amazon because the price is always better than in-salon.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>These products also moisturize very well and make fine lines and wrinkles disappear.</li>
            <li>But overall really nice</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This serum really hydrates my skin with a fresh, light feeling leaving my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>it actually feels like it dries it out more with the Murad than with just moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love the murad products, especially, the serums and vitamins.</li>
            <li>received the product earlier than expected, nice surprise!</li>
            <li>I found that it&#x27;s a better hair frizz smoother and pre-blow dry protector.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my skin</li>
            <li>After you clean and moisturize your skin, lightly apply this serum that has a silicone-feel, almost a little oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It has really made a difference on my 60 year old face.</li>
            <li>Alsi I had some very deep white heads that didnt show much, but always bugged me.</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and get really dry.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this in hopes of it locking in moisture and after reading tons of good reviews I thought I finally found something that would actually work but to my disappointment it does not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a bad bottle of this serum.</li>

            <li> i have been a Murad customer for many years, I especially&lt;br /&gt;like Hydrate/Protection, it conditions and maintain hydrated&lt;br /&gt;and feels fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I received the product earlier than expected, nice surprise!</li>
            <li> I bought this last year and it just wasn&#x27;t good for my skin. While it didn&#x27;t break me out, per se, it did leave my face ruddy looking and developed some nasty bumps. I found that it&#x27;s a better hair frizz smoother and pre-blow dry protector. Also, when I use it on my hair, it doesn&#x27;t break my skin out the way some of the smoothing serum do that are marketed for frizz control and shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Murad Perfecting Serum for years and haven&#x27;t found any product I like better or use more often. After you clean and moisturize your skin, lightly apply this serum that has a silicone-feel, almost a little oily feeling. The first time I used it I thought it would be too oily for my skin, but it absorbs immediately and leaves your face beautifully primed for flawless makeup application. Highly recommend this product and also recommend buying it on Amazon because the price is always better than in-salon.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000GDC4HS Murad Perfecting Serum, 3: Hydrate/Protect, 1 fl oz (30 ml)]]</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, and what a great deal!  The shipment came as expected and on time...no muss no fuss!  I am very happy!</li>
            <li> broke my skin out; i kid u not, everything seems to no matter how &#x27;good&#x27; its suppose to be</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over 25 years ...I use only Murad cleansing products and use this product after cleansing in the morning and before bed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in hopes of it locking in moisture and after reading tons of good reviews I thought I finally found something that would actually work but to my disappointment it does not. It did absolutely nothing for my skin it actually feels like it dries it out more with the Murad than with just moisturizer. Also under make up it tends to look cakey.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. It has really made a difference on my 60 year old face. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the murad products, especially, the serums and vitamins. The serum makes my face feel like vervet or satin. I&#x27;d buy it more if it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a bad bottle of this serum. Not only was the smell off, but there was a little piece of what looked like mold floating in the serum.</li>
            <li> OMG I have spent soooo much money on skin care this year, its insane. And I finally found the ticket. I use the Murad Resurgence cleanser, perfecting serum and either the day or night cream as well. It had changed the texture of my skin and the pore size and color in a very short time. Alsi I had some very deep white heads that didnt show much, but always bugged me. Well they are gone with no picking! I would never have thought. I did not get the trial size stuff off the tv commercial with Joan Lundun. I just jumped in here at Amazon and bought the aforementioned products plus a couple of adjunct products by Murad. These products also moisturize very well and make fine lines and wrinkles disappear.</li>
            <li> liked the way the product  was easily absorbed into my skin and didn&#x27;t lay on it in an oily sheen. liked the lightness.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Leave skin very smooth with an uplifting shine.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff! On my second bottle and loving it!</li>
            <li> This serum really hydrates my skin with a fresh, light feeling leaving my skin very soft.  I have really dry skin so I can&#x27;t begin my day without it!  Does not leave any oily residue.</li>
            <li> Amazing for your skin</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for dry skin.  I live in the desert and get really dry.  Great primer before your foundation.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for at least 15 years and will never switch to anything else. Great product I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves skin feeling so smooth and hydrated. Lost a star for price. A little expensive. Not a moisturiser, you use it  over so you&#x27;ll have the expensive of that also. But overall really nice</li>
