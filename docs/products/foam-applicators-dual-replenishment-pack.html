            <li> I had thrown away my old Neutrogena machine as I was unable to find the foams. Now I found the foams and unfortunately unable to use them as I am having a bit of troubles getting the applicator I had ordered online.     So, I have not used them. But they are the same. I can&#x27;t comment on their performance. Not yet.</li>
            <li> The unfortunate thing about this product is it hardens after several uses, but it is necessary to have these pads in order to use the dermabrasion equipment.  These really should be available in stores.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000K9Z3Y4 Foam Applicators- Dual Replenishment Pack]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam applicators were inexpensive but of good quality.  I bought them, because they looked like they would fit a Neutrogena Microdermabrasion applicator, and they do.  They arrived within a week of ordering them from Earth Therapeutics.</li>
            <li> These applicators fit the old Neutrogena microdermabrasion base perfectly, and they are much more reasonably priced than using Neutrogena&#x27;s new applicators.</li>
            <li> WooHoo...I appreciate the other reviewer&#x27;s comments and HAPPILY took the plunge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are wonderful replacements and of course I ordered 2 packs cheaper than the RANSOM for the DISCONTINUED Neutrogena foam applicators [[ASIN:B000P1QK0S Neutrogena Advanced Solutions Soft Foam Sponge Heads (REFILLS)]]. Finding the exfoliation cream is more difficult. Look what else I found... [[ASIN:B000K6KARM Green Tea Cellular Renewal Micro-Exfoliation Cream]] AND  [[ASIN:B000KBFV44 Rejuva-Lift Professional Skin Renewal]]. I ordered the cream, I&#x27;ll  submit a review after I try it. The cream doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum which was one of the problems with many microderm creams. Since I already own too many skin care devices I didn&#x27;t buy the tempting kit, but it is a great gift idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many effective Neutrogena products/product lines being discontinued, I&#x27;ve been a little creative.

Happy Hunting finding yours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3/17/2011 These also fit [[ASIN:B000V2DLJO Neutrogena Healthy Skin Rejuvenator, The Anti-Aging Power Treatment Kit]] in addition to it&#x27;s OLDER [[ASIN:B000BI3Q20 Neutrogena Advanced Solutions At Home MicroDermabrasion System]]</li>

            <li> This replacements fit the older Neutrogena Microdermabrasion Scrubber tool perfectly! Great foam heads. Absolutely genius :) Now you can buy them for $5.00each including shipping, instead of trying to hunt the packs down with one starting at $20.00!</li>

            <li> These are for the \\&quot;Youthful Essence\\&quot; system. They will not fit any other. Do not buy if you own any system other than \\&quot;Youthful Essence\\&quot; by Susan Lucci.</li>
            <li> very good for scrubbing your face and chest area. soft and durable and a good size for every day use.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for replacement foam applicators for my neutrogena products, but couldn&#x27;t find them until now. I like the foam much better than the brush replacement heads, they seem to be much more efficient in bringing new cells to the top layer of my skin.</li>
