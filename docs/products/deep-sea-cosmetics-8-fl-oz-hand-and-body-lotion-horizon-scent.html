            <li>I also love the smell of the \\&quot;Horizon\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>wife &amp; daughter love it</li>
            <li>Like most people, I got bombarded at the mall kiosk with the nail buffer and the lotion.</li>
            <li>That is some indication that they love what it does...</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed every time I used this product because it smells great and soft.  </li>
            <li>I loved how the lotion smelled but for about $60, it definitely wasn&#x27;t happening there.</li>
            <li>i have seen this sell for much more in stores and specialty shops,will buy more in the future</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty powerful scent but not necessarily in a bad way.</li>
            <li>This protect is light and makes your skin soft &amp; smooth within the first use.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on your face.</li>
            <li>...will definitely purchase more from this company</li>
            <li>I mostly use it as my facial moisturizer now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  a great moisturizer and is so light you only need to use a small amount to cover a large area.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion; it is so helpful in our dry climate (Utah).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so smart for finding out about it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light while still being creamy enough to work well.</li>
            <li>It is very subdued and isn&#x27;t perfumery at all.</li>
            <li>thanks alot</li>
            <li>The smell is still pleasant but it has a little extra something in it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this companies hand lotions however i don&#x27;t feel like this works well on very dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The smell takes us right back to the Keys every time she uses it.</li>
            <li>This was a brand new scent for me</li>
            <li>Kept her hands silky all through the New England winter.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself seemed a bit more watery than past bottles I&#x27;ve gotten</li>
            <li>The other hand cream is wonderful, but expensive.  </li>
            <li>This hand and body lotion is so-so and pretty much indistinguishable from other hand and body creams.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida where heavy lotions are tend to make you sweet &amp; feel greasy once you go out side.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Deep Sea Cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>It was just new and different and took some time getting use to.</li>
            <li>Loved the product but wasn&#x27;t crazy about the horizon scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still the only brand of lotion I will ever use for my face because it dries so quickly and cleanly; never any greasy feeling</li>

            <li> Loved the product but wasn&#x27;t crazy about the horizon scent.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this lotion! It&#x27;s light while still being creamy enough to work well. I live in Florida where heavy lotions are tend to make you sweet &amp; feel greasy once you go out side. This protect is light and makes your skin soft &amp; smooth within the first use. I also love the smell of the \\&quot;Horizon\\&quot;. I have allergies but not bothered by the scent. It is very subdued and isn&#x27;t perfumery at all. Once you put the lotion on the scent is barley noticeable. Everything about this lotion is grate. You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you buy it.</li>
            <li> great product  wife &amp; daughter love it i have seen this sell for much more in stores and specialty shops,will buy more in the future</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion which I use for my face and body. It feels like silk and has a nice scent. The product quality is superb and the price unbeatable.</li>
            <li> my hubby had purchased this potion for me at our local mall....I was sad when I had used all of it...&lt;br /&gt;I looked for it on Amazon and was thrilled to find it...will definitely purchase more from this company&lt;br /&gt;when I run out again.</li>
            <li> did not like the smell at all. lotion is ok but could not get past the weird smell. others may like it but I didnt</li>
            <li> hello i bought these for my wife and she&#x27;s very happy she will buy from you again for sure  thanks alot</li>
            <li> This Hand Cream is excellent!  When you apply it you notice it isn;t greasy and the orer is not strong.&lt;br /&gt;When my friends come over they always compliment me on the hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;They try to sell you Deep Sea Cosmetics at the Mall and it comes in a kit, low and behold you could end-up paying $200.00 for it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Deep Sea Cosmetics.  It is very gentle on your face.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed every time I used this product because it smells great and soft.  I have four of them and will order again if they runs out.  The service were great.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this companies hand lotions however i don&#x27;t feel like this works well on very dry sensitive skin. It is good for every day use and having nice smooth smelling skin.</li>
            <li> Like most people, I got bombarded at the mall kiosk with the nail buffer and the lotion. I loved how the lotion smelled but for about $60, it definitely wasn&#x27;t happening there. I eventually remembered to check online and found it a lot cheaper. I just received my lotion today and it smells different and it&#x27;s a lot runnier that at the mall. The smell is still pleasant but it has a little extra something in it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this personally, but I know that our teen girls keep running out and I have to keep reordering.  That is some indication that they love what it does...whatever that may be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To a man...it&#x27;s a mystery...all the creams, lotions, oils...but when they find one they love...that allows a man to say \\&quot; I told you you would love this!  I&#x27;m so smart for finding out about it.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This was a brand new scent for me and I&#x27;ve been using Deep Sea lotion for years. It&#x27;s a pretty powerful scent but not necessarily in a bad way. It was just new and different and took some time getting use to. The lotion itself seemed a bit more watery than past bottles I&#x27;ve gotten but, again, nothing too crazy. It&#x27;s still the only brand of lotion I will ever use for my face because it dries so quickly and cleanly; never any greasy feeling and you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at an excellent price. I love this lotion; it is so helpful in our dry climate (Utah). The scent is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> First bought some on a trip to Florida and was happy to see I could get it here. The wife is addicted to it&lt;br /&gt; Kept her hands silky all through the New England winter. The smell takes us right back to the Keys every time she uses it. Non greasy. Dry hands or a mental vacation this is the stuff to have</li>
            <li> I had bought this product at a kiosk at the mall and it was sold in a kit for hand use and also had other products in the kit for buffing and shining your fingernails.  This lotion is so good I use it in areas on my arms, legs or any other places I have skin irritations.  I mostly use it as my facial moisturizer now.  The actual size of the tube is not 8 fl oz, but rather 6.8 fl oz.  It&#x27;s  a great moisturizer and is so light you only need to use a small amount to cover a large area.</li>
            <li> This product is ok. I think that it costs to much for the small amount that you get, so I would not buy anymore.</li>
            <li> My fault, I guess, for buying this lotion instead of the hand cream, which comes in a much smaller bottle.  The other hand cream is wonderful, but expensive.  This hand and body lotion is so-so and pretty much indistinguishable from other hand and body creams.</li>
            <li> I had purchase this product in the mall before; however the online purchase did not smell the same and I was somewhat not pleased.</li>
