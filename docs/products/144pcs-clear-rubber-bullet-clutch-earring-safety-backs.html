            <li>They are so handy to have around</li>
            <li>And so far so good!!</li>
            <li>These backings are very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>and i am in love with it....</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>These are comfortable and leaves my mind worry free!</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on and remove</li>
            <li>They fit snugly and are easy to put on and remove.  </li>
            <li>and I love that they are clear!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Worth a try for a buck though.</li>
            <li>These bullet clutch safety backs work very well on earrings............</li>
            <li>They slide off the earring wire far too easily, so they barely helped keep my earrings on at all.</li>
            <li>these would be okay, but they don&#x27;t work well on typical earrings.</li>
            <li>They do not pinch your ears and are very soft.  </li>
            <li>I am always losing the backs of my costume jewelry and these have worked on every pair so far.</li>
            <li>The earring backings came on time and as expected, along with a cute little keychain!</li>
            <li>These feel like hard plastic instead of pliable silicone and not all of my earring wires fit into them.</li>
            <li>I always tend to lose the back of my earrings and came across these clear rubber clutch.</li>
            <li>but kind of small for clumsy fingers.</li>

            <li> very small and hard to get on</li>
            <li> I needed some backings for some fishhook earrings that had a tendency to fall out, but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>

            <li> I had loose so many expensive earings i was like..i need to fix this issue. I saw this and i am in love with it....just perfect...and they are so many for a good price....</li>
            <li> 144 For that price is great, you cant beat it! These are comfortable and leaves my mind worry free! No more losing earrings and I love that they are clear!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always running out of backs for my earrings or losing them. This was the perfect product for me and the price was awesome!</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly and these are great to use on all types of earrings.</li>
            <li> Now I won&#x27;t lose my hook earrings and I have replacements for my others!</li>
            <li> These bullet clutches are very small and at first I didn&#x27;t think they would work for the varied styles of earrings i have in my store.  They fit snugly and are easy to put on and remove.  I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these because earring backs are always getting lost.  These are an inexpensive alternative to the metal spring backs.</li>
            <li> very small and hard to get on</li>
            <li> I like that I got what I ordered just like how it was described however you can find it cheaper</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! Need them for my wire drop earrings. Almost lost one of my favorites . Wearing them today!</li>
            <li> These backings are very comfortable.  They do not pinch your ears and are very soft.  I have thrown away all of my metal backings and only use these.</li>
            <li> These clutch backs are too small. I bought them to replace the backs on some of my post earrings.  They are about the same size as the clutches that come with the earrings.  I bought these because I have big fingers.  I thought they would be esier to handle they are not.  The price is so low I will not bother to return them.</li>
            <li> I needed some backings for some fishhook earrings that had a tendency to fall out, but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. They slide off the earring wire far too easily, so they barely helped keep my earrings on at all. Maybe if you had thicker wires than usual these would be okay, but they don&#x27;t work well on typical earrings.</li>
            <li> I threw them in the garbage. Did not fit any earings!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Works on any earrings. Great purchase!!!</li>
            <li> The earring backings came on time and as expected, along with a cute little keychain! &#x3D;) Thank you!</li>
