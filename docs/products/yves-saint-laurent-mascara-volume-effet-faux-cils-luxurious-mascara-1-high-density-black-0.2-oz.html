            <li>My daughter in law turned me own to this mascara</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t dock any points for this because to be quite honest</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>so I love mascara that can lengthen without clumping and volumize without clumping.</li>
            <li>I love the look that this mascara gives my lashes.</li>
            <li>love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>But overall I&#x27;m really really impressed.</li>
            <li>so well I had to re-learn how to apply -- one sweep of the wand is sufficient --- more than</li>
            <li>This one holds up better than most in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting much better based on the reviews but mine was full of clumps and did not work well!</li>
            <li>It does a good job adding volume and is very lengthening as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>

            <li>The results are fabulous.</li>
            <li>There is a slight fragrance to it, however, I find it to be very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>first thing that caught my attention was the stylish gold tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll save it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not water proof, but so far it has great staying power, much better than my previous experience with not-waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>I have found some that I love that do a fabulous job of lengthening but it makes my eyelashes look like little sticks, so then I will layer on a volume mascara on top of that one and get the effect that I like.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I got a complimentary sample for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many mascaras and this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>have tried many different types of mascaras, both high end and drug store, some I love, while others I will use once and never again...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new formula is loaded with vitamins and actually feels good on.  </li>
            <li>one is better; adds volume, length and gives look of natural full soft define</li>
            <li>The girls at my local counter suggested this to me, and I&#x27;m so glad I tried.</li>
            <li>First, let me just say that I received this product complementary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the price I would have expected more.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, really defines the lashes.  </li>
            <li>Really does make your eyelashes go on forever.</li>
            <li>But, with my change in eyesight, and an increasing chemical sensitivity over the years, I&#x27;d dropped using mascara since I couldn&#x27;t really see what I was doing</li>
            <li>It is much longer than what I&#x27;ve used, and the balance makes it very maneuverable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on very well ---</li>
            <li>Much better than any other I have tried</li>
            <li>Overall it is really rich in color and gives you length</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used mascara more one days since buying this than I have in the previous 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A definite must-have.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but not great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but not great.</li>
            <li>But as I kept dipping the wand and applying my eyelashes grew super long.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really need mascara to darken, but my eyelashes are short</li>
            <li>The fragrance may be a consideration for others with extremely sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>This mascara gives you almost a FAKE LASHES look with your own lashes...Makes them much fuller looking  adn also longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a faithful (and satisfied) user of basic drug store brands in the past.</li>
            <li>I tried this in the regular formula where I normally wear waterproof.  </li>
            <li>Just beware of the fragrance for people with extra sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of make-up, so I have tried over ten different brands trying to achieve that jaw-dropping look.&lt;br /&gt;Yves</li>
            <li>It is very buildable and the smell is unlike any other mascara smell that I have come across.</li>
            <li>A comment in some magazine article made this one worth a try, although it&#x27;s well over my usual price</li>
            <li>A bit dry - it seemed old.</li>
            <li>have a decent amount of lashes which are plenty long, but they are nearly invisible despite my dark hair coloring.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After reading great reviews from makeup artists and others, I decided to give this mascara a try. I love it. It lengthens and thickens lashes beautifully.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t as impressed as my friend was with this mascara.  For the price I would have expected more.  It&#x27;s good, but not great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not great.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara junkie. I love mascara&#x27;s. I have dark eyelashes so I don&#x27;t really need mascara to darken, but my eyelashes are short so I love mascara that can lengthen without clumping and volumize without clumping. Faux Cils Mascara does just that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My prior beauty secret was to layer mascaras. I have found some that I love that do a fabulous job of lengthening but it makes my eyelashes look like little sticks, so then I will layer on a volume mascara on top of that one and get the effect that I like. But it takes 2-3 different mascaras to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not with Faux Cils Mascara though. I can just use this one product and my eyelashes aren&#x27;t stiff, aren&#x27;t clumpy, but they are long, fanned out and have so much volume. I love the look that this mascara gives my lashes. It is very buildable and the smell is unlike any other mascara smell that I have come across. It smells fresh. I have been using this mascara everyday for the past week or so and it has been the only one I use. That is crazy for a mascara layering queen like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very pleased with Faux Cils Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*disclaimer- I got a complimentary sample for testing purposes. I was not compensated for my honest review. All thoughts are my own.</li>
            <li> love this mascara.  It goes on easily, really defines the lashes.  Much better than any other I have tried and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many mascaras and this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;This one is better; adds volume, length and gives look of natural full soft define lashes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to remove. Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> The girls at my local counter suggested this to me, and I&#x27;m so glad I tried. It makes your lashes curl up and lengthen. It doesn&#x27;t cause them to sit flat or drop.  If you&#x27;re looking for a mascara that retains that just done luck, this is a great one to go with.  The results are fabulous.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product to try with Influenster&#x27;s VoxBox and I love this stuff! It does not clump and looks great!</li>
            <li> A bit dry - it seemed old.</li>
            <li> My wife said it&#x27;s the proper one.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this mascara. I was expecting much better based on the reviews but mine was full of clumps and did not work well!</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> This mascara gives you almost a FAKE LASHES look with your own lashes...Makes them much fuller looking  adn also longer. My daughter in law turned me own to this mascara and I love it!</li>
            <li> Overall it is really rich in color and gives you length but it does get clumpy through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;Now knowing that I am not totally agreeing on the price of the product.</li>
            <li> Gave it away to a friend. ..</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. Really does make your eyelashes go on forever. FIVE STARS ON PRODUCT QUALITY. When I first opened it I tough it was a joke... because the wand was so chunky. But as I kept dipping the wand and applying my eyelashes grew super long. It does flake off a little by the end of the night or if I sleep with it on. But overall I&#x27;m really really impressed. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so crazy expensive!!! FOUR STARS ON PRICE. But will I buy it again...? Probably. I&#x27;ll save it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> this mascara war dry when it come, it is very disgusting and abominable, i will never buy this product again!</li>

A comment in some magazine article made this one worth a try, although it&#x27;s well over my usual price category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW - using this (applying and wearing) is so wonderful that I now rarely leave the house without putting this on. I&#x27;ve used mascara more one days since buying this than I have in the previous 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think part of the reason is the length and heft of the wand. It is much longer than what I&#x27;ve used, and the balance makes it very maneuverable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula also works for me. It&#x27;s not water proof, but so far it has great staying power, much better than my previous experience with not-waterproof mascara. (The humid days of summer will be the next test.) It goes on very well --- so well I had to re-learn how to apply -- one sweep of the wand is sufficient --- more than that is too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a decent amount of lashes which are plenty long, but they are nearly invisible despite my dark hair coloring.</li>
            <li> I believe the eyes is very important part of perfecting that flawless look. The eyes the pathways to the soul, so if you&#x27;re not wearing the perfect mascara - you look will fall flat.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that caught my attention was the stylish gold tube. I&#x27;m new to the world of make-up, so I have tried over ten different brands trying to achieve that jaw-dropping look.&lt;br /&gt;Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) Mascara Volume Effet Faux Cils is the best mascara out in the market today.&lt;br /&gt;Yves Saint Laurent Mascara Volume Effet Faux Cils makes my lashes appear longer than what they are. There&#x27;s no clumping, no smudging, and it&#x27;s easy to remove. A definite must-have.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> First, let me just say that I received this product complementary for testing and review purposes from Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different types of mascaras, both high end and drug store, some I love, while others I will use once and never again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is very very good!

There is a slight fragrance to it, however, I find it to be very pleasant.  The fragrance may be a consideration for others with extremely sensitive eyes.  I will have to say that it didn&#x27;t bother mine at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara holds up very well and doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake for at least 8 hours.  After 8 hours I did notice it transfer below my eyes.  I didn&#x27;t dock any points for this because to be quite honest I tried this in the regular formula where I normally wear waterproof.  I am a student and also work so my days are extra long.  I have not found a regular formula mascara that does not transfer after several hours.  This one holds up better than most in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion this formula is a hit and have no problem recommending it to others to try.  Just beware of the fragrance for people with extra sensitive eyes.</li>
