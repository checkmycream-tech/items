            <li>I&#x27;d be willing to bet you wouldn&#x27;t be buying many of those items at the end of those 30 days, lol.</li>

            <li>So glad</li>

            <li>Still a nice product absorbed in well.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the original hempz lotion and wanted to try the rest.</li>
            <li>Nice smell for men or women, very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>The cream gets absorbed into you skin and does not just sit on top.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for the feet, and has helped so much to relieve my dry cracked heels and calluses....</li>
            <li>A lot like the original and seeming to help with my post preggo looseness after one week of use.</li>
            <li>Product is great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my &amp;#34;go to lotion&amp;#34; it makes my skin so nice</li>
            <li>there is no oil like other lotions and has a pleasant light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I also mix it w the original ;)</li>
            <li>I really reccommend this wonderful cream to all you mature ladies with dry, aging skin.</li>

            <li>Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>As with most things, moderation seems to be the key.</li>
            <li>On the plus side its very creamy and smooth feeling on my skin, not greasy, leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I was not that crazy about the smell (strong) because it clashed with perfumes, even though it smells great.</li>
            <li>Received much sooner than I was expecting to considering that I&#x27;m in the UK.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone do not buy from Ulta!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and it is not oily, absorbs completely and the sent is very light and pleasing for those sensitive to highly scented products like myself.</li>
            <li>My favourite is the original floral banana scent which I mistakenly thought I ordered recently.  </li>
            <li>As a middle aged male living in a very arid climate this lotion is great.</li>
            <li>Found it at Amazon for more than $10.00 less.</li>
            <li>I particularly like it on my face after shaving.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both the product and ordering from this supplier.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion hands down!</li>
            <li>I really do see some \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; effects on my 63 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>am sure it may be fine for others, but unfortunately, it did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>and when I tried the a new bottle it came out like water.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin &amp; hands feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>like it better than the much more expensive facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this not knowing if it would be actual product or generic b/c pricing at Ulta store was more than double.</li>
            <li>Soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling soft, velvety and supple all day long.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft fragrance that reminds me of baby powder.  </li>
            <li>it kept my hands a feet soft at burning man</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and never had this happen before with any lotion.</li>
            <li>It smells like old people.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive nose to smell and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They sell old stuff and refuse to refund.  </li>
            <li>Note the label on this bottle with the name throught the hemp leaf--that denote an old product.  </li>
            <li>and they said this was probably an old old product.  </li>
            <li>So far, Hempz is #1 in my book!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i worked in a tanning salon for a few years and was able to try out a lot of different lotions.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I still had a pump from a previous bottle that I use in its place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bone marrow cancer survivor and know how important it is to be as informed as possible about the effects of what I put in, on, as well as subject, my body to.</li>
            <li>I really do like this lotion my skin is really dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing such an improvement, and in only a few days, so I can imagine how much more improvement will occur with regular use.  </li>
            <li>As veteran of tanning salons, I am always on the lookout for a decent moisturizer that actually works and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling waxy, oily or sticky.  </li>
            <li>I have had this in the distant past and really enjoyed it</li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised that I bought a smaller version for my bag and will just refill when needed.  </li>
            <li>I personally found the studies informational but not alarming.</li>
            <li>FYI, many common, widely used, over-the-counter products have potential adverse effects on the human body,&lt;br /&gt;In</li>

            <li> FYI, many common, widely used, over-the-counter products have potential adverse effects on the human body,&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after using other items from this same maker and I found this item is much thinner then the other products I used.  </li>
            <li> and it last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Skin just doesn&#x27;t stay moisturized as long as I think it should.</li>
            <li> I occasionally use it on my face when winter is playing rough with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> When my other bottle started getting low</li>
            <li> I use this lotion during the day, and I do find my dry skin softer.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Looking for a wonder cream that will tackle my severely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for any of the other Hempz moisturizer fragrances but will continue to use the Age Defying fragrance as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Soothes the skin and never causes pimples or other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> Nope its still like yucky water down moisture cream.</li>
            <li> read the reviews warning of liver toxicity due to the ingredient Comfrey (Symphytum Officinal), and did a little research myself.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the bottle it comes in the pump fails when there is still 1 1/2 inches left.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I was VERY UNHAPPY.  </li>
            <li> and it is hard to find</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have a bad smell and it makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> at least, I did.</li>

            <li> Product is great for dry skin.  Smells good and stays with you all day.  Age-defying, not so sure, but extremely good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after using other items from this same maker and I found this item is much thinner then the other products I used.  The smell isnt as awsome as the \\&quot;All day moisturizer\\&quot; either.  Still a nice product absorbed in well. Think I will stick with the \\&quot;All Day Moisturizer\\&quot; though</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s a rich creamy lotion that makes your skin feel  wonderful. Great price, and the supplier got the shipment to me in record  time. I highly recommend both the product and ordering from this supplier.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion!  My daughter got it for me for Christmas and I became instantly addicted to it.  It has a soft fragrance that reminds me of baby powder.  Soaks right in and leaves my skin feeling soft, velvety and supple all day long.  Not a hint of greasiness either.  I&#x27;m even using it on my face and  like it better than the much more expensive facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve been using.  I really do see some \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; effects on my 63 year old skin.  It&#x27;s wonderful for the feet, and has helped so much to relieve my dry cracked heels and calluses....I&#x27;m seeing such an improvement, and in only a few days, so I can imagine how much more improvement will occur with regular use.  I really reccommend this wonderful cream to all you mature ladies with dry, aging skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Love the smell. Received much sooner than I was expecting to considering that I&#x27;m in the UK. gret doing business with you. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Best lotion out there.  Nice clean scent, non-greasy, works well winter and summer.  I occasionally use it on my face when winter is playing rough with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> does not supply the moisture I need. I does smell good and and does deliver nutrients into the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great and felt soothing to the skin. I was not that crazy about the smell (strong) because it clashed with perfumes, even though it smells great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;ve found one that&#x27;s better and cheaper. Love the smell of this though!</li>
            <li> I think this lotion is very good, and I like the cream in the jar the best, and Ii put it on before bed.  I use this lotion during the day, and I do find my dry skin softer.  I do recommend this.  ait has a nice fragrance, and upi wo;; see a different if you use it every day.  I like it!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way my skin feels. I thought it was for my face also but wonder if it is really.&lt;br /&gt;I use coconut oil at night because I&#x27;m afraid to clog my pores. Would love to know if it is safe for my face also??????????</li>
            <li> i will buy this again it kept my hands a feet soft at burning man so what more can i say also it smells good and it not greasy at all yadda yadda yadda</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful lotion - very hydrating, great smelling, not sticky, fast drying..absorbs right into skin. This lotion hydrates for 12 hours - no doubt! My favorite lotion hands down!</li>
            <li> As a middle aged male living in a very arid climate this lotion is great. No smell moisturizes w/out the residue. My only complaint is the bottle it comes in the pump fails when there is still 1 1/2 inches left.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Moisturuzes, non greasy, smells good. Leaves your skin feeling sift and subtle.  I recommend this product to use.</li>
            <li> I really do like this lotion my skin is really dry and this lotion is the best.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a bad smell and it makes my skin soft and it is hard to find&lt;br /&gt;good lotion that works but this does and it last for a long time.</li>
            <li> absolutely great. will continue to buy this product because it truly makes my face, neck, arms, legs feel really good</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It makes my skin &amp; hands feel very soft.  Amazon pricing is great on this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion made me break out.  I do not have sensitive skin and never had this happen before with any lotion. am sure it may be fine for others, but unfortunately, it did not work for me.  If only rating on seller and shipper and not the product, then I would give a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin. I needed a product that would solve this problem for me. A friend told me about Hempz so I decided to try it. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love all hempz lotion.wish they made something to help your hair grow, now that would be great .more like a miracle</li>
            <li> A lot like the original and seeming to help with my post preggo looseness after one week of use. Will def buy again. I also mix it w the original ;)</li>
            <li> Love the scent of the Hempz Age Defying Herbal Body Moisturizer. I discovered this lotion about five years ago in a beauty supply store. I don&#x27;t care for any of the other Hempz moisturizer fragrances but will continue to use the Age Defying fragrance as long as they make it. I don&#x27;t wear perfume so am disappointed the lotion&#x27;s fragrance doesn&#x27;t have a lasting effect as some lotions do. The moisturizer has a good consistency and absorbs into the skin nicely with no greasy film. The downside to this purchase was the way it arrived at my home. The box was dented and the plastic pump was broken and nonfunctional. Luckily, I still had a pump from a previous bottle that I use in its place. Hempz, if you are listening, please do not discontinue the Age Defying fragrance or formula.</li>
            <li> First time tryng this. Like it alot...</li>
            <li> Love the Hempz lotions, don&#x27;t like the smell of this one.  I just combine it with the pomegranate or the watermelon for a better smell.&lt;br /&gt;But love that they have an age defying option through Hempz.</li>
            <li> Looking for a wonder cream that will tackle my severely dry skin.  I&#x27;m not noticing any difference yet.  I&#x27;ll keep trying</li>
            <li> I have had this in the distant past and really enjoyed it but this time its just so so. Doesn&#x27;t smell too strong, but ok. Skin just doesn&#x27;t stay moisturized as long as I think it should.</li>
            <li> Ordered this not knowing if it would be actual product or generic b/c pricing at Ulta store was more than double. It is exactly the product I was looking for at excellent price! Nice smell for men or women, very moisturizing! Will be purchasing more of the same! Highly recommend to anyone do not buy from Ulta! Thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> THIS CREAM JUST ABSORBS INTO YOUR SKIN AND HAS A PLEASENT SMELL. I WILL ORDER IT AGAIN, AND I SUGGEST YOU DO TO. THAN YOU WILL SEE WHAT I AM SAYING</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I was VERY UNHAPPY.  Hempz is usually thick and creamy. The bottle Supre sent me was like water. So now it sits. I thought I had come up with a great idea. When my other bottle started getting low I poured it in the waterery one in hope it would make that bottle thicker. Nope its still like yucky water down moisture cream. Even the smell was different.  So beware.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks. It smells like old people. Not at all good smelling like Hempz original moisturizer. I chose it because the reviews said it had no smell but that was obviously a lie. I love the smell of the original hempz lotion and wanted to try the rest. Disappointed with this one hempz. On the plus side its very creamy and smooth feeling on my skin, not greasy, leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> I love these products.</li>
            <li> i worked in a tanning salon for a few years and was able to try out a lot of different lotions. i have sensitive nose to smell and sensitive skin. once i found this lotion, i never bought anything else. there is no oil like other lotions and has a pleasant light fragrance. some would say it&#x27;s &#x27;unscented&#x27; but everything has it&#x27;s own scent.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years. It&#x27;s exceptional. I particularly like it on my face after shaving. Soothes the skin and never causes pimples or other skin irritations.</li>
            <li> This is just the best. Nice size &amp; goes on so nice. Not greasy &amp;&lt;br /&gt;smells great. I have been looking for something like this for awhile&lt;br /&gt;&amp; got a sample at my salon.  So glad</li>
            <li> This is by far my &amp;#34;go to lotion&amp;#34; it makes my skin so nice and it smells great to .</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!  The hemp oil makes this cream very easy to absorb, and it lasts all day...</li>
            <li> Put this on after a shower or, if your hands are always in water and it actually softens your skin.  I was so pleasantly surprised that I bought a smaller version for my bag and will just refill when needed.  This product is wonderful.  The cream gets absorbed into you skin and does not just sit on top.  You feel the difference and will see a difference in your skin.....at least, I did.</li>
            <li> Whatever you do don&#x27;t buy this product from this supplier XXXXXX.  They sell old stuff and refuse to refund.  I have been using this lotion for years and love it.  I bougth it on May 28 2014 and when I tried the a new bottle it came out like water.  I can get something better than that from a Dollar store.  Note the label on this bottle with the name throught the hemp leaf--that denote an old product.  I called Hempz products from another bottle and they said this was probably an old old product.  Be very aware as a consumer!!</li>
            <li> college student&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have loved Hempz since it was first marketed.  My favourite is the original floral banana scent which I mistakenly thought I ordered recently.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the vanilla musk, the scent of the age-defying moisturizer which is why I only gave the product four stars. However, regardless of the scent, the product does wonderful things for the texture and feel of my skin.  As veteran of tanning salons, I am always on the lookout for a decent moisturizer that actually works and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling waxy, oily or sticky.  So far, Hempz is #1 in my book!&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews warning of liver toxicity due to the ingredient Comfrey (Symphytum Officinal), and did a little research myself.  I&#x27;m a bone marrow cancer survivor and know how important it is to be as informed as possible about the effects of what I put in, on, as well as subject, my body to. I personally found the studies informational but not alarming. We all need to come to our own conclusions, of course. Try reading and familiarizing yourself for a month with every ingredient in every product you buy.  I&#x27;d be willing to bet you wouldn&#x27;t be buying many of those items at the end of those 30 days, lol. FYI, many common, widely used, over-the-counter products have potential adverse effects on the human body,&lt;br /&gt;In any case, Hempz makes great lotions and I, for one, plan to continue to use them!  As with most things, moderation seems to be the key.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion at my hair salon. I didn&#x27;t want to pay the $27.00 they were asking. Found it at Amazon for more than $10.00 less. Great product! I suffer from skin issues at times and this has not added but helped me! My skin is so soft and it is not oily, absorbs completely and the sent is very light and pleasing for those sensitive to highly scented products like myself. I use it for my over all body lotion. I will definitely re-order! I recommend the Hempz product line to all!</li>
