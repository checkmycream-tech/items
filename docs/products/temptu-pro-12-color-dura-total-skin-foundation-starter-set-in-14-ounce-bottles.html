            <li>Love, them still playing with all of the colors</li>
            <li>Dries very, very quick.  </li>
            <li>I use this product everyday and it looks beautiful!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The makeup is beautiful and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>but so far so good, the pigments work so well with my machine.</li>
            <li>The liquid itself is a great quality and will not wash off easily, which tells me that it will stand the test of long hour days and sweat.</li>
            <li>The way to remove the product or clean your airbrush gun from it is to use 90% alcohol through iy.</li>
            <li>I like the coverage, but I wish I had seen that the makeup was silicone based before I tried to clean my airbrush with water like the instructions told me to.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll need a special cleaner to remove it.</li>
            <li>tones are dis colored and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as full.</li>

            <li>If it&#x27;s clogging your machine use it at a higher speed/pressure&lt;</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Very upset I can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li>It dries fast because it&#x27;s ALCOHOL based (think about it)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Sometimes for a couples mins straight.</li>
            <li>I received the package in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Will probably buy the special cleaner, but will be switching to a water based makeup next time.</li>
            <li>makeup however does dry in the airbrush gun quick, so i use alcohol between mixing colors.</li>
            <li>It not wet, but it doesn&#x27;t give that super dry feel like water based does.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t get it on your face fast enough before it dries clogging up your airbrush.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want this near a clients face.</li>
            <li>the bottles were smaller than I thought and the product was hard to mix other than that they were great</li>
            <li>Im having a hard time using this produce in the airbrush machine, its drying up in the machine, and I cant clean it out.</li>
            <li>However, it is hard to clean it from your wand.</li>

            <li> ON THE BODY and is designed to last a few days .</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with this product after i apply it on my face with my compressor it takes way to long to dry</li>
            <li> An extreme waste of money.</li>
            <li> using a few drops of 70% or LESS % of alcohol will do the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Package looked very old and colors settled to bottom of bottles and shaking them to blend was extremely difficult.</li>
            <li> I seen a lot of 1 star ratings and got a little scared.</li>
            <li> Iv used several airbrush makeups but this is the WORST thick sticky cracks and gets oily after like a hour makes everyone look like 20 years older on top of fake looking</li>
            <li> A few of the products were dried up</li>
            <li> When it did arrive the colors look almost dried out.</li>
            <li> or you makeup has dried in the gun,</li>
            <li> It completely RUINED my EXTREMELY expensive airbrush.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am disappointed and will probably not be ordering from this seller again because I have seen all the other negative reviews (wish I would have looked sooner) and this seller still sells the product.</li>
            <li> My purchase is now a week late and still have not received it.</li>
            <li> Product is thick and clogs up airbrush machine , can&#x27;t even use it</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This make up is not good! I purchased based on the reputation of temptu, however this is so thick it clogged my airbrush machine! And it lasted for about an hour before it started cracking on my face. Definitely don&#x27;t buy. It will be a waste of your money!!!</li>
            <li> There is alcohol in the foundation!</li>
            <li> Arrieved on time and they are good for the price</li>
            <li> This product is not at all satisfying !&lt;br /&gt;The tones are dis colored and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as full. I believe one(toffee) is empty ! I will NEVER order this again.</li>
            <li> the bottles were smaller than I thought and the product was hard to mix other than that they were great</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it. This is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used. And they customer service was a joke</li>
            <li> I have a Belletto studios airbrush makeup system and it clogs my stylus.  Can&#x27;t even use the product, I tried once and couldn&#x27;t get it to pass through. Very upset I can&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but through trial and error I found that I prefer water based airbrush makeup instead of silicone base as these are.</li>
            <li> A few of the products were dried up</li>
            <li> Terrible. I have prime and didn&#x27;t receive for a week and I needed it sooner. When it did arrive the colors look almost dried out. Colors in bottle have separated and will not mix back when shaken. Absolutely horrible. This is the Airbrush makeup I&#x27;ve always used and I love the makeup, but do not order from this seller. Bad bad bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased w the results. I would like for the kit to include some blush/ lip colors this would make it very nice!!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of silicone foundations. They clog up my machine. It&#x27;s like blowing pieces of balloon on a client&#x27;s face....I honestly wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for! I seen a lot of 1 star ratings and got a little scared. Let me makes others feel more at ease.&lt;br /&gt;1. If it&#x27;s clogging your machine use it at a higher speed/pressure&lt;br /&gt;2. It dries fast because it&#x27;s ALCOHOL based (think about it)&lt;br /&gt;3. It NEEDS to be shaken... Sometimes for a couples mins straight. You have to do it with any airbrush makeup&lt;br /&gt;*If you have any problems cleaning your gun or you makeup has dried in the gun, using a few drops of 70% or LESS % of alcohol will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup is beautiful and lasts a long time. Still need to use a setting powder cuz it gives that tacky feel afterwards. It not wet, but it doesn&#x27;t give that super dry feel like water based does.</li>
            <li> The makeup goes on perfect and smooth. With all the colors you can match any skin tone and the makeup lasts a long time. The price was also unbeateable.</li>
            <li> Useless without pods to fill.</li>
            <li> Quality is not so great.  Package looked very old and colors settled to bottom of bottles and shaking them to blend was extremely difficult. I would trying looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love this make up!!!  I received the package in a reasonable amount of time. I use this product everyday and it looks beautiful! It covers any blemishes without looking caked on. Recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> My purchase is now a week late and still have not received it. The tracking number they gave me did not work. IV emailed them and it&#x27;s like they are not concerned at all. Horrible customer service.</li>
            <li> I have an airbrush machine and this product was a perfect match i love having all the color palletes to choose from because I can share them with others. great</li>
            <li> Product is thick and clogs up airbrush machine , can&#x27;t even use it</li>
            <li> this is a good set for someone starting out.&lt;br /&gt;the makeup however does dry in the airbrush gun quick, so i use alcohol between mixing colors.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent makeup to be used on the body. For those that are complaining that the makeup smells of alcohol, yes you are correct ...it does smell of alcohol because it is an alcohol based makeup. This makeup  is designed to be used on the body to cover tattoos, scars , blemishes, temporary tattoos  etc ON THE BODY and is designed to last a few days . The way to remove the product or clean your airbrush gun from it is to use 90% alcohol through iy. If you go to temptu&#x27;s  site you can read about  the makeup and what it&#x27;s used for. Great for professionals who known what they&#x27;re doing and how to work with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I found for the product.  It came within 3 days, and I have a make-up class this weekend.</li>
            <li> Iv used several airbrush makeups but this is the WORST thick sticky cracks and gets oily after like a hour makes everyone look like 20 years older on top of fake looking</li>
            <li> The wife loves it . thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very happy with this product after i apply it on my face with my compressor it takes way to long to dry sometimes it doesn&#x27;t dry all day long and my face is sticky. I will be trying something else and can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Im having a hard time using this produce in the airbrush machine, its drying up in the machine, and I cant clean it out. I put it on my face with just a makeup sponge, and it will know wash off! If, anyone has any suggestions please help.</li>
            <li> Love, them still playing with all of the colors but so far so good, the pigments work so well with my machine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I like the coverage, but I wish I had seen that the makeup was silicone based before I tried to clean my airbrush with water like the instructions told me to. Gunked up and clogged my airbrush and I&#x27;ll need a special cleaner to remove it. Will probably buy the special cleaner, but will be switching to a water based makeup next time.</li>
            <li> Dries very, very quick.  I was disappointed in product.  Colors look great but you can&#x27;t get it on your face fast enough before it dries clogging up your airbrush.  I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> You know, I actually like this. However, it is hard to clean it from your wand. The liquid itself is a great quality and will not wash off easily, which tells me that it will stand the test of long hour days and sweat. Seriously. I had to wash my hands several times to get it off. I just wish that the bottles were bigger.</li>
            <li> Received was we were sat the grocery store. I can&#x27;t wait to take to&lt;br /&gt;school to.</li>
            <li> UGH the only reason I am giving this one star is because I have to! I was BEYOND disappointed in this product! It completely RUINED my EXTREMELY expensive airbrush. I have recently had to order another airbrush to go with my machine. The makeup clogged my airbrush and I did everything I could to fix it. Not to mention, the makeup is alcohol based - but smells like you are literally pouring alcohol on your face. I wouldn&#x27;t want this near a clients face. Overall, I am disappointed and will probably not be ordering from this seller again because I have seen all the other negative reviews (wish I would have looked sooner) and this seller still sells the product. An extreme waste of money.</li>
