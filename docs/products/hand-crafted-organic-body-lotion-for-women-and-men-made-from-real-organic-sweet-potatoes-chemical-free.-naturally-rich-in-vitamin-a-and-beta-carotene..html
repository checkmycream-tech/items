            <li>Great for the face.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how happy my skin is with continued use.</li>
            <li>boyfriend says it makes my face smell like cupcakes, lol.</li>
            <li>great stuff.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could use it because the idea is great,</li>

            <li>The awesome customer service representative Angelica from this company emailed me to let me know that since this lotion was too strong for my skin, that they would send me another kind.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LOTION!  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>at my age is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I love this skin lotion and the best is that&#x27;s all natural adn organic</li>
            <li>Works great, but smells funny.</li>
            <li>My best guess would be the sweet potato enzymes, perhaps the concentration of those enzymes were too much for my skin.</li>
            <li>Could smell slightly better but makes skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>This lotion does what it says it will and more.</li>
            <li>I am 68 and have purchased many very&lt;br /&gt;expensive lotions.</li>
            <li>Already bought more.</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I then put more on my skin to see if it would worsen, and I started to feel a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>yay!! :)</li>
            <li>Love how it contains so many vitamins and antioxidants.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I really love this lotion.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>and I feel great about it being all natural!!</li>
            <li>She said it&#x27;s the best lotion she has tried in a long time.</li>
            <li>using sweet potato high in antioxidants is a great idea, but for some reason it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Soaks in easily, versatile</li>
            <li>The smell of the lotion is very pleasant and dissipates quickly.l really like that this lotion is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The seller is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling hydrated, smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice, absorbing into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>Pleasing fragrance, rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>Nothing special &amp; I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel soft and supple and absorbs into my skin vey nicely.  </li>
            <li>This really makes my skin look so healthy.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best lotion I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something more natural and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Sent an email to make sure I liked the product and gave me additional&lt;br /&gt;information about how other women my age felt about the product.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s chemical free was my reason for purchasing this in the first place, but once I used it I adored it.  </li>
            <li>It is rare when I find a lotion that works for my skin, and it is also somewhat rare when a company tries to make a customer happy, not just \\&quot;here&#x27;s your money back\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This is a great little company.</li>
            <li>It has a light coconut scent that I really like.</li>
            <li>I would like a refund, I&#x27;d be happy to try a product from this company that didn&#x27;t have the harsh enzymes in it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have bought from department stores items not natural an not as effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, creamy and fast absorbing -</li>
            <li>I just received this lotion recently and love it.  </li>
            <li>Make my face soft, smooth feeling with no greasy build up.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>It arrived prompt and from the first time I put it on my face, I could tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say yet that it does everything it claims because I am only half way through the first bottle but the ingredients are great</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion and the fragrance</li>
            <li>Highly recommended !</li>
            <li>Not greasy, fast absorbing</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product and company!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the lotion, and thanks for caring.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very absorbable and makes your skin feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>I just want to say that this company was nice enough to contact me and went above and beyond my expectations as a customer.</li>
            <li>Since I am committed to using chemical free products for all skin and hair care, I went back to making my own very inexpensive lotion using raw shea butter and emu oil.  </li>
            <li>and I so much like that the ingredients I am absorbing are natural and organic.</li>
            <li>However, if price is not an object, I would highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion they recommended was the aloe and honey, and WOW, it is perfect for my skin, which is crazy sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have been using the sweet potato lotion as spot treatment for exactly one month to help fade dark spots.</li>
            <li>It has such a subtle, pleasant smell that is not perfumey or intense, just very natural and soft.  </li>
            <li>Only gave it a  three because I like the other formula better</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not usually a fan of vanilla scents</li>
            <li>This lotion completely solved that for me!</li>
            <li>It felt pretty thick when I dispensed it into my hand, but it really does absorb into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I have mature dry skin and find this product works great when it is warm outside or as a base moisturizer under make up.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin feels smoother ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with all natural and organic ingredients so there are no harsh chemicals going into your skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a reaction like this to lotion before and was quite surprised.</li>
            <li>I bought this cream after reading how natural the ingredients were.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days (twice a day) and can totally tell a difference, so much that I already placed an order for another bottle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never irritated my skin (and I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin, prone to irritation pretty easily and red rashes or bumps) nor has it broken me out, and I&#x27;ve been using it night and day.</li>
            <li>b/c they are heavy and way too sweet but this one smells fresher to me, not like getting snuffed by a vanilla bean.</li>
            <li>which is the complete opposite of  an anti-aging properties.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really dry where we live</li>
            <li>I firmly believe that after a month of using a product conventionally, one should be able to notice a difference even if it&#x27;s MINIMAL...</li>

            <li> I firmly believe that after a month of using a product conventionally, one should be able to notice a difference even if it&#x27;s MINIMAL...</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think I had enough time to comment on effects of long term use.  </li>
            <li> and I always struggle with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I typically wait for it to sink in and then apply another layer (because I live in a very dry climate) and that usually does it.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin moist and I have very dry skin due to a lot of sun.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, too, so you can be sparing although you won&#x27;t want to be.  </li>
            <li> I have other products that I use for my face.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also noticing that it&#x27;s clearing some of the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> The lotion did nothing to fade my dark spots.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of a slightly tart buttercream frosting ...</li>
            <li> After a few weeks l started noticing improvement in the lines around my lips, improved firmness at the jawline and less puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The product is not cheap but for all it does the price</li>
            <li> I am 57 and my skin was looking dull.</li>
            <li> The strength of the product is weak and I would recommend the ingredients be reevaluated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell and it is very thick and will not come out the pump.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the amount you get for the price makes this too expensive for me.  </li>
            <li> Maybe some people can use this stuff without breaking out into a crazy horrible itchy rash, but I cannot say the same.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this. Soaks in easily, versatile (I use it from neck to forehead) and I so much like that the ingredients I am absorbing are natural and organic. Well worth the price. I have bought from department stores items not natural an not as effective. This is a great little company.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion and the fragrance</li>
            <li> Using the lotion for 4 weeks now and it has greatly diminished  a couple of brown spots on my face&lt;br /&gt;still looking for the anti aging effects</li>
            <li> Nothing special &amp; I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions. Smells nice. I&#x27;ll stick with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have ever had. Will order again and again. Noticable difference in skin almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Only gave it a  three because I like the other formula better</li>
            <li> Look younger already! Great for the face.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin moist and I have very dry skin due to a lot of sun. Pleasing fragrance, rich and creamy. Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product. I&#x27;m also noticing that it&#x27;s clearing some of the dark spots on my face. Lastly, it didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream!  It makes my face feel soft and supple and absorbs into my skin vey nicely.  It makes my skin feel refreshed and I feel great about it being all natural!!</li>
            <li> one of best products and seller. This lotion does what it says it will and more. I am 68 and have purchased many very&lt;br /&gt;expensive lotions. I bought this for a body lotion. It moisturizes, firms and reduces the appearance of age spots. Any of&lt;br /&gt;this at my age is amazing. The seller is fantastic. Sent an email to make sure I liked the product and gave me additional&lt;br /&gt;information about how other women my age felt about the product. The product is not cheap but for all it does the price&lt;br /&gt;is amazingly great! Already bought more.</li>
            <li> I just received this lotion recently and love it.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle in a bottle or anything.  I just wanted something organic, with vitamin A and no parabens that I could use at night on my body.  I have other products that I use for my face.  It has a light coconut scent that I really like. The consistency is nice, absorbing into the skin quickly.  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION!  It&#x27;s rich, creamy and fast absorbing - A little goes a long way, too, so you can be sparing although you won&#x27;t want to be.  The smell reminds me of a slightly tart buttercream frosting ... almost like cream cheese frosting.  So far I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin feels smoother ... I can&#x27;t wait to see how happy my skin is with continued use.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It felt pretty thick when I dispensed it into my hand, but it really does absorb into the skin quickly. I typically wait for it to sink in and then apply another layer (because I live in a very dry climate) and that usually does it. It&#x27;s never irritated my skin (and I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin, prone to irritation pretty easily and red rashes or bumps) nor has it broken me out, and I&#x27;ve been using it night and day. I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend says it makes my face smell like cupcakes, lol.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fanominal I just love it</li>
            <li> great stuff.  Not greasy, fast absorbing, I&#x27;m not usually a fan of vanilla scents b/c they are heavy and way too sweet but this one smells fresher to me, not like getting snuffed by a vanilla bean.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best lotion I have ever tried! It&#x27;s really dry where we live and I always struggle with dry skin. This lotion completely solved that for me! It&#x27;s made with all natural and organic ingredients so there are no harsh chemicals going into your skin. To top it off, they have excellent customer service! They reached out to me to find out what I think of their lotion and immediately responded to my questions. Highly recommended product and company!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this lotion.  The fact that it&#x27;s chemical free was my reason for purchasing this in the first place, but once I used it I adored it.  It absorbs well and leaves my skin so soft.  Not even a bit of a greasy feeling.  And the smell...LOVE!!  It has such a subtle, pleasant smell that is not perfumey or intense, just very natural and soft.  I only purchased one bottle so I don&#x27;t think I had enough time to comment on effects of long term use.  Unfortunately the amount you get for the price makes this too expensive for me.  Using this lotion on my entire body daily after showering, it only lasted me about 2 weeks. Since I am committed to using chemical free products for all skin and hair care, I went back to making my own very inexpensive lotion using raw shea butter and emu oil.  However, if price is not an object, I would highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have mature dry skin and find this product works great when it is warm outside or as a base moisturizer under make up. Like that it is made with wonderful healthy ingredients. Make my face soft, smooth feeling with no greasy build up. A keeper!</li>
            <li> Maybe some people can use this stuff without breaking out into a crazy horrible itchy rash, but I cannot say the same.  My skin instantly turned into a blotchy red after testing an area on my arm. I then put more on my skin to see if it would worsen, and I started to feel a burning sensation. My best guess would be the sweet potato enzymes, perhaps the concentration of those enzymes were too much for my skin. I have never had a reaction like this to lotion before and was quite surprised. I wish I could use it because the idea is great, using sweet potato high in antioxidants is a great idea, but for some reason it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin.  I would like a refund, I&#x27;d be happy to try a product from this company that didn&#x27;t have the harsh enzymes in it. Thanks!  UPDATE 12/19  The awesome customer service representative Angelica from this company emailed me to let me know that since this lotion was too strong for my skin, that they would send me another kind. The lotion they recommended was the aloe and honey, and WOW, it is perfect for my skin, which is crazy sensitive. I just want to say that this company was nice enough to contact me and went above and beyond my expectations as a customer. It is rare when I find a lotion that works for my skin, and it is also somewhat rare when a company tries to make a customer happy, not just \\&quot;here&#x27;s your money back\\&quot;. Thanks for the lotion, and thanks for caring.</li>
            <li> I love this skin lotion and the best is that&#x27;s all natural adn organic yay!! :)</li>
            <li> Works great, but smells funny.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion.  The delivery service was excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine. She absolutely loves it! She said it&#x27;s the best lotion she has tried in a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a product review.  I have been using the sweet potato lotion as spot treatment for exactly one month to help fade dark spots. The lotion did nothing to fade my dark spots. In fact,  pimples started forming on the areas where the lotion had been applied and it made my skin TEXTURE in those AREAS appear uneven/dull which is the complete opposite of  an anti-aging properties. The strength of the product is weak and I would recommend the ingredients be reevaluated. I firmly believe that after a month of using a product conventionally, one should be able to notice a difference even if it&#x27;s MINIMAL...</li>
            <li> I bought this cream after reading how natural the ingredients were. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated, smooth and glowing. Love how it contains so many vitamins and antioxidants. A brown spot on my forehead even seems to be fading. So far so good! It&#x27;s been 2 weeks using this product .</li>
            <li> Great product works well. Could smell slightly better but makes skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very absorbable and makes your skin feel moisturized. It does cause temporary redness and heat which I understand are the enzymes. I can&#x27;t say yet that it does everything it claims because I am only half way through the first bottle but the ingredients are great so I hope so.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but it&#x27;s enough moisture under makeup.  My face stopped breaking out and looks smoother.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t have chemicals.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I was looking for something more natural and this fit the bill.  It arrived prompt and from the first time I put it on my face, I could tell the difference.  Its so creamy but absorbs so well and what a plus that I can use it on my body as well.  I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days (twice a day) and can totally tell a difference, so much that I already placed an order for another bottle!</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion. I am 57 and my skin was looking dull. This really makes my skin look so healthy. I started using this twice a day with retinol at night and collagen peptide in the morning. After a few weeks l started noticing improvement in the lines around my lips, improved firmness at the jawline and less puffiness under my eyes. No change in an age spot. The smell of the lotion is very pleasant and dissipates quickly.l really like that this lotion is made with natural ingredients. Good price.  I am looking forward to trying some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell and it is very thick and will not come out the pump. Only use in my legs because of the smell.</li>
