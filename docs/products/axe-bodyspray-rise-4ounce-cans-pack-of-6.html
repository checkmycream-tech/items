            <li> My second best fragrance after Axe Recovery. Very light. Lasts for a couple of hours at most.</li>
            <li> No wonder they took off the market, it has unhealthy  ingredients.</li>
            <li> Best smelling Axe and I can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore.  If you have stinky teenage boys, then you need this.</li>
            <li> received on time... great price for this product.</li>
            <li> My son loves this scent and I can&#x27;t find it in stores around here.</li>
            <li> probably the best scent they make!  they need to put it back on the shelves... until then, will continue to look on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Was delivered quickly and was exactly as expected</li>
            <li> These are hard to find at stores but thanks to this person I was a happy camper ... Love the cent!!!</li>

            <li> Worst Axe product I&#x27;ve ever used - too watery and scent only lasts for 4-6 hours. Useless.</li>
            <li> Not a good smell. I wouldn&#x27;t put this on my body.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing aroma. It is now difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Good product at a competitive price.</li>
            <li> A whole six pack for what two of them would have cost me retail! Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Love it!</li>
            <li> I would def recommened the Rise scent, for men of course. This was for my husband. It smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give negative stars if I could, but for the store AmericaRX.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my package and noticed it was wrong, I contacted the seller the same day. It took almost two weeks for them to tell me thay were out of the scent I wanted, and offered a discount (which was just the shipping) for me to keep what I didnt order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They wasted my time for no reason. They could have told me they where out of Rise in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly believe they sent me the wrong item knowingly, hoping for me to keep the wrong stuff just for them to make the sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again will I buy from them!</li>
            <li> Great product. Good quality product. Hard to find this product local. Great fragrance that never gets old. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> my son plays at a lot of travel tournament games. He likes many of the scents but the size is very convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Shipped on time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore.  Great product/sent!</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to stinking products and this fragrance is the only product I can apply before bed and NOT get gagged under the covers ( i can wear many products in open air). This has a wonderful light citris fragrance. TOP RECOMMENED FOR SENSITIVE NOSES.</li>
