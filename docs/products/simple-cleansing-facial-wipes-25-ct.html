            <li> These work fine for me.  Use 1 in the morning and one in the evening.  No problems with my sensitive skin.  I actually cut the sheet in half and use a half sheet a.m. and half sheet p.m..  Not sure about make up removal since I don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of facial wipes because of my sensitive oily/acne prone skin. I prefer washing my face at night but after reading what&#x27;s not in this product I decided to give them a try. I was really impressed and like the way it makes my skin feel after I&#x27;m done using the wipe. It even removes waterproof mascara and does not leave a mess. I&#x27;ve enjoyed this product so much that I have set it up on subscribe and save. The name matches the ease of the product- Simple.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and arrived in time.</li>
            <li> Quick and convenient way for a teenager to keep his face from getting too oily.</li>
            <li> These wipes are great for on the go clean ups or even nighttime washing . . .they remove makeup and dirt without any irritation or sting on my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> super dry and do not remove water proof mascara.</li>
            <li> I love Simple&#x27;s products. They are very gentle for sensitive, acne prone skin. These wipes are great at removing make-up and controlling oil. This 2 pack is a great deal, too.</li>
            <li> Love these wipes, but had to stop using them when I realized they had methylparabens in them.  If they can make them paraben-free, I&#x27;ll buy them again for life.</li>
            <li> These seemed too dry to really do much cleaning. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea &amp; I like how gentle these are on my skin. They remove most of my makeup, with a pleasant smell. My only complaint is they leave my face feeling a little oily.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes  I use one in the morning and one before  bed and it takes care of my oily face</li>
            <li> My sister in law got me hooked on these little guys and I really like them.they clean everything off your face without making your face feel like it&#x27;s squeaky. I am so glad it&#x27;s subscribe and save! Whoot whoot!</li>
            <li> Love having this available on Subscribe and Save!  I&#x27;ll never go to Costco again!</li>
            <li> If you are specifically looking to buy the &amp;#34;Oil Balancing&amp;#34; wipes, look elsewhere. I ordered this thinking I&#x27;d get the oil balancing wipes as described, but received the original wipes instead which in my opinion aren&#x27;t as good.  I noticed this happened to another reviewer, so I&#x27;m assuming they are advertising the wrong product. Customer service DID refund me though, but said they couldn&#x27;t replace because they ran out.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and this is the only product that seems to help. I use it in combination with the simple ultra light moisturizing gel.... another item I would definitely recommend for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer the skin oil balancing wipes over the regular version of this product.  I received the wrong item but just assumed I ordered the wrong product so started using them.  Now that I&#x27;m going through my products that need reviewing, I see that I did in fact order the correct item, they just sent me the wrong one.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time.  They don&#x27;t burn my eyes like some brands do.</li>
            <li> not for me - will not reorder.</li>
            <li> I expected a little bit more from these. They smell like unscented baby wipes and they sting a tiny bit when applied.</li>
            <li> They take off your makeup better than most wipes and don&#x27;t mess up your skin in the process. I have (what I consider to be) pretty sensitive skin (I always used neutrogena products) and these don&#x27;t irritate at all.</li>
            <li> Gentle wipes and a great deal! Removes all my make up and cleans my face. I don&#x27;t know about the oil control but I like these wipes a lot</li>
            <li> I like the idea of using cleansing wipes when I am traveling or don&#x27;t have the time to wash my face with my cleaner and water. Let&#x27;s be honest, some nights you&#x27;re just too tired to do the full routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many other products I have tried have left my skin feeling irritated or filmy. I thought I would give this brand a try and I am so happy I did!</li>
