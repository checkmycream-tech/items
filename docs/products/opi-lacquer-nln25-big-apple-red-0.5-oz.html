            <li>Great color for holidays and everday color.  </li>
            <li>This color was great and the name speaks for</li>
            <li>Great color for your toes or finger nails.</li>
            <li>Great job.</li>
            <li>This is a great color</li>
            <li>Opi makes gorgeous colors and their formulas adhere very nicely.</li>
            <li>Good polish.</li>
            <li>but I loved it.</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product!</li>
            <li>Really loving this polish</li>
            <li>looks better on fair skin tones.</li>
            <li>needs topcoat even thought it does have a bit of its own shine.</li>
            <li>Was exactly as I expected - great product, perfect red color and OPI quality make this a great purchase and a good price.</li>
            <li>I really do love this color.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>Love Opi polishes.</li>
            <li>Perfect red nail polish.</li>
            <li>Opi is consistently my favorite brand of nail polish.</li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this color...</li>
            <li>Beautiful red.  </li>
            <li>Securely rolled in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>Great pin-up red!</li>
            <li>red looks great</li>
            <li>The color is really great, but  it started chipping off the tips of my nails right away - even with clear coat on it.</li>
            <li>I love this color and found this to be just what I was looking for at just the right price.</li>
            <li>It took 4 coats to cover my nail completely and it did not leave nice stokes at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s vibrant, thick-ish (making application more even and avoiding streaks), and really durable under a top coat.</li>
            <li>Delivery quick and reliable.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was exactly as described in listing.</li>
            <li>and this one is certainly more of a true red.</li>
            <li>Red is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>Overall - I love OPI polish.  </li>
            <li>Big Apple Red is my very favorite.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>This polish has the usual OPI good quality you&#x27;d expect and a true red like poppy flowers.  </li>
            <li>I purchased 3 other OPI bottles from other vendors on amazon and they were great.</li>
            <li>True candy apple red.</li>
            <li>The color dries slightly darker than it is in the bottle, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I was replacing an old bottle.</li>
            <li>much* deeper red than I was looking for.</li>
            <li>A vibrant matte red.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still pretty, but it&#x27;s much like the other red polishes I already have.</li>
            <li>Package was small fit in my mailbox.</li>
            <li>If you add another top coat a few days later - your nail color should last 1-2 weeks.</li>

            <li> It came quicker then expected</li>
            <li> It seems to have lasted longer than other name brand nail polishes.</li>
            <li> It paints on smooth, the color is vibrant, and you don&#x27;t get those horrible air</li>
            <li> also use a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> The opacity is a little lacking, as well.</li>
            <li> However, the nail polish is a little chunky for me.</li>
            <li> It seems like the bottle is old and the actual polish started to go bad.</li>
            <li> Use it for my pedicures all year round.</li>

            <li> I really do love this color. It&#x27;s vibrant, thick-ish (making application more even and avoiding streaks), and really durable under a top coat. Two coats is all you need. The color dries slightly darker than it is in the bottle, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I love this color. I was replacing an old bottle. Love Opi polishes. Red is my favorite color. Good polish.</li>
            <li> Great color for holidays and everday color.  OPI has wonderful color selection and creative names!  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this color! Perfect red nail polish. Opi is consistently my favorite brand of nail polish. I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product!</li>
            <li> Love this color. My go to.</li>
            <li> Overall - I love OPI polish.  It paints on smooth, the color is vibrant, and you don&#x27;t get those horrible air bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a base and top coat. If you add another top coat a few days later - your nail color should last 1-2 weeks. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> This polish looks a lot lighter in the bottle than it does once it dries. I know this happens a lot, but this turned out to be a *much* deeper red than I was looking for. It&#x27;s still pretty, but it&#x27;s much like the other red polishes I already have. The opacity is a little lacking, as well. You can get away with 2 coats... if you don&#x27;t mind slight transparency or have short nails.</li>
            <li> Opi makes gorgeous colors and their formulas adhere very nicely. Big Apple Red is my very favorite. Use it for my pedicures all year round.</li>
            <li> Package was small fit in my mailbox. Securely rolled in bubble wrap. Only took one coat. Great pin-up red! Really loving this polish</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this color...but I loved it. True candy apple red.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as described in listing. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I used to use Revlon&#x27;s RED color then I found this and this one is certainly more of a true red. It seems to have lasted longer than other name brand nail polishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s name definitely fits. Beautiful red.  looks better on fair skin tones. needs topcoat even thought it does have a bit of its own shine.</li>
            <li> The best. A vibrant matte red.</li>
            <li> This color was great and the name speaks for it&#x27;s self! Great color for your toes or finger nails. It came quicker then expected and I can&#x27;t wait to use it. Definitely recommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the reputation OPI has, but it did not live up to it. It took 4 coats to cover my nail completely and it did not leave nice stokes at all.

            <li> This polish has the usual OPI good quality you&#x27;d expect and a true red like poppy flowers.  Neither orange nor purple undertones, just red.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as I expected - great product, perfect red color and OPI quality make this a great purchase and a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a great color and I really like it. However, the nail polish is a little chunky for me.</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail today and I can&#x27;t wait to wear this red for Valentine day.&lt;br /&gt;this red looks great everyone should have a red color like this one.</li>
