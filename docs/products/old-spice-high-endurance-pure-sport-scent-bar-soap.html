    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>One of the things I like best is the scent.</li>
            <li>It smells great and the smell is not overpowering like some soaps.</li>
            <li>Still a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that should probably do well with the over-45 crowd, and the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; guys under that age.</li>
            <li>What a great product.</li>
            <li>great smelling bars of soap.</li>
            <li>Five stars for a great product.</li>
            <li>A great scent and works up a great lather.</li>
            <li>The bars are formed perfectly; They fit wonderfully in the hand.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly</li>
            <li>You can buy these most places, like Meijer, Walmart, but Amazon&#x27;s price is very good</li>
            <li>It also does not lather well, but feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>The price was good.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is just a good soap, at a good price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, guys if you&#x27;re looking for some good soap, check this stuff out.</li>
            <li>It smells good and does the job.</li>
            <li>6 bars for under $5 is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>But it is a good product</li>
            <li>This soap is a good product without being anything exceptional.</li>
            <li>After using this soap for about three weeks I can safely say it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great value getting this quantity off Amazon for so cheap!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my gf was all over me, telling me this is the best I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li>Perhaps for some people it is too potent, but I recommend this soap!</li>
            <li>It has never been better!</li>
            <li>Another great value item to add if you need something for $5 to qualify for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shape is nice.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, and the shape.</li>
            <li>and he liked the scent.</li>
            <li>All I know is that it smells nice when I&#x27;m showering,</li>
            <li>I liked this bar soap.</li>
            <li>the soap was good, lathering well and having a nice smell that&#x27;s not too strong, but the one thing neither of us cared for was how drying it seemed to be.  </li>
            <li>Mild but very nice fragrance</li>
            <li>Arrived 2 days early (great!)</li>
            <li>This soap kills odor very well, is pleasant and easy on the skin, and comes in a great shape that&#x27;s easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>This soap has a pleasant fresh scent that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a good soap product, without being extraordinary in any way.</li>
            <li>Mostly for the nostalgia...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soap and fitness instructor all in one!  :)</li>
            <li>I love using these soap bars and they come with 6, so i wont run out anytime soon.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap, it smells like a man should smell.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>While that stuff was okay, some people just prefer bar soap.</li>
            <li>And of course there&#x27;s something timeless and appealing about the brand and logo itself.  </li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing, but doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>I have discovered that this is my favorite bath soap.  </li>
            <li>but I think I get more &amp;#34;showers&amp;#34; per bar.  </li>
            <li>That satisfies the basics of what most of us would want from a bar of soap.</li>
            <li>What keeps it from being a five star product is that it doesn&#x27;t have an especially pleasant smell that lasts on your skin after usage, like, say Dove&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Care bodywash; and doesn&#x27;t leave you with any especially refreshed feeling after you wish it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lifetime Dial soap user, mostly out of habit.  </li>
            <li>enjoyed the smell of the soap, and the feel of the bar in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I would like them to have better packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure what the company is trying to do by claiming this is a soap on a rope without a rope.</li>
            <li>If the price is greater than that.</li>
            <li>Also it leaves you with a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good soap.</li>
            <li>thing though - the smell, while nice, tends to fade quickly.  </li>
            <li>Most here will already be familiar.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit strong for women, so</li>
            <li>Strong, manly scent - again, reminding you to hit the weights,</li>
            <li>Then it is scent, it is very light and mild.</li>
            <li>these products, I give the edge to Old Spice because of the pleasant smell and easy grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells really fresh and clean while having a nice &#x27;sporty&#x27; note to it.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s a fine choice, and a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; one too.</li>
            <li>My father used Old Spice when I was a child, so it always triggers pleasant memories when I see the product.  </li>
            <li>I originally thought it was going to have some sort of strong, musky smell to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the bar soap is a great way to get a little more of that scent that girls seem to love.</li>
            <li>and me smell nice, thanks Old Spice for the timeless scent that always brings back memories of good men who helped make our nation Great</li>
            <li>It has the desired smooth texture, rinses off easily, and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lathers very well and has me smelling nice, manly and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy have the scent on me.</li>
            <li>I personally like the scent and would be happy if the men in my life used it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say this was a great soap</li>
            <li>Because the scent is so light, I put the rest of the soap within a zipper bag to keep the scent in.</li>
            <li>The bar is easy to hold, offers a light scent that my son loves and suds up nicely.</li>
            <li>So when this was re-released I was excited.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very refreshing, masculine and clean.</li>
            <li>I would still like a hint of that clean scent.</li>
            <li>This soap is a great alternative to the liquid body wash, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>but he did like how clean he felt.</li>
            <li>I will definitely not buy the bar soap again despite being a bit cheaper and still having the pleasant smell like the gel.</li>
            <li>When in a huge rush, once or twice I&#x27;ve even used it to wash my hair - with success.</li>
            <li>The 34 year old who works at a desk liked it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a clean dude, I soap up, but this is obviously powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>Body wash would get used up quickly, I got bought these</li>
            <li>Combined with the deodorant, this bar soap is a good strong product for active men to use.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong but mild smell, which means the fragrance of the soap is masculine (like most Old Spice products) but not too strong or cheap smelling.  </li>
            <li>Very clean and refreshing, but you&#x27;ll definitely want to lather on some lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li>But we still have Old Spice, Thanks Amazon for the good soap that makes my mom smile</li>
            <li>And last a 25 year old who was happy to get free soap.</li>
            <li>Old Spice has always had a knack for providing products with clean, appealing scents that didn&#x27;t leave others thinking they&#x27;d stumbled onto the \\&quot;Jersey Shore\\&quot; set by mistake when you entered the room.</li>
            <li>Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport soap is a  great products.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, long lasting, and good suds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the old &#x27;sailboat smell good&#x27; scent, it&#x27;s something new.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the light scent of these 4 ounce ergonomically shaped easy to grip bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is a decent price, and does its primary job - clean me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aroma is ok, doesn&#x27;t really smell like pure sport.</li>
            <li>The bars last a good long time and are very strongly scented.</li>
            <li>Finally, the soap lathers nicely and cleans quite well.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of everything by old spice .I</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re old.  :)</li>
            <li>I now respect the Old Spice commercials even more.</li>
            <li>Not too powerful.</li>
            <li>One of my reviewers got back to me again today to say it didn&#x27;t lather up as well as he would have liked and the scent didn&#x27;t stay with him</li>
            <li>Typically I find Old Spice to be more marketing hype than anything, but this bar of soap really does leave a nice, long-lasting scent, and it is in a shape that is very easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of strange</li>
            <li>The Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Bar Soap is surprisingly nice.  </li>
            <li>These bars make a great addition to his \\&quot;manly\\&quot; products and we will definitely purchase them in the future.</li>
            <li>Again the \\&quot;sport scent\\&quot; is not strong, but quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>Old Spice calls this &#x27;Pure Sport&#x27; but it doesnt smell like the Pure Sport deodorant, it smells more like soap used to smell before it was ruined by people trying to make soap smell like something its not supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So they definitely work nicely on 12 year old skin and will be a staple in our home!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get any more basic than that...</li>
            <li>This is definitely a product we will buy more of.</li>
            <li>Really like the enduring fresh after-shave smell.</li>
            <li>Pretty funny.  </li>
            <li>I noticed three things when I first get the soap.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice - the usual \\&quot;pure sport\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li>This scent is similar to Irish Spring soap but a little more pleasant and not as strong.</li>
            <li>The clean fresh scent of the Old Spice soap is strongly reminiscent of the Irish Spring soap scent - and that&#x27;s actually a good thing in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>It gives off a pleasant clean scent while applying, similar to other bar soaps.</li>
            <li>so i cant say if it has a standard old spice smell, but as i said, i liked the scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what else I can say, but as far as I can tell it is one of the cheapest available bar soaps on Amazon, so I really do highly recommend it, especially for Men :)</li>
            <li>soap lathers to a nice, thick foam - washes off clean without leaving any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might not be the best soap in the market relative to other similar products with respect to prices.</li>
            <li>Overall he likes the convenience of the body wash, but found these bars easy to hold and didn&#x27;t have any problems with using them to wash his face.</li>
            <li>I should have looked closer at the pure sport name.</li>
            <li>Would certainly purchase these again.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It smells greats and lathers up really well.</li>
            <li>He said he didn&#x27;t notice the scent much.</li>
            <li>haha ...</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t think much about</li>
            <li>- I really did like the soap.</li>
            <li>After the shower, I feel clean and not dry.</li>
            <li>it cleans like soap but really, do you really have to make it so stinky?</li>
            <li>The last thing I wanted was that Old Spice cologne smell my grandfather would wear, but this is something better.</li>
            <li>Does it leave you more refreshed than other soaps out there?</li>
            <li>From deodorant to after shave, Old Spice is a pretty reliable brand.  </li>
            <li>Lathers nicely, packaged like usual.</li>
            <li>Just one sniff of Old Spice takes me back in time; fond memories of the important men in my life.</li>
            <li>In addition, the soap hasn&#x27;t ebbed away too quickly, despite daily use of almost three weeks.  </li>
            <li>It produces a decent amount of lather.  </li>
            <li>As to its main purpose, it is soap and it works well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I got the Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Bar Soap because I was looking for a cheaper soap than the gel.</li>
            <li>But after using it that fresh clean smell does not last for long.</li>
            <li>school, honest, reliable and hard working&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Again, this is a plus for those who want their skin to literally squeak after a shower (and there are many who genuinely do), but after years of using shower gels with moisturizers, it felt a little like scrubbing down with lye.  </li>
            <li>In those days, every man I ever new used this product and the after-shave too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was with them to find new high-end products, not $3 bars of soap.</li>
            <li>Let me say, I live in an area that is murder on my allergies</li>
            <li>The 37 year old who works hard at a bakery liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are a bit smaller and denser than the Irish Spring soap bars, but lather equally well and leave my skin feeling clean, fresh yet never dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing</li>
            <li>My son uses all the Old Spice products and we mainly purchase the body wash.</li>
            <li>I thought it was just silly hype, but it really does deserve those good but crazy-funny commercials.</li>
            <li>It smells fine, but the smell is pretty hard to detect.</li>
            <li>done Old Spice!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this bar of soap and I would certainly purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>Classic Old Spice fragrance and what you would expect from Old Spice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years, good thing Amazon always has it to buy because it&#x27;s hard to find anywhere else!!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Old Spice but this soap has very little scent.</li>
            <li>and I realized that I have been using Old Spice&#x27;s deoderant for MANY years now, and I also remembered the older Old Spice commercials (I mean like 25+ years old) about the smell of the soap.  </li>
            <li>This soap smells (obviously) like the Old Spice Pure Sport scent.  </li>
            <li>so you can get a grip on it in the shower and the bar seems to still be hard after several uses which is a good indication that it will last a while.  </li>
            <li>I grew up in an era where young men had three choices when it came to anything with a scent.</li>
            <li>Old Spice, Brut and Canoe.</li>
            <li>you like the scent of Old Spice cologne or aftershave</li>
            <li>, Old Spice has stood the test of time admirably.</li>
            <li>now my 78 year young mom says &amp;#34;You smell like my dad did&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Each bar lasts a while, and does not leave the skin smelling too much, but just enough</li>
            <li>I shower using old spice bar and end with body wash which eliminates the tightness of bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear any cologne (it&#x27;s just my old spice</li>
            <li>Just that &#x27;old school soap&#x27; smell as my wife stated.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised I would like it.</li>
            <li>I nearly felt as though I didn&#x27;t need cologne after using it.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>The Old Spice made a difference IMMEDIATELY.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not some 16 year old kid that drenches himself in &amp;#34;sprays&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t need to smell like my soap all day.</li>
            <li>I like this soap and I (74 year old man)</li>
            <li>think I smell like a 50 year old man ...</li>
            <li>happen to like the Old Spice aroma and the soap</li>
            <li>The soap is OK, but not the typical Old Spice scent I expected.</li>
            <li>That left Old Spice for the rest of us &#x27;normal&#x27; guys.</li>
            <li>Normally I use Irish Spring bath soap bars, but I have always like the smell of Old Spice after shave</li>
            <li>It has a decent smell; however, it leaves behind the same old dryness that most bar soaps do.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell at all like the Old Spice aftershave, which might be a plus for those who don&#x27;t care for the traditional Old Spice, but we both like that scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In general</li>
            <li>Besides the unique design, not much else stood out to me about this product than other bar soaps.</li>
            <li>The odd barbell-ish shape gives you a decent grip so you can scrub with the two sides sticking out from your grasped hand - all the while reminding you that you should be getting back to the gym, lifting real weights, girly man.</li>
            <li>I remember my Grandfather always had the scent of &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; on him- I use only Old Spice aftershave</li>
            <li>My husband wanted to get this because he&#x27;s fond of Old Spice products overall.  </li>
            <li>You can even barely smell it when you use it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent - it reminds me a very subtle polo sport cologne.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the trip down memory lane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure what that is supposed to mean, honestly.  </li>
            <li>The size really is what you would expect for a soap on the rope size, I would consider the bar a little smaller than a medium sized soap bar.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> One of the things I like best is the scent.</li>
            <li> It smells great and the smell is not overpowering like some soaps.</li>
            <li> Still a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that should probably do well with the over-45 crowd, and the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; guys under that age.</li>
            <li> What a great product.</li>
            <li> great smelling bars of soap.</li>

            <li> I was pleasantly</li>
            <li> You can buy these most places, like Meijer, Walmart, but Amazon&#x27;s price is very good</li>

            <li> It smells good and does the job.</li>

            <li> But it is a good product</li>
            <li> This soap is a good product without being anything exceptional.</li>
            <li> After using this soap for about three weeks I can safely say it is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Great value getting this quantity off Amazon for so cheap!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my gf was all over me, telling me this is the best I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> Perhaps for some people it is too potent, but I recommend this soap!</li>
            <li> It has never been better!</li>
            <li> Another great value item to add if you need something for $5 to qualify for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shape is nice.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, and the shape.</li>
            <li> and he liked the scent.</li>
            <li> All I know is that it smells nice when I&#x27;m showering,</li>
            <li> I liked this bar soap.</li>
            <li> the soap was good, lathering well and having a nice smell that&#x27;s not too strong, but the one thing neither of us cared for was how drying it seemed to be.  </li>
            <li> Mild but very nice fragrance</li>
            <li> Arrived 2 days early (great!)</li>
            <li> This soap kills odor very well, is pleasant and easy on the skin, and comes in a great shape that&#x27;s easy to grip.  </li>
            <li> This soap has a pleasant fresh scent that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a good soap product, without being extraordinary in any way.</li>
            <li> Mostly for the nostalgia...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soap and fitness instructor all in one!  :)</li>
            <li> I love using these soap bars and they come with 6, so i wont run out anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap, it smells like a man should smell.</li>
            <li> and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> While that stuff was okay, some people just prefer bar soap.</li>
            <li> And of course there&#x27;s something timeless and appealing about the brand and logo itself.  </li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing, but doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I have discovered that this is my favorite bath soap.  </li>
            <li> but I think I get more &amp;#34;showers&amp;#34; per bar.  </li>
            <li> That satisfies the basics of what most of us would want from a bar of soap.</li>
            <li> What keeps it from being a five star product is that it doesn&#x27;t have an especially pleasant smell that lasts on your skin after usage, like, say Dove&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Care bodywash; and doesn&#x27;t leave you with any especially refreshed feeling after you wish it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifetime Dial soap user, mostly out of habit.  </li>
            <li> enjoyed the smell of the soap, and the feel of the bar in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I would like them to have better packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what the company is trying to do by claiming this is a soap on a rope without a rope.</li>
            <li> If the price is greater than that.</li>
            <li> Also it leaves you with a very clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good soap.</li>
            <li> thing though - the smell, while nice, tends to fade quickly.  </li>
            <li> Most here will already be familiar.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to hold on to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit strong for women, so</li>
            <li> Strong, manly scent - again, reminding you to hit the weights,</li>
            <li> Then it is scent, it is very light and mild.</li>
            <li> these products, I give the edge to Old Spice because of the pleasant smell and easy grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells really fresh and clean while having a nice &#x27;sporty&#x27; note to it.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s a fine choice, and a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; one too.</li>
            <li> My father used Old Spice when I was a child, so it always triggers pleasant memories when I see the product.  </li>
            <li> I originally thought it was going to have some sort of strong, musky smell to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the bar soap is a great way to get a little more of that scent that girls seem to love.</li>
            <li> and me smell nice, thanks Old Spice for the timeless scent that always brings back memories of good men who helped make our nation Great</li>
            <li> It has the desired smooth texture, rinses off easily, and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lathers very well and has me smelling nice, manly and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy have the scent on me.</li>
            <li> I personally like the scent and would be happy if the men in my life used it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say this was a great soap</li>
            <li> Because the scent is so light, I put the rest of the soap within a zipper bag to keep the scent in.</li>
            <li> The bar is easy to hold, offers a light scent that my son loves and suds up nicely.</li>
            <li> So when this was re-released I was excited.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very refreshing, masculine and clean.</li>
            <li> I would still like a hint of that clean scent.</li>
            <li> This soap is a great alternative to the liquid body wash, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> but he did like how clean he felt.</li>
            <li> I will definitely not buy the bar soap again despite being a bit cheaper and still having the pleasant smell like the gel.</li>
            <li> When in a huge rush, once or twice I&#x27;ve even used it to wash my hair - with success.</li>
            <li> The 34 year old who works at a desk liked it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a clean dude, I soap up, but this is obviously powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> Body wash would get used up quickly, I got bought these</li>
            <li> Combined with the deodorant, this bar soap is a good strong product for active men to use.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong but mild smell, which means the fragrance of the soap is masculine (like most Old Spice products) but not too strong or cheap smelling.  </li>
            <li> Very clean and refreshing, but you&#x27;ll definitely want to lather on some lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> But we still have Old Spice, Thanks Amazon for the good soap that makes my mom smile</li>
            <li> And last a 25 year old who was happy to get free soap.</li>
            <li> Old Spice has always had a knack for providing products with clean, appealing scents that didn&#x27;t leave others thinking they&#x27;d stumbled onto the \\&quot;Jersey Shore\\&quot; set by mistake when you entered the room.</li>
            <li> Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport soap is a  great products.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, long lasting, and good suds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the old &#x27;sailboat smell good&#x27; scent, it&#x27;s something new.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the light scent of these 4 ounce ergonomically shaped easy to grip bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is a decent price, and does its primary job - clean me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aroma is ok, doesn&#x27;t really smell like pure sport.</li>
            <li> The bars last a good long time and are very strongly scented.</li>
            <li> Finally, the soap lathers nicely and cleans quite well.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of everything by old spice .I</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re old.  :)</li>
            <li> I now respect the Old Spice commercials even more.</li>
            <li> Not too powerful.</li>
            <li> One of my reviewers got back to me again today to say it didn&#x27;t lather up as well as he would have liked and the scent didn&#x27;t stay with him</li>
            <li> Typically I find Old Spice to be more marketing hype than anything, but this bar of soap really does leave a nice, long-lasting scent, and it is in a shape that is very easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of strange</li>
            <li> The Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Bar Soap is surprisingly nice.  </li>
            <li> These bars make a great addition to his \\&quot;manly\\&quot; products and we will definitely purchase them in the future.</li>
            <li> Again the \\&quot;sport scent\\&quot; is not strong, but quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> Old Spice calls this &#x27;Pure Sport&#x27; but it doesnt smell like the Pure Sport deodorant, it smells more like soap used to smell before it was ruined by people trying to make soap smell like something its not supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So they definitely work nicely on 12 year old skin and will be a staple in our home!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get any more basic than that...</li>
            <li> This is definitely a product we will buy more of.</li>
            <li> Really like the enduring fresh after-shave smell.</li>
            <li> Pretty funny.  </li>
            <li> I noticed three things when I first get the soap.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice - the usual \\&quot;pure sport\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li> This scent is similar to Irish Spring soap but a little more pleasant and not as strong.</li>
            <li> The clean fresh scent of the Old Spice soap is strongly reminiscent of the Irish Spring soap scent - and that&#x27;s actually a good thing in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It gives off a pleasant clean scent while applying, similar to other bar soaps.</li>
            <li> so i cant say if it has a standard old spice smell, but as i said, i liked the scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what else I can say, but as far as I can tell it is one of the cheapest available bar soaps on Amazon, so I really do highly recommend it, especially for Men :)</li>
            <li> soap lathers to a nice, thick foam - washes off clean without leaving any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might not be the best soap in the market relative to other similar products with respect to prices.</li>
            <li> Overall he likes the convenience of the body wash, but found these bars easy to hold and didn&#x27;t have any problems with using them to wash his face.</li>
            <li> I should have looked closer at the pure sport name.</li>
            <li> Would certainly purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It smells greats and lathers up really well.</li>
            <li> He said he didn&#x27;t notice the scent much.</li>
            <li> haha ...</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t think much about</li>
            <li> - I really did like the soap.</li>
            <li> After the shower, I feel clean and not dry.</li>
            <li> it cleans like soap but really, do you really have to make it so stinky?</li>
            <li> The last thing I wanted was that Old Spice cologne smell my grandfather would wear, but this is something better.</li>
            <li> Does it leave you more refreshed than other soaps out there?</li>
            <li> From deodorant to after shave, Old Spice is a pretty reliable brand.  </li>
            <li> Lathers nicely, packaged like usual.</li>
            <li> Just one sniff of Old Spice takes me back in time; fond memories of the important men in my life.</li>
            <li> In addition, the soap hasn&#x27;t ebbed away too quickly, despite daily use of almost three weeks.  </li>
            <li> It produces a decent amount of lather.  </li>
            <li> As to its main purpose, it is soap and it works well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got the Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Bar Soap because I was looking for a cheaper soap than the gel.</li>
            <li> But after using it that fresh clean smell does not last for long.</li>
            <li> school, honest, reliable and hard working&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Again, this is a plus for those who want their skin to literally squeak after a shower (and there are many who genuinely do), but after years of using shower gels with moisturizers, it felt a little like scrubbing down with lye.  </li>
            <li> In those days, every man I ever new used this product and the after-shave too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was with them to find new high-end products, not $3 bars of soap.</li>
            <li> Let me say, I live in an area that is murder on my allergies</li>
            <li> The 37 year old who works hard at a bakery liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a bit smaller and denser than the Irish Spring soap bars, but lather equally well and leave my skin feeling clean, fresh yet never dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing</li>
            <li> My son uses all the Old Spice products and we mainly purchase the body wash.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just silly hype, but it really does deserve those good but crazy-funny commercials.</li>
            <li> It smells fine, but the smell is pretty hard to detect.</li>
            <li> done Old Spice!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this bar of soap and I would certainly purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Classic Old Spice fragrance and what you would expect from Old Spice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years, good thing Amazon always has it to buy because it&#x27;s hard to find anywhere else!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Old Spice but this soap has very little scent.</li>
            <li> and I realized that I have been using Old Spice&#x27;s deoderant for MANY years now, and I also remembered the older Old Spice commercials (I mean like 25+ years old) about the smell of the soap.  </li>
            <li> This soap smells (obviously) like the Old Spice Pure Sport scent.  </li>
            <li> so you can get a grip on it in the shower and the bar seems to still be hard after several uses which is a good indication that it will last a while.  </li>
            <li> I grew up in an era where young men had three choices when it came to anything with a scent.</li>
            <li> Old Spice, Brut and Canoe.</li>
            <li> you like the scent of Old Spice cologne or aftershave</li>
            <li> , Old Spice has stood the test of time admirably.</li>
            <li> now my 78 year young mom says &amp;#34;You smell like my dad did&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Each bar lasts a while, and does not leave the skin smelling too much, but just enough</li>
            <li> I shower using old spice bar and end with body wash which eliminates the tightness of bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear any cologne (it&#x27;s just my old spice</li>
            <li> Just that &#x27;old school soap&#x27; smell as my wife stated.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised I would like it.</li>
            <li> I nearly felt as though I didn&#x27;t need cologne after using it.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> The Old Spice made a difference IMMEDIATELY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not some 16 year old kid that drenches himself in &amp;#34;sprays&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t need to smell like my soap all day.</li>
            <li> I like this soap and I (74 year old man)</li>
            <li> think I smell like a 50 year old man ...</li>
            <li> happen to like the Old Spice aroma and the soap</li>
            <li> The soap is OK, but not the typical Old Spice scent I expected.</li>
            <li> That left Old Spice for the rest of us &#x27;normal&#x27; guys.</li>
            <li> Normally I use Irish Spring bath soap bars, but I have always like the smell of Old Spice after shave</li>
            <li> It has a decent smell; however, it leaves behind the same old dryness that most bar soaps do.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell at all like the Old Spice aftershave, which might be a plus for those who don&#x27;t care for the traditional Old Spice, but we both like that scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In general</li>
            <li> Besides the unique design, not much else stood out to me about this product than other bar soaps.</li>
            <li> The odd barbell-ish shape gives you a decent grip so you can scrub with the two sides sticking out from your grasped hand - all the while reminding you that you should be getting back to the gym, lifting real weights, girly man.</li>
            <li> I remember my Grandfather always had the scent of &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; on him- I use only Old Spice aftershave</li>
            <li> My husband wanted to get this because he&#x27;s fond of Old Spice products overall.  </li>
            <li> You can even barely smell it when you use it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent - it reminds me a very subtle polo sport cologne.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the trip down memory lane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what that is supposed to mean, honestly.  </li>
            <li> The size really is what you would expect for a soap on the rope size, I would consider the bar a little smaller than a medium sized soap bar.  </li>
            <li> I havent used other old spice products</li>
            <li> But once I turn off the water and step out, all my nose detects is the usual Pure Sport scent.  </li>
            <li> An avid athlete, biker who plays hard uses this product.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The carton is unappealing but adequate.</li>
            <li> As the one who has to smell him when he gets home from his adventure, dripping in sweat, I am grateful for the strong scent of Old Spice that doesn&#x27;t mask unpleasant smells, but makes them virtually non-existent.  </li>
            <li> Same scent as the Old Spice Pure Sport deodorant but very weakly scented.</li>
            <li> However after using the bar soap, my skin was left feeling very dry.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems to leave a slippery feeling after what I consider to be a normal amount of rinsing.  </li>
            <li> Minor quibble</li>
            <li> No need to worry if it has a scent that will overpower other scents or last all day.</li>
            <li> If it was meant to be funny, the humor is weak or non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite owning a few really expensive colognes (Creed, Bond) I still can&#x27;t get over how I get the most compliments on days</li>
            <li> Well just imagine when you smell similar deodorants that seem to promote sports or an active lifestyle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My one criticism is that this soap is not particularly fragrant.</li>
            <li> It does lather up well but considering the small size of the bars, it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Since it is not advertised to have moisturizing properties, I can only describe this a soap residue that gets left behind unless extra time is spent rinsing.  </li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say but they seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> an over zealous Amazon description writer took the supplied flyer from Old Spice and thought they were being serious and included it in the description points.  </li>
            <li> But I guess that is to encourage us to buy their other products.</li>
            <li> only wish whatever causes the slick feel would sometime be improved to where you felt no traces of residue.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t usually use bar soap, opting instead for various shower gels.  </li>
            <li> I bought this when they were on sale due to a coupon on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The contents are not exactly fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;deal breaker\\&quot; for me would be if it had an unpleasant scent and was ineffective in keeping a man smelling gresh and clean even after vigorous exercise.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is with the scent.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I got straight on Amazon and ordered this up.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get a real wide variety of choices of bar soap to choose from when you go to the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Doesnt dissolve in the shower after a couple days, it stays in bar form until you wear it down with use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> down to the test.</li>
            <li> Would even buy it again paying a slight - say 15% - premium because I like the scent.</li>
            <li> The slickness is not quick to rinse off and I find myself in the shower just a little longer in attempts to rid the filmy slickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport soap is a  great products. It smells greats and lathers up really well. Also it leaves you with a very clean feeling. My only complaint is with the scent. It smells great and the smell is not overpowering like some soaps. But after using it that fresh clean smell does not last for long. After an hour I noticed that the smell of the soap was gone. Now I don&#x27;t expect the scent to last all day but an hour after showering I would still like a hint of that clean scent. But I guess that is to encourage us to buy their other products. Still a great product.</li>
            <li> It feels weird reviewing a bar of soap, but this bar is so different from other bar soap I&#x27;ve used, it relly does deserve the review!  Typically I find Old Spice to be more marketing hype than anything, but this bar of soap really does leave a nice, long-lasting scent, and it is in a shape that is very easy to hold and use.  I don&#x27;t really know what else I can say, but as far as I can tell it is one of the cheapest available bar soaps on Amazon, so I really do highly recommend it, especially for Men :)</li>
            <li> I grew up in an era where young men had three choices when it came to anything with a scent. Old Spice, Brut and Canoe. Brut was for the slicks who used Brylcreem and rolled up their t-shirt sleeves, and Canoe was for the preppies. That left Old Spice for the rest of us &#x27;normal&#x27; guys. Old Spice has always had a knack for providing products with clean, appealing scents that didn&#x27;t leave others thinking they&#x27;d stumbled onto the \\&quot;Jersey Shore\\&quot; set by mistake when you entered the room. This is a great product that should probably do well with the over-45 crowd, and the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; guys under that age. I usually use Lever soap, but since trying a 6-pack of this, I&#x27;ll be switching. Nice scent, long lasting, and good suds. Doesn&#x27;t get any more basic than that...</li>
            <li> Normally I use Irish Spring bath soap bars, but I have always like the smell of Old Spice after shave so I thought I would give their bath soap bars a try.  I was pleasantly surprised at the light scent of these 4 ounce ergonomically shaped easy to grip bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit smaller and denser than the Irish Spring soap bars, but lather equally well and leave my skin feeling clean, fresh yet never dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing these products, I give the edge to Old Spice because of the pleasant smell and easy grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the scent of Old Spice cologne or aftershave, I will bet that you will like this inexpensive product too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it with confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a number of reviews raving about the scent of this soap.  To me, it was virtually neutral.  It does lather up well but considering the small size of the bars, it doesn&#x27;t last long.  I used one and passed the rest on to my son-in-law.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very refreshing, masculine and clean. It is a pleasure to use with the invigorating scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one apprehension in using the soap is that it produces a very slick feel. The slickness is not quick to rinse off and I find myself in the shower just a little longer in attempts to rid the filmy slickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers very well and has me smelling nice, manly and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish whatever causes the slick feel would sometime be improved to where you felt no traces of residue.</li>
            <li> The soap is OK, but not the typical Old Spice scent I expected. I should have looked closer at the pure sport name.</li>
            <li> I consider this a man&#x27;s fragrance, attributing this to my father and brothers using it when I was a teen back in Ohio. Just one sniff of Old Spice takes me back in time; fond memories of the important men in my life. In those days, every man I ever new used this product and the after-shave too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit strong for women, so I don&#x27;t use it for anything but washing my hands... Mostly for the nostalgia...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Old Spice has stood the test of time admirably. Thanks for the trip down memory lane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Betty Dravis, June 20, 2013&lt;br /&gt;Author of \\&quot;Millennium Babe: The Prophecy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Bar Soap is surprisingly nice.  It cleans like any other soap but doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin too bad. The odd barbell-ish shape gives you a decent grip so you can scrub with the two sides sticking out from your grasped hand - all the while reminding you that you should be getting back to the gym, lifting real weights, girly man. The clean fresh scent of the Old Spice soap is strongly reminiscent of the Irish Spring soap scent - and that&#x27;s actually a good thing in my opinion.  Strong, manly scent - again, reminding you to hit the weights, weakling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers to a nice, thick foam - washes off clean without leaving any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended! It&#x27;s a soap and fitness instructor all in one!  :)</li>
            <li> From deodorant to after shave, Old Spice is a pretty reliable brand.  Therefore I had little trepidation when I got my hands on this bar soap.  After using this soap for about three weeks I can safely say it is a great product.  It has a strong but mild smell, which means the fragrance of the soap is masculine (like most Old Spice products) but not too strong or cheap smelling.  The bar of soap itself is contoured to a man&#x27;s hand and does not easily slip out of grip.  In addition, the soap hasn&#x27;t ebbed away too quickly, despite daily use of almost three weeks.  Finally, the soap lathers nicely and cleans quite well. I highly recommend this bar of soap and I would certainly purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> My son uses all the Old Spice products and we mainly purchase the body wash. But we decided to give the bar soap a try. What a great product. The bar is easy to hold, offers a light scent that my son loves and suds up nicely. These bars make a great addition to his \\&quot;manly\\&quot; products and we will definitely purchase them in the future. Overall he likes the convenience of the body wash, but found these bars easy to hold and didn&#x27;t have any problems with using them to wash his face. So they definitely work nicely on 12 year old skin and will be a staple in our home!!</li>
            <li> It has a decent smell; however, it leaves behind the same old dryness that most bar soaps do. The dove men soap is the only one I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> I love using these soap bars and they come with 6, so i wont run out anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I remember my Grandfather always had the scent of &amp;#34;Old Spice&amp;#34; on him- I use only Old Spice aftershave, when I saw these bars of their soap, I knew I wanted to get them- now my 78 year young mom says &amp;#34;You smell like my dad did&amp;#34; I take that as a compliment, he was &amp;#34;Old school, honest, reliable and hard working&amp;#34; I&#x27;m sorry we don&#x27;t see more of that behavior anymore- But we still have Old Spice, Thanks Amazon for the good soap that makes my mom smile and me smell nice, thanks Old Spice for the timeless scent that always brings back memories of good men who helped make our nation Great</li>
            <li> great smelling bars of soap. Smells like a man should. Lathers nicely, packaged like usual. Each bar lasts a while, and does not leave the skin smelling too much, but just enough</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Old Spice but this soap has very little scent. It also does not lather well, but feels good on the skin. The shape is nice. And it&#x27;s cheap. No big loss, just a loss. I had to try it.</li>
            <li> This soap smells (obviously) like the Old Spice Pure Sport scent.  I have the same deodorant and liquid body wash.  This soap is a great alternative to the liquid body wash, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  Great value getting this quantity off Amazon for so cheap!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of everything by old spice .I give some to others to try. The price was good.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin real tight after shower. Aroma is ok, doesn&#x27;t really smell like pure sport. Pretty disappointed. I shower using old spice bar and end with body wash which eliminates the tightness of bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Smell like a champion every morning, you can even put it in your hair for extra woman lure all day</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap, it smells like a man should smell. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years, good thing Amazon always has it to buy because it&#x27;s hard to find anywhere else!!</li>
            <li> What can I say? I use this deodorant every day and it works.  Smells good. Keeps me dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like buying it in bulk like this. You&#x27;ll always need deodorant, and it doesn&#x27;t go bad sitting in the cupboard.</li>
            <li> Despite owning a few really expensive colognes (Creed, Bond) I still can&#x27;t get over how I get the most compliments on days I don&#x27;t wear any cologne (it&#x27;s just my old spice deodorant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the bar soap is a great way to get a little more of that scent that girls seem to love. I like the shape that&#x27;s not a traditional bar soap size but has a bit of a handle/grip to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done Old Spice!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> This soap has a pleasant fresh scent that is not overpowering.  It produces a decent amount of lather.  The bar shape is designed well so you can get a grip on it in the shower and the bar seems to still be hard after several uses which is a good indication that it will last a while.  My only complaint is that it seems to leave a slippery feeling after what I consider to be a normal amount of rinsing.  Since it is not advertised to have moisturizing properties, I can only describe this a soap residue that gets left behind unless extra time is spent rinsing.  I took off a star for this.  Other than that, I think it&#x27;s a fine choice, and a \\&quot;manly\\&quot; one too.</li>
            <li> I like this soap.  As to its main purpose, it is soap and it works well.  Doesnt dissolve in the shower after a couple days, it stays in bar form until you wear it down with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is where I become a big fan.  There is no lavender, flowers, lotions, or other crazy scents.  Just that &#x27;old school soap&#x27; smell as my wife stated.  Old Spice calls this &#x27;Pure Sport&#x27; but it doesnt smell like the Pure Sport deodorant, it smells more like soap used to smell before it was ruined by people trying to make soap smell like something its not supposed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a good soap, at a good price.  No need to worry if it has a scent that will overpower other scents or last all day.</li>
            <li> I love the scent - it reminds me a very subtle polo sport cologne.  The bars are formed perfectly; They fit wonderfully in the hand. It&#x27;s hard to say but they seem to last a long time. Give this product a try!  I love it.  When in a huge rush, once or twice I&#x27;ve even used it to wash my hair - with success.</li>
            <li> They used to make this soap years ago, and then they stopped. Why? Who knows... maybe it was because they came out with the shower gel. While that stuff was okay, some people just prefer bar soap. They prefer it enough to actually write a review about it. Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of strange but I digress...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys don&#x27;t get a real wide variety of choices of bar soap to choose from when you go to the grocery store. So when this was re-released I was excited. It smells really fresh and clean while having a nice &#x27;sporty&#x27; note to it. What the heck does that mean? Well just imagine when you smell similar deodorants that seem to promote sports or an active lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, guys if you&#x27;re looking for some good soap, check this stuff out. It&#x27;s not the old &#x27;sailboat smell good&#x27; scent, it&#x27;s something new.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted to get this because he&#x27;s fond of Old Spice products overall.  We don&#x27;t usually use bar soap, opting instead for various shower gels.  This soap looked and smelled a lot like the old-school Irish Spring bar soap, so that&#x27;s what it reminded me of.  It didn&#x27;t smell at all like the Old Spice aftershave, which might be a plus for those who don&#x27;t care for the traditional Old Spice, but we both like that scent.  We&#x27;re old.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general the soap was good, lathering well and having a nice smell that&#x27;s not too strong, but the one thing neither of us cared for was how drying it seemed to be.  Again, this is a plus for those who want their skin to literally squeak after a shower (and there are many who genuinely do), but after years of using shower gels with moisturizers, it felt a little like scrubbing down with lye.  Very clean and refreshing, but you&#x27;ll definitely want to lather on some lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was surprised I would like it. I originally thought it was going to have some sort of strong, musky smell to it. The last thing I wanted was that Old Spice cologne smell my grandfather would wear, but this is something better. It has a scent I like smelling even when I&#x27;m washing my hands with it. I truly enjoy have the scent on me. I now respect the Old Spice commercials even more. I thought it was just silly hype, but it really does deserve those good but crazy-funny commercials. I would definitely try this again, once I run out.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I like it.  I don&#x27;t have to get my wife to buy it when she&#x27;s out.  The smell is nice, and the shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find anything negative to say about this product.  The scent is very nice - the usual \\&quot;pure sport\\&quot; smell.  Most here will already be familiar.  I did find, however, that it smells a bit different *in the shower* - which is to say, it smells almost a little lardy in the shower.  But once I turn off the water and step out, all my nose detects is the usual Pure Sport scent.  This soap kills odor very well, is pleasant and easy on the skin, and comes in a great shape that&#x27;s easy to grip.  And of course there&#x27;s something timeless and appealing about the brand and logo itself.  You will, as they say, feel like your dad.  Five stars for a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s My Personal Opinion, But To Me, It Smells The Same And Leaves Your Skin Feeling The Same As Palmolive. I Usually Use Dove Men + Care, And Decided To Try Something Else. I&#x27;ll Definitely Be Going Back To Dove!</li>
            <li> This soap is the best-smelling soap I&#x27;ve ever used. The first time I used it my gf was all over me, telling me this is the best I&#x27;ve ever smelled. I&#x27;m a clean dude, I soap up, but this is obviously powerful stuff. I nearly felt as though I didn&#x27;t need cologne after using it. Perhaps for some people it is too potent, but I recommend this soap!</li>
            <li> The bars last a good long time and are very strongly scented. You can buy these most places, like Meijer, Walmart, but Amazon&#x27;s price is very good and you don&#x27;t have to drive anywhere. I bought this when they were on sale due to a coupon on Amazon. I may buy again here depending on the price when my hubby needs it.</li>
            <li> So, I actually received a sample of this from one of those monthly &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; companies. I was actually mad. I was with them to find new high-end products, not $3 bars of soap. I decided to try it since it was there. Wow. Let me say, I live in an area that is murder on my allergies and I&#x27;ve tried every body wash known to man and still itch. The Old Spice made a difference IMMEDIATELY. I was shocked. Needless to say, I got straight on Amazon and ordered this up. One of the things I like best is the scent. Not too powerful. I&#x27;m not some 16 year old kid that drenches himself in &amp;#34;sprays&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t need to smell like my soap all day. I like to wear cologne. The scent is refreshing, but doesn&#x27;t linger. Still, the biggest difference is in my skin. It has never been better! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Same scent as the Old Spice Pure Sport deodorant but very weakly scented.</li>
            <li> A great scent and works up a great lather. Would certainly purchase these again. Classic Old Spice fragrance and what you would expect from Old Spice.</li>
            <li> I have discovered that this is my favorite bath soap.  Mild but very nice fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my body.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim, and he wanted me to buy it again. My husband tells me that he likes the scent. I guess I will be buying this again</li>
            <li> This item has been known to create skin irritations.</li>
            <li> Body wash would get used up quickly, I got bought these and they last longer. They smell the same, and they don&#x27;t give you the sting/burn feeling that some body washes give you.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good soap. What can one say? It smells good and does the job. My one criticism is that this soap is not particularly fragrant. It smells fine, but the smell is pretty hard to detect. Otherwise, there is nothing not to like about this soap. RJB.</li>
            <li> I brought the soap home for the men in my life.  The 37 year old who works hard at a bakery liked it a lot. He feels it works well and he liked the scent. The 34 year old who works at a desk liked it but his pg wife banned it as she couldn&#x27;t handle the smell so that might have to wait for a while. And last a 25 year old who was happy to get free soap. He said he didn&#x27;t notice the scent much. I personally like the scent and would be happy if the men in my life used it.One of my reviewers got back to me again today to say it didn&#x27;t lather up as well as he would have liked and the scent didn&#x27;t stay with him but he did like how clean he felt.</li>
            <li> I began using this product this spring. This scent is similar to Irish Spring soap but a little more pleasant and not as strong. It helps you feel and smell your cleanest after a shower. However, if you are allergic to scents then this soap is not for you. Overall, I would say this was a great soap but it didn&#x27;t last long. It might not be the best soap in the market relative to other similar products with respect to prices.</li>
            <li> An avid athlete, biker who plays hard uses this product. As the one who has to smell him when he gets home from his adventure, dripping in sweat, I am grateful for the strong scent of Old Spice that doesn&#x27;t mask unpleasant smells, but makes them virtually non-existent.  My father used Old Spice when I was a child, so it always triggers pleasant memories when I see the product.  Combined with the deodorant, this bar soap is a good strong product for active men to use.  It is a regular sized bar of soap that lathers and lasts through an acceptable number of showers.  The \\&quot;deal breaker\\&quot; for me would be if it had an unpleasant scent and was ineffective in keeping a man smelling gresh and clean even after vigorous exercise.  This is definitely a product we will buy more of.</li>
            <li> I like this soap and I (74 year old man) think I smell like a 50 year old man ... haha ... I&#x27;d buy again, because I don&#x27;t know but I think I get more &amp;#34;showers&amp;#34; per bar.  They call their product &amp;#34;soap on a rope ... without the rope&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This soap is a good product without being anything exceptional. It has the desired smooth texture, rinses off easily, and leaves you feeling clean. That satisfies the basics of what most of us would want from a bar of soap. What keeps it from being a five star product is that it doesn&#x27;t have an especially pleasant smell that lasts on your skin after usage, like, say Dove&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Care bodywash; and doesn&#x27;t leave you with any especially refreshed feeling after you wish it. So it&#x27;s a good soap product, without being extraordinary in any way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifetime Dial soap user, mostly out of habit.  It&#x27;s just what I did.  Soap is one of those products that just \\&quot;is\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s not sexy, it&#x27;s soap.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and that&#x27;s it.  So I didn&#x27;t think much about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw this item during random browsing on Amazon, and I realized that I have been using Old Spice&#x27;s deoderant for MANY years now, and I also remembered the older Old Spice commercials (I mean like 25+ years old) about the smell of the soap.  So I thought - why not.  I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the smell of the soap, and the feel of the bar in my hand.  Now, this is billed as \\&quot;Soap on a Rope without the rope\\&quot;.  Not sure what that is supposed to mean, honestly.  All I know is that it smells nice when I&#x27;m showering, is a decent price, and does its primary job - clean me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though - the smell, while nice, tends to fade quickly.  Wish it lasted a bit longer, but then you&#x27;re probably getting into leaving a residue on your body to sustain that.  Minor quibble - I really did like the soap.</li>
            <li> The size really is what you would expect for a soap on the rope size, I would consider the bar a little smaller than a medium sized soap bar.  Really like the enduring fresh after-shave smell. 6 bars for under $5 is a good deal.  Another great value item to add if you need something for $5 to qualify for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only part that has me confused are the description points.  \\&quot;Soap on a rope without the rope\\&quot;? \\&quot;Rope not included\\&quot;? Is that supposed to be a joke?  I know Old Spice has some weird commercials so it may be a joke.  I&#x27;m thinking it was a joke but an over zealous Amazon description writer took the supplied flyer from Old Spice and thought they were being serious and included it in the description points.  Pretty funny.  Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I noticed three things when I first get the soap. The shape, the scent, and packaging. The shape is like a cylinder. It is easy to hold on to. Then it is scent, it is very light and mild. So don&#x27;t think about impressing anyone after you take a shower. You can even barely smell it when you use it. Then its packaging, all the six bars are wrapped in a plastic wrap. Then each soap is in a thin white paper box. Because the scent is so light, I put the rest of the soap within a zipper bag to keep the scent in. I would like them to have better packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now down to the test. Again the \\&quot;sport scent\\&quot; is not strong, but quite pleasant. After the shower, I feel clean and not dry. In the same time, I don&#x27;t feel oily like Dove soap. The price is right. If it is not because of the packaging, I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I liked this bar soap. It gives off a pleasant clean scent while applying, similar to other bar soaps. It doesnt leave any scent after shower. I havent used other old spice products so i cant say if it has a standard old spice smell, but as i said, i liked the scent. The design is like an arch, so its 2 ends are tilted downward... thus make it easier to hold. Besides the unique design, not much else stood out to me about this product than other bar soaps.</li>
            <li> I got the Old Spice High Endurance Pure Sport Scent Bar Soap because I was looking for a cheaper soap than the gel. However after using the bar soap, my skin was left feeling very dry. I was told that this is a common feeling with any bar soap but I couldn&#x27;t stand it, so I will definitely not buy the bar soap again despite being a bit cheaper and still having the pleasant smell like the gel.</li>
            <li> Items was as described</li>
            <li> Arrived 2 days early (great!) but remains unopened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure what the company is trying to do by claiming this is a soap on a rope without a rope. If it is a positioning strategy, it is too complicated for me to understand. If it was meant to be funny, the humor is weak or non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a soap, folks, just a soap. The carton is unappealing but adequate. The contents are not exactly fragile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to like the Old Spice aroma and the soap does leave you feeling refreshed so I give it four stars. Does it leave you more refreshed than other soaps out there? Not really. But it is a good product and I would buy it again. Would even buy it again paying a slight - say 15% - premium because I like the scent. If the price is greater than that. I will switch.</li>
            <li> The smell on this one is OVER powering like it began to over power my bathroom, then, hall way, then stairwell, to kitchen living room and bedroom, it literally was making house smell like soap in a day. I puked. it cleans like soap but really, do you really have to make it so stinky? what&#x27;s the point of having a soap that over powers like that. Who use this anyway? How stinky do you have to be?</li>
