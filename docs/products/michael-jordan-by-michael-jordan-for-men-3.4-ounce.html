            <li>you also cant beat the price for it and it arrived really quick too</li>
            <li>Love the scent of this since I was in High School.</li>
            <li>But it has been getting women excited since I first put it on in 1999.</li>
            <li>The cologne smells fresh and masculine, and for its low price, I really don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t more popular!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and crisp scent.</li>
            <li>Fresh pine-ish scent.</li>
            <li>the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;Also, nice cologne to have for a throw back day.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different cologne&#x27;s and this by far is the best I have ever tried, even better than any of the high priced name prands</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and very protected in package.  </li>
            <li>He first used it in Cancun.  </li>
            <li>Better to buy it here than the store next door.</li>
            <li>Good everyday cologne....</li>
            <li>Its a cologne you can wear everyday that has a good smell to it.</li>
            <li>Packaging came in a bubble wrapped envelope and also pretty fast shipping.</li>
            <li>the most, scent doesn&#x27;t stay with u very long, expected more.</li>
            <li>my baby (boyfriend) loves it and wants another one</li>
            <li>So Much I&#x27;m Going To Buy It</li>
            <li>nice smell greaqt price use it everyday</li>
            <li>Smelled like an older batch.</li>
            <li>This is the classic scent that started it all and is still one of our favorites.</li>
            <li>Classic EDT.</li>
            <li>Will buy this one again and highly recommend it to all.  </li>
            <li>Been rocking this since high school</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne and things are always on time or delivered earlier than expected when ordering through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have used this cologne for almost ten years and this was the first time I&#x27;ve ordered online.</li>
            <li>It has a very soft masculine scent, every man should have it.</li>
            <li>I bought it for a young teenager.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised! .</li>
            <li>As a teen I used to stick to axe products but those are too common and easy to tell apart.</li>
            <li>Had a hard time finding the original colonge.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find in stores as it is the original MJ cologne.</li>
            <li>I have several expensive bottles from D&amp;G and Ralph Lauren and they are nice in their own right but far too expensive for such a small quantity of cologne.</li>
            <li>The other MJ scents can&#x27;t shake a stick at this classic.</li>

            <li> Better to buy it here than the store next door.It was about $5:00 cheaper compared to where it&#x27;s sold cheapest at the mall</li>
            <li> I, for one, love this scent. Everyone I&#x27;m around loves this scent and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. This scent is all around amazing! Buying again! This and the Flight are the best by Michael Jordan. Also, the Legend one isn&#x27;t that bad, but I&#x27;m saving that one for when I get old.</li>
            <li> always loved this smell. good stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing spectacular, but you will like it. You&#x27;ll probably be able to recognize the scent. I would recommend it for and every day causal smell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smell it myself. But it has been getting women excited since I first put it on in 1999. No lie.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and so does my gf i bout this a long time ago and its not even a centimeter down the bottle.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, my husband loves it and so do I.  Not overly perfumed as some after shaves/colognes.  This product on Amazon was a great bargain.  It is hard to find in stores as it is the original MJ cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and I do too. Clean and spicy with a little attitude at a great price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years, and I get many compliments on how good I smell. The cologne smells fresh and masculine, and for its low price, I really don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t more popular! I have several expensive bottles from D&amp;G and Ralph Lauren and they are nice in their own right but far too expensive for such a small quantity of cologne. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised! .</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people who like a nice clean smelling cologne.  My son-in-law likes it and it&#x27;s hard to find in the north country.</li>
            <li> Best smelling cologne ever. Highly recommend to any guy or girl that has a guy she wants to smell delicious. Great for the price too!</li>
            <li> My mom asked me to get this for my dad and he smells great in it.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne and things are always on time or delivered earlier than expected when ordering through Amazon. Can&#x27;t beat it...</li>
            <li> This cologne is the best on the market and for a reasonable price. Love it. The other MJ scents can&#x27;t shake a stick at this classic.</li>
            <li> Awesome gift for my husband. Brought back childhood memories for him. It has a very soft masculine scent, every man should have it.</li>
            <li> the only fragrance my hubby likes</li>
            <li> I wanna smell like Mike.</li>
            <li> Product delivered on time am enjoying it</li>
            <li> A clean-good smelling cologne.Its a cologne you can wear everyday that has a good smell to it.Looking for good cheap cologne buy this.</li>
            <li> My son asked for this for xmas and it was just what he wanted. It also smells really good!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift before and had to get more after I always get compliments on dates about it.</li>
            <li> My son was very happy to get this cologne for Christmas and being that it&#x27;s discontinued in stores was a plus.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Gotta love the MJ colognes and my husband and I do. This is the classic scent that started it all and is still one of our favorites.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, smells great!</li>
            <li> Totally love this cologne! Will buy this one again and highly recommend it to all.  This is the best one yet !</li>
            <li> Bought this as a birthday present for my fiance to replace the one he used up. Love love love the scent and so does he.</li>
            <li> my baby (boyfriend) loves it and wants another one</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne on my man. He always gets compliments on how well he smells too</li>
            <li> It is a gift for my husband. Actually he only uses this perfume. Very good smell!</li>
            <li> This is Very impressive product with a very good price, seldom to see some thing like this. I am recommended. The Seller was wonderful.</li>
            <li> If u need a everyday cologne this is it. U will have to use it twice a day tho. This is the perfect after gym cologne something just too throw on. Great value</li>
            <li> It was ok @ the most, scent doesn&#x27;t stay with u very long, expected more.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this since I was in High School. The girls loved it too. I still get compliments and questions about what I&#x27;m wearing. Classic EDT. A must have for every man&#x27;s collection.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different cologne&#x27;s and this by far is the best I have ever tried, even better than any of the high priced name prands</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. We both really liked it. This is a big size. Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my nephew who is 12.  Its a clean cologne and not overbearing.  You know kids that age want to bathe in it so I thought this would be something that won&#x27;t over power everything else and it doesn&#x27;t.  My husband also wears it to work.  It&#x27;s clean and crisp scent.</li>
            <li> This is the real original deal. Fresh pine-ish scent. My fave.</li>
            <li> excellent shipping time and price</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, recommend it for sure. Packaging came in a bubble wrapped envelope and also pretty fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I smell good now, it helped me slam dunk the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;Also, nice cologne to have for a throw back day.</li>
            <li> I Love It So Much I&#x27;m Going To Buy It Again This Is A Must Buy One The Best By Michael Jordan</li>
            <li> Smells terrific and lasts for a long time. Wonderful Christmas gift for our son. The price was nice, too. Great gift.</li>
            <li> Great cologne - It is hard to find so I always order from Amazon.  My husband&#x27;s favorite.  He gets many compliments.</li>
            <li> As a teen I used to stick to axe products but those are too common and easy to tell apart. A friend gave this as a gift and I put it to the side cause upon seeing &amp;#34;Michael Jordan&amp;#34; I thought &amp;#34;how good can a basketball players fragrance be&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Another lesson why you should not judge something without trying. One day I couldn&#x27;t find my armani Cologne and I was in a rush so I saw this and tried it on just so I would have some kind of Cologne.  I&#x27;ve bough 2 bottles since then cause it&#x27;s such a good fragrance and I regularly get compliments on it. I&#x27;ve had people try and guess the brand and they always name the ones that go for $70+ a bottle.</li>
            <li> Remember: this is a cologne, not a perfum</li>
            <li> My dad loves this cologne which makes me happy because its his go to birthday gift which is no small feat</li>
            <li> I bought it for a young teenager. He loved it, his girlfriend loves it, so I guess it&#x27;s a five!</li>
            <li> Been rocking this since high school and I will continue to buy it until it&#x27;s no longer sold. I&#x27;ve always gotten compliments on what cologne I wear and I never tell :)</li>
