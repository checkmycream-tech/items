            <li> During winter my hands get so dry, there is nothing that can help them except this cream.</li>
            <li> It is rather expensive, but it looks like the tube will last at least 3 or 4 months, since I only have to use it once a day, and sometimes before I go to bed.  </li>

            <li> On a bad day, the skin on the back of my hands actually starts to hurt.</li>
            <li> At almost $40 for a 4.3 ounce tube, it&#x27;s expensive, but a very small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle yet timeless.</li>
            <li> I handle a lot of paper in the course of my workday, and that really dries out your skin, especially in cold weather.</li>
            <li> I AM NOT HAPPY.  </li>

            <li> This hand cream is fabulous. I always buy this and the rose scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> I adore this cream with no chemicals and made from herbs in Australia. The scent is subtle yet timeless. No phoney rose smell. This cream does not leave your hands sticky and is well worth the price. I plan to use it forever.</li>
            <li> The odor is way too strong. Even after being washed off the odor lingers. I do love roses and their aroma, but this odor is ridiculous.I  Returned item.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand cream! During winter my hands get so dry, there is nothing that can help them except this cream. I apply it overnight and I have soft hands all day long, as opposed to other hand creams when the softness in your hands remains till the next time you wash your hands. And I try so many before this. Certainly one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> This product keep hands moisture in a long time and the smell of it is gorgeous rose. And only a little hand cream can be used in whole hand.</li>
            <li> Five Stars In Every Way*****</li>
            <li> Nice product! I like its smell and it really soft my hand! Rose is the best!</li>
            <li> A lovely, rich but non-greasy hand cream that leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. It does have a strong rose fragrance, which I like, although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone who doesn&#x27;t like that particular scent. (Note: it is a natural floral fragrance, not chemical at all.) At almost $40 for a 4.3 ounce tube, it&#x27;s expensive, but a very small amount goes a long way. I handle a lot of paper in the course of my workday, and that really dries out your skin, especially in cold weather. On a bad day, the skin on the back of my hands actually starts to hurt. This product is instantly replenishing and soothing, without leaving a sticky or greasy residue. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The expire date was removed by some stainless tool because the container is made of metal. I don&#x27;t know why. It could be some kind of  cheating. I would like to ask for a return.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hand creams. When I am running low on this product I immediately purchase it again. I love the rose delicate scent. It leaves your hands very soft.</li>
            <li> THIA IS THE 1ST TIME I HAVE EVER HAD TROUBLE ...THEVPACKAGE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS TAMPERED WITH  THE BOX WAS A LITTLE BENT AND WRAPPED UP WITH CLEAR TAPE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.WHEN I TOOK THE TUBE  IT LOOKED LIKE IE IT HAD BEEN SQUEEZED. IT WAS BENT IN  3 PLACES. I AM NOT HAPPY.  GAIL STADLER  gailstadler@gmail.com</li>
