            <li> One of the tubes was missing and later I found the same product (complete!!)</li>
            <li> how long it can last you.last you.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands all year long.  </li>
            <li> My hands tend to get really dry for seemingly no reason.</li>
            <li> so dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit as a gift for my daughter because she tends to have dry hands in winter</li>
            <li> have slowly gone away thanks to the Almond Milk--where other moisturizers didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I would have paid less locally.</li>
            <li> for half the price at a big discount retailer.</li>
            <li> Of course, the tiny little metal tin CAN be difficult to open when your hands are all softened and moistened up, so you might want to use this first before anything else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Patches of rough skin</li>
            <li> After just a couple of nights using the hand creme and cotton gloves my hands were noticeably less dry and no longer in pain.  </li>
            <li> My cuticles are made out of anger and steel I think, so using this has been a HUGE help in softening and dealing with them.</li>
            <li> A little too nature smelling for my choice.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It is a really small gift set.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, going back to the old standby, Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> sum it up, if you have really bad, dry hands or are having to a) plunge them into water or b) cleaners all day</li>
            <li> My hands get incredibly dry and cracked in the winter time and become rather painful.  </li>
            <li> Well it smells really, really bad to me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it was bad, but not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> I received this kit for last Christmas (Christmas 2009) and I am STILL using it. This is an amazing little bundle for price and effects and it really made me question why on earth I hadn&#x27;t ever purchased more Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s almond milk hand creme packs a moisturizing punch. I have only had to use little more than a daub at the end of my index finger to moisturize and soften the entire skin on my hands. I have super dry/problem areas on my elbows and ankles too, so decided--what the heck--I&#x27;ll use it there too. Patches of rough skin I&#x27;ve had for AGES have slowly gone away thanks to the Almond Milk--where other moisturizers didn&#x27;t work. It smells perfect. Lightly scented with almond, just enough to make you smell fantastic but not like you rolled around in a bath tub of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small tube of Burt&#x27;s Bees Shea Butter hand repair cream does its job, but I haven&#x27;t used it more than once. Why? ....Well..it...Well it smells really, really bad to me. It sort of reminds me of the same smell of a certain cream (I can&#x27;t remember the name) that&#x27;s medicated and use for baby rashes. And while I applaud them for not scenting it, the smell of it isn&#x27;t something I enjoy so I rarely use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lemon cuticle softener is a godsend. My cuticles are made out of anger and steel I think, so using this has been a HUGE help in softening and dealing with them. Also the cuticle softner smells SO good--as good as the almond milk and far, far better than the shea butter cream. Of course, the tiny little metal tin CAN be difficult to open when your hands are all softened and moistened up, so you might want to use this first before anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves are ridic-a-cute, soft and clean. I&#x27;ve used them once during winter when my skin was very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, if you have really bad, dry hands or are having to a) plunge them into water or b) cleaners all day, this kit for the price is the right one, just for the almond milk and how long it can last you.last you.</li>
            <li> great products super fast delivery</li>
            <li> I recommend it for battered hands smell is a bit strong but the benefits as reward</li>
            <li> Before I purchased the hand repair kit, I had heard people raving about Burt&#x27;s Bees, but I hadn&#x27;t really tried it myself. My hands always chap during the winter, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try, and now I&#x27;m in love. The cuticle cream is wonderful, and the hand repair cream is really effective. The gloves don&#x27;t fit very well, but the actual products are great and I highly recommend them to anyone with dry hands or nails.</li>
            <li> I would have thought this item was coming in a gift basket or bucket.  However, it arrived in a \\&quot;nice\\&quot; plastic bag.  It is a really small gift set.  I thought it would have been larger.  For what I paid, $11.99 Plus $3.99 S&amp;H, should have returned it and went to the local Drugstore to pick one up.  I would have paid less locally.</li>
            <li> The product was just what I thought what I was getting.  Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees products. The hand-set keeps my hands moisturized, in my line of work it&#x27;s imperative. I work with paper and boxes so I get splits and cracks in my hands (hurts like hell). The  kit seems to be working well so far, I just wish there was more in it.</li>
            <li> My hands tend to get really dry for seemingly no reason. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It worked if I slathered up my hand 3 times before putting on the gloves. It didn&#x27;t make them super soft, just not so dry. I can&#x27;t say it was bad, but not what I was hoping for. My husband bought me this Neutrogena hand lotion that I think has worked a little better for me overall. [[ASIN:B0056IJRV4 Neutrogena Lotion Light Sesame Formula]]</li>
            <li> Gloves could be a bit bigger</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law is a massage therapist (and huge Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s fan) so this gift was perfect for someone who&#x27;s livelihood depends on the feel of her hands.</li>
            <li> My hands get incredibly dry and cracked in the winter time and become rather painful.  After just a couple of nights using the hand creme and cotton gloves my hands were noticeably less dry and no longer in pain.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product more.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought this kit and absolutely love it. Though I don&#x27;t like the sticky feeling of the Banana and Beeswax creme and also banana like flavor , but quality wise I can give this product a 4 out of 5. Here you can find the complete review of each product in this kit :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://doshobhuja.blogspot.com/2013/09/my-hand-care-routine-with-burts-bees.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with these items.  They are nice size..not too small as I was worried they would be.  Great products!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  One of the tubes was missing and later I found the same product (complete!!) for half the price at a big discount retailer.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit as a gift for my daughter because she tends to have dry hands in winter and she was going to school in London.  Burt&#x27;s Bees doesn&#x27;t contain any of the harmful ingredients as most beauty products do.  Excellent buy and great gift.</li>
            <li> Love everything Burt&#x27;s Bees.  Great hands on everything.</li>
            <li> Very handy hand care kit. Great products.</li>
            <li> Love Burt&#x27;s Bees products - the gloves which are included are perfect for an overnight hand treatment.</li>
            <li> This product is quality, like all Burt&#x27;s Bees products, but the gloves leave something to be desired.  You constantly have to wash them almost after every use.  So if you are purchasing this product for the gloves, I would move on.  Otherwise the lotions and creams are great.  A little too nature smelling for my choice.</li>
            <li> I bought the package based on a recommendation from my daughter.  I have a disease that requires hand washing and carrying a hand sanitizer.  I have not had problems with hang nails until now.  I used the creams they sent and used the gloves overnight.  Over a week and I have seen no improvement, even using their cuticle product.  I really have to keep my cuticles under control, as any infection could be lethal.  Very disappointed, going back to the old standby, Vaseline.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands all year long.  I was hoping this product would be the one I was looking for.  It&#x27;s turned out to be ok, but &amp;#34;nothing to write home about&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Works awesome on your hands</li>
            <li> perfectly contained and items were in perfect shape, i am so very happy with my purchases.  Yes in deed dy</li>
