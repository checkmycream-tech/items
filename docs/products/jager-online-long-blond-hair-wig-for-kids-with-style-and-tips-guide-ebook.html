            <li>I received this item for instructional purposes for my honest thoughts.</li>

            <li>I ordered this for my 3 year old daughter and it fits her perfectly</li>

            <li>my daughter more</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get a better review than that.</li>

            <li>It fit on everyone&#x27;s heads just fine.</li>

            <li>This be a great wig for a costume, theater, play acting.</li>
            <li>fits my 2 years old dotter, nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to up my review because of this, but I really don&#x27;t think that a company selling something that isn&#x27;t what they say they&#x27;re selling deserves anything more than 1 star.</li>
            <li>Some of the strands on top were falling out, but that happens with normal hair!</li>
            <li>I recommend this wig and it would be a great gift to a little princess.  </li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t look as nice as it does in any of its photos, and its much more yellow, very unlike Elsa&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>My kids tried this on as soon as it came in, even though they are boys, we had fun with it.</li>
            <li>What a fun wig.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it definitely isn&#x27;t worth the price + shipping, one, because it doesn&#x27;t look like what the pictures show and doesn&#x27;t look like Elsa&#x27;s hair -</li>
            <li>right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>The hair is nice and soft plus looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li>so maybe it&#x27;ll fit other 3 year olds better</li>
            <li>My daughter really looked like elsa!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s still be my husband of I posted that picture here ;).</li>
            <li>Could have fit a little better.</li>
            <li>It also had many strands loose and scraggly</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 7, but she&#x27;s a little small, it fit her great</li>
            <li>My 5 year old has trouble getting it to cover the front of her forehead.but other than that it&#x27;s soft and looks good!</li>
            <li>The more she wears it, the worse it gets.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well and the hair itself is very thin at the top-not very full at all.</li>
            <li>only fits 2 year old with a tiny head.</li>

            <li> only fits 2 year old with a tiny head.</li>
            <li> It barely squeezed on my 5 yr old&#x27;s head and thewhole night of Halloween we had to keep stopping to pull it back down as it was popping off her head.  </li>
            <li> Fit extremely small and the color was very yellow :/</li>
            <li> They really enjoyed acting silly, but it did keep slipping off of their heads every time they moved.</li>
            <li> , it was just a pain getting it on because she has really long hair (no fault of the wig</li>
            <li> One of my boys has long hair with ringlets(to about his shoulders)</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t even reach out to apologize or offer any sort of excuse.</li>
            <li> The braid is also shorter than in the photos and doesn&#x27;t have the hair poof, but instead a strange widows peak looking V in the center.</li>
            <li> It fits a little small on my 3 years old but she has a big head</li>
            <li> It stayed on (what little bit she would actually wear it, she just doesn&#x27;t like wigs, but wanted one for this costume).  </li>
            <li> Not much I like about this wig.</li>
            <li> My daughter is four, and the wig is a little loose.</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> but after the first day she won&#x27;t even wear it because it constantly falls off :(</li>
            <li> Guessing it will be a tangled mess soon destined for the trash.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worse than Barbie hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this wig wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to me they&#x27;re sending out whatever they can get their hands on, and two, because it&#x27;s sheisty and disappointing that this company isn&#x27;t selling the product they claim they are.  </li>

            <li> Not much I like about this wig. It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well and the hair itself is very thin at the top-not very full at all. My daughter thought it was amazing at first but after the first day she won&#x27;t even wear it because it constantly falls off :(</li>
            <li> i liked it..my daughter more</li>
            <li> My grandchild says the wig is great. Can&#x27;t get a better review than that.</li>
            <li> only fits 2 year old with a tiny head. misleading</li>
            <li> I was actually impressed by the quality of this wig. Bought it for my niece to go with the Elsa costume I made her.  It stayed on (what little bit she would actually wear it, she just doesn&#x27;t like wigs, but wanted one for this costume).  She&#x27;s 7, but she&#x27;s a little small, it fit her great, it was just a pain getting it on because she has really long hair (no fault of the wig ha ha).</li>
            <li> fits my 2 years old dotter, nice</li>
            <li> My niece liked a lot. It arrived in perfect state and made a huge sucess</li>
            <li> Wonderful wig! Fits perfectly</li>
            <li> Looks great in person and my daughter wont take it off.</li>
            <li> It fits a little small on my 3 years old but she has a big head so maybe it&#x27;ll fit other 3 year olds better</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my 3 year old daughter and it fits her perfectly she loves it and looks so cute!</li>
            <li> Beautiful play wig. My granddaughter will love it.</li>
            <li> Fit extremely small and the color was very yellow :/</li>
            <li> FIT PERFECTLY!! My daughter really looked like elsa! Amazing!</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it!</li>
            <li> My kids tried this on as soon as it came in, even though they are boys, we had fun with it. They really enjoyed acting silly, but it did keep slipping off of their heads every time they moved. That is my only complaint. Although, I can&#x27;t say that I am an expert at what it takes to keep a wig in place. Some of the strands on top were falling out, but that happens with normal hair! This isn&#x27;t something that you can throw in a dress up box, It needs to be taken care of and kept apart to keep it in good condition. It fit on everyone&#x27;s heads just fine. Even my husbands, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s still be my husband of I posted that picture here ;). One of my boys has long hair with ringlets(to about his shoulders) We put it in a pony tail and it fit on his head just fine. This be a great wig for a costume, theater, play acting. I received this item for instructional purposes for my honest thoughts. It created a lot of fun imaginative play for my boys and I am excited to see their creativity with it.</li>
            <li> What a fun wig. I got this for my daughter and she loves it. This fits her perfectly and love how it comes with the hair net. The hair is nice and soft plus looks pretty natural. Perfect length.  I recommend this wig and it would be a great gift to a little princess.  This was based with my honest opinion</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this wig wasn&#x27;t what I was hoping.  It barely squeezed on my 5 yr old&#x27;s head and thewhole night of Halloween we had to keep stopping to pull it back down as it was popping off her head.  It also had many strands loose and scraggly right out of the package.  The more she wears it, the worse it gets.  Guessing it will be a tangled mess soon destined for the trash.  There is no grooming it....it&#x27;s worse than Barbie hair.</li>
            <li> Does not look anything like Elsa hair</li>
            <li> Gift for the Grand daughter, shes happy.</li>
            <li> Could have fit a little better. My 5 year old has trouble getting it to cover the front of her forehead.but other than that it&#x27;s soft and looks good!</li>
            <li> This was okay, because my daughter liked it, but it wasn&#x27;t what they&#x27;re showing in the photos. My daughter is four, and the wig is a little loose. It certainly doesn&#x27;t look as nice as it does in any of its photos, and its much more yellow, very unlike Elsa&#x27;s hair. The braid is also shorter than in the photos and doesn&#x27;t have the hair poof, but instead a strange widows peak looking V in the center. It also came in a different bag, and our wig doesn&#x27;t even look like another commenter&#x27;s wig where they shared a picture (and even theirs doesn&#x27;t look like the photo). I&#x27;d say it definitely isn&#x27;t worth the price + shipping, one, because it doesn&#x27;t look like what the pictures show and doesn&#x27;t look like Elsa&#x27;s hair - and it seems to me they&#x27;re sending out whatever they can get their hands on, and two, because it&#x27;s sheisty and disappointing that this company isn&#x27;t selling the product they claim they are.  Update: I just logged into my bank account to see a refund, for what I believe is this item. Looking at another 1 star review also leads me to believe this, as they were also reimbursed, though never contacted. I&#x27;d like to up my review because of this, but I really don&#x27;t think that a company selling something that isn&#x27;t what they say they&#x27;re selling deserves anything more than 1 star. They didn&#x27;t even reach out to apologize or offer any sort of excuse. I&#x27;d say I hope they continue sending out reimbursements, but what I&#x27;d have really liked what the wig they&#x27;re showing in the photos.</li>
