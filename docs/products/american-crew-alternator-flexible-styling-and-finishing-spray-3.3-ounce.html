            <li>good price, good product.</li>
            <li>considering Crew has a good reputation for quality men&#x27;s hair products.</li>
            <li>I might leave this in my car for &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;last minute touch ups&amp;#34; but thats about all its good for.</li>
            <li>And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>and it leaves a nice texture on your hair</li>
            <li>Awesome, great for styling or just keeping the frizz down.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s more like a liquid mousse than a hairspray.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for the mornings when your hair really doesn&#x27;t want to cooperate.</li>
            <li>I tried again after making sure I washed shampoo and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this spray for more than a year.</li>
            <li>it will allow you to style it easily.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I became acquainted with this product at the barber shop and like it very much.</li>
            <li>Good hold, but kind of crunchy sensation when combing hair after the gel has dried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through gel, axe putties, my sister&#x27;s mousse, and solid wax; but nothing holds as good as Alternator.</li>
            <li>Love this produce great for men, not such a wet or greasy look and  </li>
            <li>and then you get one that works just right.</li>
            <li>The hold is just right.</li>
            <li>While it smells nicely &amp;#34;mantastic,&amp;#34; it does not hold very well at all, and it actually left my hair feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>A little will go a long way but this product, though excellent, is still pricey.</li>
            <li>First time I used this I immediately got compliments.</li>
            <li>Okay for final touches..</li>
            <li>This product is great for a firm yet soft and non-crunchy hold.  </li>
            <li>Same good results even though smaller quantities.</li>
            <li>Works amazing miracles on old dry hair.</li>
            <li>Going back to the tube of light hold styling gel.&lt;br /&gt;Get some.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of it and it holds well throughout the day</li>
            <li>That is to much for a 3.3 fl oz bottle.</li>
            <li>No problems&amp;#62; Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>Solid purchase, will be back for more</li>
            <li>highly recommend my friend</li>
            <li>this product is awesome,it makes my hair flexiblble no shine mat finish, also it&#x27;s not sticky like other product, so far i love it.</li>
            <li>If you prefer a firm hold just spray lightly over dry hair and it works fine.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and keeps his hair in place without leaving it rock hard.</li>
            <li>hair can be restyled not stiff</li>
            <li>also smells masculine.</li>

            <li> Same as previous order.</li>

            <li> However, I have never put such a terrible product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After combing and spraying, I was good for about an hour.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thick and long (but not very long), so perhaps that impacted the results in some way; I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the product&#x27;s poor performance</li>
            <li> This product was failed to live up the advertising.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy and stiff spray and you can almost not get your comb thru your hair as soon as you spray it on.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with American Crew.</li>
            <li> 2-3 sprays after a shower, and my hawk will stay up for at LEAST 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I have a thick head of hair, and had to use about 4-5 squirts minimum to get any result.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that I would never use this product again, and since it was on the expensive side, I will try to give it away to a friend who may like it, but I would not be surprised if he also finds it horrible.</li>
            <li> It seems weird for men to discuss hair products, but every now</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is crap.</li>
            <li> This product is probably the worst styling product I have ever used.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product as always.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with American Crew.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I put on my hair. I&#x27;ve gone through gel, axe putties, my sister&#x27;s mousse, and solid wax; but nothing holds as good as Alternator. 2-3 sprays after a shower, and my hawk will stay up for at LEAST 24 hours. Smells good, and gets me some compliments periodically. Yes, pricey at local barber shops, but that&#x27;s what Amazon is for.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome,it makes my hair flexiblble no shine mat finish, also it&#x27;s not sticky like other product, so far i love it.</li>
            <li> Great product, not sticky and doesn&#x27;t feel like hairspray. I have fine hair so I spray some into my hair after I shower and then comb through. It doesn&#x27;t give me too much hold but enough control to last the day and to give my hair some volume. I would say it&#x27;s more like a liquid mousse than a hairspray.</li>
            <li> BEWARE - this is a much smaller size even thought the photo looks like the regular size product. And Amazon will NOT allow you to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> good price, good product.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy and stiff spray and you can almost not get your comb thru your hair as soon as you spray it on. I did not like this product at all.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for the mornings when your hair really doesn&#x27;t want to cooperate. First time I used this I immediately got compliments. Solid purchase, will be back for more</li>
            <li> Love this produce great for men, not such a wet or greasy look and  hair can be restyled not stiff</li>
            <li> The product is great!  It seems weird for men to discuss hair products, but every now and then you get one that works just right. This product doesn&#x27;t make your hair like a helmet, and it isn&#x27;t all sticky. The hold is just right.</li>
            <li> This product is probably the worst styling product I have ever used. While it smells nicely &amp;#34;mantastic,&amp;#34; it does not hold very well at all, and it actually left my hair feeling greasy. I used the product twice after shampooing and conditioning (two separate days), and it made me want to wash it out each time because of the way it made my hair feel. I was surprised by the product&#x27;s poor performance considering Crew has a good reputation for quality men&#x27;s hair products. My hair is fairly thick and long (but not very long), so perhaps that impacted the results in some way; I&#x27;m not sure. The bottom line is that I would never use this product again, and since it was on the expensive side, I will try to give it away to a friend who may like it, but I would not be surprised if he also finds it horrible.</li>
            <li> Okay for final touches..</li>
            <li> I have always purchased CREW hair products. However, I have never put such a terrible product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After combing and spraying, I was good for about an hour. The rest of the day I was left with my hair feeling&lt;br /&gt;like broom straw mixed with dried pancake syrup.  I tried again after making sure I washed shampoo and&lt;br /&gt;conditioners out of my hair just in case that was the issue.  Nope. Forget it! I cannot recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;to anyone with any hairstyle.  This product is crap. Tossed it.  Going back to the tube of light hold styling gel.&lt;br /&gt;Get some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this spray for more than a year. The on-line price was great!</li>
            <li> Hair crack is amazing! Works amazing miracles on old dry hair. You will never use anything else again. Promise! Go team</li>
            <li> Long curly hair.product works well with a couple of short pumps on towel dried hair.  Doesn&#x27;t clump hair, hair retains curls and still has bounce.</li>
            <li> Price price and delivery were excellent.  The product is as advertised.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. It is very easy to use and keeps his hair in place without leaving it rock hard. And it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Awesome, great for styling or just keeping the frizz down. also smells masculine.</li>
            <li> Smells great!! and i like how well it lets you manipulate your hair and it leaves a nice texture on your hair highly recommend my friend</li>
            <li> This product is great for a firm yet soft and non-crunchy hold.  You don&#x27;t need much of it and it holds well throughout the day</li>
            <li> Some how I thought it would be bigger.</li>
            <li> This product was failed to live up the advertising. As a stand alone product, it is seemingly ineffective. I have a thick head of hair, and had to use about 4-5 squirts minimum to get any result. That is to much for a 3.3 fl oz bottle. I had style with defining paste then add Alternator to make the hold last longer and look sharper. All in all, i am going to up grade my the hold in my next styling paste. I might leave this in my car for &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;last minute touch ups&amp;#34; but thats about all its good for.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product from a magazine and decided to give it a try. It holds up well for my 12-hour shifts.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and reviewed by newspaper.  Good hold, but kind of crunchy sensation when combing hair after the gel has dried.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. No problems&amp;#62; Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Same as previous order. Same good results even though smaller quantities.</li>
            <li> I became acquainted with this product at the barber shop and like it very much. The Pro side of this product is that it is a non-sticky lotion that you spray in your hand and then apply to your hair while still damp and it will allow you to style it easily. If you blow dry your hair the product will dry as well without any &#x27;wetness\\&quot; appearing in spots. If you prefer a firm hold just spray lightly over dry hair and it works fine. The only Con about this product is the price being somewhere in the neighborhood of $12-$15 for a 3.3 oz. bottle. A little will go a long way but this product, though excellent, is still pricey.</li>
