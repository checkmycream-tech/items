            <li>I saw an interview with Miranda Kerr, and she swears by rose hip oil as a part of her beauty routine.  </li>
            <li>Honestly....</li>
            <li>My skin is loving this stuff.</li>

            <li>My skin is loving this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was using another brand of rose hip oil until it ran out -</li>
            <li>This was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>and thats what you want in a rose hip oil</li>
            <li>but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice dropper</li>
            <li>The seller has stated that rose petals give the rose smell and the hips do not have a rose smell.  </li>
            <li>so I was not expecting a rose smell.  </li>
            <li>expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>I use it to make my own hand creams.</li>
            <li>It has a nice silky feel.</li>
            <li>good moisture...smells ok...</li>
            <li>and it’s been great as a moisturizer, keeping my skin nice and smooth despite the winter dryness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is an excellent quality bottle of rosehip oil at a reasonable price (for the 4oz size anyways).</li>
            <li>every application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve received a sample in exchange for an honest review</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about the product !  </li>
            <li>much worth it!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this!  </li>
            <li>On drier days, I mix 2 parts serum and 1 part oil to help it absorb more easily.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use very many products without having some kind of reaction.</li>
            <li>Though I do not have many wrinkles, I do feel like this organic oil helps me fight the fine lines that come with turning 40 and aging.</li>
            <li>but I was looking for a superior brand that was pure and organic.</li>
            <li>But I have experienced Moisturized, Hydrated Skin that is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>but so far happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Great results thus far.</li>
            <li>so the rosehip wouldn’t lose any of its health benefits, and so far I have been extremely happy VoilaVe</li>
            <li>My skin has become so smooth and more even textured.  </li>
            <li>The Rosehip Oil is working great so far.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re great with super packaging and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>It was good, didn&#x27;t seem to be as good of quality as other rosehip oils I&#x27;ve used, but seemed ok</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this amazing oil anymore!</li>
            <li>Just by using it twice a day for about 2 weeks I have already noticed my acne scars fading significantly and my skin tone becoming more even.</li>
            <li>This rosehip oil is great, I apply it directly on my face and around my eyes, is very light, it absorbs quick and it does not leave your face shiny.</li>
            <li>sometimes I use H2O+ for extra moisture but this oil is a good substitute for some of the items I used before and saves me a lot of money!</li>
            <li>It has a more rich feel about it.  </li>
            <li>it soaks in very quickly.  </li>

            <li>The order arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>This is a great essential oil that I find works best on my scars and dark spots.</li>

            <li>★ BEWARE of huge economy size Rosehip oils.</li>
            <li>but I see a difference with my nails and cuticles and that is huge in my book.  </li>
            <li>I applied a couple of drops to my fingertips and pat lightly all over my face.</li>
            <li>If you can handle a lot of neem,  Wondercide&#x27;s renovate soap bar was amazing on her acne rosacea but was too much neem for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Works great as a facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Great customer service and will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know if there are enough words to describe how great this product is and what it has done for our family.  </li>
            <li>I almost prefer it over my argan oil because I&#x27;ve seen such great results even overnight.</li>
            <li>Saw amazing results really fast.</li>
            <li>My skin was suffering of blotchy redness and it&#x27;s now smooth and seems to be one color.</li>
            <li>I use it at night and my skin feels so soft and bright in the morning.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a great product, but your service as a vendor is excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>seller of this product has a great response and personally contacted me with e-mail - not</li>
            <li>They responded to my emails and I even get free samples.</li>
            <li>It is doing a great job moisturizing and helping to minimize facial lines.</li>
            <li>Fantastic oil.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic recommendation.  </li>
            <li>have also used it all over my body as a lotion and it makes my skin glowing and smooth.</li>
            <li>A great extra benefit is that I got an email immediately from the company thanking me for purchasing it and to call if I had any questions about the product.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and does not feel oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Rosehip Oil might sound like it smells nice because of the word ROSE, but it actually smells nutty/fishy.</li>
            <li>this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Was looking forward to useing  this oil and defenetly will buy again thank you amozan for making this available.</li>
            <li>(the smell thing really threw me off to be honest) and I&#x27;m using it on my stretch marks for now hoping it works.</li>
            <li>it feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li>seller cares that you got the product, that you&#x27;re happy with it, and that you know of the various ways to use it.</li>
            <li>the smell is quite important.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this all natural product and encourage you to get it for yourself and a friend...</li>
            <li>/&gt;To protect the oil from light, it is bottled in amber glass, and the cap has a glass dropper for ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My cuticles and nails are smooth and moisturized as well.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face moisturized, smooth, and brighter, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>After applying it once a day for two weeks, my face does seem more calm.</li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>This one isn’t much different from the rest, but that should be a good thing, as most of the rosehip oil</li>
            <li>so far so good....</li>
            <li>I started using it as my main face moisturizer, and my skin hasn’t looked better!</li>
            <li>, I know from experience this means it is very fresh.</li>
            <li>I had found what I thought was a wonderful &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; routine but it involved multiple high priced products.  </li>
            <li>It is as advertised, light, absorbs easily, smell is earthy but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>What I love about it--besides the incredible benefits--is that it absorbs beautifully into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave that heavy oily feeling like some other oils.</li>
            <li>I will most certainly reorder!</li>
            <li>You can be sure it is pure here!</li>
            <li>After seeing a recommendation for rose hip oil on Dr. Oz, I went to Amazon and purchased this particular product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff, it&#x27;s simply amazing.</li>
            <li>In this You Tube Vide Rose Hip Oil was highly recommended after the treatment to moisturize.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge advocate in pure &amp; natural products and have taken the time to look into Rosehip oil and this oil by VoilaVe, and its all great.</li>
            <li>which is good, it absorbs quickly, and does leave my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It feels so light going on and absorbs quickly, making my skin feel so smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>are nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li>Seems to be working on my fine lines already, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling oily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have found this Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li>Love the rosehip oil;-)</li>
            <li>originally i gave it four stars because i thought it gave me a rash.</li>
            <li>but if you are already familiar with Rosehip oil</li>
            <li>Originally I had intended to use it on my husband to see if it would work on his psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li>I got it originally because I read that it helps repair sun damage and also promotes collagen production.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very important naturally scented too : )&lt;</li>
            <li>I love this Rose hip oil for many things its great to put on discolorations when you want to use something more natural and non irritating to skin.</li>
            <li>Great product... as a person w/very dry, sensitive skin who is also a sufferer of Eczema; I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I really honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect as this is a new path for me.  </li>
            <li>Worked great on dry skin on my face &amp; legs.  </li>
            <li>The instruction booklet that was available with the purchase provided important and enlightening skincare information.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchases rose hip oil online, but I feel as though I was ripped off and returned the product after the first use.  </li>
            <li>It is a light oil that absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it&#x27;s been amazing helping some of my psoriasis areas and a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Like other buyers said, it smells like fish oil, but it makes you beautiful</li>
            <li>I had read great reviews on Rose Hip Oil and was anxious to purchase and try it!</li>
            <li>Great remedy for dry skin!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is 100% pure &amp; ECO Certified Organic.  </li>
            <li>The pure rosehip oil from ViolaVe is much better.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is awesome, it keeps my redness, pimples and dry skin completely away!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this! :)</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful dark orange</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I mix it with Helichrysum oil and sweet almond oil to treat scars~</li>
            <li>I mix it with a bit almond oil and put it on my freshly washed face at night, my skin is smooth and glowing,</li>
            <li>far I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy this oil in the bath for all over body care, and have used it with success on my nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it so far - using it for everything from the patch of eczema on my elbow to my toddlers knee scars from falling.</li>
            <li>and I think that is why I love it so much.</li>
            <li>love it and highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li>The oil goes on smoothly, however, the smell and golden color are off putting.  </li>
            <li>It is cold-pressed from the fruit or hip of the wild climbing dog rose, also known scientifically as Rosa canina.  </li>
            <li>It was a nice addition when taking a bath, makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>but the results were good enough.  </li>
            <li>Has a woody smell but not bad or offensive.</li>
            <li>Even though it is an oil, it is light in texture and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, love the oil; will order when it runs out (eventually).</li>
            <li>And being pregnant, wouldn&#x27;t try anything full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I tend to have super dry skin, and the moisturizing benefits of this rosehip oil is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>Plus, it has imparted a more even rosy tone which de-accentuates the patches of redness and even the appearance of the fine blood vessels near the skin surface around nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I would try the renovate bar first and do a test spot first to make sure you don&#x27;t have a reaction.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and</li>
            <li>and it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>and the smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Well, after trying my first bottle of this oil, the verdict is in, and I am very pleased with this product and how soft my skin feels after use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell because it goes away quickly</li>
            <li>It does not leave a greasy film, it penetrates quickly leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li>It smells like oil, and it goes away quick and the skin appretiated it.</li>
            <li>I realize what works for one person may not necessarily  work the same on someone else, just saying this stuff is AWESOME,</li>
            <li>My skin absorbs it quickly although I don&#x27;t feel like it &amp;#34;totally&amp;#34; moisturizes my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>It was gone as quickly as the oil itself seeps in.</li>
            <li>Not too many companies go that extra step to make sure 1 the product was received and 2 ensure that you like the product.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great product that she highly recommends!</li>
            <li>I love the high quality and intend to purchase it again</li>
            <li>High quality and a lovely dropper too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;About how good it is or how well it works i cant say anything right now  because i only have been using it for 3 days</li>
            <li>This rosehip oil worked best when I combined it with other oils for my sensitive face</li>
            <li>Not using it that long to know if it&#x27;s good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I always had the impression since I was break out prone and my pores clog very easily, that I should always avoid any products with oil and use only oil free</li>
            <li>i got an invitation to contact the seller if i had any questions, and a boost of confidence that i would not only be happy with the product, but with vendor support.&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed really quickly leaving the skin</li>
            <li>applied to the skin, it is quickly and fully absorbed and doesn’t leave any oily feeling or sheen.  </li>
            <li>Leaves fact very soft and has softened lines and wrinkles,  I use this mostly at night, but have also used in am .  </li>
            <li>It made my skin very soft but make sure your hair is off your face as it did make my bangs greasy.</li>
            <li>The pure rosehip oil is a great single ingredient option</li>
            <li>Stellar customer service!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely amazed by this oil!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very moisturizing, but it made me breakout!!</li>
            <li>This makes it  a pleasure to use on the skin and cuticles and it gives excellent protection against dry skin, especially when applied after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never in my life did I think I could get soft , smooth skin so easily.  </li>
            <li>If you’ve never used Rosehip oil before, I would definitely recommend it, as it does do great things for the skin (sometimes unexpected!).</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and was hoping for a good quality oil.</li>

            <li>I use a few drops alone or with a drop of carrot seed oil before my moisturizer (Christina Moss Naturals which is also really great).</li>
            <li>It actually settles in the skin quite nicely.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>and I love how natural it is</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels and dryness is no longer an issue.  </li>
            <li>Out of all three, rosehip felt the most luxurious and soft.</li>
            <li>I also love that is all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>(they WILL NOT make your face more oily) and they make my combination skin soft and luminous.</li>
            <li>I can truly say that it heals blemishes and fresh acne issues nearly overnight, at most 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I had read many times that rosehip oil was a natural healer oil.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every dollar.  </li>
            <li>As I used this fresh out of the shower, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t take alot</li>
            <li>and I am enjoying it so far.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
            <li>At 34, I still suffer from the occasional hormonal breakout, and this oil helps to heal the skin but most importantly for me, fade the post pimple marks that before, stayed for weeks after a breakout.</li>
            <li>Now after this deep pore cleansing Rose hip oil is a moisturizer, a moisturizer that will not clog your pores.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to incorporate more natural and organic products into my skincare routine.  </li>
            <li>I tried all the sensitive skin/ oil-free versions of top brand names as well as drugstore alternatives but nothing helped.</li>
            <li>I tried all the sensitive skin/ oil-free versions of top brand names as well as drugstore alternatives but nothing helped.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>then it just gets absorbed</li>
            <li>Overall, I am thrilled to add this product to my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I run out SO fast because I love it so much</li>
            <li>but I think it worth it.  </li>
            <li>and well worth it for the benefits.</li>
            <li>Knowing that oil is often the cause of my acne, I was hesitant to put even more oil on my already sensitive</li>
            <li>My skin is drinking it up and feels soft, dewy and better than it did when I was in my twenties.  </li>
            <li>Kinda like the smell of freshly cut grass, but not as offensive.</li>
            <li>I use it under moisturizer but can definitely do the trick on its own.</li>
            <li>My shins are slender and it&#x27;s nice to look down and see lovely, youthful pretty skin.</li>
            <li>I love that it is 100% organic because I can trust that there is no hidden chemicals that I may be applying on my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a funky smell when it first goes on, but that disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was quick, and you get exactly what is in the picture/</li>
            <li>The last bottle had a strong smell like fish oil smell but this time it didn&#x27;t have the strong smell.</li>
            <li>but if you really don&#x27;t like it, then just add a few drops of your favorite skin loving essential oils such as rose, lavender, helichrysum, neroli and you will have a really amazing anti-aging skin product.  </li>
            <li>OMG very satisfied, noticed how extra soft, smooth my face is.  </li>
            <li>and you could see the improvements the dark spot on her face are fading very good product so far</li>
            <li>right when I got it.</li>
            <li>Goes right into the skin and no issues with coming off on pillows.</li>
            <li>You can feel it softening up your skin right there in the bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a smell and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li>All right got to say this stuff works</li>
            <li>I was interested in finding more natural methods to taking care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am particular about what I put on my skin and the fact that it&#x27;s organic is important to me.</li>
            <li>I honesty do not believe its true 100% pure.</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t like the smell, because it was a very very strong smell, the last time i used</li>
            <li>VoilaVe also has fantastic customer service - would highly recommend ordering from them.</li>
            <li>It may be a good oil, but it&#x27;s not right for my skin.</li>
            <li>a try its very pure</li>
            <li>The oil arrived very quick, was packaged very well and the oil smelled fresh and high quality.</li>
            <li>I saw a huge improvement in my developing fine lines &amp; wrinkles, hydration, and overall coloring/glow in just a week!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference with my fine lines and overall appearance.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s a pure and natural oil and that it&#x27;s organic and processed correctly (which makes all the difference).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other natural oils and rose hip is not the most pungent of scents.</li>
            <li>wear it after a hot shower, right before going to bed</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased the ViolaVe vitamin C serum, and really loved it and decided to purchase the Rosehip oil and the hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>( i don&#x27;t look like a grease ball in the morning anymore), makes my skin so soft and ready for makeup and on top of that</li>

            <li>I also started to use it as a spot treatment on red marks leftover from acne (not indented scarring - just red marks) because I have heard about the great regenerating properties of rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far from greasy and is easily absorbent.</li>
            <li>Like this very much.  </li>
            <li>Second, this oil is very smooth and versatile.</li>
            <li>I forgot to mention that shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery</li>
            <li>That being said, no difference as far as hyper pigmentation, fine lines, or any thing else</li>
            <li>I use with a little avocado oil which is high in vitamin E and great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I started using this product only a few days ago, so can not attest to its long-term effects, but it immediately made my fine lines look softer and my face feels great.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend an organic natural product like this -- way better than anything at Origins or</li>
            <li>As far as the brand, color and texture it is accurately described.</li>
            <li>I was nervous about using an oil on my skin because I suspected more clogged pores or breakouts, or overall oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle of it, and will be buying again.</li>
            <li>I will definately be purchasing more of this in the future!!</li>
            <li>Wondercide Natural Products has fantastic neem products for humans and your pets.  </li>
            <li>(Read about neem allergic reactions online first.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure if was the oil&#x27;s work or not, but I&#x27;m definitely purchasing another bottle.</li>
            <li>After applying to my face the first day I could smell the fishy, oily smell all day long...and don&#x27;t use it in your hair..</li>
            <li>I use many essential oils</li>
            <li>I am interested in seeing what will happen with continued use of these two products.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>love using essential oils on my face</li>
            <li>My dark spots are lighten up and my skin tone seems to look more smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using Rosehip oil</li>
            <li>She personally emails you to make sure you got the item and then follows up to see if you like it.</li>
            <li>There are SO many ways that I have seen improvements in my skin in a very short amount of time!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in the first week</li>
            <li>I use it on my face at night(nothing else) and even after sleeping in an air conditioned room all night my skin still feels soft, dewy and smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li>As for the overall feel on my skin...I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>First off, I did not smell anything from this oil as some reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li>The bottle is sure to last for a while</li>
            <li>At first I thought this oil did not absorb well.  </li>
            <li>After the first night I woke up with glowing skin.</li>
            <li>so much so that the burn didn&#x27;t even hurt after one day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my acne system but instead of moisturizers, I&#x27;ll apply rosehip oil to my face after as my nightly moisturizer and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks so soft and smooth.</li>

            <li>and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product and I am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out as most commercial moisturizers do.</li>
            <li>First time trying Rosehip Oil after being recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li>It is light and makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I massage it onto my skin as the last step of my skin care regime as it is more occlusive.</li>
            <li>This product is very brightening, and nurishing!</li>
            <li>I looked so healthy after the next morning!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the rosehip oil it leaves my skin soft and feels plump.</li>
            <li>You probably could’ve looked all of that up, so the rest of this review is going to focus more on this specific VoilaVe Rosehip Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really recommend!</li>
            <li>Always checking up to see how you are liking the product.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>Of course, the skin needs inside and outside care to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>I would say that my face does feel a lot smoother since the first couple of usages.</li>
            <li>I have been blessed with soft skin, but after two weeks my husband and my mother commented on the silky smooth feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I run out, I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face before bed and in the morning my face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been slathering this rose hip oil on my face and neck morning and evening with ABSOLUTELY NO BREAKOUTS;  </li>
            <li>My face is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have been aware of Rosehip oil years</li>
            <li>, I will recommend it to my daughter and my mother and at this point believe I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>and i seen a difference the first use.</li>
            <li>The first one was from another company; however, I can feel the difference in quality of this brand.  </li>
            <li>Finally I decided to put more on my face (6 drops).</li>
            <li>At first I thought it might be a coincidence, but then I started noticing a difference myself.</li>
            <li>My skin looks a bit plumper and more dewy, especially since I&#x27;ve started using it in the morning too (under my moisturizer).</li>
            <li>This thinness put me off at first, but then I realized how much quicker it absorbed into my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but it didn&#x27;t really take care of the bumps on my skin which I was really hoping it would.</li>
            <li>;) .</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>, I noticed it the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It works wonders on any dry skin and keeps my healthy skin absolutely glowing!!  </li>
            <li>VoilaVe is the real deal, organic, environmentally friendly, and extremely high quality.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>As for its effectiveness in combating wrinkles and fine lines, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to honestly say it does</li>
            <li>This oil really softened my rough, dry gardener&#x27;s hands - I highly recommend this for anyone with work-roughened hands - it&#x27;s THE BEST!!!!</li>
            <li>well i used to use Rose hip oil from other brand</li>
            <li>I’ve tried several brands of Rosehip oil, and quality wise, they’re pretty similar.</li>
            <li>It has a natural nutty scent and a rich amber color.</li>
            <li>am writing this review now because I am getting ready to order my second bottle, I love it that much!</li>
            <li>My face cleared up quickly after using it for few days, I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love it, and feel great using something without all those crazy additives.</li>
            <li>I used this same routine for a couple of years not really feeling like I saw great results..</li>
            <li>There are many so-called natural offers.  </li>
            <li>I will try everything to fight it, and this light pure oil is a natural and healthy way to moisturize my dry skin, nails and hair.</li>
            <li>You should absolutely try it, especially if your fine lines and blemishes are fresh.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel super soft!</li>
            <li>(Note:  Even though my experience was positive).  </li>
            <li>I had read of rosehip oil&#x27;s positive skin benefits and decided to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li>I was not required or compelled to write a positive review.</li>
            <li>am hoping to see more benefits after long term use of this product.</li>
            <li>Pretty much identical to the bottle of Nordic Naturals</li>
            <li>The first time I bought rosehip oil was from Whole Foods</li>
            <li>Works JUST AS GOOD if not better then</li>
            <li>This particular oil is fabulous and just makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Even fragrance free, dye free, super strength lotion doesn&#x27;t keep my skin moisturized past one or two handwashings.  </li>
            <li>Before application, the color is an unusual golden orange, from the high beta carotene</li>
            <li>It even gives my skin a healthy subtle glow, which tells me that it is actually doing something good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was dealing with excess oil production on my cheeks and forehead on top of having extremely dry patches on my chin, around my eyes and nose.</li>
            <li>It even gives my skin a healthy subtle glow, which tells me that it is actually doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li>I was dealing with excess oil production on my cheeks and forehead on top of having extremely dry patches on my chin, around my eyes and nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to buy oils in dark glass with glass droppers because plastic adds cancer-causing toxins to oils, and UV light causes the oils to create free-radicals, which ages your skin.</li>
            <li>did a hair mask and after washing it out and letting it dry, my hair was more</li>
            <li>It takes care of dry skin better than any lotion out there.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to forget....and the benefits last ALL</li>
            <li>I also have mild rosacea and extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is 100% pure.  </li>
            <li>so I can smell which is pure and which is adulterated.  </li>
            <li>Pure quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  100% PURE AND MADE IN THE USA</li>
            <li>so I know it&#x27;s pure.</li>
            <li>i think using this oil may have triggered it but certainly did not cause it.</li>
            <li>I also have  a large patch of sunspots in both arms, after two weeks the spots are lighter and not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 100% Pure USDA &amp; ECO Certified Organic</li>
            <li>Make certain to keep in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>I chose VoilaVe Organics because it was certified 100% pure and ECO certified organic.</li>
            <li>i add 3 drops to my 100% pure and unrefined shea butter for my face.</li>
            <li>First off it smells vaguely like rose a touch like rose water, it is an orange color but goes on your face clear.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for certified organic rosehip oil and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but those wrinkles are started to show, this product is really a good item for daily use, and it really moisture my skin for a long time!</li>
            <li>I think it is helping with my fine lines, but maybe I will update later when I&#x27;ve used it for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick, right on time as i expected.</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a smell when you first apply it to your face, but as you smooth it out, the slight odor quickly disappears.</li>
            <li>This seems to be little heavy for the very sensitive skin on my face, but it works beautifully as an eye serum for reducing (the beginnings of) fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Much better for you and worth the $$ that is way less than Strivectin SD or any other stretch mark/healer cream on the market that costs waaaaaay more and requires you to buy it over and over again for months.</li>
            <li>Then a few months ago I read a review on here that said rosehip oil and tea tree oil worked amazing together.</li>
            <li>I hear tamanu and sea buckthorn oil can help with skin rejuvenation and evening skin tone like rose hip oil though they&#x27;re more expensive.</li>
            <li>It is very absorbent and brightens my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think it would be rosey</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much as the odor has deterred me from using it.</li>
            <li>Very moisturized and not oily.</li>
            <li>Then I go back smooth it into my skin as you would when applying any lotion.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t so much at all for me</li>
            <li>Will absolutely keep using it as an alternative to chemical cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Excellent organic cold pressed rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>The combination of Rosehip oil and coconut oil has stopped the irritation and itch and my legs are much softer than before I started doing this.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>VoilaVe seems to be very committed to their products.</li>
            <li>It is a very concentrated oil</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very well moisturized with out leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li>If you are considering trying rosehip oil, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This really calms the redness on my face.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this product.</li>
            <li>I really need)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am impressed with the fact the oil is certifed organic and cold pressed.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and I will be ordering this product again.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me, and I think it might have made me break out.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>and lives in very humid Florida</li>
            <li>Very lubricating to skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and will order it again.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel much smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much fragrance at all.</li>
            <li>Has a very earthy smell to it.</li>
            <li>This does not depreciate the value of the product at all, and returning it was a breeze thanks to amazon.</li>
            <li>This does not break me out and helps so much.  </li>
            <li>The oil is very lightweight and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for</li>
            <li>really like the rosehip oil from VoilaVe.</li>
            <li>I highly highly reccomend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>The color was very orange</li>
            <li>My skin seams very radiant.</li>
            <li>I really like this Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>really i am amazed</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and healing.  </li>
            <li>I really do hope I didn&#x27;t get a rancid oil</li>
            <li>I guess because I didn&#x27;t really know what it was.</li>
            <li>and I definitely would feel comfortable ordering from them again.</li>
            <li>so I am very grateful.  </li>
            <li>Because who wants to go to bed with a fish?</li>
            <li>For my face this is light enough to use in the morning before applying foundation, once it has adsorbed.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>I cant really explain it.</li>
            <li>but I expect real intense results and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair silky soft</li>
            <li>I much prefer Medyskin for the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks Voilave...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that maybe I was expecting too much from this oil.</li>
            <li>I can use it on my curly hair as well as my face - anywhere that needs moisture really.  </li>
            <li>so I was very cautious before using it.</li>
            <li>Speaking of, the oil seeps in fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother (age 54) and she uses this for her whole body.</li>
            <li>I have recently switched to more natural skin care.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft, isn&#x27;t oily, and I think I look younger :)</li>
            <li>I had been trying different brands of rose  hip oil for about 6 months until I finally found this one.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it does minimize scarring, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I saw amazing results in less than 2 days no kidding!</li>
            <li>Usually, my skin reacts very quickly and I haven&#x27;t seen any breakouts after a few days of use which makes me really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Amazing and economical little powerhouse of benefits towards a clear, vibrant complexion.</li>
            <li>and I mean NEVER put oil on my face, but I thought I would give it a try since hearing that it was so good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy at all, just the right consistency.</li>
            <li>The color is very rich and I can tell this is a very high quality rosehip oil than other brands.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines are less visible, my skin tone is more even and much brighter, and my pores seem to be smaller too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other VoilaVe products before though, and I&#x27;d love the try</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with rosehip oil, but I also bought argan oil and pumpkin seed oil (from different companies) at the same time to see which one is the most compatible with my skin.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews for different rosehip oils on Amazon, trying to decide which to try out first, I finally settled on this brand.</li>
            <li>One of the top deciding factors was the fact that it has the official USDA organic label on the bottle, whereas other oils I considered claimed to be organic in their title and/or description, but produced no proof of it anywhere on the packaging or bottle.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was really surprised!</li>
            <li>I recently ran out of it and have noticed a significant difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>This works much better than other items I have tried before.</li>
            <li>I feel like this one is more &amp;#34;condensed&amp;#34; than other products.  </li>
            <li>I have such dry damaged skin (from Arizona and love to be out without sunscreen!)  </li>
            <li>I was weary at first about putting an oil on my very combination, sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased to see that this oil, like jojoba, does not irritate my sensitive skin or clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>hip oil has a clean, verdant odor, similar to the leaves and stems of roses.  </li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s just the skin stuff, I also use it on my hair to keep the frizzys down and keep my ends nice and soft.</li>
            <li>So far under the eyes the circles seem to be faded but not by very much.</li>
            <li>After having success with the rose hip oil as a facial moisturizer, I decided to use it sparingly (a little goes along way) on the ends of my hair .</li>
            <li>For a while I have been hearing about the amazing benefits of rosehip oil, but hesitated to try it on my sensitive, acne prone, unpredictably reactive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been hearing about the amazing benefits of rosehip oil, but hesitated to try it on my sensitive, acne prone, unpredictably reactive skin.</li>
            <li>I believe using less is better than using too much.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and slightly nutty, but fades quickly.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is it smells like cooking oil instead of having a light rose scent to it.</li>
            <li>People who have acne rosacea have more of these microscopic Demodex mites than the average person without acne rosacea.  </li>
            <li>My face breaks out frequently, when my friend first told me about rosehip oil</li>
            <li>This felt really soft and matte on my skin when first applied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and so far I really like it!  </li>
            <li>Overall not bad, but not what I needed for my skin problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a little surprised by the scent, which is not like rose flowers or rosehip fruits.  </li>
            <li>The results I have gotten from this already after 3-4 days of usage on my skin is already more even toned with less blemishes.</li>
            <li>and I like it even better than my previous brand of Argan...</li>
            <li>Exactly as expected and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>Ever since starting rosehip oil into my twice daily skincare routine (am and pm), I am in love with my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using it on a recent sunburn, and it&#x27;s healed up my skin really quickly -</li>
            <li>I must be allergic to something in this particular brand.  </li>
            <li>After one month of use, my pores are much smaller, the redness is much better, and I definitely have a glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best find for me since I use expensive stuffs such as Estee Lauder, Lancome,</li>
            <li>it penetrates quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to just float on the surface of the skin like some low quality oils.</li>
            <li>I only recently started using this but love the way it makes my skin feel -</li>
            <li>Wow, the next morning, my face was so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It is now a regular, daily part of my regime me and I&#x27;ll be ordering more as needed from this Amazon seller......</li>
            <li>product goes on smoothly and does not cause a single adverse reaction to my skin.  </li>
            <li>It has an earthy smell but it is not unpleasant and the smell fades after a short time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended brand of organic rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and this seems like a high quality brand.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>For note, I have really sensitive, crappy skin which is generally very red, easily irritated, and acne prone (at 29 years old).  </li>
            <li>Natural and pure is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Not only is our Rosehip oil USDA Certified organic, we also have ECO Certification by Ecocert which means it is made with even higher standards than most other Rosehip</li>
            <li>the skin absorbs it very quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face look &#x27;oily&#x27; like some other oils i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin silky soft, and I can actually see it working on my fine lines so far (just started using it)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that due to Rosehip&#x27;s high concentration of Vit A that it can help with reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>So now we are figuring out just how much neem my daughter can handle because she is so sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff in combination with the Triple Action Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Feels really natural, smells terrifyc, but really works</li>
            <li>I also no longer have any razor burn on my thighs which I normally would get from time to time...</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much better even in just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>This one organic pure product replaces several other chemical laden products and does a better job.  </li>
            <li>It was a serious improvement and I am so glad I decided to try it!</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and Rosacea, not really sure if it helps with the Rosacea but moisturizes my face amazingly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve personally struggled with dry fingernails that get many hangnails.</li>
            <li>I started using it right away, and while it does smell a little earthy, the smell goes away quickly even when I rub it on my face.</li>
            <li>Right now i can only review about the shipping, the package and the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIgh quality organic rosehip oil has been in my sights since I neared forty and started becoming aware of my slowly aging skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little under a week and the changes I see in my skin, in that short period of time, is amazing.</li>
            <li>The reason neem works so well is because it kills off the Demodex mites that live on our skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the bigger bottle, but while other versions made the oil feel like a serum, this particular brand made the oil feel like it was just sitting on my skin and never sinking in.</li>
            <li>both old and new scars almost disappear in about a month!</li>
            <li>It has helped tremendously to heal my daughter&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin that causes me to break out in hives or turn red with nearly every product on the market.  </li>
            <li>Just a few days of using this rose hip oil and my itchy red eczema is gone!</li>
            <li>Supposedly this should dissipate within a few minutes of putting it on, but I was still catching a whiff of it hours later.  </li>
            <li>A few drops leaves my face deeply moisturized with a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I use half/half of rosehip oil and Argan oil with a few drops of lavender essential oil to create my own nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Using rosehip oil made the skin less sensitive and made it look slightly better, although so far (after 2 weeks of use)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fresh rosehip oil has a nice earthy and herbaceous smell.&lt;br /&gt;It has a short shelf life and goes rancid in a few months after opening.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>Like the quality of the oil and the scent is not too strong (slightly nutty.)</li>
            <li>However, it keeps your hands feeling very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This has not caused me to break out at all, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>It has made my skin very soft and my skin is beginning to heal.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin gets red and hot and I get hives.</li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s helping my dark spots and making my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I have noticed the fine lines less and skin texture seems to be improving.  </li>
            <li>This will be regular face lotion now since it goes on very well and does make me face greasy at all!</li>
            <li>This has helped to reduce the problem with my nails I completely recommend it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid to try something natural and good for your body!  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve noticed my old acne scars fading!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve noticed my old acne scars fading!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve noticed my old acne scars fading!</li>
            <li>Smells a bit fishy at first but goes away shortly after</li>
            <li>Wow, I am somewhat of a skeptic, but after trying this oil I know BELIEVE!</li>
            <li>, I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I also havew been using it on my face and it clears my acne and leaves my face soft as baby skin!</li>
            <li>First time purchase and will be buying it on the regular from now on.</li>
            <li>and I am a 25yr old African American female with great skin but three dark spots on my cheek.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to find other uses for it.</li>
            <li>but in my experience, I definitely noticed a softness and smoothness with the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>I only need to use a little bit to cover my entire face, so I expect the bottle to last me quite a while, which is great.</li>
            <li>In addition, the dropper dispenser makes it so, so easy to apply with absolutely no waste or mess.</li>
            <li>my husband had patches of eczema for years on the back of both hands his skin cracks on his knuckles and has spots of bleeding and he gets in pain to from this medical issue he used lotions, hydrocortisone cream, special soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always had very clear skin, but after using this product my forehead and chin would break out and take forever to clear up.  </li>
            <li>The Rosehip oil blends in easily and leaves no oily residue after allowing a few minutes for it to soak in completely.</li>
            <li>Together with the vitamin c serum, I have found that my pores are a lot smaller, I break out less, and my skin just looks so alive and healthy.</li>
            <li>ONLY ONE INGREDIENT: 100% Pure USDA &amp; ECO Certified Organic Rosehip Seed Oil - No Fillers.</li>
            <li>I recently switch from Lifeflo&#x27;s rosehip to Viola&#x27;s because this one is actually pure with zero additives.</li>
            <li>This combination has been working great on my skin for the past week or so, and I plan to experiment on the quantity of oils and combination with other essential oils.</li>
            <li>A couple of drops goes a long way and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is great for acne, dark circles under my eyes, clearing up my scars, reducing my facial greasiness, eczema, dry skin, brittle nails, fixing my dry and damage hair.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other rosehip seed oil, and while there is definitely an earthy scent to it, it has never smelled so strongly of fish.  </li>
            <li>and what&#x27;s left is hardly noticeable honestly please give this product a try you&#x27;ll never regret it</li>
            <li>My skin feels moisturized and clear.</li>
            <li>My coworker suggested I order this product after I commented on how clear her skin looked.</li>
            <li>Skin clear now.</li>
            <li>As soon as I apply it, my skin feels soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I wake up in the mornings with soft skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I use it along with a Retinol cream and it keeps my skin soft and blemish-less.</li>
            <li>I ordered twice directly from Patagonia their organic rosehip oil (Aceite De Rosa Mosqueta.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft without being greasy</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after using one time.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Wonderful...my face is so soft and I have been getting complements on how my skin is glowing..</li>
            <li>My face cleared up completely in month 3.</li>
            <li>I have been using the organic rosehip oil for about 2 weeks, along with the triple action vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>After reading VoilaVe&#x27;s skin care recommendations of avoiding chemicals commonly in the ingredients of many skin care products &amp; make-up, I will plan to continue using products like theirs.</li>
            <li>I combine the rosehip oil with the Voilave Triple Action Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>Definitely follow with a moisturizer, as this was very drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an old scar, so I don&#x27;t expect it to disappear, but I like the</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s completely natural.</li>
            <li>It healed as much as I believe it was going to and had settled on a purplish red color.  </li>
            <li>I like the way the oil makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>but I CAN claim that this oil makes my skin as soft as a child&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t get over how soft my 42 year old face feels- with zero</li>
            <li>When I got it, the oil was an orangish color and had a natural smell to it.</li>
            <li>So far I have used twice a day...</li>
            <li>And another thing I just discovered was that this helped an itchy rash that I developed overnight on my arm --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 years old and for years I had been battling my oily/acne prone skin</li>
            <li>This oil doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, helps with my natural oil production of my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 years old and for years I had been battling my oily/acne prone skin</li>
            <li>This oil doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, helps with my natural oil production of my skin</li>
            <li>This oil doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, helps with my natural oil production of my skin</li>
            <li>It is very nourishing to skin and definitely helps combat the dryness and uneveness.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and Rosacea</li>
            <li>You only need a couple of drops for your skin and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It does not clog my pores or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this this to try to fade some very visible scars on my hands left from a dermatologist treatment.  </li>
            <li>I can truly say my acne scars are almost completely gone</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin but still want something to diminish age spots or scaring</li>
            <li>It does however make my skin soft.</li>
            <li>As far as the product go, I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I would say I need to use at least two more bottles before I would see results.</li>
            <li>I am not expecting overnight results, that is why I say I would use at least two more bottles of this.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin gets dewy and soft after each application.  </li>
            <li>Your skin will feel so soft and it transforms your skin.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne and have scars.</li>
            <li>as far as i can determine the product works as designed and described.  </li>
            <li>So far its working well for me.</li>
            <li>I have only been using the oil for a few days, but so far I am enjoying the soft, yet non-oily feeling it leaves on my hands and face.</li>
            <li>I bought this looking for a natural alternative for my acne prone, scarred face.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft all day.</li>
            <li>It probably would have healed my skin completely</li>
            <li>Just 2 drops is enough for my hair because using too much would exaggerate the effect and would make my hair look unwashed and</li>
            <li>Remember this is natural, it has an earthy smell but it goes away</li>
            <li>Works really well and no lasting oiliness.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how soft it has made my skin and how hydrated it is.</li>
            <li>Probably the most noticeable skin changes I&#x27;ve ever noticed from a product before, at least on this time scale.  </li>
            <li>I have even taken a few drops of this and run thru my hair for a silky smooth look.  </li>
            <li>and he managed to resolve it in two days using the product, and today his skin is really almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my overly sensitive acne prone skin breakout</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used about a quarter of the bottle so far, using 5 drops/night all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for natural skin care products since I gave up the &amp;#34;chemical laden&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was the smell.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot for it to go far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled for years with extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s used as a part of my natural beauty routine.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy at all and smooths on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft and supple</li>
            <li>She only use the concentrate on her wrinkles and absolutely loves this.  </li>
            <li>However, so far, I&#x27;d say that I like it.</li>
            <li>Their oil smelled like vegetable oil and was more thick while Viola&#x27;s has an earthy scent and is thinner.</li>
            <li>Due to the dryness, I noticed fine lines around my eyes starting to form.</li>
            <li>Due to the dryness, I noticed fine lines around my eyes starting to form.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands and this is my first time using this particular brand</li>
            <li>Works better than other products I&#x27;ve used that were much much more expensive.</li>
            <li>I keep the original bottle itself in the fridge for prolonged freshness and shelf life, and only use enough of it in a separate cobalt blue dropper bottle with my mix of added oils to keep on hand in my bedroom for use.</li>
            <li>Now after four months,  it is almost flake free and doesn&#x27;t hardly ever feel super dry.</li>
            <li>on this product and don&#x27;t forget a small amount goes a long way plus great to add to bath with other bath therapies items</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle now, since I really do notice that my skin is softer, less dry, and more youthful looking.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it beneficial to for us as consumers to know the benefits and uses of your quality products, but it is also a extremely important to understand why all those other products never worked, and the problems and/or side effects they cause.</li>
            <li>MANY USES: Used topically for wrinkles, scars, stretch marks, rashes, burns, acne scars, dry skin, dermatitis, age spots, brittle nails, psoriasis, eczema, hyper-pigmentation, radiation and sun damage, dry &amp; damaged hair, anti-inflammatory&lt;br</li>
            <li>for my hair i add about 3-5 drops to my leave-in conditioner and my curls are less frizzy without looking oily and super soft.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell and the smell does not last long.  </li>
            <li>I have even been mixing a very small amount in with my foundation and love the results.  </li>
            <li>its rich, earthy smell did take me a few days to get use to (which disappears after it soaks in, about 5 min.)</li>
            <li>: on my face, I use it in conjunction with the Triple Action Vitamin C Serum and Low &amp; High Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum from VoilaVe.</li>
            <li>I just turned 50 in December and have noticed the beginnings of fine lines, uneven texture, discoloration and even acne again!  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed that my skin tone seems more even since using this daily and that my monthly hormone related breakouts are less severe.</li>
            <li>This oil has a slight nut-like aroma which quickly fades</li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;srtesy of VoilaVe ..   </li>

            <li>The other problem is that rosehip oil should be dry, and absorb easily.  </li>
            <li>Due to the constant usage of acne medication and cleansers because of the mild adult acne I had been dealing with, my skin was always unbalance in terms of oil control.</li>
            <li>Due to the constant usage of acne medication and cleansers because of the mild adult acne I had been dealing with, my skin was always unbalance in terms of oil control.</li>
            <li>This oil worked wonder&#x27;s on my nails which are normally brittle and constantly peel and break.</li>
            <li>Granted, I have only been using this product for a few days , so I can&#x27;t claim any miracle reduction in fine lines or scars ( yet) ,</li>
            <li>It instantly calm down my itcyness and redness.</li>
            <li>and I could not find a pure oil, only one mixed with Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>The skin used to be incredibly dry, to the point where it would flake and crack in pain with blood coming from his cracks of hands , now the whole area is 90% back to normal.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily on my face and also on this rash on my hip (the doctor said I got the rash due to dry skin).</li>
            <li>It has a pretty nasty smell to it, but other than that its great at moisturizing and reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It actually works for the 2 problems for which I purchased this: a stubborn patch of psoriasis near my hairline, and old dark spots from ancient mosquito bites on my right shin.</li>
            <li>This product really helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This oil works very well mixed with coconut oil for overall body use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to protect my 60+ skin that so far has no noticeable wrinkling and use natural products as much as possible.</li>
            <li>She adds a few drops to her regular body moisturizer because it takes the itch away from her skin and makes it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>In fact, it soothes my skin while at the same time hydrating it and creating the perfect base for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>In fact, it soothes my skin while at the same time hydrating it and creating the perfect base for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>And the smell is not bad, it&#x27;s like raisins, dark chocolate, oats, and dirt mixed together</li>
            <li>Use for a facial moisturiser and my face is soft and glowing!</li>
            <li>I use this product first and then use the rest of my other products by Epionce and it works well.</li>
            <li>Other places sell organic for much higher.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little bit to moisturize the entire face and it absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li>We did the same thing again that night after his shower, and the next day, the scar was a light pink!!  </li>
            <li>the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using the Rosehip Oil since it works, it&#x27;s more natural and a bottle would last for a long time since I only need a few drops</li>
            <li>It definitely has a different but natural scent about it, probably not what most people are used to because all commercial beauty products contain added fragrances which really are not great for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I also use the oil straight from the bottle on the lower parts of my legs that tend to get very dry and scaly</li>
            <li>After using this oil for about a week, they became super strong and just started growing like crazy.</li>
            <li>My dark spots seem to have lightened a little bit, but I would need to continue using this product more to determine if it is truly making a difference.</li>
            <li>The oil works great, and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product to clear up some acne on my face I&#x27;ve been using it religiously, but I&#x27;ve yet to see it work.</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and have tried a lot of facial moisturizers.</li>
            <li>But so far the scars are still the same, need to use it longer&lt;</li>
            <li>Just be careful because my daughter used too much and caused a allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>Before, the derma-rolling marks would take about two days to heal completely and I would no longer see the red dots all over my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is on the sensitive inner part of his upper arm which is naturally lighter than the rest of his arm.  </li>
            <li>The color is a very muted pink now.  </li>
            <li>I regularly lighten my hair and spend quite a bit of money on all natural products to help keep it in condition.</li>
            <li>Only used it a couple times so far</li>
            <li>I just happened to discover I&#x27;m allergic apparently to this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used 4 different Rosehip Oil so far and this one had the strongest smell - which is like fish oil smell.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see if further extended use will make it completely disappear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural and likely won&#x27;t cause</li>
            <li>It has smoothed my complexion, somehow made some red stops disappear, and faded old acne scars.</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed (just a few minutes) and as I&#x27;ve said, the greasy feeling and scent fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s not dry or oil, just regular</li>
            <li>I just started using it from last week on my left side of the face since right side still has some active acne.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it for your hair again not to much , you can always use it on your skin in other problem areas</li>
            <li>For those unfamiliar with rosehip oil, they’re extracted from the seeds of a specific variety of roses, and they’re full of several fatty acids, vitamins E, C, and A.</li>
            <li>If you are not completely satisfied, simply contact us and we will give you a full refund, no questions asked.</li>
            <li>and i have no dry, flaky skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This item was on time, as described &amp; even came with a little info on how to use it which is something I needed being a first time user.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old and 4 1/2 months pregnant with our second baby, and my face was broken out worse than it ever has been, with new fine lines and spots from acne and age.</li>
            <li>I use Rosehip Oil from my local health food store and it is very moisturizing and works well to remove makeup and as a carrier oil for other products.  </li>
            <li>I have to also say that the people behind this product run their company with such utmost focus on customer service --- following up to ensure the customer is satisfied and</li>
            <li>It does have a slight odor to it but not near as strong as some of the other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li>For the first week, no positive results, the oil penetrated the skin, quickly and still felt dry and dull.</li>
            <li>Also the dark spots on my shin are DRAMATICALLY fading, with the additional happiness of no more summer ugly alligator skin :-)</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t greasy like other oil, soaked in quickly, and helped eliminate the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 and over the past few years realized it was time to treat the appearance of very fine lines, and especially prevent them for the future.  </li>
            <li>but now i have stretch marks pink ones so they are new  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry, acne prone, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for half a week, but every single time I use it (as a serum overnight), I wake up with noticeably less red, more radiant skin.  </li>
            <li>I have never seen such results before with other, well known natural products!!</li>
            <li>I mean super gross.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell that bad, very earthy smell, for sure not like roses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip oil has been a HUGE game changer.  </li>

            <li> I gave up my chemical laden eye cream as well; the rose hip oil is the most wonderful eye cream one could ever need.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a good organic Rosehip oil for the serum i make for under eyes and face and after reading a lot of reviews and comparing products, i decided on buying this one</li>
            <li> oh boy I loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing because I am a sun worshiper.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping for continued good results from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that this is the mark of a good rosehip oil, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I also learned that it is good for hair.</li>
            <li> I never had any acne problems as a teenager and had good skin.  </li>
            <li> And this company seems to offer excellent products as well as fantastic customer correspondence.</li>
            <li> I used for my face because is good for acne.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this company and their products.</li>
            <li> and I find it works really good in that regard.  </li>
            <li> the seller is good and the quality of the oil is good.</li>
            <li> But I kept using hoping that this has a good result on my skin</li>
            <li> and I can tell that the quality was good.  </li>
            <li> It is good that the company informed us there will be no rosy smell</li>
            <li> After two weeks of treatment, my skin gained a good amount of moisture.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> My face never looks that good since I was teenager.</li>
            <li> away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO delighted that the psoriasis no longer itches, the granular bumps have gone away and all I need to do is use a bit of concealer and there is ZERO evidence that there&#x27;s any issue there at all.</li>
            <li> Enjoy, and good luck!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any good result</li>
            <li> Good product, but not for me.</li>

            <li> I was using another brand of rose hip oil until it ran out -</li>
            <li> This was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> and thats what you want in a rose hip oil</li>
            <li> but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> It comes with a nice dropper</li>
            <li> The seller has stated that rose petals give the rose smell and the hips do not have a rose smell.  </li>

            <li> expressed are my own.</li>

            <li> and it’s been great as a moisturizer, keeping my skin nice and smooth despite the winter dryness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is an excellent quality bottle of rosehip oil at a reasonable price (for the 4oz size anyways).</li>

            <li> I love this rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> Plus given it&#x27;s undiluted purity this stuff is potent.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> With continued use my skin looks better and better.</li>
            <li> the customer service was top notch.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> As if you couldn&#x27;t tell I would highly recommend this rosehip oil and this company for their quality product and exceptional customer care!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> The redness/purpleness of the marks is lightening up and becoming more uniform with the surrounding healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> cuz my skin is more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Overall excellent product that I will recommend anyone...excellent for dry skin like elbows, feet, etc</li>
            <li> I received this oil exceptionally fast 4 days before scheduled delivery date and that&#x27;s just amazing!</li>
            <li> I wasnt sure because of how great the price was , but man was I surprised!</li>
            <li> it great to use for so many things and is a more natural approach to skin and nail care.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, not bad or even earthy like some reviews say.</li>
            <li> It was pretty noticeable and had been there for a good 3 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> Amazon are pretty good</li>
            <li> I guess it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about the product !  </li>
            <li> much worth it!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this!  </li>
            <li> On drier days, I mix 2 parts serum and 1 part oil to help it absorb more easily.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use very many products without having some kind of reaction.</li>
            <li> Though I do not have many wrinkles, I do feel like this organic oil helps me fight the fine lines that come with turning 40 and aging.</li>
            <li> but I was looking for a superior brand that was pure and organic.</li>
            <li> But I have experienced Moisturized, Hydrated Skin that is soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> but so far happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great results thus far.</li>
            <li> so the rosehip wouldn’t lose any of its health benefits, and so far I have been extremely happy VoilaVe</li>
            <li> My skin has become so smooth and more even textured.  </li>
            <li> The Rosehip Oil is working great so far.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re great with super packaging and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It was good, didn&#x27;t seem to be as good of quality as other rosehip oils I&#x27;ve used, but seemed ok</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this amazing oil anymore!</li>
            <li> Just by using it twice a day for about 2 weeks I have already noticed my acne scars fading significantly and my skin tone becoming more even.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is great, I apply it directly on my face and around my eyes, is very light, it absorbs quick and it does not leave your face shiny.</li>
            <li> sometimes I use H2O+ for extra moisture but this oil is a good substitute for some of the items I used before and saves me a lot of money!</li>
            <li> It has a more rich feel about it.  </li>
            <li> it soaks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very mild.</li>
            <li> It fades very quickly and is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I use this to moisturize at night, absorbs very quickly without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> ( pores clog easily even with &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; products).</li>
            <li> ( pores clog easily even with &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; products).</li>
            <li> It also absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.  </li>
            <li> Using it on my hands and noticing the fine are really becoming smoother or should I say they are gradually disappearing.   </li>
            <li> And also love how personal this company is with dealing with me, adds a great touch to the product</li>
            <li> Shipped by company very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Eyedropper dispenser makes it easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> For one thing, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face which is easy to do.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend buying all three products for the highest benefit.</li>
            <li> This product smells strongly of fish oil.  </li>
            <li> does have a diff odor to it, but not too strong....</li>
            <li> Very light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase and the fast shipping.</li>

            <li> So far it&#x27;s wonderful and i highly recommend it for nightly use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice and reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li> Acne, fine lines</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if it helps with my fine lines</li>
            <li> The rash is now gone, and I continue to use the rosehip oil on the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This is also a fine oil to use for the oil cleansing method, which  has done wonders for my cystic acne.</li>
            <li> you wil lbe fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Rosehip Oil pleasantly light and extremely easy to distribute.</li>
            <li> This literally made my fine lines disappear.  </li>
            <li> It is light and does not have strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> The order arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil that I find works best on my scars and dark spots.</li>
            <li> The pump makes it so much easier, plus you will love it any way, and use it up!</li>
            <li> So far, I am enjoying the product - it is incredibly moisturizing and leaves my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> The search is over, this &amp;#34;Organic VoilaVe Rosehip Oil&amp;#34; is just what I have been searching for and it is pure with no additives or preservatives which makes me love it even more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Between the unbeatable price, awesome customer service, and instant benefits from using the product, this has certainly become a staple in my ever-changing beauty routine.</li>
            <li> ★ BEWARE of huge economy size Rosehip oils.</li>
            <li> but I see a difference with my nails and cuticles and that is huge in my book.  </li>
            <li> I applied a couple of drops to my fingertips and pat lightly all over my face.</li>
            <li> If you can handle a lot of neem,  Wondercide&#x27;s renovate soap bar was amazing on her acne rosacea but was too much neem for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Works great as a facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Great customer service and will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if there are enough words to describe how great this product is and what it has done for our family.  </li>
            <li> I almost prefer it over my argan oil because I&#x27;ve seen such great results even overnight.</li>
            <li> Saw amazing results really fast.</li>
            <li> My skin was suffering of blotchy redness and it&#x27;s now smooth and seems to be one color.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and my skin feels so soft and bright in the morning.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a great product, but your service as a vendor is excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> seller of this product has a great response and personally contacted me with e-mail - not</li>
            <li> They responded to my emails and I even get free samples.</li>
            <li> It is doing a great job moisturizing and helping to minimize facial lines.</li>
            <li> Fantastic oil.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic recommendation.  </li>
            <li> have also used it all over my body as a lotion and it makes my skin glowing and smooth.</li>
            <li> A great extra benefit is that I got an email immediately from the company thanking me for purchasing it and to call if I had any questions about the product.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and does not feel oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Rosehip Oil might sound like it smells nice because of the word ROSE, but it actually smells nutty/fishy.</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Was looking forward to useing  this oil and defenetly will buy again thank you amozan for making this available.</li>
            <li> (the smell thing really threw me off to be honest) and I&#x27;m using it on my stretch marks for now hoping it works.</li>
            <li> it feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li> seller cares that you got the product, that you&#x27;re happy with it, and that you know of the various ways to use it.</li>
            <li> the smell is quite important.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this all natural product and encourage you to get it for yourself and a friend...</li>
            <li> /&gt;To protect the oil from light, it is bottled in amber glass, and the cap has a glass dropper for ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My cuticles and nails are smooth and moisturized as well.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face moisturized, smooth, and brighter, and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> After applying it once a day for two weeks, my face does seem more calm.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> This one isn’t much different from the rest, but that should be a good thing, as most of the rosehip oil</li>
            <li> so far so good....</li>
            <li> I started using it as my main face moisturizer, and my skin hasn’t looked better!</li>
            <li> , I know from experience this means it is very fresh.</li>
            <li> I had found what I thought was a wonderful &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; routine but it involved multiple high priced products.  </li>
            <li> It is as advertised, light, absorbs easily, smell is earthy but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> What I love about it--besides the incredible benefits--is that it absorbs beautifully into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave that heavy oily feeling like some other oils.</li>
            <li> I will most certainly reorder!</li>
            <li> You can be sure it is pure here!</li>
            <li> After seeing a recommendation for rose hip oil on Dr. Oz, I went to Amazon and purchased this particular product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff, it&#x27;s simply amazing.</li>
            <li> In this You Tube Vide Rose Hip Oil was highly recommended after the treatment to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge advocate in pure &amp; natural products and have taken the time to look into Rosehip oil and this oil by VoilaVe, and its all great.</li>
            <li> which is good, it absorbs quickly, and does leave my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It feels so light going on and absorbs quickly, making my skin feel so smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> are nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li> Seems to be working on my fine lines already, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling oily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have found this Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> Love the rosehip oil;-)</li>
            <li> originally i gave it four stars because i thought it gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> but if you are already familiar with Rosehip oil</li>
            <li> Originally I had intended to use it on my husband to see if it would work on his psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much!</li>
            <li> I got it originally because I read that it helps repair sun damage and also promotes collagen production.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very important naturally scented too : )&lt;</li>
            <li> I love this Rose hip oil for many things its great to put on discolorations when you want to use something more natural and non irritating to skin.</li>
            <li> Great product... as a person w/very dry, sensitive skin who is also a sufferer of Eczema; I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I really honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect as this is a new path for me.  </li>
            <li> Worked great on dry skin on my face &amp; legs.  </li>
            <li> The instruction booklet that was available with the purchase provided important and enlightening skincare information.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchases rose hip oil online, but I feel as though I was ripped off and returned the product after the first use.  </li>
            <li> It is a light oil that absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s been amazing helping some of my psoriasis areas and a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Like other buyers said, it smells like fish oil, but it makes you beautiful</li>
            <li> I had read great reviews on Rose Hip Oil and was anxious to purchase and try it!</li>
            <li> Great remedy for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is 100% pure &amp; ECO Certified Organic.  </li>
            <li> The pure rosehip oil from ViolaVe is much better.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is awesome, it keeps my redness, pimples and dry skin completely away!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this! :)</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful dark orange</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I mix it with Helichrysum oil and sweet almond oil to treat scars~</li>
            <li> I mix it with a bit almond oil and put it on my freshly washed face at night, my skin is smooth and glowing,</li>
            <li> far I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy this oil in the bath for all over body care, and have used it with success on my nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it so far - using it for everything from the patch of eczema on my elbow to my toddlers knee scars from falling.</li>
            <li> and I think that is why I love it so much.</li>
            <li> love it and highly recommend giving it a try!</li>
            <li> The oil goes on smoothly, however, the smell and golden color are off putting.  </li>
            <li> It is cold-pressed from the fruit or hip of the wild climbing dog rose, also known scientifically as Rosa canina.  </li>
            <li> It was a nice addition when taking a bath, makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> but the results were good enough.  </li>
            <li> Has a woody smell but not bad or offensive.</li>
            <li> Even though it is an oil, it is light in texture and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, love the oil; will order when it runs out (eventually).</li>
            <li> And being pregnant, wouldn&#x27;t try anything full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I tend to have super dry skin, and the moisturizing benefits of this rosehip oil is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> Plus, it has imparted a more even rosy tone which de-accentuates the patches of redness and even the appearance of the fine blood vessels near the skin surface around nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I would try the renovate bar first and do a test spot first to make sure you don&#x27;t have a reaction.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and</li>
            <li> and it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> and the smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Well, after trying my first bottle of this oil, the verdict is in, and I am very pleased with this product and how soft my skin feels after use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell because it goes away quickly</li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy film, it penetrates quickly leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li> It smells like oil, and it goes away quick and the skin appretiated it.</li>
            <li> I realize what works for one person may not necessarily  work the same on someone else, just saying this stuff is AWESOME,</li>
            <li> My skin absorbs it quickly although I don&#x27;t feel like it &amp;#34;totally&amp;#34; moisturizes my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> It was gone as quickly as the oil itself seeps in.</li>
            <li> Not too many companies go that extra step to make sure 1 the product was received and 2 ensure that you like the product.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great product that she highly recommends!</li>
            <li> I love the high quality and intend to purchase it again</li>
            <li> High quality and a lovely dropper too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About how good it is or how well it works i cant say anything right now  because i only have been using it for 3 days</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil worked best when I combined it with other oils for my sensitive face</li>
            <li> Not using it that long to know if it&#x27;s good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I always had the impression since I was break out prone and my pores clog very easily, that I should always avoid any products with oil and use only oil free</li>
            <li> i got an invitation to contact the seller if i had any questions, and a boost of confidence that i would not only be happy with the product, but with vendor support.&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed really quickly leaving the skin</li>
            <li> applied to the skin, it is quickly and fully absorbed and doesn’t leave any oily feeling or sheen.  </li>
            <li> Leaves fact very soft and has softened lines and wrinkles,  I use this mostly at night, but have also used in am .  </li>
            <li> It made my skin very soft but make sure your hair is off your face as it did make my bangs greasy.</li>
            <li> The pure rosehip oil is a great single ingredient option</li>
            <li> Stellar customer service!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely amazed by this oil!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very moisturizing, but it made me breakout!!</li>
            <li> This makes it  a pleasure to use on the skin and cuticles and it gives excellent protection against dry skin, especially when applied after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never in my life did I think I could get soft , smooth skin so easily.  </li>
            <li> If you’ve never used Rosehip oil before, I would definitely recommend it, as it does do great things for the skin (sometimes unexpected!).</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and was hoping for a good quality oil.</li>

            <li> I use a few drops alone or with a drop of carrot seed oil before my moisturizer (Christina Moss Naturals which is also really great).</li>
            <li> It actually settles in the skin quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> and I love how natural it is</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels and dryness is no longer an issue.  </li>
            <li> Out of all three, rosehip felt the most luxurious and soft.</li>
            <li> I also love that is all natural and organic.</li>
            <li> (they WILL NOT make your face more oily) and they make my combination skin soft and luminous.</li>
            <li> I can truly say that it heals blemishes and fresh acne issues nearly overnight, at most 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I had read many times that rosehip oil was a natural healer oil.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every dollar.  </li>
            <li> As I used this fresh out of the shower, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t take alot</li>
            <li> and I am enjoying it so far.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so worth it</li>
            <li> At 34, I still suffer from the occasional hormonal breakout, and this oil helps to heal the skin but most importantly for me, fade the post pimple marks that before, stayed for weeks after a breakout.</li>
            <li> Now after this deep pore cleansing Rose hip oil is a moisturizer, a moisturizer that will not clog your pores.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to incorporate more natural and organic products into my skincare routine.  </li>
            <li> I tried all the sensitive skin/ oil-free versions of top brand names as well as drugstore alternatives but nothing helped.</li>

            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> then it just gets absorbed</li>
            <li> Overall, I am thrilled to add this product to my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I run out SO fast because I love it so much</li>
            <li> but I think it worth it.  </li>
            <li> and well worth it for the benefits.</li>
            <li> Knowing that oil is often the cause of my acne, I was hesitant to put even more oil on my already sensitive</li>
            <li> My skin is drinking it up and feels soft, dewy and better than it did when I was in my twenties.  </li>
            <li> Kinda like the smell of freshly cut grass, but not as offensive.</li>
            <li> I use it under moisturizer but can definitely do the trick on its own.</li>
            <li> My shins are slender and it&#x27;s nice to look down and see lovely, youthful pretty skin.</li>
            <li> I love that it is 100% organic because I can trust that there is no hidden chemicals that I may be applying on my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a funky smell when it first goes on, but that disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was quick, and you get exactly what is in the picture/</li>
            <li> The last bottle had a strong smell like fish oil smell but this time it didn&#x27;t have the strong smell.</li>
            <li> but if you really don&#x27;t like it, then just add a few drops of your favorite skin loving essential oils such as rose, lavender, helichrysum, neroli and you will have a really amazing anti-aging skin product.  </li>
            <li> OMG very satisfied, noticed how extra soft, smooth my face is.  </li>
            <li> and you could see the improvements the dark spot on her face are fading very good product so far</li>
            <li> right when I got it.</li>
            <li> Goes right into the skin and no issues with coming off on pillows.</li>
            <li> You can feel it softening up your skin right there in the bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a smell and absorbs right away.</li>
            <li> All right got to say this stuff works</li>
            <li> I was interested in finding more natural methods to taking care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am particular about what I put on my skin and the fact that it&#x27;s organic is important to me.</li>
            <li> I honesty do not believe its true 100% pure.</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t like the smell, because it was a very very strong smell, the last time i used</li>
            <li> VoilaVe also has fantastic customer service - would highly recommend ordering from them.</li>
            <li> It may be a good oil, but it&#x27;s not right for my skin.</li>
            <li> a try its very pure</li>
            <li> The oil arrived very quick, was packaged very well and the oil smelled fresh and high quality.</li>
            <li> I saw a huge improvement in my developing fine lines &amp; wrinkles, hydration, and overall coloring/glow in just a week!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference with my fine lines and overall appearance.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s a pure and natural oil and that it&#x27;s organic and processed correctly (which makes all the difference).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural oils and rose hip is not the most pungent of scents.</li>
            <li> wear it after a hot shower, right before going to bed</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the ViolaVe vitamin C serum, and really loved it and decided to purchase the Rosehip oil and the hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> ( i don&#x27;t look like a grease ball in the morning anymore), makes my skin so soft and ready for makeup and on top of that</li>

            <li> ( i don&#x27;t look like a grease ball in the morning anymore), makes my skin so soft and ready for makeup and on top of that</li>
            <li> I also started to use it as a spot treatment on red marks leftover from acne (not indented scarring - just red marks) because I have heard about the great regenerating properties of rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far from greasy and is easily absorbent.</li>
            <li> Like this very much.  </li>
            <li> Second, this oil is very smooth and versatile.</li>
            <li> I forgot to mention that shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery</li>
            <li> That being said, no difference as far as hyper pigmentation, fine lines, or any thing else</li>
            <li> I use with a little avocado oil which is high in vitamin E and great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I started using this product only a few days ago, so can not attest to its long-term effects, but it immediately made my fine lines look softer and my face feels great.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend an organic natural product like this -- way better than anything at Origins or</li>
            <li> As far as the brand, color and texture it is accurately described.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about using an oil on my skin because I suspected more clogged pores or breakouts, or overall oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of it, and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I will definately be purchasing more of this in the future!!</li>
            <li> Wondercide Natural Products has fantastic neem products for humans and your pets.  </li>
            <li> (Read about neem allergic reactions online first.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure if was the oil&#x27;s work or not, but I&#x27;m definitely purchasing another bottle.</li>
            <li> After applying to my face the first day I could smell the fishy, oily smell all day long...and don&#x27;t use it in your hair..</li>
            <li> I use many essential oils</li>
            <li> I am interested in seeing what will happen with continued use of these two products.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> love using essential oils on my face</li>
            <li> My dark spots are lighten up and my skin tone seems to look more smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using Rosehip oil</li>
            <li> She personally emails you to make sure you got the item and then follows up to see if you like it.</li>
            <li> There are SO many ways that I have seen improvements in my skin in a very short amount of time!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the first week</li>
            <li> I use it on my face at night(nothing else) and even after sleeping in an air conditioned room all night my skin still feels soft, dewy and smooth in the morning.</li>
            <li> As for the overall feel on my skin...I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> First off, I did not smell anything from this oil as some reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> The bottle is sure to last for a while</li>
            <li> At first I thought this oil did not absorb well.  </li>
            <li> After the first night I woke up with glowing skin.</li>
            <li> so much so that the burn didn&#x27;t even hurt after one day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using my acne system but instead of moisturizers, I&#x27;ll apply rosehip oil to my face after as my nightly moisturizer and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll apply rosehip oil to my face after as my nightly moisturizer and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and I am extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out as most commercial moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> First time trying Rosehip Oil after being recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> It is light and makes my skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> I massage it onto my skin as the last step of my skin care regime as it is more occlusive.</li>
            <li> This product is very brightening, and nurishing!</li>
            <li> I looked so healthy after the next morning!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the rosehip oil it leaves my skin soft and feels plump.</li>
            <li> You probably could’ve looked all of that up, so the rest of this review is going to focus more on this specific VoilaVe Rosehip Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really recommend!</li>
            <li> Always checking up to see how you are liking the product.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> Of course, the skin needs inside and outside care to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li> I would say that my face does feel a lot smoother since the first couple of usages.</li>
            <li> I have been blessed with soft skin, but after two weeks my husband and my mother commented on the silky smooth feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> When I run out, I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face before bed and in the morning my face is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been slathering this rose hip oil on my face and neck morning and evening with ABSOLUTELY NO BREAKOUTS;  </li>
            <li> My face is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have been aware of Rosehip oil years</li>
            <li> , I will recommend it to my daughter and my mother and at this point believe I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> and i seen a difference the first use.</li>
            <li> The first one was from another company; however, I can feel the difference in quality of this brand.  </li>
            <li> Finally I decided to put more on my face (6 drops).</li>
            <li> At first I thought it might be a coincidence, but then I started noticing a difference myself.</li>
            <li> My skin looks a bit plumper and more dewy, especially since I&#x27;ve started using it in the morning too (under my moisturizer).</li>
            <li> This thinness put me off at first, but then I realized how much quicker it absorbed into my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it didn&#x27;t really take care of the bumps on my skin which I was really hoping it would.</li>
            <li> ;) .</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> , I noticed it the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on any dry skin and keeps my healthy skin absolutely glowing!!  </li>
            <li> VoilaVe is the real deal, organic, environmentally friendly, and extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> As for its effectiveness in combating wrinkles and fine lines, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to honestly say it does</li>
            <li> This oil really softened my rough, dry gardener&#x27;s hands - I highly recommend this for anyone with work-roughened hands - it&#x27;s THE BEST!!!!</li>
            <li> well i used to use Rose hip oil from other brand</li>
            <li> I’ve tried several brands of Rosehip oil, and quality wise, they’re pretty similar.</li>
            <li> It has a natural nutty scent and a rich amber color.</li>
            <li> am writing this review now because I am getting ready to order my second bottle, I love it that much!</li>
            <li> My face cleared up quickly after using it for few days, I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love it, and feel great using something without all those crazy additives.</li>
            <li> I used this same routine for a couple of years not really feeling like I saw great results..</li>
            <li> There are many so-called natural offers.  </li>
            <li> I will try everything to fight it, and this light pure oil is a natural and healthy way to moisturize my dry skin, nails and hair.</li>
            <li> You should absolutely try it, especially if your fine lines and blemishes are fresh.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel super soft!</li>
            <li> (Note:  Even though my experience was positive).  </li>
            <li> I had read of rosehip oil&#x27;s positive skin benefits and decided to try it out for myself.</li>
            <li> I was not required or compelled to write a positive review.</li>
            <li> am hoping to see more benefits after long term use of this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty much identical to the bottle of Nordic Naturals</li>
            <li> The first time I bought rosehip oil was from Whole Foods</li>
            <li> Works JUST AS GOOD if not better then</li>
            <li> This particular oil is fabulous and just makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Even fragrance free, dye free, super strength lotion doesn&#x27;t keep my skin moisturized past one or two handwashings.  </li>
            <li> Before application, the color is an unusual golden orange, from the high beta carotene</li>
            <li> It even gives my skin a healthy subtle glow, which tells me that it is actually doing something good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was dealing with excess oil production on my cheeks and forehead on top of having extremely dry patches on my chin, around my eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> It even gives my skin a healthy subtle glow, which tells me that it is actually doing something good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I was dealing with excess oil production on my cheeks and forehead on top of having extremely dry patches on my chin, around my eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to buy oils in dark glass with glass droppers because plastic adds cancer-causing toxins to oils, and UV light causes the oils to create free-radicals, which ages your skin.</li>
            <li> did a hair mask and after washing it out and letting it dry, my hair was more</li>
            <li> It takes care of dry skin better than any lotion out there.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to forget....and the benefits last ALL</li>
            <li> I also have mild rosacea and extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is 100% pure.  </li>
            <li> so I can smell which is pure and which is adulterated.  </li>
            <li> Pure quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  100% PURE AND MADE IN THE USA</li>
            <li> so I know it&#x27;s pure.</li>
            <li> i think using this oil may have triggered it but certainly did not cause it.</li>
            <li> I also have  a large patch of sunspots in both arms, after two weeks the spots are lighter and not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 100% Pure USDA &amp; ECO Certified Organic</li>
            <li> Make certain to keep in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> I chose VoilaVe Organics because it was certified 100% pure and ECO certified organic.</li>
            <li> i add 3 drops to my 100% pure and unrefined shea butter for my face.</li>
            <li> First off it smells vaguely like rose a touch like rose water, it is an orange color but goes on your face clear.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for certified organic rosehip oil and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but those wrinkles are started to show, this product is really a good item for daily use, and it really moisture my skin for a long time!</li>
            <li> I think it is helping with my fine lines, but maybe I will update later when I&#x27;ve used it for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was very quick, right on time as i expected.</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a smell when you first apply it to your face, but as you smooth it out, the slight odor quickly disappears.</li>
            <li> This seems to be little heavy for the very sensitive skin on my face, but it works beautifully as an eye serum for reducing (the beginnings of) fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Much better for you and worth the $$ that is way less than Strivectin SD or any other stretch mark/healer cream on the market that costs waaaaaay more and requires you to buy it over and over again for months.</li>
            <li> Then a few months ago I read a review on here that said rosehip oil and tea tree oil worked amazing together.</li>
            <li> I hear tamanu and sea buckthorn oil can help with skin rejuvenation and evening skin tone like rose hip oil though they&#x27;re more expensive.</li>
            <li> It is very absorbent and brightens my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think it would be rosey</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much as the odor has deterred me from using it.</li>
            <li> Very moisturized and not oily.</li>
            <li> Then I go back smooth it into my skin as you would when applying any lotion.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t so much at all for me</li>
            <li> Will absolutely keep using it as an alternative to chemical cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Excellent organic cold pressed rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> The combination of Rosehip oil and coconut oil has stopped the irritation and itch and my legs are much softer than before I started doing this.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> VoilaVe seems to be very committed to their products.</li>
            <li> It is a very concentrated oil</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very well moisturized with out leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li> If you are considering trying rosehip oil, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This really calms the redness on my face.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this product.</li>
            <li> I really need)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the fact the oil is certifed organic and cold pressed.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and I will be ordering this product again.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me, and I think it might have made me break out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> and lives in very humid Florida</li>
            <li> Very lubricating to skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel much smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> Has a very earthy smell to it.</li>
            <li> This does not depreciate the value of the product at all, and returning it was a breeze thanks to amazon.</li>
            <li> This does not break me out and helps so much.  </li>
            <li> The oil is very lightweight and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for</li>
            <li> really like the rosehip oil from VoilaVe.</li>
            <li> I highly highly reccomend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> really like it.</li>
            <li> The color was very orange</li>
            <li> My skin seams very radiant.</li>
            <li> I really like this Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> really i am amazed</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and healing.  </li>
            <li> I really do hope I didn&#x27;t get a rancid oil</li>
            <li> I guess because I didn&#x27;t really know what it was.</li>
            <li> and I definitely would feel comfortable ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> so I am very grateful.  </li>
            <li> Because who wants to go to bed with a fish?</li>
            <li> For my face this is light enough to use in the morning before applying foundation, once it has adsorbed.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> I cant really explain it.</li>
            <li> but I expect real intense results and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair silky soft</li>
            <li> I much prefer Medyskin for the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks Voilave...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that maybe I was expecting too much from this oil.</li>
            <li> I can use it on my curly hair as well as my face - anywhere that needs moisture really.  </li>
            <li> so I was very cautious before using it.</li>
            <li> Speaking of, the oil seeps in fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother (age 54) and she uses this for her whole body.</li>
            <li> I have recently switched to more natural skin care.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft, isn&#x27;t oily, and I think I look younger :)</li>
            <li> I had been trying different brands of rose  hip oil for about 6 months until I finally found this one.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it does minimize scarring, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I saw amazing results in less than 2 days no kidding!</li>
            <li> Usually, my skin reacts very quickly and I haven&#x27;t seen any breakouts after a few days of use which makes me really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing and economical little powerhouse of benefits towards a clear, vibrant complexion.</li>
            <li> and I mean NEVER put oil on my face, but I thought I would give it a try since hearing that it was so good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy at all, just the right consistency.</li>
            <li> The color is very rich and I can tell this is a very high quality rosehip oil than other brands.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines are less visible, my skin tone is more even and much brighter, and my pores seem to be smaller too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other VoilaVe products before though, and I&#x27;d love the try</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with rosehip oil, but I also bought argan oil and pumpkin seed oil (from different companies) at the same time to see which one is the most compatible with my skin.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews for different rosehip oils on Amazon, trying to decide which to try out first, I finally settled on this brand.</li>
            <li> One of the top deciding factors was the fact that it has the official USDA organic label on the bottle, whereas other oils I considered claimed to be organic in their title and/or description, but produced no proof of it anywhere on the packaging or bottle.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was really surprised!</li>
            <li> I recently ran out of it and have noticed a significant difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> This works much better than other items I have tried before.</li>
            <li> I feel like this one is more &amp;#34;condensed&amp;#34; than other products.  </li>
            <li> I have such dry damaged skin (from Arizona and love to be out without sunscreen!)  </li>
            <li> I was weary at first about putting an oil on my very combination, sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased to see that this oil, like jojoba, does not irritate my sensitive skin or clog my pores.  </li>
            <li> hip oil has a clean, verdant odor, similar to the leaves and stems of roses.  </li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s just the skin stuff, I also use it on my hair to keep the frizzys down and keep my ends nice and soft.</li>
            <li> So far under the eyes the circles seem to be faded but not by very much.</li>
            <li> After having success with the rose hip oil as a facial moisturizer, I decided to use it sparingly (a little goes along way) on the ends of my hair .</li>
            <li> For a while I have been hearing about the amazing benefits of rosehip oil, but hesitated to try it on my sensitive, acne prone, unpredictably reactive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been hearing about the amazing benefits of rosehip oil, but hesitated to try it on my sensitive, acne prone, unpredictably reactive skin.</li>
            <li> I believe using less is better than using too much.</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and slightly nutty, but fades quickly.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is it smells like cooking oil instead of having a light rose scent to it.</li>
            <li> People who have acne rosacea have more of these microscopic Demodex mites than the average person without acne rosacea.  </li>
            <li> My face breaks out frequently, when my friend first told me about rosehip oil</li>
            <li> This felt really soft and matte on my skin when first applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and so far I really like it!  </li>
            <li> Overall not bad, but not what I needed for my skin problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little surprised by the scent, which is not like rose flowers or rosehip fruits.  </li>
            <li> The results I have gotten from this already after 3-4 days of usage on my skin is already more even toned with less blemishes.</li>
            <li> and I like it even better than my previous brand of Argan...</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> Ever since starting rosehip oil into my twice daily skincare routine (am and pm), I am in love with my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it on a recent sunburn, and it&#x27;s healed up my skin really quickly -</li>
            <li> I must be allergic to something in this particular brand.  </li>
            <li> After one month of use, my pores are much smaller, the redness is much better, and I definitely have a glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best find for me since I use expensive stuffs such as Estee Lauder, Lancome,</li>
            <li> it penetrates quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to just float on the surface of the skin like some low quality oils.</li>
            <li> I only recently started using this but love the way it makes my skin feel -</li>
            <li> Wow, the next morning, my face was so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> It is now a regular, daily part of my regime me and I&#x27;ll be ordering more as needed from this Amazon seller......</li>
            <li> product goes on smoothly and does not cause a single adverse reaction to my skin.  </li>
            <li> It has an earthy smell but it is not unpleasant and the smell fades after a short time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended brand of organic rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and this seems like a high quality brand.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For note, I have really sensitive, crappy skin which is generally very red, easily irritated, and acne prone (at 29 years old).  </li>
            <li> Natural and pure is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Not only is our Rosehip oil USDA Certified organic, we also have ECO Certification by Ecocert which means it is made with even higher standards than most other Rosehip</li>
            <li> the skin absorbs it very quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face look &#x27;oily&#x27; like some other oils i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin silky soft, and I can actually see it working on my fine lines so far (just started using it)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that due to Rosehip&#x27;s high concentration of Vit A that it can help with reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> So now we are figuring out just how much neem my daughter can handle because she is so sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff in combination with the Triple Action Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Feels really natural, smells terrifyc, but really works</li>
            <li> I also no longer have any razor burn on my thighs which I normally would get from time to time...</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much better even in just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This one organic pure product replaces several other chemical laden products and does a better job.  </li>
            <li> It was a serious improvement and I am so glad I decided to try it!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and Rosacea, not really sure if it helps with the Rosacea but moisturizes my face amazingly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally struggled with dry fingernails that get many hangnails.</li>
            <li> I started using it right away, and while it does smell a little earthy, the smell goes away quickly even when I rub it on my face.</li>
            <li> Right now i can only review about the shipping, the package and the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIgh quality organic rosehip oil has been in my sights since I neared forty and started becoming aware of my slowly aging skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little under a week and the changes I see in my skin, in that short period of time, is amazing.</li>
            <li> The reason neem works so well is because it kills off the Demodex mites that live on our skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the bigger bottle, but while other versions made the oil feel like a serum, this particular brand made the oil feel like it was just sitting on my skin and never sinking in.</li>
            <li> both old and new scars almost disappear in about a month!</li>
            <li> It has helped tremendously to heal my daughter&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that causes me to break out in hives or turn red with nearly every product on the market.  </li>
            <li> Just a few days of using this rose hip oil and my itchy red eczema is gone!</li>
            <li> Supposedly this should dissipate within a few minutes of putting it on, but I was still catching a whiff of it hours later.  </li>
            <li> A few drops leaves my face deeply moisturized with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I use half/half of rosehip oil and Argan oil with a few drops of lavender essential oil to create my own nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Using rosehip oil made the skin less sensitive and made it look slightly better, although so far (after 2 weeks of use)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fresh rosehip oil has a nice earthy and herbaceous smell.&lt;br /&gt;It has a short shelf life and goes rancid in a few months after opening.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> Like the quality of the oil and the scent is not too strong (slightly nutty.)</li>
            <li> However, it keeps your hands feeling very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This has not caused me to break out at all, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> It has made my skin very soft and my skin is beginning to heal.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin gets red and hot and I get hives.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s helping my dark spots and making my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the fine lines less and skin texture seems to be improving.  </li>
            <li> This will be regular face lotion now since it goes on very well and does make me face greasy at all!</li>
            <li> This has helped to reduce the problem with my nails I completely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try something natural and good for your body!  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed my old acne scars fading!</li>

            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed my old acne scars fading!</li>
            <li> Smells a bit fishy at first but goes away shortly after</li>
            <li> Wow, I am somewhat of a skeptic, but after trying this oil I know BELIEVE!</li>
            <li> , I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I also havew been using it on my face and it clears my acne and leaves my face soft as baby skin!</li>
            <li> First time purchase and will be buying it on the regular from now on.</li>
            <li> and I am a 25yr old African American female with great skin but three dark spots on my cheek.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to find other uses for it.</li>
            <li> but in my experience, I definitely noticed a softness and smoothness with the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I only need to use a little bit to cover my entire face, so I expect the bottle to last me quite a while, which is great.</li>
            <li> In addition, the dropper dispenser makes it so, so easy to apply with absolutely no waste or mess.</li>
            <li> my husband had patches of eczema for years on the back of both hands his skin cracks on his knuckles and has spots of bleeding and he gets in pain to from this medical issue he used lotions, hydrocortisone cream, special soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always had very clear skin, but after using this product my forehead and chin would break out and take forever to clear up.  </li>
            <li> The Rosehip oil blends in easily and leaves no oily residue after allowing a few minutes for it to soak in completely.</li>
            <li> Together with the vitamin c serum, I have found that my pores are a lot smaller, I break out less, and my skin just looks so alive and healthy.</li>
            <li> ONLY ONE INGREDIENT: 100% Pure USDA &amp; ECO Certified Organic Rosehip Seed Oil - No Fillers.</li>
            <li> I recently switch from Lifeflo&#x27;s rosehip to Viola&#x27;s because this one is actually pure with zero additives.</li>
            <li> This combination has been working great on my skin for the past week or so, and I plan to experiment on the quantity of oils and combination with other essential oils.</li>
            <li> A couple of drops goes a long way and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is great for acne, dark circles under my eyes, clearing up my scars, reducing my facial greasiness, eczema, dry skin, brittle nails, fixing my dry and damage hair.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other rosehip seed oil, and while there is definitely an earthy scent to it, it has never smelled so strongly of fish.  </li>
            <li> and what&#x27;s left is hardly noticeable honestly please give this product a try you&#x27;ll never regret it</li>
            <li> My skin feels moisturized and clear.</li>
            <li> My coworker suggested I order this product after I commented on how clear her skin looked.</li>
            <li> Skin clear now.</li>
            <li> As soon as I apply it, my skin feels soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I wake up in the mornings with soft skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I use it along with a Retinol cream and it keeps my skin soft and blemish-less.</li>
            <li> I ordered twice directly from Patagonia their organic rosehip oil (Aceite De Rosa Mosqueta.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft without being greasy</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using one time.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wonderful...my face is so soft and I have been getting complements on how my skin is glowing..</li>
            <li> My face cleared up completely in month 3.</li>
            <li> I have been using the organic rosehip oil for about 2 weeks, along with the triple action vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> After reading VoilaVe&#x27;s skin care recommendations of avoiding chemicals commonly in the ingredients of many skin care products &amp; make-up, I will plan to continue using products like theirs.</li>
            <li> I combine the rosehip oil with the Voilave Triple Action Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> Definitely follow with a moisturizer, as this was very drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an old scar, so I don&#x27;t expect it to disappear, but I like the</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s completely natural.</li>
            <li> It healed as much as I believe it was going to and had settled on a purplish red color.  </li>
            <li> I like the way the oil makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> but I CAN claim that this oil makes my skin as soft as a child&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get over how soft my 42 year old face feels- with zero</li>
            <li> When I got it, the oil was an orangish color and had a natural smell to it.</li>
            <li> So far I have used twice a day...</li>
            <li> And another thing I just discovered was that this helped an itchy rash that I developed overnight on my arm --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 years old and for years I had been battling my oily/acne prone skin</li>
            <li> This oil doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, helps with my natural oil production of my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and for years I had been battling my oily/acne prone skin</li>
            <li> This oil doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, helps with my natural oil production of my skin</li>
            <li> This oil doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, helps with my natural oil production of my skin</li>
            <li> It is very nourishing to skin and definitely helps combat the dryness and uneveness.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and Rosacea</li>
            <li> You only need a couple of drops for your skin and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It does not clog my pores or irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this this to try to fade some very visible scars on my hands left from a dermatologist treatment.  </li>
            <li> I can truly say my acne scars are almost completely gone</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin but still want something to diminish age spots or scaring</li>
            <li> It does however make my skin soft.</li>
            <li> As far as the product go, I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I would say I need to use at least two more bottles before I would see results.</li>
            <li> I am not expecting overnight results, that is why I say I would use at least two more bottles of this.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin gets dewy and soft after each application.  </li>
            <li> Your skin will feel so soft and it transforms your skin.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne and have scars.</li>
            <li> as far as i can determine the product works as designed and described.  </li>
            <li> So far its working well for me.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the oil for a few days, but so far I am enjoying the soft, yet non-oily feeling it leaves on my hands and face.</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a natural alternative for my acne prone, scarred face.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft all day.</li>
            <li> It probably would have healed my skin completely</li>
            <li> Just 2 drops is enough for my hair because using too much would exaggerate the effect and would make my hair look unwashed and</li>
            <li> Remember this is natural, it has an earthy smell but it goes away</li>
            <li> Works really well and no lasting oiliness.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how soft it has made my skin and how hydrated it is.</li>
            <li> Probably the most noticeable skin changes I&#x27;ve ever noticed from a product before, at least on this time scale.  </li>
            <li> I have even taken a few drops of this and run thru my hair for a silky smooth look.  </li>
            <li> and he managed to resolve it in two days using the product, and today his skin is really almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my overly sensitive acne prone skin breakout</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about a quarter of the bottle so far, using 5 drops/night all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for natural skin care products since I gave up the &amp;#34;chemical laden&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was the smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot for it to go far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for years with extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s used as a part of my natural beauty routine.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy at all and smooths on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft and supple</li>
            <li> She only use the concentrate on her wrinkles and absolutely loves this.  </li>
            <li> However, so far, I&#x27;d say that I like it.</li>
            <li> Their oil smelled like vegetable oil and was more thick while Viola&#x27;s has an earthy scent and is thinner.</li>
            <li> Due to the dryness, I noticed fine lines around my eyes starting to form.</li>
            <li> Due to the dryness, I noticed fine lines around my eyes starting to form.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and this is my first time using this particular brand</li>
            <li> Works better than other products I&#x27;ve used that were much much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I keep the original bottle itself in the fridge for prolonged freshness and shelf life, and only use enough of it in a separate cobalt blue dropper bottle with my mix of added oils to keep on hand in my bedroom for use.</li>
            <li> Now after four months,  it is almost flake free and doesn&#x27;t hardly ever feel super dry.</li>
            <li> on this product and don&#x27;t forget a small amount goes a long way plus great to add to bath with other bath therapies items</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle now, since I really do notice that my skin is softer, less dry, and more youthful looking.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it beneficial to for us as consumers to know the benefits and uses of your quality products, but it is also a extremely important to understand why all those other products never worked, and the problems and/or side effects they cause.</li>
            <li> MANY USES: Used topically for wrinkles, scars, stretch marks, rashes, burns, acne scars, dry skin, dermatitis, age spots, brittle nails, psoriasis, eczema, hyper-pigmentation, radiation and sun damage, dry &amp; damaged hair, anti-inflammatory&lt;br</li>
            <li> for my hair i add about 3-5 drops to my leave-in conditioner and my curls are less frizzy without looking oily and super soft.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell and the smell does not last long.  </li>
            <li> I have even been mixing a very small amount in with my foundation and love the results.  </li>
            <li> its rich, earthy smell did take me a few days to get use to (which disappears after it soaks in, about 5 min.)</li>
            <li> : on my face, I use it in conjunction with the Triple Action Vitamin C Serum and Low &amp; High Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum from VoilaVe.</li>
            <li> I just turned 50 in December and have noticed the beginnings of fine lines, uneven texture, discoloration and even acne again!  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my skin tone seems more even since using this daily and that my monthly hormone related breakouts are less severe.</li>
            <li> This oil has a slight nut-like aroma which quickly fades</li>

            <li> The other problem is that rosehip oil should be dry, and absorb easily.  </li>
            <li> Due to the constant usage of acne medication and cleansers because of the mild adult acne I had been dealing with, my skin was always unbalance in terms of oil control.</li>
            <li> Due to the constant usage of acne medication and cleansers because of the mild adult acne I had been dealing with, my skin was always unbalance in terms of oil control.</li>
            <li> This oil worked wonder&#x27;s on my nails which are normally brittle and constantly peel and break.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have only been using this product for a few days , so I can&#x27;t claim any miracle reduction in fine lines or scars ( yet) ,</li>
            <li> It instantly calm down my itcyness and redness.</li>
            <li> and I could not find a pure oil, only one mixed with Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> The skin used to be incredibly dry, to the point where it would flake and crack in pain with blood coming from his cracks of hands , now the whole area is 90% back to normal.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily on my face and also on this rash on my hip (the doctor said I got the rash due to dry skin).</li>
            <li> It has a pretty nasty smell to it, but other than that its great at moisturizing and reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It actually works for the 2 problems for which I purchased this: a stubborn patch of psoriasis near my hairline, and old dark spots from ancient mosquito bites on my right shin.</li>
            <li> This product really helped my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This oil works very well mixed with coconut oil for overall body use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to protect my 60+ skin that so far has no noticeable wrinkling and use natural products as much as possible.</li>
            <li> She adds a few drops to her regular body moisturizer because it takes the itch away from her skin and makes it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> In fact, it soothes my skin while at the same time hydrating it and creating the perfect base for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> In fact, it soothes my skin while at the same time hydrating it and creating the perfect base for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> And the smell is not bad, it&#x27;s like raisins, dark chocolate, oats, and dirt mixed together</li>
            <li> Use for a facial moisturiser and my face is soft and glowing!</li>
            <li> I use this product first and then use the rest of my other products by Epionce and it works well.</li>
            <li> Other places sell organic for much higher.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit to moisturize the entire face and it absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li> We did the same thing again that night after his shower, and the next day, the scar was a light pink!!  </li>
            <li> the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using the Rosehip Oil since it works, it&#x27;s more natural and a bottle would last for a long time since I only need a few drops</li>
            <li> It definitely has a different but natural scent about it, probably not what most people are used to because all commercial beauty products contain added fragrances which really are not great for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I also use the oil straight from the bottle on the lower parts of my legs that tend to get very dry and scaly</li>
            <li> After using this oil for about a week, they became super strong and just started growing like crazy.</li>
            <li> My dark spots seem to have lightened a little bit, but I would need to continue using this product more to determine if it is truly making a difference.</li>
            <li> The oil works great, and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to clear up some acne on my face I&#x27;ve been using it religiously, but I&#x27;ve yet to see it work.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and have tried a lot of facial moisturizers.</li>
            <li> But so far the scars are still the same, need to use it longer&lt;</li>
            <li> Just be careful because my daughter used too much and caused a allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> Before, the derma-rolling marks would take about two days to heal completely and I would no longer see the red dots all over my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is on the sensitive inner part of his upper arm which is naturally lighter than the rest of his arm.  </li>
            <li> The color is a very muted pink now.  </li>
            <li> I regularly lighten my hair and spend quite a bit of money on all natural products to help keep it in condition.</li>
            <li> Only used it a couple times so far</li>
            <li> I just happened to discover I&#x27;m allergic apparently to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used 4 different Rosehip Oil so far and this one had the strongest smell - which is like fish oil smell.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see if further extended use will make it completely disappear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural and likely won&#x27;t cause</li>
            <li> It has smoothed my complexion, somehow made some red stops disappear, and faded old acne scars.</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed (just a few minutes) and as I&#x27;ve said, the greasy feeling and scent fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s not dry or oil, just regular</li>
            <li> I just started using it from last week on my left side of the face since right side still has some active acne.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it for your hair again not to much , you can always use it on your skin in other problem areas</li>
            <li> For those unfamiliar with rosehip oil, they’re extracted from the seeds of a specific variety of roses, and they’re full of several fatty acids, vitamins E, C, and A.</li>
            <li> If you are not completely satisfied, simply contact us and we will give you a full refund, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> and i have no dry, flaky skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This item was on time, as described &amp; even came with a little info on how to use it which is something I needed being a first time user.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and 4 1/2 months pregnant with our second baby, and my face was broken out worse than it ever has been, with new fine lines and spots from acne and age.</li>
            <li> I use Rosehip Oil from my local health food store and it is very moisturizing and works well to remove makeup and as a carrier oil for other products.  </li>
            <li> I have to also say that the people behind this product run their company with such utmost focus on customer service --- following up to ensure the customer is satisfied and</li>
            <li> It does have a slight odor to it but not near as strong as some of the other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> For the first week, no positive results, the oil penetrated the skin, quickly and still felt dry and dull.</li>
            <li> Also the dark spots on my shin are DRAMATICALLY fading, with the additional happiness of no more summer ugly alligator skin :-)</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t greasy like other oil, soaked in quickly, and helped eliminate the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and over the past few years realized it was time to treat the appearance of very fine lines, and especially prevent them for the future.  </li>
            <li> but now i have stretch marks pink ones so they are new  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry, acne prone, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for half a week, but every single time I use it (as a serum overnight), I wake up with noticeably less red, more radiant skin.  </li>
            <li> I have never seen such results before with other, well known natural products!!</li>
            <li> I mean super gross.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell that bad, very earthy smell, for sure not like roses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip oil has been a HUGE game changer.  </li>
            <li> i received the item very quickly and have only used it a few days so not sure if i will be getting the benefit i am expecting</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this product, especially after seeing so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Also, the other day, a pimple just suddenly appeared, so I rubbed some rosehip oil on it, and later that day, it was completely cleared.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I expect this reasonably priced bottle will easily last the entire summer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately with his busy schedule I could not find a significant time frame to do this.  </li>
            <li> No only do I use it as part of my nighttime facial treatment, but recently I had a red, patchy area of dry skin above my knee.  </li>
            <li> I have been using coconut oil as my main daily moisturizer for quite some time now, so I added a few drops of the rosehip oil into that and blended it well -</li>
            <li> The scent completely dissipates and blends in with whatever other oils/lotions you use.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the product I received is either adulterated with other oils, or it&#x27;s old and rancid.  </li>
            <li> If your not satisfied VoilaVe offers a complete money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I stopped using my other routine completely and all I do is apply this oil to my face after washing before bed</li>
            <li> It might seem a bit pricey, but 4oz can last an incredibly long time as you only need several drops each time.</li>
            <li> Although I have been using this product for only a few weeks, it has worked very well in alleviating the dry skin patches on my face.  </li>
            <li> just that one small change has already made my face much softer and lessened the redness that I have been experiencing for the last couple of years.  </li>
            <li> I have even started using it on my upper back to treat some minor acne and acne scars from when I was a teenager...</li>
            <li> admit, I was a little skeptical about trying the rose hip oil, especially since it is an oil.</li>
            <li> My small dog couldn&#x27;t handle the renovate bar either because of too much neem but</li>
            <li> It has gotten skinnier and the skin looks flat and striated as if it is pulling together and tightening.  </li>
            <li> It helps make my hair look flat and shinier.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to absorb into my skin so I only use one drop.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> , i started to use it on my face and it actually felt good, but unfortunately did not see any mayor changes other than more breakouts :(</li>
            <li> Soft and subtle with a new \\&quot;spring\\&quot; to it.</li>
            <li> I occasionally use it on my children when their skin is dry also.</li>
            <li> that oil made it soft and less</li>
            <li> So I figured at the end of the day my hands would be back to dry</li>
            <li> I purchased the organic rosehip oil to try on a rash (dry and red) on my face.  </li>
            <li> It definitely helps to regulate the oils in my skin and helps to keep my skin from getting dry.</li>
            <li> I SO wanted this to work on my dry, red skin and rosea on my face.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t drip or smear (like other oils I&#x27;ve used) and it was there until I got back home 5 hours later.</li>
            <li> This bottle is more expensive than other brands</li>
            <li> It was only a couple days of use before I could feel and see the difference when comparing the other area of my hand, an actual visible difference!</li>
            <li> It is just a little oily but that makes it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> when i received product it smelled like fish - I&#x27;m not sure if it is suppose to smell like that since its something very far away from a fish!.</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry out acne, but its not like they look dry and crusty</li>
            <li> The skin around my shin scar not only looks bad it is also more sensitive than other areas.  </li>
            <li> when my bottle of 100% pure &amp; unrefined cold press arrived and he put some on his hands like the first night before he went to bed</li>
            <li> The voilave rosehip has the normal faint scent that I expect from a truly pure oil.</li>
            <li> i can totally tolerate it, is not as strong as the other one i used to have, dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted hundreds and hundreds of dollars on expensive, useless products while slathering toxins on my face for years when I could have been using this wonderful gem.  </li>
            <li> People expecting a rose smell will be shocked</li>
            <li> I sourced other &amp;#34;organic rosehip&amp;#34; and the quality of this was no where near it, since have done this with two other suppliers and</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a long, raised scar on my leg for about 15 years, and after a week of applying rosehip oil to it, the scar is not longer raised.</li>
            <li> The next morning, the scar was already a pink color.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s minor miracle</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy this product as long as it is being offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have no clue how long one should be using before any results can be seen.</li>
            <li> I have not used it for long</li>
            <li> Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really sinks into my normal/dry skin on my neck and face and back of hands.</li>
            <li> so I was not surprised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was definitely not greasy as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with a few old acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I will be sticking with this oil and company for a long time.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using other voilave products in future.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using it on some scars that I have on my arms too after reading several other review about that.  </li>
            <li> Extremely hydrating and has left my skin glowing!  </li>
            <li> (this is the only brand i&#x27;ve used, so i can&#x27;t speak to the difference between this and any other brand.)</li>
            <li> (which won&#x27;t be for a long time!).</li>
            <li> I wish I would have know about this long ago!</li>
            <li> also used this on my hands since they&#x27;re a bit dry due to washing the dishes multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil in hopes to help relieve my dry skin and hair and also to reduce lines in my face.</li>
            <li> I have also applied to dry patches on the my arms for temporary relief from itching and it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Today they are just barely dry.  </li>
            <li> have been using it on my chest area, as it tends to get wrinkly and dry with the years.</li>
            <li> I started to notice it has diminished some of my stretch marks and as a bonus it has helped me with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I always have problems with dry skin, even in the summer time.  </li>
            <li> also used this on my hair since my hair is dry and always frizzy.</li>
            <li> my skin gets quite dry in the winter months.</li>
            <li> It looks like the company recommends it for dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also helped with peeling, dry skin on healing</li>
            <li> I use it on dry spots before applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t leave it dry either.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> When a friend told me that my 71-year-old skin looked dry, I felt I needed a change in my skin-care regimen.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my regular facial moisture cream..</li>
            <li> This oil has reduced the redness on my active breakouts and improved the overall look of my non-broken out skin.  </li>
            <li> However, the smell dissipates quickly and covered up easily by other scents so it really isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to some products so my skin was pretty broken out and after just two days I can see the healing taking place.  </li>
            <li> After all, you can&#x27;t loose.</li>
            <li> I was having a minor breakout due to stress lately, which was my main reason for ordering this, and that has practically cleared up as well.</li>
            <li> Not one to ever turn down potentially looking like Miranda Kerr, I had to get myself a bottle of rosehip oil as well.</li>
            <li> It is not a pleasant smelling oil (that&#x27;s rosehip oil) but works really well on skin and hair.</li>
            <li> dry flakey/oily for me!)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working wonderfully on my dry skin!  </li>
            <li> I started off with the smaller bottle, but just get the larger one, the larger one has a pump and the small one is a dropper, I spilled half of mine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks but am already noticing that my face feels softer and that the lines and wrinkles are noticeably less defined.  </li>
            <li> in the morning and evening and have noticed a slight change in my lines and texture of my facial skin.</li>
            <li> After reading you guide I can understand why some of those expensive wonder products seemed to do the exact opposite,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if everyone will have the same results since everyone&#x27;s body reacts differently to different products but for me, being 65, this product has exceeded its expectations.  </li>
            <li> Just a few small drops provides so much moisture and its not sticky or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> and I had to find something that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin super oily, yet do its job (which has been extremely difficult to find in my years of dealing with acne).  </li>
            <li> I use the rosehip oil on the very dry patches of skin on my face like around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> My skin can be very dry and prone to eczema flare-ups.</li>
            <li> Really, I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews at all!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really gotten into the natural products and essential oils recently, as I&#x27;ve found they benefit my skin just as well, it not better, than expensive creams, and serums containing harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because it is a little greasy feeling for about 30 minutes after it is put on.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to diminish sun spots from my skin using it several weeks now a little fading but the spots are still visible.</li>
            <li> I only put a little bit yet</li>
            <li> : Our Rosehip Oil is 100% Pure, Cold pressed, Unrefined, All natural, and Bottled in the U.S.A.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I am not a very consistent user (used 1-2 times a week)</li>
            <li> bad love</li>
            <li> the past month, I have noticed a reduction in two scars from when I left my ACV on too long removing a skin tag and mole.</li>
            <li> I find that my skin is shiny the rest of the evening, but of course that is expected because I just applied an oil to my face</li>
            <li> the Dead Sea Mud Mask next.</li>
            <li> Just received this product a few days ago and it is already a part of my daily routine.  </li>
            <li> I starting using this product a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Its has only been few days</li>
            <li> I bought my bottle last week and have been using it everyday night for 5 days now.</li>
            <li> This light-bodied oil disappears like water on my aged skin.</li>
            <li> bought my bottle last week and have been using it everyday night for 5 days now.</li>
            <li> You really only need a few drops to see results.  </li>
            <li> I mix it in with my Derma e facial moisturizer and it makes the cream seem &#x27;fluffy&#x27; and easier to go on with no greasiness whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> My skin is red and has an uneven tone.  </li>
            <li> It does feel greasy on the initial application but after a few minutes, the greasy feeling goes away.</li>
            <li> I am 26 Latina with extremely sensitive combo skin, also suffer from Seborrheic dermatitis and some moderate breakouts as of lately and uneven skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen rosehip oil mentioned in reviews as part of the skin care regiment a lot of folks use but for some reason I just had this mental block about about it.</li>
            <li> I got this and carefully read not to expect it to smell like rosehips, which is no problem.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops at night mixed with my moisturizer and the Vitamin C serum in the morning.</li>
            <li> so it should last a while if not to heavy with use age like on hair</li>
            <li> Either way, you likely won&#x27;t waste your ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I carefully pat it under my eyes and on my eyelids).  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy as it sinks into the skin</li>
            <li> A little known secret that gives a strong punch in small bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pure rosehip oil</li>
            <li> This product was not very useful for me.</li>
            <li> I have used it on a few small scars and so far they seem to be a bit flatter and softer.  </li>
            <li> I have always added Rosehip Oil with my body lotion as it helps that it is now less dry.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little of it goes a long way too</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, it leaves no greasy residue</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and it gives me extreme moisture without any oily residue.</li>
            <li> I had read that other Rosehip Oil smelled fishy and was relieved to see no comments here on this brand.  </li>
            <li> Works well with other oils for my face.</li>
            <li> I think is is going to replace my other fancy anti-aging creams.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The problem is ( other than the $$$) that any leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> I depend on reviews from other users before buying any products on amazon.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no risk to you when you order now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is with this product compared to the product I buy locally</li>
            <li> Other reviews did not think it smelled.  </li>
            <li> It does not produce adverse effect when combined with my other face</li>
            <li> I have written other reviews on some of their other products as well.</li>
            <li> I also mix this with other oils and use it for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am also using it on past scars and yes they are actually changing into thinner and lighter colors in 2 days as well!</li>
            <li> I used other brands and it didn&#x27;t smell like that.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I was at first a bit wary of it since I have combination, acne-prone skin that can get oily at times.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and just put 3 drops on my face for first week.</li>
            <li> I am going to try other Voilave skincare products.</li>
            <li> I use it for moisturizing as well as a variety of other applications</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I also rubbed my hair with a little rosehip oil, as I have dry hair - and it helps a lot.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong and it does not smell bad either.</li>
            <li> My legs are usually very irritated from the shaving and use to itch like crazy the next day, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> he did this step to another previous review by the way for other stuff used anyway .</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - just a few drops at night for me - so it may be awhile before I need to purchase.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t dry, unlike when I have used other moisturizers in the past.</li>
            <li> I will continue this regime and will be anxious to see long term results.</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing massive cystic acne breakout for the past few months leaving me with lots of scars on my face.</li>
            <li> I read that Rosehip oil is commonly used for a variety of skin conditions such as dermatitis, acne and eczema, sun burnt skin and brittle nails.  </li>
            <li> Keep this somewhere dark, even though it&#x27;s in dark glass.</li>
            <li> I think its average.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also started using it under my eyes, for my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I was having a difficult time finding a moisturizer that really worked, that did not have a laundry list of unsafe chemical ingredients and would not cause break outs.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also helped with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> VoilaVe is bottled in a dark colored bottle.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Sticky, thick with a big odor.</li>
            <li> I do not use makeup and was not very comfortable using chemicals.</li>
            <li> has been a miracle worker for my skin in terms of oil control (crazy, right?) and scar correction.</li>
            <li> I have some dry patches on my hands from past scarring, and it seems to be softening those areas already</li>
            <li> The Repel bar has less neem.  </li>
            <li> but I broke out with black heads after using this for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> After just one week I noticed my wrinkles are less visible.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that Rosehip Oil could help with stretch marks, but those seem less noticeable too.</li>
            <li> I saw much less redness to my skin,</li>
            <li> less wrinkles and my skin looked well hydrated without being oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, just a slight change for the areas that need work.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a difference in the reduction of redness in my skin and less blotchy.</li>
            <li> this product claims to do- slight or otherwise.</li>
            <li> but I can see slight differences.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with the slightly earthy scent.</li>
            <li> Since using rosehip oil I find that I have much less acne</li>
            <li> A lot of my previous acne scars have faded as a result</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically give feedback or write reviews</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, and lines are less visible.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles on my forehead have gotten less defined.</li>
            <li> I had very dark spots on my cheeks and now there are not as dark.  </li>
            <li> my nails are a mess.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face to help with wrinkles and on the backs of my hands to get rid of a few dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I found this to be very average rosehip oil and found it difficult to justify the sky high price.</li>
            <li> I have already noticed I am using less concealer for the dark marks left behind by acne.  </li>
            <li> I have already noticed I am using less concealer for the dark marks left behind by acne.</li>
            <li> I have already noticed I am using less concealer for the dark marks left behind by acne.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I thought I might try it at least once.  </li>
            <li> I dab a little under my eyes, I mix with the Voila Ve Hyaluronic Acid Serum and put it all over my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I bought this rosehip oil with the intent to even out my complexion (ethnic skin with a little variation in color) and help my skin retain moisture.  </li>
            <li> I also add a little to my body lotion and it gives me a glowing complexion.  </li>
            <li> This little brown bottle will be a part of my collection from here on.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a little over a month</li>
            <li> Organic, Cold Pressed and 100% pure</li>
            <li> I apply a few drops to my face at night time.</li>
            <li> Once it has dried, I add two drops of the Rosehip oil to a pump of an oil-free moisturizer from Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I never wore sunscreen as a kid, acne scars, and all over uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item few weeks ago and used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of my Rosehip Oil and mix it with coconut oil for my legs after shaving.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> The oil comes with a dropper so prevents waste.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few oils that I can put on my face w/o breaking out.  </li>
            <li> I massaged a few drops of Rosehip Oil on the area and the itch is gone and redness is fading.</li>
            <li> You just put a few drops on and rub it in.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to help with the appearance of scars that were left behind from acne.</li>
            <li> I am almost 60 (another few months) and have decided to stop using harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I have used this every night for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> just a few drops every morning</li>
            <li> It had a heavy fish smell</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this oil with my face moisturizer, or just put a few drops on wrinkle prone spots on my body.  </li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try the Organic Rosehip Oil, a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> A few times a week should do the size is 1 fl oz  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops massaged into your skin once or twice a day seems to take off a few years, soften tissues, even tones, and repair damage.</li>
            <li> gave this product a four based on the fact that I have only used it for  approximately two weeks.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops are all that is needed.  </li>
            <li> Messy to use.</li>
            <li> It slightly heavy for my skin and causes me to break out</li>
            <li> No strong odors at all.</li>
            <li> The smell was not strong nor did it linger.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount and prefer to leave my face a little damp to help spread the oil around my face.</li>
            <li> the smell is pretty bad....</li>
            <li> I am needing to file down at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that a little hyperpigmentation in my neck has faded as well as an old chicken pox scar has faded as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an unbelievable difference.</li>
            <li> Not sure if these comments are staged or not,</li>
            <li> Sorry to say I am not totally please with the oil...</li>
            <li> not sure why people had problems with the oil&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> My husband has a small scar on his arm from a scratch.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling nourished and diminishes small lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> In the past couple of weeks, I have noticed scar tissue fading.</li>
            <li> I usually have oily face</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING CLOGGED MY PORES causing small pimples to always form.</li>
            <li> I also love that it is an oil, but doesn&#x27;t leave that awful greasy sheen.  </li>

            <li> I also love that it is an oil, but doesn&#x27;t leave that awful greasy sheen.</li>
            <li> I also love that it is an oil, but doesn&#x27;t leave that awful greasy sheen.</li>
            <li> and I also have a small bottle in my purse for my hands.</li>
            <li> ( make my skin worse) due to their ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle scent which goes away after a few minutes of application so for me, it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
            <li> I only cant say I hate it because I was ignorant enough to not know.</li>
            <li> Another deciding factor was the fact it is cold pressed and has no other added oils or ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this rosehip oil - you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but I can say that my very sensitive skin has not reacted badly to it,</li>
            <li> and this one hardly smelled at all.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to soy and because tocopherol/vitamin e can be soy based I have a hard time with any formulations of serums or moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I started to break out really bad at 23 years old.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, not too greasy, no smell.  </li>
            <li> This was partly because after I had gotten my product, I read some of the negative reviews regarding VoilaVe.</li>
            <li> I read a review that complained about the smell.  </li>
            <li> had read reviews where people complained about the smell of rosehip oil, and while it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause any negative reactions whatsoever from my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause any negative reactions whatsoever from my skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my late twenties</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to report.</li>
            <li> I have slowly been changing what I put on my face because I don&#x27;t want the chemicals anymore.</li>
            <li> I do sometimes follow up with a thick under eye moisturizer if I feel the need.  </li>
            <li> like that the oil is not sticky or thick and has a subtle scent.</li>
            <li> You need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> They were so dry from this cold winter.  </li>
            <li> I was a sad sap of a mess.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is the SMELL.</li>
            <li> it has been impossible to find a skin care regime, not more or less a moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad excema, like knuckles bleed in the winter bad.  </li>
            <li> Tough to take bc of the scent.</li>
            <li> When I first got this, and smelled it, I was disappointed, not because I was expecting it to smell like roses but because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to smell quite so bad, almost a chemical scent.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any breakouts from using this product.....</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to look like a Victoria Secret Model?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted and I&#x27;m kicking myself for not having discovered this sooner.</li>

            <li> Boy, my dermaltologist gave me &amp;#34;mivaso&amp;#34; cream which made face even worse.</li>
            <li> In fact, it seems to be making my redness and breakouts worse, almost like acne.  </li>
            <li> I have heard of other people saying that it smells bad.  </li>

            <li> In my case, the weather ruins my skin badly; however when I turn junk eater, no one to blame but me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for approximately a month and find the smell is not strong or rank</li>
            <li> The American Frankendiet is causing horrible inflammation in our bodies caused by yeast and fungus.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs well, no stickiness has a faint scent</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the oil itself, just didn&#x27;t work on my face.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, this one(which</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> It does feel weird putting oil on your skin if you’ve never done it before, but it doesn’t clog up pores or anything.</li>
            <li> I have combination type which even with the expensive mosturizers</li>
            <li> It faintly smelled like dirt after the rain.</li>
            <li> I have a few blemish marks from my incessant need to pick at my skin (awful, I know).  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was afraid to order rosehip oil based on the &amp;#34;fish oil&amp;#34; smell, but decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> but with the windy and cold weather of fall and swing-shift work, my skin needed almost a miracle to recover.</li>
            <li> but I am beyond disappointed.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone would be disappointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if I have any results.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> i hate the crunchy look.</li>
            <li> Very unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> but this is the worst smelling beauty product I have ever tried to use.  </li>
            <li> good&amp;#34;  to me it is not off-putting or terribly pungent.</li>
            <li> but I felt like I was in a vicious cycle of drying out my face and clogging my pores with the moisturizers I&#x27;d use to combat the dryness.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really love this product.  I use it at night and sometimes in the morning.  As soon as I apply it, my skin feels soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil in hopes to help relieve my dry skin and hair and also to reduce lines in my face. I have not yet noticed any changes in wrinkles/smile lines but I have noticed a nice change in my skin&#x27;s texture. I apply a few drops to my face at night time. I find that my skin is shiny the rest of the evening, but of course that is expected because I just applied an oil to my face (so basically don&#x27;t put it on in the mornings). I was nervous about using an oil on my skin because I suspected more clogged pores or breakouts, or overall oily skin. However, using this oil every night has not caused any of the above. It actually settles in the skin quite nicely. I wake up in the mornings with soft skin. I have also applied to dry patches on the my arms for temporary relief from itching and it worked well.&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping to see more benefits after long term use of this product. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my skin feels soft and hydrated. The smell is lovely too. will buy more.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and have tried a lot of facial moisturizers. This is one of the best. After a week, my skin looks much better. It is very absorbent and brightens my skin. I use it every night. In the morning I use the VoilaVe argon oil, which is lighter, along with a sunscreen. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Like this very much.  Goes on nicely, not too greasy, no smell.  Leaves fact very soft and has softened lines and wrinkles,  I use this mostly at night, but have also used in am .  This is my first bottle of it, and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Use this every night. Love it !!</li>
            <li> Great stuff and works better than my high end serums!  I can always tell a difference when I forget it.  I just don&#x27;t have the same glow.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it along with a Retinol cream and it keeps my skin soft and blemish-less.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is 100% pure.  Reason:  I ordered twice directly from Patagonia their organic rosehip oil (Aceite De Rosa Mosqueta.  It has it &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; smell which is agreeable.  I&#x27;m from Europe so I can smell which is pure and which is adulterated.  Somehow this doesn&#x27;t smell like the ones I ordered from Patagonia.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE ViolaVe products. I had previously purchased the ViolaVe vitamin C serum, and really loved it and decided to purchase the Rosehip oil and the hyaluronic acid. Together with the vitamin c serum, I have found that my pores are a lot smaller, I break out less, and my skin just looks so alive and healthy. I use a drop of the hyaluronic acid and a pump of the vit c serum and spread that on my face. Once it has dried, I add two drops of the Rosehip oil to a pump of an oil-free moisturizer from Neutrogena. I do this every morning and night and it gives me extreme moisture without any oily residue. I strongly recommend buying all three products for the highest benefit. So bottom line is I love ViolaVe products and plan to continue purchasing more and more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell at all. Bought as a moisturizer but... Tough to take bc of the scent. Do not expect a rose scent. I didn&#x27;t really think it would be rosey but I wasn&#x27;t expecting the odor it did have. I can&#x27;t speak to how it works bc I haven&#x27;t used it much as the odor has deterred me from using it. Will keep it around to add to some homemade products where hopefully the scent will be masked.</li>
            <li> it is much better than a lot of overpriced cosmetic products. Very moisturized and not oily. It is effective and you can see the change. Worth the price and I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> The Organic Rosehip Oil has worked wonders on my face. Even though it is an oil, it is light in texture and absorbed quickly. I applied a couple of drops to my fingertips and pat lightly all over my face. Then I go back smooth it into my skin as you would when applying any lotion. I have not experienced any breakouts from using this product..... But I have experienced Moisturized, Hydrated Skin that is soft to the touch. I am now using it on my hands and forearms with great results. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product! Use for a facial moisturiser and my face is soft and glowing!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my mom she use it on her face and you could see the improvements the dark spot on her face are fading very good product so far</li>
            <li> Ineffective with psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I use this rosehip oil in my bath bombs. The product arrived as shown, and no issues.I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Product is great.  I use this mixed with the argon oil as a moistureizer.  I also use it on my cuticles.  Will buy product again.  Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great Rosehip oil. I use this regularly and notice it softens my skin as well as gives a radiant clarity which is what I was looking for. I occasionally use it on my children when their skin is dry also. It&#x27;s not miracle oil by any means but you will see an improvement in clarity and does provide moisture comfort to the face. I didn&#x27;t notice and reduction in fine lines. As far as the brand, color and texture it is accurately described. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Okay so where do I begin? I am 25 and have always had problem skin. Acne, fine lines b/c I never wore sunscreen as a kid, acne scars, and all over uneven skin tone. This stuff is seriously amazing. Not only does it dry out acne, but its not like they look dry and crusty, they just shrink literally over night, I can even use this as a spot treatment. Just by using it twice a day for about 2 weeks I have already noticed my acne scars fading significantly and my skin tone becoming more even. I love that I can put this on, wait 5 mins and then put my powder over it and it never looks cakey or layered on. I have even started using it on my upper back to treat some minor acne and acne scars from when I was a teenager...not even 2 days later and I can see a difference. I have also been using it when I dermaroll my stretch marks on my legs and bottom and its working like a charm.  Now that&#x27;s just the skin stuff, I also use it on my hair to keep the frizzys down and keep my ends nice and soft. I will 100% be buying this again.</li>
            <li> My skin is getting smoother each day I use it. But so far the scars are still the same, need to use it longer&lt;br /&gt;to get the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> Excellent product .  Thank you</li>
            <li> Seems to be working on my fine lines already, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling oily.  Worked great on dry skin on my face &amp; legs.  The only complaint I have is it smells like cooking oil instead of having a light rose scent to it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed by this oil at all. Didn&#x27;t so much at all for me</li>
            <li> Love this on my skin and my hair.  This product is a keeper</li>
            <li> Great product and fast service, thank you.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft without being greasy</li>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use very many products without having some kind of reaction. My skin gets red and hot and I get hives. Finding this product has been amazing. I don&#x27;t have any of those problems when I use rose hip oil. My skin feels moisturized and clear. It does have an earthy smell but I have grown to like the smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item few weeks ago and used it a few times. It did not suit my skin and I decided to return the product. I reached out to Voilave customer service and got a response from Dan, owner of this line. Dan provided excellent customer service and  I am very pleased by this experience. I look forward to using other voilave products in future.</li>
            <li> Does contain vitamin e as well. It&#x27;s not pure rosehip oil like I thought so I can&#x27;t use it on my face but it&#x27;s wonderful for the body</li>
            <li> my skin loves this and I love how natural it is</li>
            <li> In love with with!! The results I have gotten from this already after 3-4 days of usage on my skin is already more even toned with less blemishes. I will definately be purchasing more of this in the future!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I feel like it&#x27;s helping my dark spots and making my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more radiant and tighter I have noticed the fine lines less and skin texture seems to be improving.  Will absolutely keep using it as an alternative to chemical cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> i received the item very quickly and have only used it a few days so not sure if i will be getting the benefit i am expecting yet.&lt;br /&gt;love the purity of your products though.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough great things about this! First off it smells vaguely like rose a touch like rose water, it is an orange color but goes on your face clear. I use it on my face, lips, hair and scars. You need a very small amount. It is amazing, i will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Excellent organic cold pressed rosehip oil.  We use this alone or we mix it up in our face lotion.  My daughter has been using it for her red acne marks and it seems to be helping.  Also wonderful on your fingernail and cuticles.  Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has severe acne rosacea and we have been using neem oil and it works wonders.  Wondercide Natural Products has fantastic neem products for humans and your pets.  The neem bar soap worked immediately on her acne rosacea.  The reason neem works so well is because it kills off the Demodex mites that live on our skin.  People who have acne rosacea have more of these microscopic Demodex mites than the average person without acne rosacea.  Just be careful because my daughter used too much and caused a allergic reaction.  We bought organic neem oil and add a drop or two to her cleanser and her face lotion.  If you can handle a lot of neem,  Wondercide&#x27;s renovate soap bar was amazing on her acne rosacea but was too much neem for my daughter.  The renovate bar has neem oil, neem leaf juice and need bark.  The Repel bar has less neem.  The combination of the neem and rosehip oil has been working great.  I would try the renovate bar first and do a test spot first to make sure you don&#x27;t have a reaction.  (Read about neem allergic reactions online first.)  The repel soap has been getting rid of mites on my pet too.  My small dog couldn&#x27;t handle the renovate bar either because of too much neem but the repel bar worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read an article about a year ago regarding the Demodex mites pertaining to acne rosacea and that they &amp;#34;could&amp;#34; be the cause of acne rosacea.  Very short article but didn&#x27;t say what would kill the mites.  My dog got mites so I found this Wondercide&#x27;s soap bar for him but when I read it help to get rid of mites then it clicked in my brain back to that article.  So that&#x27;s when I tested the renovate bar on my daughter&#x27;s back acne it was IMMEDIATE results.  Red marks diminshed.So she tried it on her face and her rosacea went away immediately.  So now we are figuring out just how much neem my daughter can handle because she is so sensitive.  My husband has skin issues and uses too it in the shower with no allergic reactions.  Also, I read the mites feed off of yeast (candida) in the body which is caused by sugar, HFC, processed foods, stress, etc. which causes inflammation in the body.  Acne rosacea are inflammatory diseases.  Also neem gets rid of fungus too.  The American Frankendiet is causing horrible inflammation in our bodies caused by yeast and fungus.  Inflammatory diseases are on the rise.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected. Love the smell and the way my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after using one time.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to agree with my skin. I have extremely sensitive skin and maybe that&#x27;s why, but I broke out with black heads after using this for 2 weeks. It may be a good oil, but it&#x27;s not right for my skin.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and this is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well, no stickiness has a faint scent</li>
            <li> I purchased this to add to a DIY age-fighting moisturizer recipe. The customer service was awesome and the product seems to be everything it claims to be. High quality and works excellently for the purpose I purchased it for!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have dry skin so I just use this for my daily moisturizer. It has a pretty nasty smell to it, but other than that its great at moisturizing and reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  I started off with the smaller bottle, but just get the larger one, the larger one has a pump and the small one is a dropper, I spilled half of mine right when I got it. The pump makes it so much easier, plus you will love it any way, and use it up!</li>
            <li> Works great as a facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good organic Rosehip oil for the serum i make for under eyes and face and after reading a lot of reviews and comparing products, i decided on buying this one and I am glad i got this! It is not a pleasant smelling oil (that&#x27;s rosehip oil) but works really well on skin and hair. Recommend this to anyone looking for a good organic rosehip oil for face or hair!</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff!  I love using it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product about 3 weeks and I am seeing a reduction in the redness and age spots, this is good news for a &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; citizen!</li>
            <li> Great product. My skin is healthier.</li>
            <li> love it!  have been applying to face in the mornings.  not to oily but feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful...my face is so soft and I have been getting complements on how my skin is glowing..</li>
            <li> Amazing texture. I use it for my scars and around the eyes to prevent wrinkles since I am always surfing and expose to the sun</li>
            <li> This stuff did wonders to my face. I started to break out really bad at 23 years old. I tried everything but nothing seemed to worked. For two years my self-esteem was very low. Then a few months ago I read a review on here that said rosehip oil and tea tree oil worked amazing together. So I tried it, and oh boy I loved it. My face cleared up completely in month 3. I highly recommend trying this! :)</li>
            <li> I use this mixed with coconut oil in leu of face lotion.  I love how soft my skin feels and dryness is no longer an issue.  After just one week I noticed my wrinkles are less visible.</li>
            <li> Right now i can only review about the shipping, the package and the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Delivery was very quick, right on time as i expected. the package was well protected because it is glass and arrived intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Smell. well i used to use Rose hip oil from other brand and i didn&#x27;t like the smell, because it was a very very strong smell, the last time i used it was 5 or 6 months ago, but now i have stretch marks pink ones so they are new  and i need to treat them, so my dermatologist told me to buy rosehip oil and i wasn&#x27;t sure if i was going to buy it, but then i read review here about this one and i decided to give it a try and i must say the smell of this brand i can totally tolerate it, is not as strong as the other one i used to have, dont get me wrong it does have a smell but it goes away after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About how good it is or how well it works i cant say anything right now  because i only have been using it for 3 days but it does make my skin very smooth, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle worker!! I&#x27;m 30 years old and 4 1/2 months pregnant with our second baby, and my face was broken out worse than it ever has been, with new fine lines and spots from acne and age. I was a sad sap of a mess. And being pregnant, wouldn&#x27;t try anything full of chemicals. I read the reviews and gave this rosehip oil a shot, thank goodness! In 10 days, my skin looks 10 years younger!!! the acne is totally gone!!! and the spots are fading very quickly! My mom saw me tonight and commented that my skin looked like porcelain, and I had even skipped my makeup today!!! It&#x27;s an unbelievable difference. I&#x27;ve begun using it almost everywhere on my body. Go for the bigger bottle, it will last forever and your skin will thank you for it! And the smell is not bad, it&#x27;s like raisins, dark chocolate, oats, and dirt mixed together and it goes away quickly. Try it!!</li>
            <li> I love using Rosehip Oil in lieu of a moisturizer because it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make my skin feel greasy. That being said, this isn&#x27;t the best rosehip oil that I&#x27;ve ever used. I love the bigger bottle, but while other versions made the oil feel like a serum, this particular brand made the oil feel like it was just sitting on my skin and never sinking in. I&#x27;ve tried other VoilaVe products before though, and I&#x27;d love the try the Dead Sea Mud Mask next.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil was amazing!! It wasn&#x27;t greasy like other oil, soaked in quickly, and helped eliminate the dark spots on my face. Before purchasing this oil I had been bit by a dog on my face and had multiple scars on my upper lip and nose area, after finishing this bottle of oil the scars are not as noticeable. I&#x27;m not 100% sure if was the oil&#x27;s work or not, but I&#x27;m definitely purchasing another bottle.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of my Rosehip Oil and mix it with coconut oil for my legs after shaving. My legs are usually very irritated from the shaving and use to itch like crazy the next day, but not anymore. The combination of Rosehip oil and coconut oil has stopped the irritation and itch and my legs are much softer than before I started doing this. I didn&#x27;t realize that Rosehip Oil could help with stretch marks, but those seem less noticeable too. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have recently switched to more natural skin care.  I made a moisturizer containing this, jojoba oil, and essential oils together.  I LOVE IT!  My skin feels so soft, isn&#x27;t oily, and I think I look younger :)</li>
            <li> I use this oil with the Argan oil to control a skin condition.</li>
            <li> Incredible rosehip oil! I love the high quality and intend to purchase it again</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic oil! It has helped tremendously to heal my daughter&#x27;s dry skin. I have been combining it with a vitamin c/hyaluronic acid serum as part of my night time routine. The results are softer, smoother skin in the morning. The scent is clean and slightly nutty, but fades quickly. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Good product! Makes my face feel super soft!</li>
            <li> I have been using the organic rosehip oil for about 2 weeks, along with the triple action vitamin C serum. The oil absorbs almost immediately &amp; there is no oily residue. My skin is appearing healthier with a nice sheen. After reading VoilaVe&#x27;s skin care recommendations of avoiding chemicals commonly in the ingredients of many skin care products &amp; make-up, I will plan to continue using products like theirs.</li>
            <li> I had read that other Rosehip Oil smelled fishy and was relieved to see no comments here on this brand.  Not sure if these comments are staged or not, but this is the worst smelling beauty product I have ever tried to use.  After applying to my face the first day I could smell the fishy, oily smell all day long...and don&#x27;t use it in your hair..you will smell it the next day as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have written the company asking if this was rancid...will wait to see their reply, but I think this will be going back to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And before anyone says anything I went to a local store and smelled their organic Rosehip Oil and there was no odor at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love this product...but I am beyond disappointed.  I didn&#x27;t even want to give it one star.</li>
            <li> I use many essential oils and I know quality. The voilave rosehip has the normal faint scent that I expect from a truly pure oil. But the thing I noticed most is the color. It is a beautiful dark orange, I know from experience this means it is very fresh. It goes on nicely and makes my skin feel so soft. I purchased from the voilave website and have to say that the customer service was excellent as well! Will definitely buy again and have told my sisters about the oil and they too are going to purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks but am already noticing that my face feels softer and that the lines and wrinkles are noticeably less defined.  I combine the rosehip oil with the Voilave Triple Action Vitamin C serum.  I am interested in seeing what will happen with continued use of these two products.  The instruction booklet that was available with the purchase provided important and enlightening skincare information.</li>
            <li> My face breaks out frequently, when my friend first told me about rosehip oil I apprehensive but I bought this product and was very pleased on how well it worked. My face cleared up quickly after using it for few days, I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say I am not totally please with the oil... It is granually.. Have had others I liked better&lt;br /&gt;Dory Dean Atkinson</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with rosehip oil, but I also bought argan oil and pumpkin seed oil (from different companies) at the same time to see which one is the most compatible with my skin. Out of all three, rosehip felt the most luxurious and soft. It gets absorbed really quickly leaving the skin well moisturized. I think the quality of this product is amazing and I would definitely try again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  No only do I use it as part of my nighttime facial treatment, but recently I had a red, patchy area of dry skin above my knee.  I&#x27;ve been applying one drop at night and I have seen a great improvement. And even though I received this product for review, I&#x27;ll definitely consider purchasing it when this bottle runs out.  A little goes a long way - just a few drops at night for me - so it may be awhile before I need to purchase. ;-)</li>
            <li> Pure quality. There are a lot of different rosehip oil . This brand is by far the best I have tried. Very easy to receive any information needed on this product. VoilaVe seems to be very committed to their products. Will continue with this brand.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this and I absolutely love it. It smells amazing, not bad or even earthy like some reviews say. It sinks into my fair, freckled skin so nicely and almost immediately makes me look more awake and refreshed. Lovely for morning application or before bed as well. I use just this for moisturizer and it does the trick! I highly recommend an organic natural product like this -- way better than anything at Origins or the like and it&#x27;s got a great price tag as well.</li>
            <li> This felt really soft and matte on my skin when first applied. Definitely follow with a moisturizer, as this was very drying.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong and it does not smell bad either. I have been using it for two weeks and I love the way it makes my skin feel! I also love that is all natural and organic. This will be regular face lotion now since it goes on very well and does make me face greasy at all!</li>
            <li> I love the scent and hydrating effect the product leaves on my skin. It is just that much more comforting to know that it is organic and safe. I&#x27;ve personally struggled with dry fingernails that get many hangnails. This has helped to reduce the problem with my nails I completely recommend it! Great product.</li>
            <li> Although I have been using this product for only a few weeks, it has worked very well in alleviating the dry skin patches on my face.  It is a very concentrated oil so a little goes a long way.  The price is very reasonable for certified organic rosehip oil and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am having to replace my personal care products with items that don&#x27;t contain chemicals for health reasons. I have been using this rosehip oil as a moisturizer at night for two weeks now, and I love it. It works much better than the products I used before. A little of it goes a long way too so I can tell one bottle will last me months.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I thought I might try it at least once.  I&#x27;ve been using this on my face for a couple of weeks now, and I am surprisingly happy with the results.  I can&#x27;t quite pin point it, but have noticed that my face are more even toned.  It&#x27;s a good thing because I am a sun worshiper.  Also, the other day, a pimple just suddenly appeared, so I rubbed some rosehip oil on it, and later that day, it was completely cleared.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this oil before and really really liked it...but when it came time to reorder, I decided to look at other Amazon websites just to be sure I&#x27;d get the best product for the best price. This was partly because after I had gotten my product, I read some of the negative reviews regarding VoilaVe. (Note:  Even though my experience was positive).  In the end I decided to try VoilaVe again as it seemed to still be the best.  I reordered, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  Really, I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews at all!  The oil doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, but they tell you that up front.  The oil works great, and doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor.  I&#x27;m not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> received my oil as promised.  I love it great product and value.  I mix it with Helichrysum oil and sweet almond oil to treat scars~ both old and new scars almost disappear in about a month!</li>
            <li> Just received this product a few days ago and it is already a part of my daily routine.  I had read about the many benefits of rosehip oil and I am very impressed with this 100% organic and GMO free formula.  I have been using coconut oil as my main daily moisturizer for quite some time now, so I added a few drops of the rosehip oil into that and blended it well - just that one small change has already made my face much softer and lessened the redness that I have been experiencing for the last couple of years.  I am looking forward to using it on some scars that I have on my arms too after reading several other review about that.  I love this stuff and I am hooked!</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil that I find works best on my scars and dark spots. I&#x27;ve had a long, raised scar on my leg for about 15 years, and after a week of applying rosehip oil to it, the scar is not longer raised. It&#x27;s an old scar, so I don&#x27;t expect it to disappear, but I like the that oil made it soft and less prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using essential oils on my face (they WILL NOT make your face more oily) and they make my combination skin soft and luminous. This rosehip oil worked best when I combined it with other oils for my sensitive face skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why people had problems with the oil&#x27;s scent. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, but essential oils all have earthy smells. That&#x27;s completely natural. Great customer service and will definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> I have had some SMELLY rosehip oil. I mean super gross. and this one hardly smelled at all. I love it. Works JUST AS GOOD if not better then some others I&#x27;ve tried too.. I wasnt sure because of how great the price was , but man was I surprised!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil as an alternative to argan oil...I&#x27;ve heard that due to Rosehip&#x27;s high concentration of Vit A that it can help with reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and I like it even better than my previous brand of Argan...it soaks in very quickly.  I use it at bedtime, and when I get up in the morning my skin is still so moisturized that I don&#x27;t need any additional moisturizer in the a.m.  This will be a staple in my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! We&#x27;ll see if it works on the age spots, but it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have always had very clear skin, but after using this product my forehead and chin would break out and take forever to clear up.  Finally had to discard product.</li>
            <li> I was interested in finding more natural methods to taking care of my skin.  I read about the moisturizing and anti-aging effects of rose hip oil, so I decided to give it a try.  For an organic product, the price is great.  So far, I am enjoying the product - it is incredibly moisturizing and leaves my skin very soft.  I have problem skin on my arms, so I am hoping with continued use it will improve.  I read a review that complained about the smell.  It definitely has a different but natural scent about it, probably not what most people are used to because all commercial beauty products contain added fragrances which really are not great for your skin.  I don&#x27;t think the smell is overpowering. I&#x27;ve tried other natural oils and rose hip is not the most pungent of scents.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, miraculous, extraordinary, and powerful!  I don&#x27;t even know if there are enough words to describe how great this product is and what it has done for our family.  I use this product for my stretch marks.  I am currently derma-rolling and combining this rosehip oil with evening primrose oil, vitamin e oil, and vitamin c oil.  You can tell the difference from when I used this mixture before without the rosehip oil and now that I have incorporated it in my routine solution.  Before, the derma-rolling marks would take about two days to heal completely and I would no longer see the red dots all over my skin.  After adding rosehip oil to the solution, it is a miracle healer and the red dots are gone before it has even been 24 hours.  My stretch marks are lifted and filling in nicely.  The redness/purpleness of the marks is lightening up and becoming more uniform with the surrounding healthy skin.  My skin is softer and more supple.  I also no longer have any razor burn on my thighs which I normally would get from time to time...I do not know why!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product goes on smoothly and does not cause a single adverse reaction to my skin.  I have super sensitive skin that causes me to break out in hives or turn red with nearly every product on the market.  This is truly hypoallergenic in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only have I used this for stretch marks, I also have started putting this on my face instead of lotion.  I was weary at first about putting an oil on my very combination, sensitive skin...but I gave it a shot after I read many testimonials to its acne-clearing and skin toning abilities.  It only takes a little bit to moisturize the entire face and it absorbs very quickly.  It does not look shiny or greasy at all.  I can truly say that it heals blemishes and fresh acne issues nearly overnight, at most 2 days.  I have a few blemish marks from my incessant need to pick at my skin (awful, I know).  This has lightened those marks where they arealmost invisible now.  Also, it heals acne on the spot.  It actually dries them out (you can see it if you look at a pimple in the mirror after applying this) and you&#x27;ll see it just basically shrink into nothing within a day.  No redness, no whitehead...it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, one last thing I&#x27;ve tried this for: my husband&#x27;s scar on his arm.  My husband has a small scar on his arm from a scratch.  It is on the sensitive inner part of his upper arm which is naturally lighter than the rest of his arm.  It was pretty noticeable and had been there for a good 3 weeks or so.  It healed as much as I believe it was going to and had settled on a purplish red color.  I had read many times that rosehip oil was a natural healer oil.  I thought why not and we applied it after his nightly shower.  The next morning, the scar was already a pink color.  We did the same thing again that night after his shower, and the next day, the scar was a light pink!!  We have done this once a day for about 4 days now and the scar looks great.  It has gotten skinnier and the skin looks flat and striated as if it is pulling together and tightening.  The color is a very muted pink now.  I bet it will be all healed in another 4 days or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I don&#x27;t know what else to say except you have to try this product for yourself.  It is worth every dollar.  The smell may throw some people off but I have been reassured by holistic professionals that this product should have a flax seed type smell to it and it also depends on a woman&#x27;s status on her menstrual cycle how the smell is perceived!  With that said, once the product is on you, you do not smell anything at all.  The scent completely dissipates and blends in with whatever other oils/lotions you use.  The color is orange but it rubs in colorless.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try something natural and good for your body!  You won&#x27;t regret it!  Much better for you and worth the $$ that is way less than Strivectin SD or any other stretch mark/healer cream on the market that costs waaaaaay more and requires you to buy it over and over again for months.</li>
            <li> My skin is loving this oil. I mix it with a bit almond oil and put it on my freshly washed face at night, my skin is smooth and glowing,</li>
            <li> When I first got this, and smelled it, I was disappointed, not because I was expecting it to smell like roses but because I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to smell quite so bad, almost a chemical scent. However, the smell dissipates quickly and covered up easily by other scents so it really isn&#x27;t that bad. I have no idea if it&#x27;s working it&#x27;s minor miracle but I can say that my very sensitive skin has not reacted badly to it, so that&#x27;s a big point in its favor.</li>
            <li> One of the best oils I&#x27;ve tried.  Great for face, hair and skin.  Great for scarring.  AMAZING quality.</li>
            <li> I had heard beauty bloggers rave about cleansing with oil, but after a month I had breakouts and skin was irritated. I switched to konjac sponges, much better for my skin. Nothing wrong with the oil itself, just didn&#x27;t work on my face.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product. I put a few drops in my regular facial moisture cream.. It works wonders on any dry skin and keeps my healthy skin absolutely glowing!!  Highly recommended brand of organic rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I like the way the oil makes my skin so soft.  I believe it has reduced the appearance of lines around my eyes.  I use essential oils with the Rosehip such as: lemon, carrot seed, and frankincense.  Rosehip is aweson</li>
            <li> I starting using this product a few weeks ago.  I have already started seeing changes in my skin.  My dark spots are lighten up and my skin tone seems to look more smooth.  I&#x27;m so excited about the product !  I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next months.&lt;br /&gt;So grateful I found this awesome product. !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonnie</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Rosehip oil and I&#x27;m really loving it.  It absorbs into my skin without leaving it greasy. All you need is a drop or two so a little goes a long way.  It has an earthy smell but it is not unpleasant and the smell fades after a short time. I love the fact that it is 100% pure &amp; ECO Certified Organic.  Gives my face a rosy glow and I even used it to moisturize my hands.  Susan, the company&#x27;s co-founder is great.  She personally emails you to make sure you got the item and then follows up to see if you like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this rose hip oil from the voilave site to help with the eczema on my face. Nothing seems to work. Just a few days of using this rose hip oil and my itchy red eczema is gone! Amazing! I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! There are SO many ways that I have seen improvements in my skin in a very short amount of time! Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about a week or so. I have been religious with it though and use it once in the morning and once before bed.  I have even been mixing a very small amount in with my foundation and love the results.  My skin is glowing and my pores are visibly smaller.  I have used it on a few small scars and so far they seem to be a bit flatter and softer.  The smell is very mild. I know I have read some reviews stating the smell was similar to fish, but I just find it to be &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; and not offensive at all. It fades very quickly and is not overpowering.  I am hoping for continued good results from this product.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived very quick, was packaged very well and the oil smelled fresh and high quality. I noticed a difference in the first week I used it. I saw much less redness to my skin, less wrinkles and my skin looked well hydrated without being oily. I recommend it to all my friends who love it as well.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have only been using this product for a few days , so I can&#x27;t claim any miracle reduction in fine lines or scars ( yet) , but I CAN claim that this oil makes my skin as soft as a child&#x27;s. I have been using it on my face twice daily and I can&#x27;t get over how soft my 42 year old face feels- with zero oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;I had read reviews where people complained about the smell of rosehip oil, and while it doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34; good&amp;#34;  to me it is not off-putting or terribly pungent. Dont expect any aroma of roses- it is made from the seeds not the buds after all .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice since I received it. When I got it, the oil was an orangish color and had a natural smell to it. As I used this fresh out of the shower, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t take alot and my skin isn&#x27;t left lacking for moisturizer. I put it on with hyaluronic acid and walked out of the house. It didn&#x27;t drip or smear (like other oils I&#x27;ve used) and it was there until I got back home 5 hours later. My skin isn&#x27;t dry, unlike when I have used other moisturizers in the past. It is just a little oily but that makes it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way my skin feels</li>
            <li> This oil works very well mixed with coconut oil for overall body use. Feels very silky going on - happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any benefits or changes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when a friend recommended rosehip seed oil to me as a way to provide better moisturization for my skin without causing breakouts (I&#x27;m in my 30s).  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased to see that this oil, like jojoba, does not irritate my sensitive skin or clog my pores.  I use it at night instead of a commercial cream.  My skin seems to absorb it faster than jojoba and feel softer in the morning.  It also seems to be helping with residual acne scars, which is a nice plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little surprised by the scent, which is not like rose flowers or rosehip fruits.  Instead, it&#x27;s nut-like.  I&#x27;ve read that this is the mark of a good rosehip oil, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchases rose hip oil online, but I feel as though I was ripped off and returned the product after the first use.  Here&#x27;s why:  This product smells strongly of fish oil.  Pretty much identical to the bottle of Nordic Naturals I have in the fridge.  Supposedly this should dissipate within a few minutes of putting it on, but I was still catching a whiff of it hours later.  Very unpleasant.  I have purchased other rosehip seed oil, and while there is definitely an earthy scent to it, it has never smelled so strongly of fish.  The other problem is that rosehip oil should be dry, and absorb easily.  This product did not absorb well, and my skin still felt so oily 30-minutes after applying 2 drops that I had to wipe my face with tissue to remove some of it.  I feel like the product I received is either adulterated with other oils, or it&#x27;s old and rancid.  Really disappointed with this product, especially after seeing so many positive reviews.  I think I&#x27;ll stick with what I can get at the local co-op.</li>
            <li> Rosehip Oil is one of my favorite treatments for my skin and I love that this product is organic. A few drops leaves my face deeply moisturized with a nice glow. It leaves my skin feeling nourished and diminishes small lines and wrinkles.  I also enjoy this oil in the bath for all over body care, and have used it with success on my nails and cuticles. It is very nice!</li>
            <li> While none of the chemical products could do it, this product changed my skin and made it so much better. Love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I am enjoying it so far. I use it on my face at night(nothing else) and even after sleeping in an air conditioned room all night my skin still feels soft, dewy and smooth in the morning. The oil comes with a dropper so prevents waste. Goes right into the skin and no issues with coming off on pillows. No breakouts or any type of reaction. Nice earthy smell. Will continue to buy this product as long as it is being offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Truly wonderful, it really helps clear up blemishes, great antiinflammatory. It smells like fish oil because it has a lot of omegas in it but it&#x27;s so worth it and the smell dissipates quickly. I almost prefer it over my argan oil because I&#x27;ve seen such great results even overnight.</li>
            <li> I am on my 2nd bottle of this, it works wonderfully on my skin. It leaves my skin very well moisturized with out leaving it greasy. It works great on the chest area and is lightening the age spots on my hands. Works better than other products I&#x27;ve used that were much much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really gotten into the natural products and essential oils recently, as I&#x27;ve found they benefit my skin just as well, it not better, than expensive creams, and serums containing harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using rosehip oil for a while now and am stunned with it&#x27;s benefits! It works amazingly for fading scars or sun spots, and also helps fight wrinkles too! I tend to have super dry skin, and the moisturizing benefits of this rosehip oil is absolutely amazing! I use it on my face day and night, just a few drops, and my skin feels so much softer and supple. I also use this in my bath regularly, and emerge with the softest, smoothest skin! You can feel it softening up your skin right there in the bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil is also great for your nails and cuticles too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love my VoilaVe rosehip oil, and believe it&#x27;s benefits to the skin and body are nothing short of amazing! I believe everyone should have this on their bathroom counter, to help bring back that youthful glow to your skin, as well as give it the moisturizing, and anti-aging benefits it needs!</li>
            <li> Wow!  This oil really softened my rough, dry gardener&#x27;s hands - I highly recommend this for anyone with work-roughened hands - it&#x27;s THE BEST!!!!</li>
            <li> I had read of rosehip oil&#x27;s positive skin benefits and decided to try it out for myself. After reading many reviews for different rosehip oils on Amazon, trying to decide which to try out first, I finally settled on this brand. One of the top deciding factors was the fact that it has the official USDA organic label on the bottle, whereas other oils I considered claimed to be organic in their title and/or description, but produced no proof of it anywhere on the packaging or bottle. Another deciding factor was the fact it is cold pressed and has no other added oils or ingredients in it. I wanted to mix it myself with fractionated coconut oil and essential oils of my choice to use on my face and neck. Well, after trying my first bottle of this oil, the verdict is in, and I am very pleased with this product and how soft my skin feels after use. I keep the original bottle itself in the fridge for prolonged freshness and shelf life, and only use enough of it in a separate cobalt blue dropper bottle with my mix of added oils to keep on hand in my bedroom for use. I am now on my second bottle of this stuff. It seems like very good quality, works very well for me, and unless anything changes with this product, I think I will gladly continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lillia~ (Bob&#x27;s Wife)</li>
            <li> I received it and love LOVE the oil. I haven&#x27;t experienced an odor coming from it at all and enjoy the fact that it lasts all day. So far I have used twice a day...in the morning and evening and have noticed a slight change in my lines and texture of my facial skin. The lines in-between the eyebrows and the marionette lines at the side of my mouth don&#x27;t seem as predominant. I&#x27;m also using it on a skin color variation on my forehead where there is a darker patch to see if the oil will minimize it. I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, just a slight change for the areas that need work. So far under the eyes the circles seem to be faded but not by very much. The puffiness is there to stay. As for the overall feel on my skin...I absolutely love it. Soft and subtle with a new \\&quot;spring\\&quot; to it. So I will continue using it and see over a period of time, if the changes will be beneficial to continued use in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Again...Great GREAAAT product.</li>
            <li> I use this Organic rosehip Oil after I shower, and find it to be an excellent moisturizer for my psoriasis!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. No strong odors at all. Works well with other oils for my face. I use this to moisturize at night, absorbs very quickly without feeling greasy. Too soon to tell if it helps with my fine lines but so far happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> For a while I have been hearing about the amazing benefits of rosehip oil, but hesitated to try it on my sensitive, acne prone, unpredictably reactive skin. I stumbled upon this specific product, and after reading the description and seeing the price, I decided to give it a shot. So I ordered it and hoped for the best. Well, I can happily report that I was not disappointed. This stuff is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t cause any negative reactions whatsoever from my skin. In fact, it soothes my skin while at the same time hydrating it and creating the perfect base for my moisturizer. It soaks in almost instantly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy layer like some face oils. It even gives my skin a healthy subtle glow, which tells me that it is actually doing something good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of the amazing results I&#x27;ve seen thus far, I also had a very pleasant experience with VoilaVe&#x27;s customer service. They contacted me to follow up and make sure I was happy with the product, and when I emailed them with questions they responded almost instantly with a very kind and helpful response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the unbeatable price, awesome customer service, and instant benefits from using the product, this has certainly become a staple in my ever-changing beauty routine. If you are considering trying rosehip oil, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love it! Saw amazing results really fast. My skin was suffering of blotchy redness and it&#x27;s now smooth and seems to be one color. Only took about a month tops, but I saw results almost immediately.</li>
            <li> So this product is amazing! I have pretty bad excema, like knuckles bleed in the winter bad.  Even fragrance free, dye free, super strength lotion doesn&#x27;t keep my skin moisturized past one or two handwashings.  I was going to do a before and after photo, but remembered after I had already put some of this oil on.  So I figured at the end of the day my hands would be back to dry and I could do one then.  Nope.  My hands stayed moisturized for three days.  Today they are just barely dry.  Even my boyfriend noticed! That was with just one application!  You bet I&#x27;m going to keep using this!  It was a serious improvement and I am so glad I decided to try it!</li>
            <li> It was good, didn&#x27;t seem to be as good of quality as other rosehip oils I&#x27;ve used, but seemed ok</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! I saw a huge improvement in my developing fine lines &amp; wrinkles, hydration, and overall coloring/glow in just a week!! I have never seen such results before with other, well known natural products!! I think is is going to replace my other fancy anti-aging creams. I love the fact that it&#x27;s a pure and natural oil and that it&#x27;s organic and processed correctly (which makes all the difference). I am so excited to have found this Rosehip Oil. I&#x27;m a huge advocate in pure &amp; natural products and have taken the time to look into Rosehip oil and this oil by VoilaVe, and its all great. Plus great costumer service and the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one and only thing is its rich, earthy smell did take me a few days to get use to (which disappears after it soaks in, about 5 min.) now I kinda like it:) Other than that it&#x27;s just simply amazing!!!</li>
            <li> After researching for variety of rosehip oil, I decided to go with ViolaVe. First off, I did not smell anything from this oil as some reviewers mentioned. Second, this oil is very smooth and versatile. I use half/half of rosehip oil and Argan oil with a few drops of lavender essential oil to create my own nighttime moisturizer. This combination has been working great on my skin for the past week or so, and I plan to experiment on the quantity of oils and combination with other essential oils. The bottle is sure to last for a while and I know it serves many of my skin/hair care needs. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this oil did not absorb well.  The company owner actually emailed me!  Stellar customer service!  She suggested mixing one drop oil and one drop of water.  BINGO!  It has made a world of difference.  In the past couple of weeks, I have noticed scar tissue fading. Seriously?  This is amazing!  I should have taken before photos.</li>
            <li> Just started using it. Looking forward to experiencing &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; the wonderful things this product promises &amp;#34;?&amp;#34;. I started with my face.</li>
            <li> Great quality and quick results!! After the first night I woke up with glowing skin. After about a week my skin has cleared up and my skin has evened out. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Organic Rosehip Oil for over 6 months and love it.  I have rosacea and have had a lot of difficulty with products for the face.  Since using this product my face has been so much better.  I use Organic Rosehip Oil with Rose Petal Witch Hazel.  This really calms the redness on my face.  I plan to continue to use Organic Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> Best  organic rosehip oil I ever used.</li>
            <li> I heard on the Dr. Oz show that Rosehip oil was the best for your skin. I decided to give it a try. I did some research and found VoilaVe to be the perfect product to try. I have been very happy with the results. I use it at night and my skin feels so soft and bright in the morning. I would recommend this product to anyone who would like smoother softer skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use it as a face moisturizer.  It is one of the few oils that I can put on my face w/o breaking out.  Has a bit of an earthy smell that may be off putting for some, but I got used to it, and don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> Ever since starting rosehip oil into my twice daily skincare routine (am and pm), I am in love with my skin. At 34, I still suffer from the occasional hormonal breakout, and this oil helps to heal the skin but most importantly for me, fade the post pimple marks that before, stayed for weeks after a breakout. Use this in addition to a hylaronic acid, then a ceramide based moisturizer, give it 6 mths, and you&#x27;ll see that you&#x27;ve knocked years off of your face!!</li>
            <li> I love the product. It is organic, affordable and has none of the harmful chemicals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on my chest area, as it tends to get wrinkly and dry with the years. I am 38 and love to run on the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it after a hot shower, right before going to bed and I wake up to a moisturized decollete, there are no visible lines, like I used to have, especially in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that even though it is an oil, it does not leave you greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying it around my eyes next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I purchased the organic rosehip oil to try on a rash (dry and red) on my face.  The rash is now gone, and I continue to use the rosehip oil on the fine lines around my eyes.  I love that it&#x27;s organic, and not greasy.  I am very impressed with this product!  I like it much better than any eye cream I have ever tried.  It is nourishing, non-irritating, and doesn&#x27;t contain any chemicals.  I think I&#x27;m going to try using it on my nails next, as I see that is another use that is recommended.</li>
            <li> I have always had oily skin and hitting my 40’s it has been impossible to find a skin care regime, not more or less a moisturizer, that does not make me break out. After reading you guide I can understand why some of those expensive wonder products seemed to do the exact opposite, ( make my skin worse) due to their ingredients. Furthermore, I always had the impression since I was break out prone and my pores clog very easily, that I should always avoid any products with oil and use only oil free products.&lt;br /&gt;I admit, I was a little skeptical about trying the rose hip oil, especially since it is an oil. After reading the reviews and viewing a You Tube video on “Deep Pore Cleaning Treatment”. In this You Tube Vide Rose Hip Oil was highly recommended after the treatment to moisturize. Now after this deep pore cleansing Rose hip oil is a moisturizer, a moisturizer that will not clog your pores. So with that in mind, I figured I should try it. After using it for more than a week, I believe that I have now found my moisturizer, an oil believe it or not; and the best thing is that I know exactly what I am putting on my face you’re your guide, I also learned that it is good for hair. I regularly lighten my hair and spend quite a bit of money on all natural products to help keep it in condition. The problem is ( other than the $$$) that any leave in conditioner I use makes my scalp or forehead breakout. After having success with the rose hip oil as a facial moisturizer, I decided to use it sparingly (a little goes along way) on the ends of my hair . After a couple days of this routine with my hair, have noticed that I do not break out on my scalp or forehead and my hair is appears more manageable and feels great. I will continue this regime and will be anxious to see long term results. Thank you so much for this product. Not only is it a great product, but your service as a vendor is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;First, your product is genuine just as you describe.&lt;br /&gt;Second,your price is very reasonable and the best that I can see from my most recent research.&lt;br /&gt;Third, your guide “ Eight Secrets to Younger Looking skin” is not only a great marketing tool, but an excellent consumer educational brochure. Not only is it beneficial to for us as consumers to know the benefits and uses of your quality products, but it is also a extremely important to understand why all those other products never worked, and the problems and/or side effects they cause.</li>
            <li> I have been experiencing massive cystic acne breakout for the past few months leaving me with lots of scars on my face. I never had any acne problems as a teenager and had good skin.  I do not use makeup and was not very comfortable using chemicals. So I have been doing some research and decided upon the rosehip oil.  I just started using it from last week on my left side of the face since right side still has some active acne.  Its has only been few days but I think the scars are starting to fade.  I had very dark spots on my cheeks and now there are not as dark.  Overall I am liking the rosehip oil.  I depend on reviews from other users before buying any products on amazon.  So keeping that in mind, I will post an update after continuous use for a month.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moLRGVGO2KYJ4B]]I am using rosehip oil to treat a scar on my shin.  I read that Rosehip oil is commonly used for a variety of skin conditions such as dermatitis, acne and eczema, sun burnt skin and brittle nails.  The article also mentioned that rosehip oil is also used to heal scarring. The skin around my shin scar not only looks bad it is also more sensitive than other areas.  Using rosehip oil made the skin less sensitive and made it look slightly better, although so far (after 2 weeks of use) I cannot say it has diminished the scar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is practically unscented, it does not smell like rosehips. VoilaVe comes in a 1 oz bottle with a droplet applicator.  I use argan oil for my hair, and I have tried bottles with different applicators: spray bottles and bottle with droplets. I found bottle with droplet applicators are better for controlling the amount of oil I dispense.  So the droplet applicator on this bottle is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rosehip oil provided by VoilaVe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for scarring and while I believe it&#x27;s helping with that, it&#x27;s also causing a bit of breaking out so I won&#x27;t purchase again. I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s not dry or oil, just regular and I&#x27;ve used castor and almond oil on my skin as well as cocoa oil, avocado oil, vitamin e oil and tea tree oil but unfortunately, this one(which I really need) just doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin. It&#x27;s inexpensive so I recommend trying it. Different Strokes for different folks I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone else has an issue with rose hip oil breaking them out I hear tamanu and sea buckthorn oil can help with skin rejuvenation and evening skin tone like rose hip oil though they&#x27;re more expensive.</li>
            <li> This product has made my face so smooth! I use it every night and morning. I usually have oily face but this oil is so light! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product , even though I have oily skin I haven&#x27;t had any break out after using it. Absorbs quickly and perfect as a night serum .i wake up with this lovely glow . Definitely recommend it to anyone looking to prevent premature aging and saving their skin .</li>
            <li> Like the quality of the oil and the scent is not too strong (slightly nutty.) Have gotten compliments since I started using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Organic Rosehip Oil on some of my scars and noticing them getting smaller every day, as well as lightening up in color. I&#x27;ve also been using it on a recent sunburn, and it&#x27;s healed up my skin really quickly - so much so that the burn didn&#x27;t even hurt after one day! And another thing I just discovered was that this helped an itchy rash that I developed overnight on my arm -- I massaged a few drops of Rosehip Oil on the area and the itch is gone and redness is fading. I&#x27;m very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the hydration this oil gives, without the greasy residue. I use it on my neck and chest for anti-aging too, but haven&#x27;t yet tried it on my face. After seeing the great results I&#x27;ve gotten on the rest of my body though, my face is next!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service and the oil feels exceptional when rubbed (gently) on my face. Rosehip oil is the way to go, folks. And this company seems to offer excellent products as well as fantastic customer correspondence. I&#x27;ll definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to incorporate more natural and organic products into my skincare routine.  I saw an interview with Miranda Kerr, and she swears by rose hip oil as a part of her beauty routine.  Who doesn&#x27;t want to look like a Victoria Secret Model? I bought my bottle last week and have been using it everyday night for 5 days now. Honestly....I&#x27;m obsessed. I&#x27;m 37 years old and for years I had been battling my oily/acne prone skin( pores clog easily even with &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; products). Due to the constant usage of acne medication and cleansers because of the mild adult acne I had been dealing with, my skin was always unbalance in terms of oil control. I was dealing with excess oil production on my cheeks and forehead on top of having extremely dry patches on my chin, around my eyes and nose. Due to the dryness, I noticed fine lines around my eyes starting to form. Frustration took over and I started looking into heavier night creams to bring back moisture into my skin. But everything I bought always clogged my pores. I tried all the sensitive skin/ oil-free versions of top brand names as well as drugstore alternatives but nothing helped. EVERYTHING CLOGGED MY PORES causing small pimples to always form. Being on anti acne meds and products helped maintain the clogged pores situation but I felt like I was in a vicious cycle of drying out my face and clogging my pores with the moisturizers I&#x27;d use to combat the dryness. Then I discovered the benefits of facial oils through some research and have never looked back since! I&#x27;m still using my acne system but instead of moisturizers, I&#x27;ll apply rosehip oil to my face after as my nightly moisturizer and when I wake up in the morning my skin looks so soft and smooth. This oil doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, helps with my natural oil production of my skin( i don&#x27;t look like a grease ball in the morning anymore), makes my skin so soft and ready for makeup and on top of that, I&#x27;ve noticed my old acne scars fading! My skin is loving this stuff. I&#x27;m addicted and I&#x27;m kicking myself for not having discovered this sooner. I have already noticed I am using less concealer for the dark marks left behind by acne.  I am hoping to get rid of it all together!!  I also love that it is an oil, but doesn&#x27;t leave that awful greasy sheen.  I have heard of other people saying that it smells bad.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like roses, but it is not an offensive smell at all and I don&#x27;t notice any smell at all once it has soaked in.</li>

I have been hearing about the amazing benefits of rosehip oil, but hesitated to try it on my sensitive, acne prone, unpredictably reactive skin. I stumbled upon this specific product, and after reading the description and seeing the price, I decided to give it a shot. So I ordered it and hoped for the best. Well, I can happily report that I was not disappointed. This stuff is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t cause any negative reactions whatsoever from my skin. In fact, it soothes my skin while at the same time hydrating it and creating the perfect base for my moisturizer. It soaks in almost instantly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy layer like some face oils. It even gives my skin a healthy subtle glow, which tells me that it is actually doing something good for my skin.This light-bodied oil disappears like water on my aged skin. The results were almost immediately soothing and smoothing. Plus, it has imparted a more even rosy tone which de-accentuates the patches of redness and even the appearance of the fine blood vessels near the skin surface around nose and cheeks.I have put rose hip oil in conditioner and it improves the appearance of my hair by making it more lustrous and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my bottle last week and have been using it everyday night for 5 days now.

            <li> VERY USEFUL, EXCELLENT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the rosehip oil and this seems like a high quality brand. I am allergic to soy and because tocopherol/vitamin e can be soy based I have a hard time with any formulations of serums or moisturizers. The pure rosehip oil is a great single ingredient option and I have already noticed my face looking and feeling better. I use a few drops alone or with a drop of carrot seed oil before my moisturizer (Christina Moss Naturals which is also really great). I also appreciate the follow up from the seller to make sure I was happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great oil to be used on hair, body and skin. Can be mixed with your current moisturizer or just applied alone. It is very nourishing to skin and definitely helps combat the dryness and uneveness. Great results thus far.</li>
            <li> My coworker suggested I order this product after I commented on how clear her skin looked. I have only been using the organic rosehip oil  a week and my skin looks and feels softer.  Now I am the one getting comments on my skin. Great product!</li>
            <li> Got it for my friend, she use this rosehip oil along with teatree oil for her face and she loves it. Help reduce her acnes</li>
            <li> I found this lovely oil and am using it for a variety of uses. I do garden and this time of year my nails are a mess. This oil on my hands and cuticles softens and returns them to &amp;#34;pre garden&amp;#34; state. Love it. I have also started mixing this oil with avocado to use on my hair and face. Great results. Give it a try..you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about one month and I really love it. I have really sensitive skin and Rosacea and I have noticed a difference in the reduction of redness in my skin and less blotchy. This product does not break out my skin and isn&#x27;t greasy. You only need a couple of drops for your skin and is very moisturizing. My skin glows. I am particular about what I put on my skin and the fact that it&#x27;s organic is important to me. Great value and product.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT AS A MOISTURIZER ONLY!  I&#x27;ve used this product for approximately a month and find the smell is not strong or rank which is good, it absorbs quickly, and does leave my face feeling soft. It does not clog my pores or irritate my sensitive skin. That being said, no difference as far as hyper pigmentation, fine lines, or any thing else this product claims to do- slight or otherwise. Great for moisture.That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I was using another brand of rose hip oil until it ran out - it worked well but I was looking for a superior brand that was pure and organic. I started using VoilaVe last week and I&#x27;m loving it so far - using it for everything from the patch of eczema on my elbow to my toddlers knee scars from falling. Even using a bit under my eye area and I mix it into my cerave nightly moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it&#x27;s made in the scarring and skin discoloration in just a week! It&#x27;s gentile enough to use on my toddler so I know it&#x27;s pure. It keeps my itching at bay and my face is already starting to look brighter. Love love love!</li>
            <li> I use Rosehip Oil from my local health food store and it is very moisturizing and works well to remove makeup and as a carrier oil for other products.  I saw this product on Amazon and decided to try it.  I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is with this product compared to the product I buy locally but this oil makes my eyes water.  Even when I don&#x27;t use it around my eyes but just on the rest of my face - my eyes will water.  I must be allergic to something in this particular brand.  So I&#x27;ll stick with the local brand as it works with no adverse reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller of this product has a great response and personally contacted me with e-mail - not a form e-mail but specific to me.  This was a nice touch.  I would purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> Never reviewed anything before. But I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff in combination with the Triple Action Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I bought this this to try to fade some very visible scars on my hands left from a dermatologist treatment.  It helped the scars fade in a short. time.  I am not a very consistent user (used 1-2 times a week) so was very happy that it had helped so well.  You just put a few drops on and rub it in.  I plan to try it on some age spots next and see how well it works.  I gave it 4 stars only because it is a little greasy feeling for about 30 minutes after it is put on.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell..an using it on recent burn scars</li>
            <li> Love the rosehip oil;-)</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and I am extremely pleased.  I am impressed with the fact the oil is certifed organic and cold pressed.  The delivery was fast and I will be ordering this product again.  I absolutely recommend this rosehip oil - you will not be disappointed.  Try it!!!</li>
            <li> T7his is the best on the market..my face loves it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me, and I think it might have made me break out. I used it on my skin along with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about two months. I bought it to help with the appearance of scars that were left behind from acne. I can truly say my acne scars are almost completely gone and what&#x27;s left is hardly noticeable honestly please give this product a try you&#x27;ll never regret it</li>
            <li> I saw this in Urbanette Magazine&#x27;s beauty section and bought it. It&#x27;s important to buy oils in dark glass with glass droppers because plastic adds cancer-causing toxins to oils, and UV light causes the oils to create free-radicals, which ages your skin. Keep this somewhere dark, even though it&#x27;s in dark glass.</li>
            <li> I love this Rose hip oil for many things its great to put on discolorations when you want to use something more natural and non irritating to skin. it great to use for so many things and is a more natural approach to skin and nail care. if you have sensitive skin but still want something to diminish age spots or scaring I hope you give this one a try its very pure and thats what you want in a rose hip oil .&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to try in order to make an informed review for my blog and amazon but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> I think its average. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes in my skin. It does however make my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  What an incredible find!  It feels so light going on and absorbs quickly, making my skin feel so smooth and moisturized.  I can&#x27;t believe I wasted hundreds and hundreds of dollars on expensive, useless products while slathering toxins on my face for years when I could have been using this wonderful gem.  My sister is hooked now as well, she has (well, HAD oily skin - we both switched to the OCM so bye-bye oily for her and bye-bye dry flakey/oily for me!) and lives in very humid Florida and this still totally works for her.  I will recommend this to anyone and everyone who will listen.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> i purchased this item to use for eczema around my eyes. (which turned out to be a fungal infection) but in the process i discovered how great this product is.  i will be ordering this again.  it&#x27;s great on the face!</li>
            <li> Very lubricating to skin.  Not using it that long to know if it&#x27;s good for my skin.</li>
            <li> works wonderful. Especially good on your neck and décolleté area. I use with a little avocado oil which is high in vitamin E and great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using it and i feel my skin more hydrated and softer. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a month now and haven&#x27;t seen any change. Have no clue how long one should be using before any results can be seen. I&#x27;m totally fed up waiting to see any change. Maybe my spots and blemishes are too deep seated...ah don&#x27;t know!!!  Smells a bit fishy at first but goes away shortly after or I got accustomed to the smell...maybe...ah don&#x27;t know.  However, it keeps your hands feeling very soft and moisturized. You should absolutely try it, especially if your fine lines and blemishes are fresh.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to diminish sun spots from my skin using it several weeks now a little fading but the spots are still visible.</li>
            <li> Love this oil its the absolute best,</li>
            <li> I used for my face because is good for acne.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face morning and night.  It has a light scent that disappears, and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film or shiny appearance as it soaks in nicely.  It also doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out as most commercial moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  My favorite part about this Organic Rosehip Oil is that can be used for skin AND hair!  I have acne scars and I had to find something that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin super oily, yet do its job (which has been extremely difficult to find in my years of dealing with acne).  This Rosehip Oil felt great and I notice my complexion getting better every day.  I also use this on my hair and I have noticed my hair to look/feel more moisturized and healthy than ever before!</li>
            <li> I am almost 60 (another few months) and have decided to stop using harsh chemicals.  I started using this product only a few days ago, so can not attest to its long-term effects, but it immediately made my fine lines look softer and my face feels great.  It comes with a nice dropper so I don&#x27;t feel like I am wasting any of the product.  It is ok to use from the bottle, which is nice.  I have been mixing essential oils with avocado oil.  I will continue to use that mixture for my body, but for the face the rose hip oil is perfect!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! A wonderful natural source of vitamin A and C, and organic, too. I am very pleased with this purchase and the fast shipping. I appreciate the knowledge and tips shared by the owner/seller. Will definitely buy from this company again. PS  Voilave&#x27;s Vitamin C serum is the best!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product as doctor Oz recommended it for scars. I love it so far. I started to notice it has diminished some of my stretch marks and as a bonus it has helped me with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Voilave were great. They responded to my emails and I even get free samples. As far as the product go, I would recommend it to others. The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant. I have not used it for long but I can see slight differences. I actually am using this to help the appearance of stretch marks. I would say I need to use at least two more bottles before I would see results. I am not expecting overnight results, that is why I say I would use at least two more bottles of this.</li>
            <li> First time trying Rosehip Oil after being recommended by a friend. This item was on time, as described &amp; even came with a little info on how to use it which is something I needed being a first time user. Oh &amp; I forgot to mention this seller has great customer service. They kept in contact with me from the time item was shipped &amp; even after to see had I got item &amp; etc. I will be using this seller again &amp; ordering more of this product. Only used it a couple times so far but I can tell a difference already.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was afraid to order rosehip oil based on the &amp;#34;fish oil&amp;#34; smell, but decided to try it anyway.  Other reviews did not think it smelled.  The seller has stated that rose petals give the rose smell and the hips do not have a rose smell.  I believe the seller is correct so I was not expecting a rose smell.  It really doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell and the smell does not last long.  It is light and makes my skin feel soft.  I really like it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Use sparingly.  Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this product I use it for roseasia. It works better than the prescription medicine.  But it also had improved my complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  It makes my skin feel much smoother and softer.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> A little known secret that gives a strong punch in small bottle. This is now a permanent part of my facial care regiment!</li>
            <li> I love using the oil as eye serum every night.  It is light and does not have strong fragrance. I feel my skin gets dewy and soft after each application.  A couple of drops goes a long way and the price is very reasonable.  Definitely will keep using it as my beauty routine!</li>
            <li> Wow, I am somewhat of a skeptic, but after trying this oil I know BELIEVE! This oil worked wonder&#x27;s on my nails which are normally brittle and constantly peel and break. After using this oil for about a week, they became super strong and just started growing like crazy. I am needing to file down at least once a week. I have also applied it to my face and neck for extra moisture and nourishment. I highly recommend this stuff, it&#x27;s simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I just received this product 2 days ago but I love it.  You really only need a few drops to see results.  Your skin will feel so soft and it transforms your skin.  I had an allergic reaction to some products so my skin was pretty broken out and after just two days I can see the healing taking place.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell because it goes away quickly but if you really don&#x27;t like it, then just add a few drops of your favorite skin loving essential oils such as rose, lavender, helichrysum, neroli and you will have a really amazing anti-aging skin product.  I would buy this product again.  I also rubbed my hair with a little rosehip oil, as I have dry hair - and it helps a lot.  You will do a happy dance if you buy this product.</li>
            <li> I use this as moisturizer during winter months. I massage it onto my skin as the last step of my skin care regime as it is more occlusive. On drier days, I mix 2 parts serum and 1 part oil to help it absorb more easily. It does not produce adverse effect when combined with my other face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh rosehip oil has a nice earthy and herbaceous smell.&lt;br /&gt;It has a short shelf life and goes rancid in a few months after opening.&lt;br /&gt;Keep it in a fridge to prevent the fishy rancid smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal-dry skin, then I think you would benefit most from adding rosehip oil to your routine.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this company and their products. I have written other reviews on some of their other products as well. I use this product along with Argan oil and Hyaluronic acid serum, but can be used alone. I started at first using this by itself and started seeing great improvident on my skin. I suffer from adult acne and have scars. This has not caused me to break out at all, I have very sensitive skin. It starts out feeling oily then it just gets absorbed so well it feels like you never put anything on your face. You don&#x27;t need but 2 drops at the most. I use this product first and then use the rest of my other products by Epionce and it works well.</li>
            <li> …if i could.  as far as i can determine the product works as designed and described.  i am very happy with the product.  but the exceptional part of this transaction was the follow up by the vendor.  i got a very pleasant thank you for purchasing, but more importantly, so very generous helpful guidelines, suggestions, hints for using the product, all this  before  the package even arrived.  i got an invitation to contact the seller if i had any questions, and a boost of confidence that i would not only be happy with the product, but with vendor support.&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the trick. Wish it smelt better but the hips don&#x27;t smell of roses and for the cost, very happy with product. You pay so much more for rose oil but it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, best of any others I&#x27;ve bought.  I mix it in with my Derma e facial moisturizer and it makes the cream seem &#x27;fluffy&#x27; and easier to go on with no greasiness whatsoever.  I also use the oil straight from the bottle on the lower parts of my legs that tend to get very dry and scaly and I find it works really good in that regard.  It does not leave a greasy film, it penetrates quickly leaving no residue.  I especially like that.</li>
            <li> I have used this every night for a few weeks now. I feel like it really sinks into my normal/dry skin on my neck and face and back of hands. I don&#x27;t notice much fragrance at all. I think it is helping with my fine lines, but maybe I will update later when I&#x27;ve used it for a longer period of time.  Update: It&#x27;s been several months since I&#x27;ve first starting using the oil on my face, usually at night. It is doing a great job moisturizing and helping to minimize facial lines.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s wonderful and i highly recommend it for nightly use.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t describe how good it is! This product is very brightening, and nurishing! The first time I used it, I was really surprised! I looked so healthy after the next morning! Like other buyers said, it smells like fish oil, but it makes you beautiful and you gonna wash it next day, so I can take that! Since its oil, I need to finish it within three months so I use it on my face every evening and some times on my body after shower. Very great product!</li>
            <li> If I could only have one skin care product, it would be VoillaVe Organic Rosehip Oil. I have experienced amazing results!</li>
            <li> its ok but not to impressed with it</li>
            <li> Has a very earthy smell to it. I personally like the smell. Its not over powering. I use it as part of my night time moisturizing oil concoction with some lavender EO. So far its working well for me.</li>
            <li> Fantastic oil.  I have been using various argon oils for a while, and had rosehip oil recommended to me.  Fantastic recommendation.  Extremely hydrating and has left my skin glowing!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I have only been using the oil for a few days, but so far I am enjoying the soft, yet non-oily feeling it leaves on my hands and face. I have some dry patches on my hands from past scarring, and it seems to be softening those areas already and the redness is fading. I use it on my face each night after oil washing with Tamanu Oil and toning my skin with a homemade toner of purified water and essential oils specified for aging skin. The Rosehip oil blends in easily and leaves no oily residue after allowing a few minutes for it to soak in completely. I believe using less is better than using too much. I&#x27;m trying to protect my 60+ skin that so far has no noticeable wrinkling and use natural products as much as possible. I have no problem with the slightly earthy scent. I will most certainly reorder!</li>
            <li> I love using this product.  I dab a little under my eyes, I mix with the Voila Ve Hyaluronic Acid Serum and put it all over my face and neck.  I also mix this with other oils and use it for my hair.  It makes my skin feel very soft.  It also absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.  I still haven&#x27;t run out of the smaller bottle even though I use it often.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> To clarify -- I like the product. It came on time, as advertised, it smelled amazing, felt amazing. I just happened to discover I&#x27;m allergic apparently to this stuff. This does not depreciate the value of the product at all, and returning it was a breeze thanks to amazon. It did smell and feel amazing, and anyone who can tolerate it you&#x27;re lucky!</li>
            <li> After reading a couple articles on how rosehip oil can help repair sun damaged skin and scars from sunburn, I decided to give it a try. I wanted to make sure that I got organic and cold-pressed oil so the rosehip wouldn’t lose any of its health benefits, and so far I have been extremely happy VoilaVe’s oil. I started using it right away, and while it does smell a little earthy, the smell goes away quickly even when I rub it on my face. I started using it as my main face moisturizer, and my skin hasn’t looked better! My sunburn scars seem like they’re doing better, but I know it’ll take awhile for them to recover completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll definitely keep using this oil as my face moisturizer in addition to spot repair on my skin. Great product!</li>
            <li> This seems to be little heavy for the very sensitive skin on my face, but it works beautifully as an eye serum for reducing (the beginnings of) fine lines around my eyes. I also started to use it as a spot treatment on red marks leftover from acne (not indented scarring - just red marks) because I have heard about the great regenerating properties of rosehip seed oil. Great nourishing oil to add to homemade face serums as well! VoilaVe also has fantastic customer service - would highly recommend ordering from them.</li>
            <li> I started using this a couple of weeks ago on my fine lines around my eyes and I have seen remarkable results already.  I will definitely keep using this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this rosehip oil with the intent to even out my complexion (ethnic skin with a little variation in color) and help my skin retain moisture.  I am in my late twenties so I do not have any visible signs of aging, yet- and I would like to keep it that way!  I use this as a serum under moisturizer at night.  I literally use two or three droplets and massage into my face and neck.  It smoothes into skin very easily without leaving any oily residue.  I have noticed that a little hyperpigmentation in my neck has faded as well as an old chicken pox scar has faded as well.  I also add a little to my body lotion and it gives me a glowing complexion.  I will definitely purchase this again, and again, and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, for those expecting a &amp;#34;rosy scent&amp;#34;, this is not it.  This is not an essential oil, which are oils used for their aromas and perfumes.  This is a healing oil.  It has an earthy smell, which may take some getting used to, but it&#x27;s not a lingering smell.  Overall, I am thrilled to add this product to my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> I got this from the original VoilaVe website, and I have to say it is amazing!  This is even more moisturizing than the argan oil I bought.  I use the argan oil on my face, neck, and decollate.  I use the rosehip oil on the very dry patches of skin on my face like around my mouth.  I always have problems with dry skin, even in the summer time.  This has helped more than anything I have tried.  It is definitely worth the money.  I have extremely dry, acne prone, sensitive skin.  This does not break me out and helps so much.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Oh MY!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT STUFF!&lt;br /&gt;Your skin will THANK YOU!!&lt;br /&gt;Very much worth it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this looking for a natural alternative for my acne prone, scarred face. It had great reviews so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one day, my pores were smaller and skin smoother. After days, my acne was gone. I did have a cystic pimple on my hairline so I applied some of the oil on it that night- and the next day it was gone.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it all over my body as a lotion and it makes my skin glowing and smooth. Even most of my arm bumpies (Keratosis Pilaris) are cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;I did a hair mask and after washing it out and letting it dry, my hair was more vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall? I run out SO fast because I love it so much and it&#x27;s expensive. May look for a lotion alternative.</li>
            <li> There are many uses for this oil and I think that is why I love it so much. Rosehip oil is great for acne, dark circles under my eyes, clearing up my scars, reducing my facial greasiness, eczema, dry skin, brittle nails, fixing my dry and damage hair. It does almost anything you can think of. It does have a slight odor to it but not near as strong as some of the other oils I have tried. The oil comes in a glass amber jar to help extend the life of the oil. I love that it is 100% organic because I can trust that there is no hidden chemicals that I may be applying on my skin. The oil is so safe I can use it on a newborn baby or on my ailing grandmother. The oil is very lightweight and non-greasy. This gives me the ability to use it daily without breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

            <li> Still have to wait and see</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness!  I love this oil.  I have NEVER and I mean NEVER put oil on my face, but I thought I would give it a try since hearing that it was so good for your skin.  My skin is red and has an uneven tone.  After one month of use, my pores are much smaller, the redness is much better, and I definitely have a glow to my skin.  A great extra benefit is that I got an email immediately from the company thanking me for purchasing it and to call if I had any questions about the product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best brand of Roseship  oil you can buy. The customer service is also great they will email you to find out if your happy with your purchase, something that&#x27;s rare nowadays if I could give the 10 stars I would. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have 2 scars, one on my ankle and one on my face. The one on my ankle I didn&#x27;t treat to prevent scarring. The one on my face, is about gone. So faded and it&#x27;s been months and months but you can&#x27;t even see it anymore unless you look for it. This is also a fine oil to use for the oil cleansing method, which  has done wonders for my cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the rosehip oil it leaves my skin soft and feels plump.</li>
            <li> My skin can be very dry and prone to eczema flare-ups. It tends to get flaky and holds zero moisture. After using this for about two weeks, I noticed my skin was rapidly improving. Now after four months,  it is almost flake free and doesn&#x27;t hardly ever feel super dry. I use it as my moisturizer and wear it under my makeup. Keeps me feeling hydrated and beautiful. I LOVE this and am so glad I found it!!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  I use it to make my own hand creams.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this amazing oil anymore!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty product. I recently ran out of it and have noticed a significant difference in the texture of my skin. I will make sure I do not run out of it again! I use rosehip oil after washing my face. I use a small amount and prefer to leave my face a little damp to help spread the oil around my face. It definitely helps to regulate the oils in my skin and helps to keep my skin from getting dry. I used to have acne prone skin when I was younger and then into adulthood. Since using rosehip oil I find that I have much less acne and my skin just looks much better overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the rosehip oil from VoilaVe. The first time I bought rosehip oil was from Whole Foods and I could not find a pure oil, only one mixed with Vitamin E. The pure rosehip oil from ViolaVe is much better.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 6 months now. I apply it at night and in the AM. It has a nice silky feel. Goes on smooth and does not feel oily. Makes my skin feel soft all day.</li>
            <li> good moisture...smells ok...</li>
            <li> I use the rosehip oil as a toner and lotion for my facial skin. My skin feels softer and my blemishes have diminished using this oil. My complexion and tone have improved to the point where I don&#x27;t need to wear any foundation, just sunscreen.  I will definitely continue using this oil.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product quality..I used this as a daily  face moisturizer both morning and nite.  The oil is lightweight and&lt;br /&gt;did not leave a greasy feel on my face. I am very happy with the result. I am going to continue using this product without a doubt.</li>
            <li> I heard that this oil is a wonderful product for your skin. Unfortunately it did nothing for me. I used it daily for weeks with no result whatsoever. It leaves an oily film. I wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> This product was great. It probably would have healed my skin completely but I found that I had an ALLERGY to the liquid makeup(the sun screen in it!) that I was using! Skin clear now.</li>
            <li> Works great, my skin cleared up and is softer.  So glad I tried it!  I forgot to mention that shipping was very fast, I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazed by this oil!!</li>
            <li> For those unfamiliar with rosehip oil, they’re extracted from the seeds of a specific variety of roses, and they’re full of several fatty acids, vitamins E, C, and A. Some of its benefits include anti-aging effects, serving as moisturizer and as a scar treatment when applied externally. You probably could’ve looked all of that up, so the rest of this review is going to focus more on this specific VoilaVe Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a 4oz bottle, this is the standard price. It might seem a bit pricey, but 4oz can last an incredibly long time as you only need several drops each time. I like to apply it to my face after using a toner, and it’s been great for my skin. It works well when combined with a serum like hyaluronic acid too. A lot of my previous acne scars have faded as a result and it’s been great as a moisturizer, keeping my skin nice and smooth despite the winter dryness. If you’ve never used Rosehip oil before, I would definitely recommend it, as it does do great things for the skin (sometimes unexpected!). It does feel weird putting oil on your skin if you’ve never done it before, but it doesn’t clog up pores or anything. I’ve never had a breakout as a result of this.I’ve tried several brands of Rosehip oil, and quality wise, they’re pretty similar. This one isn’t much different from the rest, but that should be a good thing, as most of the rosehip oil I’ve used from  Amazon are pretty good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an excellent quality bottle of rosehip oil at a reasonable price (for the 4oz size anyways). I’d definitely recommend it for those looking for something different for their skin. I don’t know if I can guarantee 100% that it’ll do wonders for you since everyone’s skin is different, but it’s definitely benefitted me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to leave questions and comments below!

            <li> HIgh quality organic rosehip oil has been in my sights since I neared forty and started becoming aware of my slowly aging skin. Though I do not have many wrinkles, I do feel like this organic oil helps me fight the fine lines that come with turning 40 and aging. I will try everything to fight it, and this light pure oil is a natural and healthy way to moisturize my dry skin, nails and hair. I love it, and feel great using something without all those crazy additives. High quality and a lovely dropper too. (I received a bottle for the purpose of this review)</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t too great. it&#x27;s very moisturizing, but it made me breakout!!</li>
            <li> It is SO soothing on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I really like it. I even mixed in drops with my face cream.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> This is awesome, it does exactly what it says it does. This works much better than other items I have tried before. I really recommend!</li>
            <li> ok i&#x27;m rewriting my review. originally i gave it four stars because i thought it gave me a rash. the seller is good and the quality of the oil is good. the rash turned out to be perioral dermatitis. i think using this oil may have triggered it but certainly did not cause it. i use dandruff shampoo to wash my face now and the rash is under control. i will order this product again sometime in the future to give it another try for my sun damage now that i know it didn&#x27;t cause my rash.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell of Rosehip Oil, I like to use it since it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rosehip Oil might sound like it smells nice because of the word ROSE, but it actually smells nutty/fishy. It&#x27;s a subtle scent which goes away after a few minutes of application so for me, it&#x27;s tolerable. In fact, it&#x27;s supposed to smell that way since it&#x27;s unrefined and pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my elbows and knees and it made them feel softer instantly. It does feel greasy on the initial application but after a few minutes, the greasy feeling goes away. It is quickly absorbed (just a few minutes) and as I&#x27;ve said, the greasy feeling and scent fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on my hair since my hair is dry and always frizzy. It helps make my hair look flat and shinier. Just 2 drops is enough for my hair because using too much would exaggerate the effect and would make my hair look unwashed and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on my hands since they&#x27;re a bit dry due to washing the dishes multiple times a day. The Rosehip Oil instantly moisturizes my hands and just 1 drop does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using the Rosehip Oil since it works, it&#x27;s more natural and a bottle would last for a long time since I only need a few drops every application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;ve received a sample in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and was hoping for a good quality oil. It&#x27;s okay but I&#x27;m not going to buy it again. Doesn&#x27;t give me the results I need.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.. I don&#x27;t notice a smell and absorbs right away. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  II have only had it a short time and I will admit I need to read up on all it can do but I see a difference with my nails and cuticles and that is huge in my book.  They were so dry from this cold winter.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic. my skin gets quite dry in the winter months. i&#x27;ve started using this instead of a day moisturizer, and my skin has never felt better. just a few drops every morning and i have no dry, flaky skin whatsoever. the skin absorbs it very quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face look &#x27;oily&#x27; like some other oils i&#x27;ve used. love it and highly recommend giving it a try! (this is the only brand i&#x27;ve used, so i can&#x27;t speak to the difference between this and any other brand.)</li>
            <li> EXcellent product. Feels really natural, smells terrifyc, but really works</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Noticeable results in short amount of time!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  Organic, Cold Pressed and 100% pure so you can feel safe using this on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this</li>
            <li> Does what I ordered it for.</li>
            <li> seems to be a very good product</li>
            <li> I only cant say I hate it because I was ignorant enough to not know. I sourced other &amp;#34;organic rosehip&amp;#34; and the quality of this was no where near it, since have done this with two other suppliers and I honesty do not believe its true 100% pure.</li>
            <li> Love this item! I mix it with my day cream and night cream, I think it evens my skin tone, make my face look brighter, and the wrinkles are not that noticeable. Although I&#x27;m only 25 but those wrinkles are started to show, this product is really a good item for daily use, and it really moisture my skin for a long time! It&#x27;s the best find for me since I use expensive stuffs such as Estee Lauder, Lancome, sometimes I use H2O+ for extra moisture but this oil is a good substitute for some of the items I used before and saves me a lot of money!</li>
            <li> Great remedy for dry skin!</li>
            <li> Great product... as a person w/very dry, sensitive skin who is also a sufferer of Eczema; I was very pleased.  It made my skin very soft but make sure your hair is off your face as it did make my bangs greasy.</li>
            <li> 8/29/2015  I have purchased second bottle and here&#x27;s an update.  The last bottle had a strong smell like fish oil smell but this time it didn&#x27;t have the strong smell. It was instead &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell as many people call it.  The color is very rich and I can tell this is a very high quality rosehip oil than other brands.  This bottle is more expensive than other brands but I think it worth it.  Oct 2014 I have used 4 different Rosehip Oil so far and this one had the strongest smell - which is like fish oil smell.  But I kept using hoping that this has a good result on my skin and it did.  I think this product gave me the best result among the 4 oils I used.  I feel like this one is more &amp;#34;condensed&amp;#34; than other products.  The color was very orange and I can tell that the quality was good.  I am now done shopping around for Rosehip oil and I will come back to purchase this one again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically give feedback or write reviews but I just had to with this product. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little under a week and the changes I see in my skin, in that short period of time, is amazing. My fine lines are less visible, my skin tone is more even and much brighter, and my pores seem to be smaller too. I was having a minor breakout due to stress lately, which was my main reason for ordering this, and that has practically cleared up as well. I haven&#x27;t used my liquid foundation in days. Great customer service too.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great item!</li>
            <li> Great product for an excellent price. Very fast delivery</li>
            <li> So far so GREAT! My skin seams very radiant. Remember this is natural, it has an earthy smell but it goes away and well worth it for the benefits. Great shipping and customer service!!!</li>
            <li> I use this morning and night to help keep me skin supple and nourished.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!!  Love, love. love it!!&lt;br /&gt;VoliaVe is also a great company.  Always checking up to see how you are liking the product.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I really like this Rosehip oil. It minimizes scarring and evens my skin tone. However, I have to use it sparingly because it does cause tiny pimples on my acne prone skin. If you have acne only use a drop or two.</li>
            <li> i use this oil for my hair .. i  can see the result within aweek . really i am amazed</li>
            <li> the smell is pretty bad....</li>
            <li> Truly I&#x27;ve been using this oil since the 12 of  dec great oil not oily those not smell to strong nothing bad love this product relieved before time. Was looking forward to useing  this oil and defenetly will buy again thank you amozan for making this available. Will update in. Later day.</li>
            <li> The oil provides great moisturization, but after continuously breaking out after application, I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> Love this oil love the reaults in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Organic Roaehip Oil for a year and recently ordered my second bottle . I use it as a moisturizer and love how it works under makeup.</li>
            <li> I love Rosehip Oil.  I use it morning and night.  I put it on immediately after cleansing and before I use moisturizer.  My skin is softer, and lines are less visible.  I will reorder and reorder this product.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.  Very moisturizing and healing.  It has a funky smell when it first goes on, but that disappears quickly.  I am sold!</li>
            <li> The order arrived quickly! It had a heavy fish smell so I will be returning it. I used other brands and it didn&#x27;t smell like that.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent, it met all the expectations. It takes care of dry skin better than any lotion out there. Kids lked it and asked for more when needed. It is good that the company informed us there will be no rosy smell so I was not surprised. It smells like oil, and it goes away quick and the skin appretiated it.</li>
            <li> Love it put some in face moisturizer OMG very satisfied, noticed how extra soft, smooth my face is.  Using it on my hands and noticing the fine are really becoming smoother or should I say they are gradually disappearing.   I realize what works for one person may not necessarily  work the same on someone else, just saying this stuff is AWESOME, started using on my hair.  Will update.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this. wanted to use it on my face more than anything. I am 26 Latina with extremely sensitive combo skin, also suffer from Seborrheic dermatitis and some moderate breakouts as of lately and uneven skin. when i received product it smelled like fish - I&#x27;m not sure if it is suppose to smell like that since its something very far away from a fish!. any-who, i started to use it on my face and it actually felt good, but unfortunately did not see any mayor changes other than more breakouts :( so I stopped using it on my face (the smell thing really threw me off to be honest) and I&#x27;m using it on my stretch marks for now hoping it works. NOTE this NEEDS TO BE KEPT IN THE FRIDGE! I really do hope I didn&#x27;t get a rancid oil though&lt;br /&gt;been using this for about a month now</li>
            <li> It took a while for me to actually see the results of using the ViolaVe Organic Rosehip Oil. I have Mediterranean skin -healthy, but with the windy and cold weather of fall and swing-shift work, my skin needed almost a miracle to recover. For the first week, no positive results, the oil penetrated the skin, quickly and still felt dry and dull. I started using it twice daily, after face cleaning with organic products. After two weeks of treatment, my skin gained a good amount of moisture. Of course, the skin needs inside and outside care to keep it healthy. There&#x27;s no product to blame if we do not feed our bodies correctly. In my case, the weather ruins my skin badly; however when I turn junk eater, no one to blame but me. The quality of the product and the excellent customer service provided by the company earned an A+. Looking forward for a two-way ongoing business.</li>
            <li> love it. work like a magic on my skin. moderate smell which goes away</li>
            <li> This work wonderfully in my skin and no breakout.  I only put a little bit yet it feels so smooth.  I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I used this religiously until the last drop. 2 drops using the dropper is sufficient to cover my face. If I put more than that, my face gets overly oily and shiny. I did not see any changes on my face or skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the oil is not sticky or thick and has a subtle scent. My skin absorbs it quickly although I don&#x27;t feel like it &amp;#34;totally&amp;#34; moisturizes my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all it&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ll purchase again....</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as stated.  Works really well and no lasting oiliness.  Love using this product.</li>
            <li> Great quality, it has improved my skin in so many ways. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I have only been using the Rosehip Oil for a week now and the appearance of my skin has already shown improvement. I have the &amp;#34;pregnancy glow&amp;#34; without the pregnancy. My skin feels soft and supple. Such a great find!</li>
            <li> I am 53 and always looking for safe ingredients to use on my face for anti-aging.  This product is really amazing.  It leaves your skin silky soft, and I can actually see it working on my fine lines so far (just started using it)  I&#x27;m hopeful in time with regular use, it will improve my deeper wrinkles!  I can&#x27;t say enough about how it makes my skin feel, and I&#x27;ve ordered more products from this seller because I was so impressed with this product.  I will report on that as well!

            <li> I bought this about a week ago and have been using it since then.  It works phenomenal on my skin.  I put it on my face at night and it&#x27;s not oily at all.  I have combination type which even with the expensive mosturizers my face will be a bit oily in the morning.  With this product it does not happen, my skin is nice and smooth and my skin is not oily at all!  My make up lasts longer maybe cuz my skin is more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Overall excellent product that I will recommend anyone...excellent for dry skin like elbows, feet, etc</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it with my home made products and so on. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face moisturized without leaving it looking oily. Not heavy at all, just the right consistency. I have dry skin and Rosacea, not really sure if it helps with the Rosacea but moisturizes my face amazingly! Recommending this oil to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! I&#x27;ve seen rosehip oil mentioned in reviews as part of the skin care regiment a lot of folks use but for some reason I just had this mental block about about it. I guess because I didn&#x27;t really know what it was. I am truly blown away with my results. I would recommend this product to everyone! I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference with my fine lines and overall appearance. I can&#x27;t get over how soft it has made my skin and how hydrated it is. For anyone out there who is on the fence about this product just try it. After all, you can&#x27;t loose. If your not satisfied VoilaVe offers a complete money back guarantee. My only wish is that I had discovered this sooner. Thank you VoilaVe for an amazing product!!</li>
            <li> My sister is the one who turned me on to rosehip oil. I had never heard of it before until she purchased a bottle for herself after claiming that Miranda Kerr swears by it. Not one to ever turn down potentially looking like Miranda Kerr, I had to get myself a bottle of rosehip oil as well. Admittedly, I was at first a bit wary of it since I have combination, acne-prone skin that can get oily at times. Knowing that oil is often the cause of my acne, I was hesitant to put even more oil on my already sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was definitely not greasy as I expected it to be. It reminds me of tea tree oil, if you have ever used that. It&#x27;s far from greasy and is easily absorbent. I&#x27;ve been using it on an acne scar on the side of my face and am already starting to see that the scar is fading away. I can&#x27;t wait to see if further extended use will make it completely disappear. My sister loves her rosehip oil and now buys it before she even runs out just so she can always have a bottle by her side, so I have all the faith that this product will be amazing. So far, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  People expecting a rose smell will be shocked but if you are already familiar with Rosehip oil you wil lbe fine.  This is very high quality and a great bargin.  Will repurchase when I run out (which won&#x27;t be for a long time!).</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Can already see a difference in my skin.  I will definitely continue to use and buy.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face as a moisturizer every night. My skin has become so much better.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Sure will buy it again n again.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with a few old acne scars.  I use a few drops of this oil with my face moisturizer, or just put a few drops on wrinkle prone spots on my body.  My skin is A LOT softer, and has a much more even complexion.  It even has a brighter and healthier glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick, and you get exactly what is in the picture/description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller cares that you got the product, that you&#x27;re happy with it, and that you know of the various ways to use it.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try the Organic Rosehip Oil, a few months ago.  Originally I had intended to use it on my husband to see if it would work on his psoriasis.  Unfortunately with his busy schedule I could not find a significant time frame to do this.  I did, however, start using it myself every night (5 drops) in my bath water.  I have been blessed with soft skin, but after two weeks my husband and my mother commented on the silky smooth feel of my skin.  I also have  a large patch of sunspots in both arms, after two weeks the spots are lighter and not as noticeable.  I&#x27;m not sure if everyone will have the same results since everyone&#x27;s body reacts differently to different products but for me, being 65, this product has exceeded its expectations.  I&#x27;ve also started using it under my eyes, for my dark circles.  I&#x27;ll let you know how that works, in two weeks.</li>
            <li> I got this and carefully read not to expect it to smell like rosehips, which is no problem.  The problem is that it smells RANCID.  I got it to put on my face and in my nostrils, so the smell is quite important.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, love the oil; will order when it runs out (eventually). Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have always added Rosehip Oil with my body lotion as it helps that it is now less dry.  I have tried other brands and this is my first time using this particular brand and it is working well.  Will definitely order again when I need to replenish.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much! My skin feels so much better even in just a few weeks of use. It looks better every day. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to get this oil since Dr Oz recommended it a while back but never got around to it until now. This particular oil is fabulous and just makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated. It looks like the company recommends it for dry skin but I&#x27;m happy to report that this luxurious oil is great for my oily/combination skin. Usually, my skin reacts very quickly and I haven&#x27;t seen any breakouts after a few days of use which makes me really happy with this product. I have to also say that the people behind this product run their company with such utmost focus on customer service --- following up to ensure the customer is satisfied and products delivered timely. I received this oil exceptionally fast 4 days before scheduled delivery date and that&#x27;s just amazing! As for its effectiveness in combating wrinkles and fine lines, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to honestly say it does but I have a feeling it&#x27;ll do just that because of the way my face soaks in the oil...it penetrates quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to just float on the surface of the skin like some low quality oils. I love love love this all natural product and encourage you to get it for yourself and a friend...they&#x27;ll thank you!!</li>
            <li> The oil goes on smoothly, however, the smell and golden color are off putting.  It takes a long time to absorb into my skin so I only use one drop.</li>
            <li> I finally finished my tub of eye cream from the department store. I have slowly been changing what I put on my face because I don&#x27;t want the chemicals anymore. I use one drop of this for each eye at night after I wash my face and it feels great. I wish I would have know about this long ago! Great product and excellent customer service. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for using on my face (under eyes) for wrinkles. I only recently started using this but love the way it makes my skin feel - overtime I am hoping to see further improvements but automatically I noticed softer brighter skin. I have only used it for a week but my coworkers noticed a difference. And also love how personal this company is with dealing with me, adds a great touch to the product and I definitely would feel comfortable ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for half a week, but every single time I use it (as a serum overnight), I wake up with noticeably less red, more radiant skin.  Probably the most noticeable skin changes I&#x27;ve ever noticed from a product before, at least on this time scale.  For note, I have really sensitive, crappy skin which is generally very red, easily irritated, and acne prone (at 29 years old).  This oil has reduced the redness on my active breakouts and improved the overall look of my non-broken out skin.  It&#x27;s also helped with peeling, dry skin on healing acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, despite many warnings from the manufacturer about the smell of this product, I don&#x27;t smell anything!  My bf also says he can&#x27;t smell anything, whereas he abhors the smell of things like tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> I just turned 50 in December and have noticed the beginnings of fine lines, uneven texture, discoloration and even acne again!  This product is wonderful. I use a few drops at night mixed with my moisturizer and the Vitamin C serum in the morning. I love the feel of the Rosehip oil on my skin.  My skin has become so smooth and more even textured.  Don&#x27;t let the word &amp;#34;Oil&amp;#34; scare you if you have oily skin.  I do and it does not make my skiing oilier.  I have even taken a few drops of this and run thru my hair for a silky smooth look.  Great product!</li>
            <li> All right got to say this stuff works my husband had patches of eczema for years on the back of both hands his skin cracks on his knuckles and has spots of bleeding and he gets in pain to from this medical issue he used lotions, hydrocortisone cream, special soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when my bottle of 100% pure &amp; unrefined cold press arrived and he put some on his hands like the first night before he went to bed he did this step to another previous review by the way for other stuff used anyway . He woke up in the morning and it&#x27;s almost like the patches of eczema was never even there. The skin used to be incredibly dry, to the point where it would flake and crack in pain with blood coming from his cracks of hands , now the whole area is 90% back to normal. After 2 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s been dealing with this for YEARS and he managed to resolve it in two days using the product, and today his skin is really almost back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose. It&#x27;s natural and likely won&#x27;t cause anymore damage than you may already have. A few times a week should do the size is 1 fl oz  so it should last a while if not to heavy with use age like on hair Keep up with this like a couple of months are depending on your needs of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it for your hair again not to much , you can always use it on your skin in other problem areas My husband used it on his face as well,  Now his skin he says feels softer and with a light scent of organic rose hip . Either way, you likely won&#x27;t waste your ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;money on this product and don&#x27;t forget a small amount goes a long way plus great to add to bath with other bath therapies items I did ~ just follow the directions with 2-5 mls  works like a charm gave me nice silkie skin to ~~ so if you use to make a relaxation bath this stuff does the trick it&#x27;s 100% Pure USDA &amp; ECO Certified Organic that&#x27;s very important naturally scented too : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Dry Skin&lt;br /&gt;-Eczema&lt;br /&gt;-Dermatitis&lt;br /&gt;-Psoriasis&lt;br /&gt;-Scars&lt;br /&gt;-Stretch Marks&lt;br /&gt;-Dry &amp; Damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;Helps with all above Courtesy of VoilaVe ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;srtesy of VoilaVe ..

            <li> This rose hip oil from Voil&amp;agrave;Ve is organic and unrefined.  It is cold-pressed from the fruit or hip of the wild climbing dog rose, also known scientifically as Rosa canina.  It is imported from Chile, where it has been cultivated for generations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unrefined rose hip oil has a clean, verdant odor, similar to the leaves and stems of roses.  It is a very pleasant and summery scent.  Before application, the color is an unusual golden orange, from the high beta carotene content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied to the skin, it is quickly and fully absorbed and doesn’t leave any oily feeling or sheen.  This makes it  a pleasure to use on the skin and cuticles and it gives excellent protection against dry skin, especially when applied after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To protect the oil from light, it is bottled in amber glass, and the cap has a glass dropper for ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voil&amp;agrave;Ve provided a sample for testing and evaluation.</li>
            <li> I use this rosehip oil, sometimes mixed with my vitamin C powder, but also alone INSTEAD of eye or face creme. If you search Google Scholar and use the terms &amp;#34;rosehip oil&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;wrinkle,&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll see several papers on the benefits of this oil. What I love about it--besides the incredible benefits--is that it absorbs beautifully into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave that heavy oily feeling like some other oils. I also love that this is organic. It has a natural nutty scent and a rich amber color. You need only a couple of drops on the face, but don&#x27;t limit it: the neck, décolletage, hands, and even hair!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to leave a review until I knew this stuff worked.  It doesn&#x27;t make my overly sensitive acne prone skin breakout so I am very grateful.  It has made my skin very soft and my skin is beginning to heal.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful Oil.  Helps with reducing pores. When Mixed with Lavender, it makes a wonderful skin serum.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Great for mixing in with your moisturizers.  Shipped by company very quickly.  Make certain to keep in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about a quarter of the bottle so far, using 5 drops/night all over my face and neck. It has smoothed my complexion, somehow made some red stops disappear, and faded old acne scars. When I run out, I will definitely buy more. The only bad thing about it is the SMELL. This DOES NOT smell like roses. It&#x27;s sort of a fishy smell- but it doesn&#x27;t last long. Which is a good thing. Because who wants to go to bed with a fish?</li>
            <li> I stopped using this; for no reason. I guess it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Feels great on my skin and in my hair. It feels hydrating and nourishing...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I use it on my face before bed and in the morning my face is soft and smooth. Great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for natural skin care products since I gave up the &amp;#34;chemical laden&amp;#34; beauty products I have used for years. I attempted to make my own, but had not been able to create anything that I loved.  The search is over, this &amp;#34;Organic VoilaVe Rosehip Oil&amp;#34; is just what I have been searching for and it is pure with no additives or preservatives which makes me love it even more.  I was having a difficult time finding a moisturizer that really worked, that did not have a laundry list of unsafe chemical ingredients and would not cause break outs.  I have been slathering this rose hip oil on my face and neck morning and evening with ABSOLUTELY NO BREAKOUTS;  in fact it is taking away the discoloration of former blemishes.  Even my skin tone is improving.  MY SKIN LOVES IT!!!  My skin is drinking it up and feels soft, dewy and better than it did when I was in my twenties.  I gave up my chemical laden eye cream as well; the rose hip oil is the most wonderful eye cream one could ever need.  I have also been using it as a cuticle cream, one drop per hand will do it.  My cuticles and nails are smooth and moisturized as well.  This one organic pure product replaces several other chemical laden products and does a better job.  This little brown bottle will be a part of my collection from here on.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as my night time moisturizer.  Even though I have oily skin, it works great because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil.  My skin feels nice in the morning and it&#x27;s also helped with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This product was not very useful for me. Olive oil from the kitchen works better.</li>
            <li> The delivery came on time.  But I need to wait and see what the result will be for this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing and economical little powerhouse of benefits towards a clear, vibrant complexion. Just a few drops massaged into your skin once or twice a day seems to take off a few years, soften tissues, even tones, and repair damage. First time purchase and will be buying it on the regular from now on.</li>
            <li> I had read great reviews on Rose Hip Oil and was anxious to purchase and try it! I chose VoilaVe Organics because it was certified 100% pure and ECO certified organic. I also inquired in regards to the type of container it was in. VoilaVe is bottled in a dark colored bottle. This was also very important....no plastics for me, as I want to avoid toxins. In addition, the dropper dispenser makes it so, so easy to apply with absolutely no waste or mess. My order was processed and shipped promptly from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Rosehip Oil pleasantly light and extremely easy to distribute. It seems to absorb into my skin magically. For my face this is light enough to use in the morning before applying foundation, once it has adsorbed. My face is smooth and soft. My hands receive a lot of abuse and even tho I purchased this for my face, I thought I would put it to a test. When I use it, I place it on the back of my hands rather then my palm, take my finger and apply some of this to my face, then rub the rest into my hand. It was only a couple days of use before I could feel and see the difference when comparing the other area of my hand, an actual visible difference! I wish I would have been aware of Rosehip oil years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product a four based on the fact that I have only used it for  approximately two weeks. I really like it, I will recommend it to my daughter and my mother and at this point believe I will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> I had been trying different brands of rose  hip oil for about 6 months until I finally found this one.  The oil is organic and a distinctive orange-brown color which is a mark of the best quality. It also has the rich smell that a good quality rose hip oil should have. The larger 4 ounce bottle is a bargain. Just a few drops are all that is needed.  I will be sticking with this oil and company for a long time. It is an excellent moisturizer and I also have a small bottle in my purse for my hands. I feel it has also helped to even out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a discount on this product for my honest review.  I meant rvery word!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how This Rose Hip product makes my skin so soft and smooth! A little bit goes a long way, it leaves no greasy residue and it&#x27;s fast absorbing. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Sticky, thick with a big odor. Not worth the cost. Messy to use. Very disappointing. I&#x27;ve already thrown it away.</li>
            <li> I have conflicting feelings. I feel like the product works well. My skin looks better and it works better than moisturizer. The only thing I didn&#x27;t really like was the smell. You would think it smells like roses but it doesn&#x27;t. It smells like plants. Kinda like the smell of freshly cut grass, but not as offensive. I cant really explain it. But I added some lavender oil to it and it took care of that.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this!  I have such dry damaged skin (from Arizona and love to be out without sunscreen!)  Applied it as soon as it arrived.  Very light and absorbs quickly.  Eyedropper dispenser makes it easy to apply.  And a little goes a long way.  Excellent website and link to their skincare guide, so I know I&#x27;m using it correctly!  Super happy with the product, will order more!</li>
            <li> I found this to be very average rosehip oil and found it difficult to justify the sky high price. I understand that it&#x27;s organic but I expect real intense results and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair silky soft like I was hoping and only made my skin oiley. I much prefer Medyskin for the price.</li>
            <li> so far so good....does have a diff odor to it, but not too strong....</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been meaning to try this for a while since it has wonderful reviews. i love it. ive been using it a week and i seen a difference the first use. i had an instant glow. i put it on by itself at night and in the morning i add 3 drops to my 100% pure and unrefined shea butter for my face. for my hair i add about 3-5 drops to my leave-in conditioner and my curls are less frizzy without looking oily and super soft. i hate the crunchy look. doesn&#x27;t stink but doesn&#x27;t smell great either.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of rosehip oil.  The first one was from another company; however, I can feel the difference in quality of this brand.  It has a more rich feel about it.  Totally pleased with product.</li>
            <li> My face used to be very red in Wisconsin&#x27;s winter. One time I was even mis-diagnosed as rosacea. Boy, my dermaltologist gave me &amp;#34;mivaso&amp;#34; cream which made face even worse. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different kinds of skincare but they didn&#x27;t help.  It made me very miserable. My sis-in-law recommended this oil to me. I was skeptical and just put 3 drops on my face for first week. It instantly calm down my itcyness and redness. Finally I decided to put more on my face (6 drops). Wow, the next morning, my face was so smooth and silky. My face never looks that good since I was teenager. This definitely a life saver. I am going to try other Voilave skincare products. Thanks Voilave...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil for about a month now. I&#x27;ve been applying it instead of a night-time moisturizer. I got it originally because I read that it helps repair sun damage and also promotes collagen production. Since I started using it I have gotten a lot of comments about how well-rested I seem. As I have a 4 month-old, this is by no means the case. At first I thought it might be a coincidence, but then I started noticing a difference myself. My skin looks a bit plumper and more dewy, especially since I&#x27;ve started using it in the morning too (under my moisturizer). I have now ordered two more bottles and look forward to seeing even greater benefits to my skin!</li>
            <li> The Rosehip Oil is working great so far. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and I am a 25yr old African American female with great skin but three dark spots on my cheek. It has a bit of a smell when you first apply it to your face, but as you smooth it out, the slight odor quickly disappears. It leaves my face moisturized, smooth, and brighter, and is not greasy. My dark spots seem to have lightened a little bit, but I would need to continue using this product more to determine if it is truly making a difference. I only need to use a little bit to cover my entire face, so I expect the bottle to last me quite a while, which is great. With continued use, I definitely anticipate it working wonders on my skin and maintaining its youthfulness and beauty. I am also applying it to my stretch marks from having two babies back to back, and I will update this review after about a couple months to see if it has helped them fade away as well.</li>
            <li> After seeing a recommendation for rose hip oil on Dr. Oz, I went to Amazon and purchased this particular product. GLORIOUS!! It actually works for the 2 problems for which I purchased this: a stubborn patch of psoriasis near my hairline, and old dark spots from ancient mosquito bites on my right shin. Fantastic! This oil has a slight nut-like aroma which quickly fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO delighted that the psoriasis no longer itches, the granular bumps have gone away and all I need to do is use a bit of concealer and there is ZERO evidence that there&#x27;s any issue there at all. Also the dark spots on my shin are DRAMATICALLY fading, with the additional happiness of no more summer ugly alligator skin :-) My shins are slender and it&#x27;s nice to look down and see lovely, youthful pretty skin. Just REMEMBER to use this daily....with the rapid improvement it&#x27;s easy to forget....and the benefits last ALL day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A totally wonderful product which I am so glad to have discovered. A little goes a long way, so I expect this reasonably priced bottle will easily last the entire summer. It is now a regular, daily part of my regime me and I&#x27;ll be ordering more as needed from this Amazon seller......they&#x27;re great with super packaging and fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I realize these seem to be *medical* benefits I&#x27;m reporting, but along with wonderfully moisturized hands and cuticles, this has been my happy experience personally with this product. Enjoy, and good luck!!</li>
            <li> I guess it is pretty good. I don&#x27;t see any good result yet but I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> did wonders for my skin !</li>
            <li> The smell not the greatest, still need time to tell if there really any benefits.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry spots before applying my makeup. It works great!</li>
            <li> This product really helped my dry skin. Just a few small drops provides so much moisture and its not sticky or greasy at all. I have also noticed that my skin tone seems more even since using this daily and that my monthly hormone related breakouts are less severe. I will definitely re-order this product on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I SO wanted this to work on my dry, red skin and rosea on my face.  In fact, it seems to be making my redness and breakouts worse, almost like acne.  I&#x27;m blending it with fractionated coconut oil so that may be adding to the problem instead of being entirely the oil&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> The scent of the rosehip oil is really pleasant to me. I use it primarily on my face and also on this rash on my hip (the doctor said I got the rash due to dry skin). I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it does minimize scarring, but I&#x27;m very pleased with the product. It moisturizes my face without making my t-zone greasy.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.  Other places sell organic for much higher.</li>
            <li> My face tends to be rosy, so I purchased this rosehip oil to help reduce the inflammation. For one thing, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face which is easy to do. I can&#x27;t even wear Argan oil. After applying it once a day for two weeks, my face does seem more calm.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and nicely packaged in bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;Have not made my moisturizing cream yet, but have been using it on my face.  It is a light oil that absorbs quickly into the skin.  Leaves skin feeling soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this oil! I recently switch from Lifeflo&#x27;s rosehip to Viola&#x27;s because this one is actually pure with zero additives. Their oil smelled like vegetable oil and was more thick while Viola&#x27;s has an earthy scent and is thinner. This thinness put me off at first, but then I realized how much quicker it absorbed into my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip has been a miracle worker for my skin in terms of oil control (crazy, right?) and scar correction. I always add a 2-3 drops to my homemade lotion then apply it to my face and I would definitely recommend doing that if you have drier skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that maybe I was expecting too much from this oil. It&#x27;s not bad, but it didn&#x27;t really take care of the bumps on my skin which I was really hoping it would. It didn&#x27;t smell that bad, very earthy smell, for sure not like roses. It was a nice addition when taking a bath, makes your skin feel soft. Overall not bad, but not what I needed for my skin problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and over the past few years realized it was time to treat the appearance of very fine lines, and especially prevent them for the future.  In this quest, I&#x27;ve spend thousands of dollars.  I had found what I thought was a wonderful &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; routine but it involved multiple high priced products.  I used this same routine for a couple of years not really feeling like I saw great results.. but the results were good enough.  I really honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect as this is a new path for me.  A while ago, I had read about Rosehip oil and decided to give it a try.  I also have mild rosacea and extremely sensitive skin - so was hoping for that one &#x27;miracle product&#x27; that would address everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil has been a HUGE game changer.  This literally made my fine lines disappear.  I have no signs of rosacea and I no longer get the intermittent break-out that used to occur.  I stopped using my other routine completely and all I do is apply this oil to my face after washing before bed (I carefully pat it under my eyes and on my eyelids).  I do sometimes follow up with a thick under eye moisturizer if I feel the need.  This is literally just amazing.  People constantly compliment my skin and ask what I use, and my friends have all started using it too with the same results.  I can&#x27;t imagine that anyone would be disappointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell - I like it, it&#x27;s warm, light and woodsy.  It isn&#x27;t greasy as it sinks into the skin but it doesn&#x27;t leave it dry either.</li>
            <li> Research what rosehip oil is, because I can tell some people haven&#x27;t ;) . Anyway, this is awesome, it keeps my redness, pimples and dry skin completely away! Never in my life did I think I could get soft , smooth skin so easily.  About to purchase a third bottle soon.</li>
            <li> I love the the Organic Rosehip Oil!  I put it on my face to help with wrinkles and on the backs of my hands to get rid of a few dark spots.  The oil feels wonderful on my skin and the spots are fading!</li>
            <li> Love this product. A little goes a very long way. I use it under moisturizer but can definitely do the trick on its own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and so far I really like it!  I have dry skin and this is a great moisturizer.  I like that I can use it on my curly hair as well as my face - anywhere that needs moisture really.  Natural and pure is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I bought the Organic Rosehip Oil for my mom and she loves the product! The product arrived promptly. She uses the oil for her face and neck. It is very effective in moisturizing her face and helping it maintain a healthy glow! She has definitely noticed a difference in her skin since using the product!</li>
            <li> Love this for my face</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is looking wonderful these days since I started using rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> Soothed and moisturized a itchy spot on my leg. Works Great! Has a woody smell but not bad or offensive. I&#x27;m excited to find other uses for it.</li>
            <li> Good product, but not for me. It slightly heavy for my skin and causes me to break out so I won&#x27;t be purchasing again. I have very sensitive skin so I was very cautious before using it. It was recommended by a friend and wanted to give it a try. Now, I have been using it to moisturize my hands, nails and hair and it works great. I would have loved it if it didn&#x27;t made me breakout.</li>
            <li> Arrived in timely manner..... This is my second bottle of the rosehip oil. I love this product it&#x27;s been amazing helping some of my psoriasis areas and a facial moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot for it to go far.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected and delivered very quickly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> When a friend told me that my 71-year-old skin looked dry, I felt I needed a change in my skin-care regimen.  I tried Organic Rosehip Oil from VoilaVe for my morning routine after cleansing.  I am on my second bottle now, since I really do notice that my skin is softer, less dry, and more youthful looking.  I am also pleased that the price is not outrageous.</li>
            <li> Rosehip Oil - Loved it - Easy as ABC!</li>
            <li> I love this rosehip oil.  I used it during my pregnancy and I have no stretch marks.  It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for years with extremely sensitive skin.  Only recently did I discover essential oils, what a difference it makes!  There are many so-called natural offers.  VoilaVe is the real deal, organic, environmentally friendly, and extremely high quality. Plus given it&#x27;s undiluted purity this stuff is potent.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  It&#x27;s used as a part of my natural beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a little over a month and I love it. It&#x27;s not a miracle oil, so don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to put it on and all wrinkles and imperfections will be gone but in my experience, I definitely noticed a softness and smoothness with the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past month, I have noticed a reduction in two scars from when I left my ACV on too long removing a skin tag and mole. The wrinkles on my forehead have gotten less defined. My complexion has evened out. And my skin feels softer and smoother than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the smell, I noticed it the first time I used it. It faintly smelled like dirt after the rain. The smell was not strong nor did it linger. It was gone as quickly as the oil itself seeps in. Speaking of, the oil seeps in fast. It is not heavy at all and smooths on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: on my face, I use it in conjunction with the Triple Action Vitamin C Serum and Low &amp; High Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum from VoilaVe. On my body, I combine it with Earth&#x27;s Daughter Aloe Vera Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the manufacturer is very nice. They email you to thank you for your purchase and check up to see how you&#x27;re liking the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review now because I am getting ready to order my second bottle, I love it that much!</li>
            <li> After one use I saw immediate results. My skin was glowing. With continued use my skin looks better and better. I like to use it at night before bed for best results. Very happy with this oil.</li>
            <li> Not only was ordering and getting my Rosehip Oil shipped to me a breeze BUT the product is amazing! I use it for moisturizing as well as a variety of other applications and it&#x27;s working wonderfully on my dry skin!  Knowing that it&#x27;s organic and 100% makes me feel good about using this on my skin.  I know I&#x27;m using a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note the customer service was top notch.  I received personalized e-mail following up on the order being received and wanted to know my feedback on the oil itself.  Not too many companies go that extra step to make sure 1 the product was received and 2 ensure that you like the product.  As if you couldn&#x27;t tell I would highly recommend this rosehip oil and this company for their quality product and exceptional customer care!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to clear up some acne on my face I&#x27;ve been using it religiously, but I&#x27;ve yet to see it work. I&#x27;m disappointed I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if I have any results.</li>
            <li> This rosehip oil is great, I apply it directly on my face and around my eyes, is very light, it absorbs quick and it does not leave your face shiny. I don&#x27;t know about results, I am 33 and don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, so maybe it prevents them from forming.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing...I use it after I dermaroll at nite &amp; my skin is so soft and supple the next morning I wake up with a glow to my face...not to mention how even my complexion has become after 3 weeks of use...Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother (age 54) and she uses this for her whole body. She adds a few drops to her regular body moisturizer because it takes the itch away from her skin and makes it silky smooth. She only use the concentrate on her wrinkles and absolutely loves this.  This is such a great product that she highly recommends!</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it with my argon oil and lost 5 years of aging from my face.</li>
            <li> Have only just started to use it so don&#x27;t have enough data yet for comprehensive review. However, so far, I&#x27;d say that I like it. Nothing negative to report. It is as advertised, light, absorbs easily, smell is earthy but not unpleasant.</li>
