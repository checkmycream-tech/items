            <li>We love this thing!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Honestly I think it&#x27;s good, because they wore over time and became just right, plus you want to give your skin a good scrub!</li>
            <li>Amazing design.  </li>
            <li>A good product that&#x27;s lasted many months.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a nice firmness.</li>
            <li>Nice brush.</li>
            <li>Brush is effective--</li>
            <li>This is a great back scrubber at an awesome price.  </li>
            <li>which is of benefit for effective cleaning.</li>
            <li>Nice handle length.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Was well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>This is a good strong bath brush.</li>
            <li>Great pricing and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This thing wouldn&#x27;t exfoliate... something that exfoliates very easily.  </li>
            <li>This is not a fault of the brush; the handle is well shaped and a nice length and should work well for most others.</li>
            <li>This brush has turned out to be more handy than I&#x27;d imagined.</li>
            <li>Stays clean with a good rinsing.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>Very light, it won&#x27;t break if you drop it in the shower.</li>
            <li>it creates a nice lather and the handle is easy to hold and reaches everywhere</li>
            <li>This is a better brush</li>
            <li>My husband is very picky about the strength of bristles and this brush makes him quite happy.</li>
            <li>Love this brush def does the job</li>
            <li>I need to put in eight more words.</li>
            <li>I should have read the description more closely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like scratching than it is exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>The best back scrubber around!  </li>
            <li>I would also like to see better gripping provisions on the head for close quarters usage.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush, better than a loofa</li>
            <li>Cant&#x27; really elaborate more than that</li>
            <li>circle, with more than 2.5&amp;#34; of bristles.  </li>
            <li>am pleased.</li>
            <li>There is nothing magical about it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy many more for gits for family and friends.</li>
            <li>A rounded, thicker handle would definitely be better.</li>
            <li>This was gifted.</li>
            <li>In fact, this might be the best back scratcher of all time in addition to it&#x27;s cleansing</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Dropped many many times.</li>
            <li>Awesome for scratching your back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very pleased</li>
            <li>It does this by removing the top layers of skin.  </li>
            <li>Must be a better way.</li>
            <li>Make the purchase, You&#x27;ll be so glad you did:-)</li>
            <li>Not quite sure how I&#x27;ll address this,</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Better for scrubbing the shower than taking one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok brush.</li>
            <li>I find it works best to apply lotion to my back instead of using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>This is the best back brush I have found, I am 6</li>
            <li>I love this bath brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quite pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this bath brush, but not in love.  </li>
            <li>If there were a more sturdy option...I would buy it, because the bath brush is much more exfoliating than a loofa.</li>
            <li>Bristles are pretty &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; for a good scrub.</li>
            <li>The back brush is perfect, it is the perfect size and works just as we wanted, just as we expected when ordered.</li>
            <li>I could clean the floor with this brush!</li>
            <li>I love it and its super durable!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large but you can&#x27;t get a good grip.</li>
            <li>If it were a bit cheaper, I&#x27;d give 5 stars, but a good solid 4 stars and a fair value shipped free via Prime.  </li>
            <li>While 4 stars (I like it) is a good rating, I agree that for the price 5 stars is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Some kind of wood or rubber grip would be useful.</li>
            <li>Looks good and is well made, but the bristles will absolutely tear into your skin...</li>
            <li>I bring that up to say that it wasn&#x27;t three days straight of vigorous use, this product just isn&#x27;t good and probably deserves NO STARS</li>
            <li>handle is adequate and longer than many, but could still use a couple of inches more.  </li>
            <li>Nice....sturdy ...makes your back (and feet) feel so good!</li>
            <li>handle makes it easy to scrub your back&lt;</li>
            <li>so it can be hung easily.  </li>
            <li>so I can reach easily.</li>
            <li>would have been nice if they could have incorporated a scrubby on the back of it, for soap, but it is a good brush</li>
            <li>how strong it is that way.  </li>
            <li>This brush isn&#x27;t anything special, the angle of the curve could be better...</li>
            <li>Nice stiff bristles - ideal for vigorous scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>It was a smart buy, I will purchase more to put in gift baskets!</li>
            <li>Great for the price, shipped fast pretty color.</li>
            <li>That aside, the quality is fine.</li>
            <li>Perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>This one is fine and works as hoped.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy, nice compact head is easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>The handle has good gripping grooves and the ark / curve of the handle make the back cleaning easy.</li>
            <li>I guess that is what I get for trying to go cheap.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to go the cheap route.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and</li>
            <li>It makes a great back scratcher, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is all plastic - meaning it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a great item, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Bristles work very well and hangs up nicely in my shower.</li>
            <li>great back brush for the shower</li>
            <li>it did what it was suppose to and was a cheap price.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, so I went for it.</li>
            <li>No wonder this was cheap.</li>
            <li>Great arch for reaching back.</li>
            <li>Comfortable handle.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Makes a great back scratcher.</li>
            <li>cheap cheap cheap....fits in my gyn bag, yet</li>
            <li>But it was cheap and can make it work.  </li>
            <li>Great product for me, one of the big boys out there.  </li>
            <li>Will plan to order another one just to have a spare available when this one wears out.</li>
            <li>The bristles are way too soft to do any good.</li>
            <li>It has a good intensity as far as bristles go.</li>
            <li>Good for elbows and feet more than my back.</li>
            <li>love the brush just right</li>
            <li>Solid bath brush, surprisingly it&#x27;s remained very clean in the shower and the bristles have held up well under use</li>
            <li>A very nice bath brush for washing my back.  </li>
            <li>Awesome, classic brush to reach your back.</li>
            <li>Thanks for an enjoyable &#x27;clean&#x27; product and efficient delivery!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a suitable replacement for my old favorite brush and bought this one.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to - and then it feels great and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>(yes, even bamboo ones) since it&#x27;s easier to really clean and keep sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This keeps my bathroom looking clean and not cluttered--</li>
            <li>mostly for the soft rubbing of the bumps, feels a ok.</li>
            <li>like you&#x27;re trying to clean your grill after a BBQ.</li>
            <li>Raised my review rating to 5 stars after further consideration and reading a fair and valid comment on my review.</li>
            <li>good handle, simple build and may break you wash like a savage.</li>
            <li>oh so good when you have an itch on your back that you just can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li>But for the money, they are still a good value to last a year.</li>
            <li>A good product at a low price.</li>
            <li>Winter dries my skin and that makes for itchy places, but with a good back brush I can get to the problem spot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m short, so the length is good for me.  </li>
            <li>Nice long handle, I love it.</li>
            <li>It seems pretty strong though.</li>
            <li>Great for my son to scrub his back, really helping with his acne.  </li>
            <li>Great brush for those hard to reach back areas works great would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li>The long handle and fairly aggressive brush is what I was looking for and this does it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Would also be wonderful for an older person who has trouble reaching places in the shower.</li>
            <li>and I like how the nylon bristles provide a pleasant exfoliation without scratching or being too rough.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, very hard bristle bath brush.</li>
            <li>Great little scrubber.</li>
            <li>However the handle is made of the kind of plastic that bend a little bit and then shatters into many pieces.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Good quality but bit harder</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>Though this item looked like it would be useful.</li>
            <li>The inward curve lines up better with the natural curvature of my spine/back</li>
            <li>I like this brush for the firmness while others with more sensitive skin may not care for it.</li>
            <li>Mainly I just wanted something to slough off all that dull winter skin, and it&#x27;s perfect for that job.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right for me, I&#x27;d describe their firmness as &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;, on par with a fingernail brush.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>The bristles are just right for me.  </li>
            <li>Just the right length, as well as the stiffness of the bristles.</li>
            <li>But the price is so right, we&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li>I knew I had made the right decision.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will get softer overtime, but as of right now it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It was delivered at the usual speed of Amazon in great shape.</li>
            <li>Nice long handle to reach everywhere.</li>
            <li>This back brush has a good grip and nice firm bristles.</li>
            <li>This is not a soft, warm and fuzzy type of brush, hence the name &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; in the name of it.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and stiff and are stout enough to give you a good scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>I have been happily using this brush regularly for several months now.  </li>
            <li>I use a special soap for body break outs, and it is a little pricey, so using more is not an option!  </li>
            <li>The ergonomics are just right for me, and the plastic bristles do a better job scratching and washing my back than any of the boar bristled brushes did.</li>
            <li>length is just about right: I&#x27;m able to reach all areas of my back without dislocating any shoulders or straining any muscles.</li>
            <li>and it has held up fine so far after 4 months of use</li>
            <li>Great brush for the person who likes a hard bristle brush.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Should have thought to check Amazon first -</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>I think this will hold up better than a wooden one.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t lather that well on the first try.</li>
            <li>Lots of complaints about brushes breaking on their first use.</li>
            <li>The only suggestion I have is for a more curved handle.</li>
            <li>My first brush</li>
            <li>But I chose it because it was Pretty.</li>
            <li>Its definitely exfoliating alright, because it takes off the top layer of skin.</li>
            <li>I was pretty bummed about that</li>
            <li>I even held it under hot water for a while to soften it a bit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay bath brush, but I wish it were longer, I&#x27;ve got short arms.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating brush is definitely essential to the skin, which I favor most.</li>
            <li>This brush takes a while to wash with, and the angle could have been designed better, so that you can actually reach most of your back.</li>
            <li>Exactly like the &amp;#</li>
            <li>Maybe a wooden handle would be better?</li>
            <li>Good for the price, if you aren&#x27;t looking for something with firm bristles.</li>
            <li>Like some other reviews had mentioned, it&#x27;s a bit rough when using this the first time: it kind of feels like sand paper, but honestly, after the first one or two times, your skin becomes acclimated and it becomes a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>The length is good and it doesn&#x27;t feel like one of those thin plastic things that will break easily on you.  </li>
            <li>If you want a stiff brush that does a good job of scrubbing this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>I had put together a cart of items and just needed a few more dollars to receive free shipping, so I added this to my list (for $5-something).</li>
            <li>I know this won&#x27;t be much help to women reading this review; but the men who are most likely to be affected by this, will know what I&#x27;m getting at.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am back to looking for a good back brush though.</li>
            <li>Love this so much, I went back and got one for Mommy.</li>
            <li>The size of the handle is good for reaching entire back.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good product at a very reasonable price; only the most delicate skin would have a problem with the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>and I make sure to clean it well and dry it complete, but what gets stuck in the bristle holes.  </li>
            <li>And as an Add-On Item and free Prime Shipping - the $5 or so that I spent is well worth the price!  </li>
            <li>I have needed a brush like this for a long time and am glad that I bought this one.</li>
            <li>Stiff bristles as stated before but with the right kind of soap</li>
            <li>I expected it to perform exactly as it does but wish the handle was longer with a bit more of a curve to make it easier.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it yet - the bristles seem strong - just wish it was larger.</li>
            <li>The nubs on the back are good when dry for your feet or hands but</li>
            <li>It is easy to use--even for a guy with muscle mass, it reaches my entire back, it is easy to keep clean, it has never developed mold after many uses, and the bristles have stayed white.</li>
            <li>I think my pain tolerance is pretty high, but jeeeeez</li>
            <li>Good brush the curved handle helps hit hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good length and seems to be made of a hard, durable plastic.</li>
            <li>its okay wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li>, it does what it is supposed to really well.</li>
            <li>If you have very tender skin, maybe.</li>
            <li>Much stiffer bristles than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>and it really does the job.</li>
            <li>For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li>This worked alright, but the plastic handle despite crenellations was too slippery, so I wrapped the handle with a tape that made it much easier to hold onto.</li>
            <li>I like well-constructed, modern designs.</li>
            <li>I works very well.</li>
            <li>but I am sold,  this has held up very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>We really like the stiffness of the bristles.</li>
            <li>thanks to this product</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>She really likes the brush and uses it.</li>
            <li>But the real problem is the bristles...</li>
            <li>Yes this purchase has truly confirmed I have become a shut in and shun all personal contact and solely rely on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This brush was made of very brittle plastic.  </li>
            <li>It would also be very helpful to find one with a longer handle.</li>
            <li>hahaha.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is not too rough nor too soft; I enjoy using it on dry skin to really exfoliate my legs, or in the shower with body wash to get my back clean well after a good workout.</li>
            <li>The length of the handle is nice but the bristles are so stiff that it hurts to use.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this as a bath brush along with a bamboo back scratcher.  </li>
            <li>If you want a brush to scrub your skin clean, this definitely is not it.</li>
            <li>use both items in my quest for a clean back and would recommend these products to anyone...</li>
            <li>even though it is small and shorter than other brushes I have owned, it has a good comfortable reach on it.  </li>
            <li>First I thought the brush was too soft, but while using it</li>
            <li>Good for cleaning tires and peeling potatoes, but not good for the skin (unless exfoliating to the point of pain is your thing).</li>
            <li>The handle is just long enough to give us a good reach of all the scrubbable bits, the bumps on the back are great for rubbing sore, tired feet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for hard to reach areas and for back scratching too.</li>
            <li>A great back scrubber and  hard to reach areas, but don&#x27;t like the idea of having to replace it every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>After using this many times I can say that the bristles are good enough to scrub my back over and over without being too soft or too hard.</li>
            <li>I find the brush is too soft and doesn&#x27;t really feel like my back is clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just less limber than most.  </li>
            <li>This brush is of decent quality and works well.  </li>
            <li>Feels more rough that a natural bristle.</li>
            <li>I was able to get them to relax back to normal enough to use it.</li>
            <li>Nice, stiff, old school brush.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are stiff enough to do a good job of exfoliating,  3)</li>
            <li>We recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for others.</li>
            <li>Technically, this product will get your back very clean.  </li>
            <li>Firm bristles, good hand grip and the right length and angle to reach your entire back.</li>
            <li>This is in no way a soft bristle brush, and I can only describe it as feeling like one of those wire brushes that you use to clean grills.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to rinse and doesn&#x27;t hold onto the soap like some other brushes</li>
            <li>I have had a few brushes over the years where the bristles are either too soft or too hard and this is the perfect balance!</li>
            <li>The bristles are much too soft.  </li>
            <li>Wasted many.</li>
            <li>Tough bristles, light weight, easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>Nice stiff brush really scrubs the back.</li>
            <li>The damn brush broke right off of the handle the third time that I used it.</li>
            <li>I need a good scrubber that help with my bad back and with its roughness helps clean my back way more than a soft one could.</li>
            <li>But the back side with the little knobs was nice.</li>
            <li>but I can live with that, what I don&#x27;t like, and</li>
            <li>it feels like a new brush.  </li>
            <li>Need to replace, since my skin is too sensitive!</li>
            <li>is ok if you are looking for a rather small size bath brush.</li>
            <li>The quality is first rate and should last a life time.</li>
            <li>I most likely will not buy this one again due to that</li>
            <li>bristles are rough but it makes me feel like my body is getting a good scrub, i always use a loofah to scrub my body and i feel this brush is exfoliating without being hurtful or making my skin raw.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft enough not to feel like it&#x27;s tearing his skin apart, but sturdy enough to make him feel clean.</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what I need it to, scrub my back where my arms can&#x27;t bend to reach, which comes in handy because I work around a lot of gray powder that can be tough to rinse off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I feel super ripped off; it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve bought several brushes from various companies</li>
            <li>Next to black, clear is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>I wish the bristles were a little stiffer, to better scrub away dry flaky skin, but I think it&#x27;s just right for regular cleansing.</li>
            <li>I have seen many review this product saying the bristles are to hard.</li>
            <li>Mine had a clear plastic handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped to clear up the skin on my back, and I&#x27;ve got no complaints.</li>
            <li>Clear plastic construction.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m all that sensitive to pain</li>
            <li>and I can really feel the bristles digging into my back.  </li>
            <li>and it can be hung on a hook near your bath.</li>
            <li>He uses it all the time, and the skin on his back, is looking much healthier.</li>
            <li>The head is only about two to three inches in diameter; but is very usable.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and it feels too soft, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bodybuilder and a downtown professional.</li>
            <li>I think for those with sensitive skin, maybe a softer brush is preferable.</li>
            <li>This is a soft brush</li>
            <li>When I bought this brush I intended to use it as an all-purpose bath brush, much like a sponge or loofah, but it is definitely designed for exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>works well, reaches my whole back.</li>
            <li>My back felt like it was really scrubbed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand those soft bristle brushes.</li>
            <li>Not to soft.  </li>
            <li>I really needed a back scrub brush to get at the spots I can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the only criticism that I have about it is - there isn&#x27;t much on the head of the brush to hold body wash.</li>
            <li>Does what it claims, and so far we haven&#x27;t had any warping or loss of the bristles.</li>
            <li>I do like this product and it is much nicer and cleaner than the wooden versions, which splinter with wear.</li>
            <li>Makes washing your back much easier.</li>
            <li>I bought 3-each to keep stock next few years or more.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a little too stiff for my back but great for my feet.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty good reach and the brush bristles are stiff enough to clean well and remove dead skin, but not so stiff as to hurt you.</li>
            <li>The soap just sinks to the bottom of the brush, leaving nothing on my skin when I try to use it to clean my back.</li>
            <li>The brush is fine, however, I was a bit surprised by the small diameter of the brush head.</li>
            <li>The brush is a bit small but the bristles are rough enough to let you know you&#x27;re getting a good scrub.  </li>
            <li>She announced that she had just purchased what appeared to be the same exact brush from the local grocery store for $2.</li>
            <li>What can I say its a back brush and does the Job at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I have just replaced it with a new wooden handle natural bristle brush</li>
            <li>The handle is long enough; and for my use the bristles are just right.</li>
            <li>This was nice, I don&#x27;t know what really could be wrong with a back brush</li>
            <li>and I prefer the other one because the head is larger, but because of the smaller head on this one it is possible to put more force into scrubbing if desired.  </li>
            <li>a good, firm bristle brush, but the head is probably less than half the size of my previous brush, so it takes much more work to cover the same area.  </li>
            <li>The head is SUPER small and the hanging hole at the end is also way too narrow to fit over the hook on any of our three shower caddies.</li>
            <li>very stiff but not enough to hurt well made reaches about right too very good for feet and other tough stuff</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d just wasted money on a cheap back brush.</li>
            <li>Bristles are nice and stiff but a little scratchy.</li>
            <li>not quite as long as I&#x27;d like, bristles comfortable, maybe a little on the soft side.</li>
            <li>Being a big guy, 15.5 inches doesn&#x27;t reach very far.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and have ended up with many of the soft, froufrou things masquerading as back brushes in your search to find a stiff bristled back brush; then look no further.  </li>
            <li>This has a nice bend to it, which helps when trying to apply proper pressure for cleaning that hard to reach middle back area.</li>
            <li>Good little stiff!!</li>
            <li>I love the tough bristles.  </li>
            <li>The coarseness of the bristles for me are perfect as I have very dry and itchy skin, I work outside in the cold alot and probably don&#x27;t hydrate enough, and they definitely satisfy the itch factor.</li>
            <li>A lot of back brushes come with wood handles or handles clearly designed for women.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can reach over my shoulder and almost completely to my waist when scrubbing my back.  </li>
            <li>Even if it breaks, a few months of use at this price is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>A little stiff as far as the brush...but its ok.</li>
            <li>but they are pretty sharp!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2\\&quot; and this brush is long enough to scrub my whole back.  </li>
            <li>the handle is long enough to reach my whole back...</li>
            <li>it does the job of cleaning my back pretty well and lasts a long long time.</li>
            <li>Brush head is far too small, have fun soaping it up 4-5 times to wash your back.  </li>
            <li>I had to put soap on it several times before it would get the slightest lather, whereas my natural bristle brush took only the smallest amount.</li>
            <li>This brush is harsh enough to tear the skin right off your body.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are a little bit harsh if you have sensitive skin, but they do a fantastic job exfoliating.</li>
            <li>34;Aquasentials Long Handle Bath Brush (15.5in) (Clear Handle)&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The brush is pretty firm, which I like.</li>
            <li>I really have to struggle to reach parts of my back with this and other similar brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brash has very small had, it is tiny .I don&#x27;t liked .</li>
            <li>The handle is long enough to reach all of your back and the brushes are soft, not to hurt and scratch.</li>
            <li>I found the bath brush a bit rough on my sensitive skin, but my husband loves it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that person was reviewing the right product; there is nothing that could possibly rust.</li>
            <li>The problem has been that the brush is not long enough to reach my lower back.</li>
            <li>The first time I stripped and wrapped my filthy hands around its strong solid long gnarled shaft and started rubbing its large bristled head all over my body</li>
            <li>The handle is long and helps you reach areas without bending or stretching like a gymnast, but is very slick when wet which can be worked around by wrapping a washcloth around it to give you better grip.</li>

            <li> Was well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good strong bath brush.</li>
            <li> Great pricing and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This thing wouldn&#x27;t exfoliate... something that exfoliates very easily.  </li>
            <li> This is not a fault of the brush; the handle is well shaped and a nice length and should work well for most others.</li>

            <li> it creates a nice lather and the handle is easy to hold and reaches everywhere</li>
            <li> This is a better brush</li>
            <li> My husband is very picky about the strength of bristles and this brush makes him quite happy.</li>
            <li> Love this brush def does the job</li>
            <li> I need to put in eight more words.</li>
            <li> I should have read the description more closely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like scratching than it is exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> The best back scrubber around!  </li>
            <li> I would also like to see better gripping provisions on the head for close quarters usage.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush, better than a loofa</li>
            <li> Cant&#x27; really elaborate more than that</li>
            <li> circle, with more than 2.5&amp;#34; of bristles.  </li>
            <li> am pleased.</li>
            <li> There is nothing magical about it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy many more for gits for family and friends.</li>
            <li> A rounded, thicker handle would definitely be better.</li>
            <li> This was gifted.</li>
            <li> In fact, this might be the best back scratcher of all time in addition to it&#x27;s cleansing</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> Dropped many many times.</li>
            <li> Awesome for scratching your back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very pleased</li>
            <li> It does this by removing the top layers of skin.  </li>
            <li> Must be a better way.</li>
            <li> Make the purchase, You&#x27;ll be so glad you did:-)</li>
            <li> Not quite sure how I&#x27;ll address this,</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Better for scrubbing the shower than taking one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok brush.</li>
            <li> I find it works best to apply lotion to my back instead of using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the best back brush I have found, I am 6</li>
            <li> I love this bath brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this bath brush, but not in love.  </li>
            <li> If there were a more sturdy option...I would buy it, because the bath brush is much more exfoliating than a loofa.</li>
            <li> Bristles are pretty &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; for a good scrub.</li>
            <li> The back brush is perfect, it is the perfect size and works just as we wanted, just as we expected when ordered.</li>
            <li> I could clean the floor with this brush!</li>
            <li> I love it and its super durable!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large but you can&#x27;t get a good grip.</li>
            <li> If it were a bit cheaper, I&#x27;d give 5 stars, but a good solid 4 stars and a fair value shipped free via Prime.  </li>
            <li> While 4 stars (I like it) is a good rating, I agree that for the price 5 stars is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Some kind of wood or rubber grip would be useful.</li>
            <li> Looks good and is well made, but the bristles will absolutely tear into your skin...</li>
            <li> I bring that up to say that it wasn&#x27;t three days straight of vigorous use, this product just isn&#x27;t good and probably deserves NO STARS</li>
            <li> handle is adequate and longer than many, but could still use a couple of inches more.  </li>
            <li> Nice....sturdy ...makes your back (and feet) feel so good!</li>
            <li> handle makes it easy to scrub your back&lt;</li>
            <li> so it can be hung easily.  </li>
            <li> so I can reach easily.</li>
            <li> would have been nice if they could have incorporated a scrubby on the back of it, for soap, but it is a good brush</li>
            <li> how strong it is that way.  </li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t anything special, the angle of the curve could be better...</li>
            <li> Nice stiff bristles - ideal for vigorous scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> It was a smart buy, I will purchase more to put in gift baskets!</li>
            <li> Great for the price, shipped fast pretty color.</li>
            <li> That aside, the quality is fine.</li>
            <li> Perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> This one is fine and works as hoped.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy, nice compact head is easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> The handle has good gripping grooves and the ark / curve of the handle make the back cleaning easy.</li>
            <li> I guess that is what I get for trying to go cheap.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to go the cheap route.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and</li>
            <li> It makes a great back scratcher, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is all plastic - meaning it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a great item, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Bristles work very well and hangs up nicely in my shower.</li>
            <li> great back brush for the shower</li>
            <li> it did what it was suppose to and was a cheap price.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, so I went for it.</li>
            <li> No wonder this was cheap.</li>
            <li> Great arch for reaching back.</li>
            <li> Comfortable handle.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Makes a great back scratcher.</li>
            <li> cheap cheap cheap....fits in my gyn bag, yet</li>
            <li> But it was cheap and can make it work.  </li>
            <li> Great product for me, one of the big boys out there.  </li>
            <li> Will plan to order another one just to have a spare available when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> The bristles are way too soft to do any good.</li>
            <li> It has a good intensity as far as bristles go.</li>
            <li> Good for elbows and feet more than my back.</li>
            <li> love the brush just right</li>
            <li> Solid bath brush, surprisingly it&#x27;s remained very clean in the shower and the bristles have held up well under use</li>
            <li> A very nice bath brush for washing my back.  </li>
            <li> Awesome, classic brush to reach your back.</li>
            <li> Thanks for an enjoyable &#x27;clean&#x27; product and efficient delivery!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a suitable replacement for my old favorite brush and bought this one.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to - and then it feels great and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> (yes, even bamboo ones) since it&#x27;s easier to really clean and keep sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This keeps my bathroom looking clean and not cluttered--</li>
            <li> mostly for the soft rubbing of the bumps, feels a ok.</li>
            <li> like you&#x27;re trying to clean your grill after a BBQ.</li>
            <li> Raised my review rating to 5 stars after further consideration and reading a fair and valid comment on my review.</li>
            <li> good handle, simple build and may break you wash like a savage.</li>
            <li> oh so good when you have an itch on your back that you just can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> But for the money, they are still a good value to last a year.</li>
            <li> A good product at a low price.</li>
            <li> Winter dries my skin and that makes for itchy places, but with a good back brush I can get to the problem spot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m short, so the length is good for me.  </li>
            <li> Nice long handle, I love it.</li>
            <li> It seems pretty strong though.</li>
            <li> Great for my son to scrub his back, really helping with his acne.  </li>
            <li> Great brush for those hard to reach back areas works great would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> The long handle and fairly aggressive brush is what I was looking for and this does it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Would also be wonderful for an older person who has trouble reaching places in the shower.</li>
            <li> and I like how the nylon bristles provide a pleasant exfoliation without scratching or being too rough.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, very hard bristle bath brush.</li>
            <li> Great little scrubber.</li>
            <li> However the handle is made of the kind of plastic that bend a little bit and then shatters into many pieces.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good quality but bit harder</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> Though this item looked like it would be useful.</li>
            <li> The inward curve lines up better with the natural curvature of my spine/back</li>
            <li> I like this brush for the firmness while others with more sensitive skin may not care for it.</li>
            <li> Mainly I just wanted something to slough off all that dull winter skin, and it&#x27;s perfect for that job.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right for me, I&#x27;d describe their firmness as &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;, on par with a fingernail brush.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just right for me.  </li>
            <li> Just the right length, as well as the stiffness of the bristles.</li>
            <li> But the price is so right, we&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I knew I had made the right decision.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will get softer overtime, but as of right now it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It was delivered at the usual speed of Amazon in great shape.</li>
            <li> Nice long handle to reach everywhere.</li>
            <li> This back brush has a good grip and nice firm bristles.</li>
            <li> This is not a soft, warm and fuzzy type of brush, hence the name &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; in the name of it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and stiff and are stout enough to give you a good scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> I have been happily using this brush regularly for several months now.  </li>
            <li> I use a special soap for body break outs, and it is a little pricey, so using more is not an option!  </li>
            <li> The ergonomics are just right for me, and the plastic bristles do a better job scratching and washing my back than any of the boar bristled brushes did.</li>
            <li> length is just about right: I&#x27;m able to reach all areas of my back without dislocating any shoulders or straining any muscles.</li>
            <li> and it has held up fine so far after 4 months of use</li>
            <li> Great brush for the person who likes a hard bristle brush.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Should have thought to check Amazon first -</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I think this will hold up better than a wooden one.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t lather that well on the first try.</li>
            <li> Lots of complaints about brushes breaking on their first use.</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I have is for a more curved handle.</li>
            <li> My first brush</li>
            <li> But I chose it because it was Pretty.</li>
            <li> Its definitely exfoliating alright, because it takes off the top layer of skin.</li>
            <li> I was pretty bummed about that</li>
            <li> I even held it under hot water for a while to soften it a bit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay bath brush, but I wish it were longer, I&#x27;ve got short arms.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating brush is definitely essential to the skin, which I favor most.</li>
            <li> This brush takes a while to wash with, and the angle could have been designed better, so that you can actually reach most of your back.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the &amp;#</li>
            <li> Maybe a wooden handle would be better?</li>
            <li> Good for the price, if you aren&#x27;t looking for something with firm bristles.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviews had mentioned, it&#x27;s a bit rough when using this the first time: it kind of feels like sand paper, but honestly, after the first one or two times, your skin becomes acclimated and it becomes a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> The length is good and it doesn&#x27;t feel like one of those thin plastic things that will break easily on you.  </li>
            <li> If you want a stiff brush that does a good job of scrubbing this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I had put together a cart of items and just needed a few more dollars to receive free shipping, so I added this to my list (for $5-something).</li>
            <li> I know this won&#x27;t be much help to women reading this review; but the men who are most likely to be affected by this, will know what I&#x27;m getting at.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am back to looking for a good back brush though.</li>
            <li> Love this so much, I went back and got one for Mommy.</li>
            <li> The size of the handle is good for reaching entire back.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product at a very reasonable price; only the most delicate skin would have a problem with the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> and I make sure to clean it well and dry it complete, but what gets stuck in the bristle holes.  </li>
            <li> And as an Add-On Item and free Prime Shipping - the $5 or so that I spent is well worth the price!  </li>
            <li> I have needed a brush like this for a long time and am glad that I bought this one.</li>
            <li> Stiff bristles as stated before but with the right kind of soap</li>
            <li> I expected it to perform exactly as it does but wish the handle was longer with a bit more of a curve to make it easier.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet - the bristles seem strong - just wish it was larger.</li>
            <li> The nubs on the back are good when dry for your feet or hands but</li>
            <li> It is easy to use--even for a guy with muscle mass, it reaches my entire back, it is easy to keep clean, it has never developed mold after many uses, and the bristles have stayed white.</li>
            <li> I think my pain tolerance is pretty high, but jeeeeez</li>
            <li> Good brush the curved handle helps hit hard to reach spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good length and seems to be made of a hard, durable plastic.</li>
            <li> its okay wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> , it does what it is supposed to really well.</li>
            <li> If you have very tender skin, maybe.</li>
            <li> Much stiffer bristles than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> and it really does the job.</li>
            <li> For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li> This worked alright, but the plastic handle despite crenellations was too slippery, so I wrapped the handle with a tape that made it much easier to hold onto.</li>
            <li> I like well-constructed, modern designs.</li>
            <li> I works very well.</li>
            <li> but I am sold,  this has held up very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> We really like the stiffness of the bristles.</li>
            <li> thanks to this product</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> She really likes the brush and uses it.</li>
            <li> But the real problem is the bristles...</li>
            <li> Yes this purchase has truly confirmed I have become a shut in and shun all personal contact and solely rely on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This brush was made of very brittle plastic.  </li>
            <li> It would also be very helpful to find one with a longer handle.</li>
            <li> hahaha.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is not too rough nor too soft; I enjoy using it on dry skin to really exfoliate my legs, or in the shower with body wash to get my back clean well after a good workout.</li>
            <li> The length of the handle is nice but the bristles are so stiff that it hurts to use.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this as a bath brush along with a bamboo back scratcher.  </li>
            <li> If you want a brush to scrub your skin clean, this definitely is not it.</li>
            <li> use both items in my quest for a clean back and would recommend these products to anyone...</li>
            <li> even though it is small and shorter than other brushes I have owned, it has a good comfortable reach on it.  </li>
            <li> First I thought the brush was too soft, but while using it</li>
            <li> Good for cleaning tires and peeling potatoes, but not good for the skin (unless exfoliating to the point of pain is your thing).</li>
            <li> The handle is just long enough to give us a good reach of all the scrubbable bits, the bumps on the back are great for rubbing sore, tired feet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for hard to reach areas and for back scratching too.</li>
            <li> A great back scrubber and  hard to reach areas, but don&#x27;t like the idea of having to replace it every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> After using this many times I can say that the bristles are good enough to scrub my back over and over without being too soft or too hard.</li>
            <li> I find the brush is too soft and doesn&#x27;t really feel like my back is clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just less limber than most.  </li>
            <li> This brush is of decent quality and works well.  </li>
            <li> Feels more rough that a natural bristle.</li>
            <li> I was able to get them to relax back to normal enough to use it.</li>
            <li> Nice, stiff, old school brush.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are stiff enough to do a good job of exfoliating,  3)</li>
            <li> We recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for others.</li>
            <li> Technically, this product will get your back very clean.  </li>
            <li> Firm bristles, good hand grip and the right length and angle to reach your entire back.</li>
            <li> This is in no way a soft bristle brush, and I can only describe it as feeling like one of those wire brushes that you use to clean grills.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to rinse and doesn&#x27;t hold onto the soap like some other brushes</li>
            <li> I have had a few brushes over the years where the bristles are either too soft or too hard and this is the perfect balance!</li>
            <li> The bristles are much too soft.  </li>
            <li> Wasted many.</li>
            <li> Tough bristles, light weight, easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Nice stiff brush really scrubs the back.</li>
            <li> The damn brush broke right off of the handle the third time that I used it.</li>
            <li> I need a good scrubber that help with my bad back and with its roughness helps clean my back way more than a soft one could.</li>
            <li> But the back side with the little knobs was nice.</li>
            <li> but I can live with that, what I don&#x27;t like, and</li>
            <li> it feels like a new brush.  </li>
            <li> Need to replace, since my skin is too sensitive!</li>
            <li> is ok if you are looking for a rather small size bath brush.</li>
            <li> The quality is first rate and should last a life time.</li>
            <li> I most likely will not buy this one again due to that</li>
            <li> bristles are rough but it makes me feel like my body is getting a good scrub, i always use a loofah to scrub my body and i feel this brush is exfoliating without being hurtful or making my skin raw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft enough not to feel like it&#x27;s tearing his skin apart, but sturdy enough to make him feel clean.</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what I need it to, scrub my back where my arms can&#x27;t bend to reach, which comes in handy because I work around a lot of gray powder that can be tough to rinse off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I feel super ripped off; it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve bought several brushes from various companies</li>
            <li> Next to black, clear is my favorite color.</li>
            <li> I wish the bristles were a little stiffer, to better scrub away dry flaky skin, but I think it&#x27;s just right for regular cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have seen many review this product saying the bristles are to hard.</li>
            <li> Mine had a clear plastic handle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped to clear up the skin on my back, and I&#x27;ve got no complaints.</li>
            <li> Clear plastic construction.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m all that sensitive to pain</li>
            <li> and I can really feel the bristles digging into my back.  </li>
            <li> and it can be hung on a hook near your bath.</li>
            <li> He uses it all the time, and the skin on his back, is looking much healthier.</li>
            <li> The head is only about two to three inches in diameter; but is very usable.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and it feels too soft, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bodybuilder and a downtown professional.</li>
            <li> I think for those with sensitive skin, maybe a softer brush is preferable.</li>
            <li> This is a soft brush</li>
            <li> When I bought this brush I intended to use it as an all-purpose bath brush, much like a sponge or loofah, but it is definitely designed for exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> works well, reaches my whole back.</li>
            <li> My back felt like it was really scrubbed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand those soft bristle brushes.</li>
            <li> Not to soft.  </li>
            <li> I really needed a back scrub brush to get at the spots I can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the only criticism that I have about it is - there isn&#x27;t much on the head of the brush to hold body wash.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims, and so far we haven&#x27;t had any warping or loss of the bristles.</li>
            <li> I do like this product and it is much nicer and cleaner than the wooden versions, which splinter with wear.</li>
            <li> Makes washing your back much easier.</li>
            <li> I bought 3-each to keep stock next few years or more.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little too stiff for my back but great for my feet.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty good reach and the brush bristles are stiff enough to clean well and remove dead skin, but not so stiff as to hurt you.</li>
            <li> The soap just sinks to the bottom of the brush, leaving nothing on my skin when I try to use it to clean my back.</li>
            <li> The brush is fine, however, I was a bit surprised by the small diameter of the brush head.</li>
            <li> The brush is a bit small but the bristles are rough enough to let you know you&#x27;re getting a good scrub.  </li>
            <li> She announced that she had just purchased what appeared to be the same exact brush from the local grocery store for $2.</li>
            <li> What can I say its a back brush and does the Job at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I have just replaced it with a new wooden handle natural bristle brush</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough; and for my use the bristles are just right.</li>
            <li> This was nice, I don&#x27;t know what really could be wrong with a back brush</li>
            <li> and I prefer the other one because the head is larger, but because of the smaller head on this one it is possible to put more force into scrubbing if desired.  </li>
            <li> a good, firm bristle brush, but the head is probably less than half the size of my previous brush, so it takes much more work to cover the same area.  </li>
            <li> The head is SUPER small and the hanging hole at the end is also way too narrow to fit over the hook on any of our three shower caddies.</li>
            <li> very stiff but not enough to hurt well made reaches about right too very good for feet and other tough stuff</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d just wasted money on a cheap back brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles are nice and stiff but a little scratchy.</li>
            <li> not quite as long as I&#x27;d like, bristles comfortable, maybe a little on the soft side.</li>
            <li> Being a big guy, 15.5 inches doesn&#x27;t reach very far.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have ended up with many of the soft, froufrou things masquerading as back brushes in your search to find a stiff bristled back brush; then look no further.  </li>
            <li> This has a nice bend to it, which helps when trying to apply proper pressure for cleaning that hard to reach middle back area.</li>
            <li> Good little stiff!!</li>
            <li> I love the tough bristles.  </li>
            <li> The coarseness of the bristles for me are perfect as I have very dry and itchy skin, I work outside in the cold alot and probably don&#x27;t hydrate enough, and they definitely satisfy the itch factor.</li>
            <li> A lot of back brushes come with wood handles or handles clearly designed for women.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can reach over my shoulder and almost completely to my waist when scrubbing my back.  </li>
            <li> Even if it breaks, a few months of use at this price is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> A little stiff as far as the brush...but its ok.</li>
            <li> but they are pretty sharp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2\\&quot; and this brush is long enough to scrub my whole back.  </li>
            <li> the handle is long enough to reach my whole back...</li>
            <li> it does the job of cleaning my back pretty well and lasts a long long time.</li>
            <li> Brush head is far too small, have fun soaping it up 4-5 times to wash your back.  </li>
            <li> I had to put soap on it several times before it would get the slightest lather, whereas my natural bristle brush took only the smallest amount.</li>
            <li> This brush is harsh enough to tear the skin right off your body.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are a little bit harsh if you have sensitive skin, but they do a fantastic job exfoliating.</li>
            <li> 34;Aquasentials Long Handle Bath Brush (15.5in) (Clear Handle)&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty firm, which I like.</li>
            <li> I really have to struggle to reach parts of my back with this and other similar brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brash has very small had, it is tiny .I don&#x27;t liked .</li>
            <li> The handle is long enough to reach all of your back and the brushes are soft, not to hurt and scratch.</li>
            <li> I found the bath brush a bit rough on my sensitive skin, but my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that person was reviewing the right product; there is nothing that could possibly rust.</li>
            <li> The problem has been that the brush is not long enough to reach my lower back.</li>
            <li> The first time I stripped and wrapped my filthy hands around its strong solid long gnarled shaft and started rubbing its large bristled head all over my body</li>
            <li> The handle is long and helps you reach areas without bending or stretching like a gymnast, but is very slick when wet which can be worked around by wrapping a washcloth around it to give you better grip.</li>
            <li> However other brushes I&#x27;ve used were too soft.  </li>
            <li> My brush has held up well (I only use it occasionally, but still, it&#x27;s well made and will last you a long time).</li>
            <li> At first I also thought it was a little rough, but it breaks in with use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long enough to reach the hard-to-reach places of the back.</li>
            <li> Finally a brush that is long enough!</li>
            <li> I can scrub my legs with very little contortionism, which is MY main concern, as I recently had back surgery and scrubbing my legs has become quite the chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> with soap or water they become too slick to really do much.  </li>
            <li> I am tall and the brush is long enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long we expect something that cost $5.99 to last.  </li>
            <li> This won&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you like a stiff brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since this past summer of 2013, and it&#x27;s a decent product to help scrub my back.</li>
            <li> My skin is way too soft and delicate and I will be returning this and just buying a natural bristle brush again.</li>
            <li> I have looked everywhere for a long (but not too long) handled back scrubber without any luck.</li>
            <li> Also it was smaller than I expected - I would prefer a longer handle and a larger brush surface.</li>
            <li> only downside is that these brushes only last me about a year before they snap in half after being used vigorously on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> The reach is adequate for me, and the brush head is a little on the small side, but is manageable.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about how stiff the bristles are, but to me the bristles are softer than I expected and work very well.  </li>
            <li> My fingers go to far around to get a tight grip.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, appears to take up little space in the shower because it is clear.</li>
            <li> The bristles are way too long.</li>
            <li> It is plenty long for me.  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> When I got it into the shower and my back was wet</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I knew the bristles were rough, and they are, so don&#x27;t go to town on your back</li>
            <li> It holds the soap as long as you stay out of the water stream.</li>
            <li> Have not used the opposite side massage ripples, but the scrubbing head works well, and as expected.</li>
            <li> But these are minor issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush, it has an adequately long handle and it works as intended.</li>
            <li> Expected the brush head to be larger.</li>
            <li> This long reach handle Exfoliating Bath Brush has given me the comfort of a cleaner wash in the shower.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles help in the exfoliating of dead skin from  on my leg stump, ridding the build-up of skin that attracts malodorous stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much can be said about a back brush.  </li>
            <li> Not very sturdy, so it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The extra long handle is both a plus and a minus--a plus for reaching down your back and lower extremities, but I end up banging the shower wall with the end of the handle when I scrub my elbows.  </li>
            <li> It is long enough and the bristles are stiff enough for a man&#x27;s back.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re in that Goldie Lock zone; not to soft, and not to stiff.</li>
            <li> This is a really, really hard brush of super stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the handle is a little too short for me.</li>
            <li> Sent me a white one instead of the blue one shown here, but otherwise does the job, seems a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li> I bought both not realizing that, other than shape, they were the same.</li>
            <li> Bristles are extremely soft, and the head is just too small.  </li>
            <li> So we ordered it on April 8th 2012 and had daily average use of it till October 17th whereupon the handle snapped.  </li>
            <li> small soft bristles may just push the soap instead of scrubbing.</li>
            <li> The thing was only 5 bucks though, not really worth paying to return.</li>
            <li> The handle is as long as expected and needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local CVS, not on Amazon, because the handle of my old brush had broken, and this was the only one CVS sold.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very hard and since the brush is so small, takes a long time to clean everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Others have complained about the hard bristles, which is true.  </li>
            <li> The first time he used it he said it was a little tough on his back</li>
            <li> I have a bad back so twisting around trying to clean my back beyond my shoulder blades is tricky.</li>
            <li> but I like the brush enough to see if there&#x27;s something I can do to make the handle less slippery.</li>
            <li> Handle feels firm and is long enough to reach your feet if you don&#x27;t like bending over.  </li>
            <li> My previous back brush was a fancy wood brush, but it turned pink.  </li>
            <li> but it is NOT for those who want just a stiff brush much less a soft brush.</li>
            <li> Wish the bath head was a little larger</li>
            <li> It might take a little getting used to in the beginning, but your back WILL be exfoliated!</li>
            <li> the brush kinda angles back at the neck which seems a little counter productive.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a little larger.</li>
            <li> The head is a little smaller than I expected but not a problem.  </li>
            <li> the bristles aren&#x27;t too hard or soft and the handle isn&#x27;t flimsy like others in this price range.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li> not too soft, not too hard.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the picture is blue</li>
            <li> I can reach my back to wash it with soap, but I like the idea of scrubbing it to remove dead skin, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too rough to use on skin.</li>
            <li> But yeah these bristles are rough.  </li>
            <li> this scrubber is rough.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t a total waste.</li>
            <li> The one thing I discovered is the handle becomes rather slippery once my hand becomes wet.</li>
            <li> Rated it 3 star as i expected bristles to be bit softer.</li>
            <li> Not much can be said for a brush.  </li>
            <li> It feels like the brush I bought from the local Target a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.  </li>
            <li> Brush needs to be harder or have a rougher surface on reverse side.</li>
            <li> The bristles are to rough for my skin.</li>
            <li> A few of the outer bristles are beginning to show wear, but overall it is holding up well.  </li>
            <li> I searched around on Amazon and found 2 brushes that looked promising because the negative things that people had to say about them were that the bristles were too stiff.  </li>
            <li> Rust will almost certainly not be a problem.</li>
            <li> bristles are stiff enough to do the job but doesnt take off skin...will buy another when this one wears out</li>
            <li> This is the less expensive of the two brushes and it certainly does the job well enough.</li>
            <li> Unlike all other brushes, this one has STIFF bristles, the handles that does not bend, and it is NOT wooden.</li>
            <li> I like bristles that are very firm, and these are not too soft and not too firm.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> but other than that I can&#x27;t complain for the money</li>
            <li> but we knew that from other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have gone through several all-natural bristle brushes in the past year:</li>
            <li> Extremely sturdy</li>
            <li> Other brushes that I have owned lose their bristles while this one does not.</li>
            <li> Other brushes I&#x27;ve use seem to soften with age, this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Take the extra leap and buy the brush that isn&#x27;t too small.</li>
            <li> handle is only about two inches wide and about three eights of an inch thick</li>
            <li> it first arrived I was disappointed, because it was replacing a natural bristle brush in in comparison</li>
            <li> Not only the brush head but the handle which feels thin and fragile.  </li>
            <li> The brush head was a little smaller than I expected and the bristles were very stiff.</li>
            <li> The handle is flat plastic, with some plastic &amp;#34;ridges&amp;#34; near the end of the handle, As soon as I wet the brush and applied body wash, the handle became a little difficult to hold on to.</li>
            <li> I need my brush a little harder.</li>
            <li> It was a little shorter than I expected, and it felt flimsy.</li>
            <li> a little too rough for me.</li>
            <li> Instead, I&#x27;ve just got hard bristles scraping my back, not cleaning it in any way.</li>
            <li> This washes my back and also scrubs all the grease off me from work that&#x27;s hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Reach those hard to reach places on your back while bathing.  </li>
            <li> Mine didnt shatter, but if i scrubbed hard enough it would.</li>
            <li> The curve of the handle plus the angle of the brush mean that you&#x27;re trying to brush your back with just the edge of the brush, not the flat part – which, by the way, is extremely small: like about 2.5 inches across.</li>
            <li> - this is not a soft bristle brush, it&#x27;s not a wire brush hard, but it&#x27;s definitely harder than you might expect.  </li>
            <li> so am unable to give much feedback on this one</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the hand grip.</li>
            <li> I had read a few of the reviews stating that this was too small of a head, too short of a handle, and too flimsy of a design.  </li>
            <li> But it works and is average.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it, but i&#x27;ll have to find a way to wear down the bristles some.</li>
            <li> Wisht the handle was a little longer but works as expected!</li>
            <li> The usual dry flaky winter skin is gone.  </li>
            <li> Very rough, ouch!</li>
            <li> When other reviewers said that these bristles were harsh, I just thought they were being babies...</li>
            <li> The bristles are not too hard but firm enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I has been less than two weeks</li>
            <li> I had never used one previously.</li>
            <li> But, the bristles are way too stiff and sharp feeling.</li>
            <li> but I wish it was a little longer.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiffer than I would like.  </li>
            <li> Feel a little cleaner than with just a wash rag.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a paint stirrer; it&#x27;s a little thicker but about the width.</li>
            <li> Once it gets a little soap on the handle</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the brush because the handle is not friendly at all.</li>
            <li> The brush is too harsh and it hurts when I use it.  </li>
            <li> Brush Head is too small, Dollar Store type/quality, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This purchase has been a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Let me say there is absolutely no way the handle is going to break on this thing, it&#x27;s a thick and sturdy piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> And mine is a one-piece design of heavy plastic that feels kinda like Lucite.  </li>
            <li> I bought one a few years ago, and found that it worked well for my preference of a vigorous scrub.</li>
            <li> Firm in the sense</li>
            <li> /&gt;bristles are a little too stiff, feels like it&#x27;s scratching</li>
            <li> The head may be slightly on the small side, but acceptable.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to dry complete.  </li>
            <li> But the slick plastic handle is hard to use when your hands are wet &amp; soapy.</li>
            <li> I guess it has to be stiff to be exfoliating, but I have to say I prefer softer bristles.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t seem too stiff at all.</li>
            <li> Even after repeated use, the brush is incredibility stiff.</li>
            <li> they are way too stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little small for a mans hand.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> I am disabled and have a hard time takin&#x27; a shower...</li>
            <li> But if small suits your needs, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this brush.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but HARSH!</li>
            <li> which is what led to my calling it too small.</li>
            <li> brush surface is a bit small but gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> No more bending and stretching with moments of pain and stiffness.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t apply excessive pressure during use and didn&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> The head of this brush is too small for me and the bristles are very firm.</li>
            <li> This brush is very harsh, which some people may like.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews about other brushes, I was really confused.</li>
            <li> I should of paid attention before buying it, is that the round part where the bristles are located is very small.</li>
            <li> It also will rinse clean even after its turned black from nasty grease that I am washing off.</li>
            <li> Not very good.</li>
            <li> I have places that are hard to get to.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars because it&#x27;s hard to hang onto when the soap gets to flying.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit hard to have the soapy feel and move it around..</li>
            <li> Not to hard.  </li>
            <li> Also the handle would be improved with a grip, it gets hard to hold if it gets too soapy.</li>
            <li> Some have complained about the stiffness of this brush.  </li>
            <li> the bad news is that I was still not able to reach some areas of my back.</li>
            <li> It is a bit awkward due to the small brush head.</li>
            <li> Bristles were too hard and it was not pleasant at all.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are WAY too hard to use!</li>
            <li> We found it to be too rough and impossible to use on our skin.</li>
            <li> uncomfortable shape of the handle makes for an unpleasant experience when trying to use this brush to scrub your back.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too slippery and tough to grip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months now and it hasn&#x27;t broken yet.  </li>
            <li> Angle is not great either.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> The brushes are firm, but I didn&#x27;t find them painful.</li>
            <li> Duh!!  </li>
            <li> Bristles are so hard that it&#x27;s a bit painful to use.  </li>

            <li> It needs a bend at the head, otherwise it&#x27;s fairly useless for the undercarriage.</li>

            <li> Well I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will soften over time, but this is probably the worst back brush I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> Too stiff, very painful to use.</li>
            <li> I use it to scrub the kid&#x27;s dirty feet and toes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nearly impossible to hang on to and has to be rinsed.</li>
            <li> So scratchy its painful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> its okay wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about how stiff the bristles are, but to me the bristles are softer than I expected and work very well.  I am tall and the brush is long enough to do the job.  I had a bamboo 2-piece brush that was too short and kept coming apart.  This is a better brush and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband is very picky about the strength of bristles and this brush makes him quite happy. It&#x27;s soft enough not to feel like it&#x27;s tearing his skin apart, but sturdy enough to make him feel clean. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love this brush def does the job and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the brush and stick coming apart</li>
            <li> Works great and price is competitive</li>
            <li> Good quality but bit harder brush. .. difficult to use</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have ended up with many of the soft, froufrou things masquerading as back brushes in your search to find a stiff bristled back brush; then look no further.  I searched around on Amazon and found 2 brushes that looked promising because the negative things that people had to say about them were that the bristles were too stiff.  I ordered both of them and I prefer the other one because the head is larger, but because of the smaller head on this one it is possible to put more force into scrubbing if desired.  This is the less expensive of the two brushes and it certainly does the job well enough.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;long handle provides great reach&lt;br /&gt;curved handle makes it easy to scrub your back&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;bristles are a little too stiff, feels like it&#x27;s scratching&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t lather up well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the bristles were a touch softer, I&#x27;d give this five stars.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m all that sensitive to pain and I can really feel the bristles digging into my back.  Other than that, it does what it is supposed to really well.</li>
            <li> This brush is good but I wish it was a little longer.  I need to put in eight more words.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a suitable replacement for my old favorite brush and bought this one.  I have to say after using it for a few days now that I really like this brush and have returned to buy another,(because you and I both know that as soon as you find something you like,  they quit making it).  The bristles are nice and stiff and are stout enough to give you a good scrubbing.  Just a recommendation: Buy Two!!</li>
            <li> I should have read the description more closely. Being a big guy, 15.5 inches doesn&#x27;t reach very far. But if small suits your needs, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this brush. It is a quality item.</li>
            <li> Bristles are WAY too hard to use!</li>
            <li> Bristles are extremely soft, and the head is just too small.  It needs a bend at the head, otherwise it&#x27;s fairly useless for the undercarriage. ;)</li>
            <li> love the brush just right</li>
            <li> Very rough, ouch! Need to replace, since my skin is too sensitive!</li>
            <li> Works great, but the bristles could be a bit softer.</li>
            <li> A good product that&#x27;s lasted many months. Great for scrubbing those hard-to-reach places.</li>
            <li> I tried to find the best deal for a bath brush and decided to buy this one.  However, I do regret it.  The brush is too harsh and it hurts when I use it.  It&#x27;s more like scratching than it is exfoliating.  Also, it rusts.  I has been less than two weeks and I make sure to clean it well and dry it complete, but what gets stuck in the bristle holes.  It is impossible to dry complete.  I guess that is what I get for trying to go cheap.  I think I am just going to stick to a traditional loofah or something.  It isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> cleans ball sack great</li>
            <li> The best back scrubber around!  It&#x27;s durable and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Wish the bath head was a little larger</li>
            <li> I had been wanting a brush that I could use in the shower for a while when I came across this one on Amazon. I can reach my back to wash it with soap, but I like the idea of scrubbing it to remove dead skin, etc. I had put together a cart of items and just needed a few more dollars to receive free shipping, so I added this to my list (for $5-something). I got my package in the mail and was opening it when my mother-in-law walked into the room. She announced that she had just purchased what appeared to be the same exact brush from the local grocery store for $2. I like the brush, but if I had known I could have picked it up with my dinner, I probably would have done that instead.</li>
            <li> I have a bad back so twisting around trying to clean my back beyond my shoulder blades is tricky. I like the feel of a well scrubbed back though. I have looked everywhere for a long (but not too long) handled back scrubber without any luck. Ran across this one during a random internet search. Should have thought to check Amazon first - they have everything!</li>
            <li> design of handle is too flexible to scrub efficiently.</li>
            <li> Terrible! So scratchy its painful!</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what I need it to, scrub my back where my arms can&#x27;t bend to reach, which comes in handy because I work around a lot of gray powder that can be tough to rinse off. The bristles are just right for me, I&#x27;d describe their firmness as &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;, on par with a fingernail brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are way too long. The soap just sinks to the bottom of the brush, leaving nothing on my skin when I try to use it to clean my back. Instead, I&#x27;ve just got hard bristles scraping my back, not cleaning it in any way.</li>
            <li> Brush Head is too small, Dollar Store type/quality, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great brush and it can be hung on a hook near your bath.</li>
            <li> The curve of the handle plus the angle of the brush mean that you&#x27;re trying to brush your back with just the edge of the brush, not the flat part – which, by the way, is extremely small: like about 2.5 inches across. Lame.</li>
            <li> The brush head was a little smaller than I expected and the bristles were very stiff.</li>
            <li> works just perfect. maybe add a rubber handle? but other than that I can&#x27;t complain for the money</li>
            <li> This is a really, really hard brush of super stiff bristles.  This feels like murder on my back.  I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> I have seen many review this product saying the bristles are to hard. If you have very tender skin, maybe. I find that this product is awesome. Nice long handle to reach everywhere. The coarseness of the bristles for me are perfect as I have very dry and itchy skin, I work outside in the cold alot and probably don&#x27;t hydrate enough, and they definitely satisfy the itch factor. Great for scrubbing bottom of the feet as well.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it says it is. It&#x27;s long enough to reach the hard-to-reach places of the back. The brush bristles hold the soap lather well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this brush. The bristles are way too soft to do any good.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this brush.  The bristles are a little stiffer than I would like.  However other brushes I&#x27;ve used were too soft.  I like that it has a plastic handle.  I think this will hold up better than a wooden one.</li>
            <li> Nice....sturdy ...makes your back (and feet) feel so good!</li>
            <li> a good, firm bristle brush, but the head is probably less than half the size of my previous brush, so it takes much more work to cover the same area.  handle is adequate and longer than many, but could still use a couple of inches more.  I would also like to see better gripping provisions on the head for close quarters usage.</li>
            <li> Scrubs great! Feel a little cleaner than with just a wash rag.</li>
            <li> Nice long handle, I love it.</li>
            <li> This thing wouldn&#x27;t exfoliate... something that exfoliates very easily.  The bristles are much too soft.  If you want a brush to scrub your skin clean, this definitely is not it.</li>
            <li> This purchase has been a waste of my money. The problem has been that the brush is not long enough to reach my lower back. Next time&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy a back loufa.</li>
            <li> We love this thing!  The handle is just long enough to give us a good reach of all the scrubbable bits, the bumps on the back are great for rubbing sore, tired feet.  We&#x27;ve had it a while now and use it almost daily and it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my back brush after several months of use... so I decided to go the cheap route.  Mistake!!!  This is in no way a soft bristle brush, and I can only describe it as feeling like one of those wire brushes that you use to clean grills. It HURTS! Even when applying the lightest pressure. It also doesn&#x27;t lather that well on the first try. I had to put soap on it several times before it would get the slightest lather, whereas my natural bristle brush took only the smallest amount. I use a special soap for body break outs, and it is a little pricey, so using more is not an option!  I gave it a two instead of one star rating because they did get the ergonomics right. It is comfortable to hold and even though it is small and shorter than other brushes I have owned, it has a good comfortable reach on it.  It isn&#x27;t for me though. My skin is way too soft and delicate and I will be returning this and just buying a natural bristle brush again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband over Christmas. The first time he used it he said it was a little tough on his back but we knew that from other reviews. After a month of use he had softened the bristles some and loves it. We have had it for three months and it&#x27;s the best product I could have puchased for my husband</li>
            <li> Much stiffer bristles than I was expecting.  Inexpensive but HARSH!</li>
            <li> He uses it all the time, and the skin on his back, is looking much healthier. Was well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush, better than a loofa</li>
            <li> This was nice, I don&#x27;t know what really could be wrong with a back brush so am unable to give much feedback on this one</li>
            <li> This brush is of decent quality and works well.  It has a pretty good reach and the brush bristles are stiff enough to clean well and remove dead skin, but not so stiff as to hurt you. It has a cord on the end of the handle so it can be hung easily.  Mine had a clear plastic handle.  If it were a bit cheaper, I&#x27;d give 5 stars, but a good solid 4 stars and a fair value shipped free via Prime.  It makes a great back scratcher, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2016-11-20 Update:  Raised my review rating to 5 stars after further consideration and reading a fair and valid comment on my review. While 4 stars (I like it) is a good rating, I agree that for the price 5 stars is reasonable. My brush has held up well (I only use it occasionally, but still, it&#x27;s well made and will last you a long time).</li>
            <li> Great price.  Nice, stiff, old school brush.  Cannot beat this in terms of cost &amp; quality. Sturdy and well built. We recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I like almost everything about this brush.  My only complaint is the hand grip. It&#x27;s a little small for a mans hand. The handle is long enough; and for my use the bristles are just right. They&#x27;re in that Goldie Lock zone; not to soft, and not to stiff. The head is only about two to three inches in diameter; but is very usable.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is only about two inches wide and about three eights of an inch thick which is what led to my calling it too small. My fingers go to far around to get a tight grip. It reminds me of a paint stirrer; it&#x27;s a little thicker but about the width. I know this won&#x27;t be much help to women reading this review; but the men who are most likely to be affected by this, will know what I&#x27;m getting at.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product at a very reasonable price; only the most delicate skin would have a problem with the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;And I have to address the only one star rating. In that rating the person complain of rust. I&#x27;m not sure that person was reviewing the right product; there is nothing that could possibly rust. It&#x27;s all plastic. Rust will almost certainly not be a problem.</li>
            <li> It is long enough and the bristles are stiff enough for a man&#x27;s back.  would have been nice if they could have incorporated a scrubby on the back of it, for soap, but it is a good brush</li>
            <li> My previous back brush was a fancy wood brush, but it turned pink.  This brush is all plastic - meaning it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.  It cleans well, using a bar of soap it creates a nice lather and the handle is easy to hold and reaches everywhere I need it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heads up to some - this is not a soft bristle brush, it&#x27;s not a wire brush hard, but it&#x27;s definitely harder than you might expect.  I actually prefer it that way.</li>
            <li> This is a great item, especially for the price. Perfect reach and it really does the job. It might take a little getting used to in the beginning, but your back WILL be exfoliated!</li>
            <li> Love it! Bristles work very well and hangs up nicely in my shower.</li>
            <li> I found the bath brush a bit rough on my sensitive skin, but my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews about other brushes, I was really confused. Lots of complaints about brushes breaking on their first use. Let me say there is absolutely no way the handle is going to break on this thing, it&#x27;s a thick and sturdy piece of plastic. When other reviewers said that these bristles were harsh, I just thought they were being babies...but they are pretty sharp! Honestly I think it&#x27;s good, because they wore over time and became just right, plus you want to give your skin a good scrub! It&#x27;s really helped to clear up the skin on my back, and I&#x27;ve got no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have gone through several all-natural bristle brushes in the past year: some shed their bristles, the wood cracked on others, and overall they didn&#x27;t hold up in the shower or perform well. I came across one review for this brush which  commented on the reach, and that sold me on giving it a try. What appears to be a non-organic, cheesy plastic brush has turned out to be my favorite yet. My usual nature is all-natural, however, this brush is exactly the feel I was looking for. The ergonomics are just right for me, and the plastic bristles do a better job scratching and washing my back than any of the boar bristled brushes did.</li>
            <li> I find the brush is too soft and doesn&#x27;t really feel like my back is clean. I need my brush a little harder.</li>
            <li> The bristles are invigorating without being scratchy and this came with a ribbon to hang it on my plastic hook I&#x27;ve got mounted in the tub surround.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2\\&quot; and this brush is long enough to scrub my whole back.  I use this after my workouts every day.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months now and it hasn&#x27;t broken yet.  For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.  Even if it breaks, a few months of use at this price is well worth it.  Also, the bristles have not fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer these plastic bristles and handles over sponge-like materials or ones with wooden handles (yes, even bamboo ones) since it&#x27;s easier to really clean and keep sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This worked alright, but the plastic handle despite crenellations was too slippery, so I wrapped the handle with a tape that made it much easier to hold onto.</li>
            <li> Great reach and it does what you need it to do. The bristles are not too hard but firm enough to get the job done. Also like that you can hang it almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> Too stiff, very painful to use. Should have read the reviews before I purchased it.  Going to buy one locally so I know what I&#x27;m getting before I buy it.</li>
            <li> I broke my left wrist and couldn&#x27;t reach my back or scrub my feet well so this helped a lot. The bristles are a little too stiff for my back but great for my feet.</li>
            <li> The brush is fine, however, I was a bit surprised by the small diameter of the brush head. It is only about 3&amp;#34; in diameter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bummed I bought this one. The head is SUPER small and the hanging hole at the end is also way too narrow to fit over the hook on any of our three shower caddies. We could get some rope or a rubber band and loop that through to hang it up; but we shouldn&#x27;t have to do that.</li>
            <li> Though this item looked like it would be useful. We found it to be too rough and impossible to use on our skin. We found another use for it as a bath brush for our dog.</li>
            <li> Ironically I was going through my email files today and came across a request for a review of the bath brush the day after it broke.  So we ordered it on April 8th 2012 and had daily average use of it till October 17th whereupon the handle snapped.  I don&#x27;t know how long we expect something that cost $5.99 to last.  It&#x27;s not that I feel super ripped off; it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve bought several brushes from various companies and they all seem to last 6 months, give or take...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it first arrived I was disappointed, because it was replacing a natural bristle brush in in comparison this felt very scratchy and harsh.  But either we got used to it or time softened that problem.  I have just replaced it with a new wooden handle natural bristle brush and it feels too soft, so I guess we did get used to this one.</li>
            <li> Great! All Around..Very Pleased, Very Happy..Peter and Family, USA..God Bless...</li>
            <li> disappointed was too small</li>
            <li> great back brush for the shower</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bath brush it did what it was suppose to and was a cheap price. Cant&#x27; really elaborate more than that</li>
            <li> The brash has very small had, it is tiny .I don&#x27;t liked . On picture look like it is regular size. Wasted many.</li>
            <li> Next to black, clear is my favorite color. A lot of back brushes come with wood handles or handles clearly designed for women. I&#x27;m a bodybuilder and a downtown professional. I like well-constructed, modern designs. This brush fits the bill. It is easy to use--even for a guy with muscle mass, it reaches my entire back, it is easy to keep clean, it has never developed mold after many uses, and the bristles have stayed white. As a bonus, appears to take up little space in the shower because it is clear. This keeps my bathroom looking clean and not cluttered--the way I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding comments from the fragile complainers: After using this many times I can say that the bristles are good enough to scrub my back over and over without being too soft or too hard.</li>
            <li> I had read a few of the reviews stating that this was too small of a head, too short of a handle, and too flimsy of a design.  The one I received is not any of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head is a good 3&amp;#34; circle, with more than 2.5&amp;#34; of bristles.  The length is about 15&amp;#34; from the tip to tip.  And mine is a one-piece design of heavy plastic that feels kinda like Lucite.  Nothing flimsy or teensy about the one I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can reach over my shoulder and almost completely to my waist when scrubbing my back.  I can reach up from my waist to my shoulder.  I can scrub my legs with very little contortionism, which is MY main concern, as I recently had back surgery and scrubbing my legs has become quite the chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased. And as an Add-On Item and free Prime Shipping - the $5 or so that I spent is well worth the price!  I am very happy with mine.</li>
            <li> Awesome, classic brush to reach your back.</li>
            <li> What can I say about a bath brush. It&#x27;s a brush and performs as it should. There is nothing magical about it.</li>
            <li> Scrubs my back and MY FRONT.  Amazing design.  Belongs in the Smithsonian. Can also be used in the shower.  Water resistant. Works with soap, too. Fantastic!  I&#x27;ll buy many more for gits for family and friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this almost 3 months now and have been using it regularly.  It is wonderful.  The bristles are just right for me.  It is plenty long for me.  I hope it lasts for a long time.  I haven&#x27;t dropped it, so have no idea how strong it is that way.  For me it is great.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a nice firmness. I like bristles that are very firm, and these are not too soft and not too firm. Plastic is of a good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought one a few years ago, and found that it worked well for my preference of a vigorous scrub. The brushes are firm, but I didn&#x27;t find them painful. I think for those with sensitive skin, maybe a softer brush is preferable. I personally would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Does a good job exfoliating.</li>
            <li> This is a soft brush but I can live with that, what I don&#x27;t like, and I should of paid attention before buying it, is that the round part where the bristles are located is very small.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, so I went for it. The brush is to stiff/harsh for just about any area except those with tougher thicker skin.</li>
            <li> this is a brush that reaches your back. small soft bristles may just push the soap instead of scrubbing. good handle, simple build and may break you wash like a savage.</li>
            <li> I love the tough bristles.  The extra long handle is both a plus and a minus--a plus for reaching down your back and lower extremities, but I end up banging the shower wall with the end of the handle when I scrub my elbows.  I do not like the slenderness of the handle, though--it&#x27;s too slippery and tough to grip.  A rounded, thicker handle would definitely be better.</li>
            <li> I like it. Firm bristles, good hand grip and the right length and angle to reach your entire back.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, shipped fast pretty color.</li>
            <li> Some have complained about the stiffness of this brush.  Folks, it says &amp;#34;exfoliating bath brush&amp;#34;.  Duh!!  What part of exfoliating do we not understand?  It takes a little getting used to - and then it feels great and refreshing.  The usual dry flaky winter skin is gone.  A great value.  No whining!</li>
            <li> The only suggestion I have is for a more curved handle. I have places that are hard to get to.</li>
            <li> This is a very good brush! The handle is long enough to reach all of your back and the brushes are soft, not to hurt and scratch. I have needed a brush like this for a long time and am glad that I bought this one. I works very well.</li>
            <li> Yes, this brush is one of the finest back washing brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. That being said, it&#x27;s only the second one I&#x27;ve owned. Just the right length, as well as the stiffness of the bristles. The correct angle of the head of the brush makes it work wonderful. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Bristles are pretty &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; for a good scrub.</li>
            <li> No wonder this was cheap. It&#x27;s way too rough to use on skin. It&#x27;s the same type of brush bristle that I use to scrub the shower walls. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> The back brush is perfect, it is the perfect size and works just as we wanted, just as we expected when ordered.</li>
            <li> I guess it has to be stiff to be exfoliating, but I have to say I prefer softer bristles. Also it was smaller than I expected - I would prefer a longer handle and a larger brush surface. But it is inexpensive and I think well-worth the money. I will probably use it to scrub my feet rather than my back, though.</li>
            <li> Since it does not say anything about its size (head) I thought it was the size of a regular bath brush.  I am using it, but as soon as I have the opportunity will buy a larger one.&lt;br /&gt;It is ok if you are looking for a rather small size bath brush.</li>
            <li> Great brush for those hard to reach back areas works great would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this as a bath brush along with a bamboo back scratcher.  The bamboo back scratcher ended up in the trash and my fiancee and I use this to reach those occasionally itchy spots.  Extremely sturdy and it feels oh so good when you have an itch on your back that you just can&#x27;t reach.</li>
            <li> This back brush has a good grip and nice firm bristles. It&#x27;s great for hard to reach areas and for back scratching too.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but you must be a bit flexible</li>
            <li> At first I also thought it was a little rough, but it breaks in with use.</li>
            <li> When I bought this brush I intended to use it as an all-purpose bath brush, much like a sponge or loofah, but it is definitely designed for exfoliating.  I have really sensitive skin and I like how the nylon bristles provide a pleasant exfoliation without scratching or being too rough.  The nubs on the back are good when dry for your feet or hands but with soap or water they become too slick to really do much.  The handle is long and helps you reach areas without bending or stretching like a gymnast, but is very slick when wet which can be worked around by wrapping a washcloth around it to give you better grip.</li>
            <li> This brush does not have enough angle on the handle to the brush for me.  I&#x27;m tall so it might help me if the handle was 4-6&amp;#34; longer.</li>
            <li> A great back scrubber and  hard to reach areas, but don&#x27;t like the idea of having to replace it every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars because it&#x27;s hard to hang onto when the soap gets to flying. Great arch for reaching back.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a brush...for scrubbing your back. Mine was clear--not blue. It has a good intensity as far as bristles go. This won&#x27;t last too long I suspect. But who cares? Wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> Best shower brush I ever had! First I thought the brush was too soft, but while using it I found it does exfoliate. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Brush head is far too small, have fun soaping it up 4-5 times to wash your back.  Angle is not great either.  That aside, the quality is fine.</li>
            <li> this is an awesome brush! I have had a few brushes over the years where the bristles are either too soft or too hard and this is the perfect balance!</li>
            <li> handle snapped after 3 uses, it just cant take the pressure. my advice is to try and find something else</li>
            <li> Solid bath brush, surprisingly it&#x27;s remained very clean in the shower and the bristles have held up well under use</li>
            <li> i used it once and the soap comes out semi well but it&#x27;s a bit hard to have the soapy feel and move it around..mostly for the soft rubbing of the bumps, feels a ok.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  Bristles were too hard and it was not pleasant at all.  I threw it away and bought a different one.</li>
            <li> My first brush but I am sold,  this has held up very well.  Plan on purchasing one for our RV as well</li>
            <li> A very nice bath brush for washing my back.  You simply add soap to the bristels and wash away. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like this bath brush because 1) it&#x27;s a good length so I can reach my entire back,  2) the bristles are stiff enough to do a good job of exfoliating,  3) the handle and head of the brush curve inward, not outward. The inward curve lines up better with the natural curvature of my spine/back so the entire face of the brush makes contact my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that these brushes only last me about a year before they snap in half after being used vigorously on a daily basis.  But for the money, they are still a good value to last a year. I buy them 2 at a time now.</li>
            <li> My father is having rotator cuff surgery on his dominant hand so he needs some help to shower.  The length is good and it doesn&#x27;t feel like one of those thin plastic things that will break easily on you.  Good curve to it.  Comfortable handle.  But yeah these bristles are rough.  I didn&#x27;t think my dad of all people would complain but after a couple of showers he said it was a bit like a wire brush.  I soaked it in some fabric softener and I think that might help.  But the back side with the little knobs was nice.</li>
            <li> This was gifted. But I chose it because it was Pretty. BLiP:D</li>
            <li> Perfectly fine. No problems.</li>
            <li> I think my pain tolerance is pretty high, but jeeeeez this scrubber is rough. Its definitely exfoliating alright, because it takes off the top layer of skin. I could clean the floor with this brush! I&#x27;ll keep it, but i&#x27;ll have to find a way to wear down the bristles some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since this past summer of 2013, and it&#x27;s a decent product to help scrub my back. Like some other reviews had mentioned, it&#x27;s a bit rough when using this the first time: it kind of feels like sand paper, but honestly, after the first one or two times, your skin becomes acclimated and it becomes a pleasure to use. In fact, this might be the best back scratcher of all time in addition to it&#x27;s cleansing capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The length is just about right: I&#x27;m able to reach all areas of my back without dislocating any shoulders or straining any muscles.</li>
            <li> Great for my son to scrub his back, really helping with his acne.  Very sturdy, nice compact head is easy to maneuver.  Would also be wonderful for an older person who has trouble reaching places in the shower.</li>
            <li> Nice brush. It is what it is. Time will tell how durable it is.</li>
            <li> works well, reaches my whole back. bristles are rough but it makes me feel like my body is getting a good scrub, i always use a loofah to scrub my body and i feel this brush is exfoliating without being hurtful or making my skin raw.</li>
            <li> Nice stiff brush really scrubs the back. I tried it while sitting in my chair and it didn&#x27;t seem too stiff at all. When I got it into the shower and my back was wet it was different. My back felt like it was really scrubbed. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the handle is a little too short for me.</li>
            <li> A good product at a low price.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in both shoulders which makes washing my back a chore. I decided to try this brush to see if it would help. It was delivered at the usual speed of Amazon in great shape. The quality is first rate and should last a life time. That&#x27;s the good news... the bad news is that I was still not able to reach some areas of my back. This is not a fault of the brush; the handle is well shaped and a nice length and should work well for most others. I finally ordered a \\&quot;Dual Sided Back Scrubber\\&quot; from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002DQMZ5M Dual Sided Back Scrubber/Massager]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use both items in my quest for a clean back and would recommend these products to anyone...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard L. Gardner</li>
            <li> Finally a brush that is long enough! I love this brush. The brush is pretty firm, which I like. I can&#x27;t stand those soft bristle brushes. I need something I feel is doing it&#x27;s job! And this does. Will definitely buy another.</li>
            <li> This works for me as a back scrubbing brush.  Not to hard.  Not to soft.  Great price.  Clear plastic construction.</li>
            <li> I use this for skin brushing for my lymphedema to massage the lymph nodes in my legs.  the bristles aren&#x27;t too hard or soft and the handle isn&#x27;t flimsy like others in this price range.  its a longer handle so I can reach easily. even the backs of my legs.</li>
            <li> Took over a year to break the handle. Dropped many many times. After reading the reviews, I knew the bristles were rough, and they are, so don&#x27;t go to town on your back like you&#x27;re trying to clean your grill after a BBQ. It holds the soap as long as you stay out of the water stream. Awesome for scratching your back.</li>
            <li> Tough bristles, light weight, easy to hold.  It shows no signs of cracking or wear after several weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased</li>
            <li> Very good scrubber. Sturdy. Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Good price. Does its job. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> We really like the stiffness of the bristles. Just wish the head was larger. And the handle was longer. But the price is so right, we&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little disappointed with this. It was a little shorter than I expected, and it felt flimsy. I figured I&#x27;d just wasted money on a cheap back brush. Well I was wrong. This has a nice bend to it, which helps when trying to apply proper pressure for cleaning that hard to reach middle back area. Have not used the opposite side massage ripples, but the scrubbing head works well, and as expected. A 5 Star rating for a 5 Star product and price.</li>
            <li> This brush reminds me of the facial scrub brushes I use in the morning, but it&#x27;s for your body. It was a smart buy, I will purchase more to put in gift baskets!</li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t anything special, the angle of the curve could be better... the brush kinda angles back at the neck which seems a little counter productive. The thing was only 5 bucks though, not really worth paying to return.</li>
            <li> I am disabled and have a hard time takin&#x27; a shower...thanks to this product I can once again reach my feet with no pain...thanks</li>
            <li> This brush does the job, and it&#x27;s made from synthetic fibers (not animal fur/hair). So it&#x27;s cruelty free. The bristles are not too hard and not too soft.</li>
            <li> Brush is effective-- you can actually scrub.  But the slick plastic handle is hard to use when your hands are wet &amp; soapy. Some kind of wood or rubber grip would be useful.</li>
            <li> Technically, this product will get your back very clean.  It does this by removing the top layers of skin.  The bristles are very hard and since the brush is so small, takes a long time to clean everywhere.  It actually hurts to use it.  Maybe it will soften over time, but this is probably the worst back brush I&#x27;ve had.  The only reason I haven&#x27;t returned it is because the shipping would negate the refund.</li>
            <li> Brush stiffness: Medium.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived at the house with the bristles flattened on one side of the brush. I was able to get them to relax back to normal enough to use it. But, the bristles are way too stiff and sharp feeling. It felt like a wooden board that had nails pushed through it. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Unlike all other brushes, this one has STIFF bristles, the handles that does not bend, and it is NOT wooden. Hence, it does what Iwant it to do: it scrubs well without rotting. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just less limber than most.  I really have to struggle to reach parts of my back with this and other similar brushes.  Must be a better way.</li>
            <li> Personally I find this brush too abrasive to use on my back. I was pretty bummed about that but it does work great on exfoliating my legs and feet so it wasn&#x27;t a total waste. I am back to looking for a good back brush though.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are a little bit harsh if you have sensitive skin, but they do a fantastic job exfoliating. It&#x27;s easy to rinse and doesn&#x27;t hold onto the soap like some other brushes do (where you rinse and rinse and they never stop foaming). I wish the brush head was bigger though. Also the handle would be improved with a grip, it gets hard to hold if it gets too soapy. But these are minor issues. Mainly I just wanted something to slough off all that dull winter skin, and it&#x27;s perfect for that job. Just moisturize and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Durable, great size. Meets my needs.</li>
            <li> I need a good scrubber that help with my bad back and with its roughness helps clean my back way more than a soft one could.</li>
            <li> Great Quality Product. Make the purchase, You&#x27;ll be so glad you did:-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush, it has an adequately long handle and it works as intended.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the picture is blue So I thought it would be blue. Though if I had read the complete title I would have seen that they only ship clear or green. not your choice just luck of the draw. Sturdy enough though....I just wanted Blue!</li>
            <li> I really needed a back scrub brush to get at the spots I can&#x27;t reach. Winter dries my skin and that makes for itchy places, but with a good back brush I can get to the problem spot. I wish the bristles were a little stiffer, to better scrub away dry flaky skin, but I think it&#x27;s just right for regular cleansing.</li>
            <li> uncomfortable shape of the handle makes for an unpleasant experience when trying to use this brush to scrub your back.  Needs a handle on the handle!</li>
            <li> Great brush for the person who likes a hard bristle brush. I like this brush for the firmness while others with more sensitive skin may not care for it. Other brushes that I have owned lose their bristles while this one does not. If you want a stiff brush that does a good job of scrubbing this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> Love this so much, I went back and got one for Mommy. Makes a great back scratcher.</li>
            <li> very stiff but not enough to hurt well made reaches about right too very good for feet and other tough stuff</li>
            <li> In the shower. The long handle and fairly aggressive brush is what I was looking for and this does it.&lt;br /&gt;The brush surface is a bit small but gets the job done well. The handle has good gripping grooves and the ark / curve of the handle make the back cleaning easy. I like the way it scrubs so well I use it on my feet as well. I bought 3-each to keep stock next few years or more.</li>
            <li> This is a good strong bath brush. Perhaps the only criticism that I have about it is - there isn&#x27;t much on the head of the brush to hold body wash.When putting the liquid soap onto the bristles it tends to drop to the bottom of the bristles and out the holes on the plastic head. So I probably lose about 50% of the soap in this way. But it does give a god scrub with the remaining soap.</li>
            <li> Good brush the curved handle helps hit hard to reach spots. It does get slippery in your hand when your hand is soapy.</li>
            <li> Works. Good little stiff!!</li>
            <li> This is a great back scrubber at an awesome price.  The size of the handle is good for reaching entire back.  The brush is a bit small but the bristles are rough enough to let you know you&#x27;re getting a good scrub.  The bristles also hold soap well.</li>
            <li> Expected the brush head to be larger. Haven&#x27;t used it yet - the bristles seem strong - just wish it was larger.</li>
            <li> This washes my back and also scrubs all the grease off me from work that&#x27;s hard to get off. It also will rinse clean even after its turned black from nasty grease that I am washing off. I love it and its super durable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I had shoulder surgery. This brush works well. It&#x27;s slighlt curved which is of benefit for effective cleaning. It&#x27;s a good length and seems to be made of a hard, durable plastic. The head may be slightly on the small side, but acceptable.</li>
            <li> just what the title say&amp;#34;s,feels like you are using 80 grit sandpaper on your back....do no recommend it for your back.</li>
            <li> cheap cheap cheap....fits in my gyn bag, yet the handle is long enough to reach my whole back...bristles are stiff enough to do the job but doesnt take off skin...will buy another when this one wears out</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and decided to give this brush a try. The reach is adequate for me, and the brush head is a little on the small side, but is manageable. The one thing I discovered is the handle becomes rather slippery once my hand becomes wet. The handle is flat plastic, with some plastic &amp;#34;ridges&amp;#34; near the end of the handle, As soon as I wet the brush and applied body wash, the handle became a little difficult to hold on to. Not quite sure how I&#x27;ll address this, but I like the brush enough to see if there&#x27;s something I can do to make the handle less slippery. Still, a good value, and I may probably buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Rated it 3 star as i expected bristles to be bit softer. Next time I will go with multipurpose brush that can scrub back and help put lotions as well..</li>
            <li> This was part of a &amp;#34;gift basket&amp;#34; Amazon shipped for me.  My mom likes it because she can no longer stand one-legged in the shower and she felt her feet were not getting scrubbed well enough.  She really likes the brush and uses it.</li>
            <li> The length of the handle is nice but the bristles are so stiff that it hurts to use. I even held it under hot water for a while to soften it a bit but it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay bath brush, but I wish it were longer, I&#x27;ve got short arms. Does anyone make a 20 inch bath brush? Otherwise, we&#x27;re good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything you expect it to be.  Bristles feel great.  Handle feels firm and is long enough to reach your feet if you don&#x27;t like bending over.  Lil ribbon doodle so you can hang it up.  Some nubbies on the back of the head so you can....massage after exfoliating?  I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t judge!</li>
            <li> Not very sturdy, so it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Wisht the handle was a little longer but works as expected!</li>
            <li> Love it. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims, and so far we haven&#x27;t had any warping or loss of the bristles. Good buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and does exactly what it says it will do.  Reach those hard to reach places on your back while bathing.  It does not mold or mildew while hanging in the shower/tub area and keeps its shape for years.  I highly recommend this product for others.</li>
            <li> Its like scrubbing with a wire brush. Even after repeated use, the brush is incredibility stiff. Other brushes I&#x27;ve use seem to soften with age, this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Have to my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I guess it looked bigger in the photo... I was hoping for something a little larger. But the real problem is the bristles... they are way too stiff. Good for cleaning tires and peeling potatoes, but not good for the skin (unless exfoliating to the point of pain is your thing).</li>
            <li> This brush is very harsh, which some people may like. I find it unusable, however. Better for scrubbing the shower than taking one.</li>
            <li> Not much can be said for a brush.  This one is fine and works as hoped.  The head is a little smaller than I expected but not a problem.  The bristles are somewhat short, making them stiffer, thus, I suppose, the &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; part of the brush.  The handle is as long as expected and needed.</li>
            <li> Looks good and is well made, but the bristles will absolutely tear into your skin...a little too rough for me.</li>
            <li> At 65yrs of age, my joints tend to tighten on any movements I need to reach. This long reach handle Exfoliating Bath Brush has given me the comfort of a cleaner wash in the shower. No more bending and stretching with moments of pain and stiffness. The exfoliating brush is definitely essential to the skin, which I favor most. I never use lufas. They hold bacteria from each use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok brush. Firm in the sense it feels like a new brush.  It feels like the brush I bought from the local Target a few years ago. That brush is just softer now. Only time will tell if that firmness lasts. In any event, my biggest grip with this brush is that it&#x27;s tiny. Not only the brush head but the handle which feels thin and fragile.  Every time I use it I am struck by the idea that it must be designed for a child.</li>
            <li> The head of this brush is too small for me and the bristles are very firm. It will take a while to soften them up. It seems pretty strong though.</li>
            <li> Take the extra leap and buy the brush that isn&#x27;t too small. This brush takes a while to wash with, and the angle could have been designed better, so that you can actually reach most of your back.</li>
            <li> Yes this purchase has truly confirmed I have become a shut in and shun all personal contact and solely rely on Amazon. So you my blessed Amazonians, seekers of truth, and 5 star ratings on ANYTHING; shall gain the wisdom of my trials and tribulations with my trusted “Wand of Cleanliness.” The first time I stripped and wrapped my filthy hands around its strong solid long gnarled shaft and started rubbing its large bristled head all over my body I knew I had made the right decision. Just don’t try and brush your teeth with it, because that’s even crazier than reading this review.</li>
            <li> It feels like sand paper on my back...</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. Thank you!</li>
            <li> A little stiff as far as the brush...but its ok. Good for elbows and feet more than my back. Hopefully the bristles will soften up in time.</li>
            <li> not quite as long as I&#x27;d like, bristles comfortable, maybe a little on the soft side. Good for the price, if you aren&#x27;t looking for something with firm bristles. If you&#x27;re over 6 foot tall, look for something longer.</li>
            <li> Others have complained about the hard bristles, which is true.  This is not a soft, warm and fuzzy type of brush, hence the name &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; in the name of it.  I expected it to perform exactly as it does but wish the handle was longer with a bit more of a curve to make it easier.  But it works and is average.</li>
            <li> It works. Feels like the scrub brush used for NBC contamination. But that is a good thing.</li>
            <li> What can I say its a back brush and does the Job at a decent price. It is a bit awkward due to the small brush head. So if your used to the bigger ones this may not be up to par for you. I most likely will not buy this one again due to that but its a good price for a thrifty spender.    Updated this after weeks of Use.</li>
            <li> Great product. I had never used one previously. Bristles provide friction but not pain. Didn&#x27;t get moldy like loofah did. I will recommend</li>
            <li> Bath brush is&lt;br /&gt;perfect for what I needed and it has held up fine so far after 4 months of use</li>
            <li> Nice handle length. Good grip on the handle as well. Bristles are nice and stiff but a little scratchy. Feels more rough that a natural bristle.</li>
            <li> Sent me a white one instead of the blue one shown here, but otherwise does the job, seems a little flimsy.  I find it works best to apply lotion to my back instead of using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Tossed after 2 months. Not very good. Used in the shower. Even with thorough cleaning, mildewed up in 2 months.</li>
            <li> I like this back brush it does the job of cleaning my back pretty well and lasts a long long time.</li>
            <li> This brush was made of very brittle plastic.  Within a week it was dropped and broke immediately.</li>
            <li> This is the best back brush I have found, I am 6 ft tall.&lt;br /&gt;This is perfect amount of pressure, suds up nice and has a pretty good grippable handle!&lt;br /&gt;Just need to tie a longer rope on the end so you can wrap around your wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must for men!</li>
            <li> Great little scrubber. Very light, it won&#x27;t break if you drop it in the shower. Great pricing and quick shipping. They say to replace a brush every three&lt;br /&gt;months.  I soak it in vinegar and water to disinfect it every two weeks.</li>
            <li> The damn brush broke right off of the handle the third time that I used it. Not to mention that the third time happened to be over a month after I got it. I bring that up to say that it wasn&#x27;t three days straight of vigorous use, this product just isn&#x27;t good and probably deserves NO STARS</li>
            <li> This reaches all the spots I couldn&#x27;t.  Feels great.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Exfoliating\\&quot; is an understatement.  This brush is harsh enough to tear the skin right off your body.  As another reviewer noted,you could mistake it for the wire brush for your barbeque grill.  I bought this at my local CVS, not on Amazon, because the handle of my old brush had broken, and this was the only one CVS sold.  Found the same brush on Amazon while shopping for a replacement that would actually work.  If your goal is self-flagellation, buy this brush.  Otherwise, give it a pass.</li>
            <li> I love this bath brush</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job. Not much else to say.  03/24/2015: Update... worked well for awhile. Suddenly broke after about a month of owning it. Didn&#x27;t apply excessive pressure during use and didn&#x27;t use it every day. Shame. It snapped just below the handle, actually snapping in the brush section.</li>
            <li> This brush has turned out to be more handy than I&#x27;d imagined. Soft bristles help in the exfoliating of dead skin from  on my leg stump, ridding the build-up of skin that attracts malodorous stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite pleased.</li>
            <li> But it was cheap and can make it work.  Stiff bristles as stated before but with the right kind of soap, it works</li>
            <li> Love everything about this brush - lavendar color is perfect, handle is perfect length. Thanks for an enjoyable &#x27;clean&#x27; product and efficient delivery!</li>
            <li> I Give two stars because the brush part is good. not too soft, not too hard. However the handle is made of the kind of plastic that bend a little bit and then shatters into many pieces. the plastic material is the same as a CD/DVD only thicker. Mine didnt shatter, but if i scrubbed hard enough it would. just packed it up and shipping it back. Use at your own risk!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this bath brush, but not in love.  I&#x27;m short, so the length is good for me.  It may be too short of a handle for someone that is on the tall side though.</li>
            <li> I do like this product and it is much nicer and cleaner than the wooden versions, which splinter with wear. Exactly like the &amp;#34;Aquasentials Long Handle Bath Brush (15.5in) (Clear Handle)&amp;#34;. I bought both not realizing that, other than shape, they were the same. Very nice. I would not call this an exfoliating brush. Brush needs to be harder or have a rougher surface on reverse side. It would also be very helpful to find one with a longer handle.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush. Makes washing your back much easier. My only qualm is the slippery handle. Once it gets a little soap on the handle it&#x27;s nearly impossible to hang on to and has to be rinsed. Maybe a wooden handle would be better?</li>
            <li> Great product for me, one of the big boys out there.  Reaches every inch of my back and that&#x27;s saying a lot.........hahaha.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the brush because the handle is not friendly at all. It&#x27;s large but you can&#x27;t get a good grip. The bristles are to rough for my skin. I don&#x27;t recomend the product for personal use. Maybe it will get softer overtime, but as of right now it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Nice stiff bristles - ideal for vigorous scrubbing.  Stays clean with a good rinsing.  Highly recommended if you like a stiff brush.</li>
            <li> Not much can be said about a back brush.  It does the job. Will plan to order another one just to have a spare available when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> Bristles are so hard that it&#x27;s a bit painful to use.  I ended up buying a different one.</li>
            <li> I loved the angle of the arm.  But after the 3rd use, it broke in two.  If there were a more sturdy option...I would buy it, because the bath brush is much more exfoliating than a loofa.</li>
            <li> Dad seems to like it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and sturdy. A good brush. I use it to scrub the kid&#x27;s dirty feet and toes.</li>
            <li> Excellent, very hard bristle bath brush. It looks good and it scrubs good but it is NOT for those who want just a stiff brush much less a soft brush.</li>
            <li> I have been happily using this brush regularly for several months now.  A few of the outer bristles are beginning to show wear, but overall it is holding up well.  It is not too rough nor too soft; I enjoy using it on dry skin to really exfoliate my legs, or in the shower with body wash to get my back clean well after a good workout.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold well in your hand and doesn&#x27;t have enough curve.</li>
