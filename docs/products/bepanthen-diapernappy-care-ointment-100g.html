            <li>I love this magic stuff!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many creams for my kids and this one has worked by far the best.</li>
            <li>More convenient, cheaper, and easier to use than most tattoo creams.</li>
            <li>I took her many times to the pediatrician and he kept saying that was something I was eating and passing through the breast milk</li>
            <li>many moms there do it.</li>
            <li>Simply THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried almost everything over many years.  </li>
            <li>better then any ointment out there for baby</li>
            <li>Love it</li>

            <li>You can use Vaseline or coconut oil for top layer too to help create a barrier</li>
            <li>absolutely love Bepanthen and will buy again.</li>
            <li>otherwise i love it.</li>
            <li>It seems to have outstanding healing properties.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Works like magic..</li>
            <li>With Bepanthen, it&#x27;s more like 4-5 days,</li>
            <li>I love it ...........</li>
            <li>Kind of pricy but totally worth it since she is now rash-free again!</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;s going to be like a miracle ointment because of those reviews but it does works pretty good</li>
            <li>but this is wonderful for dry lips.  </li>
            <li>i just wish they would change the tube, it splits easily.</li>
            <li>This easily beats out the desitins and zinc oxides of the world.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the BEST stuff for  aby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>It heals the diaper rash in light speed; you can see the difference after just one day.</li>
            <li>It is un-preserved and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Plus it was free</li>
            <li>and I leave it in my face during all day and the results is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>At that time we lived in France and this cream was available in every pharmacy.</li>
            <li>Im from turkey and was familiar with this brand.</li>
            <li>I read a review originally about Panthenol and how they were using it as diaper cream in Europe.</li>
            <li>Priced right, and, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but I was not buying it specially</li>
            <li>nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Shipping and the order came true just wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product, very helpful for baby.</li>
            <li>Good treatment for skin problems (not only for babies BTW).</li>
            <li>Another very good diaper cream on usual days which leave no residue.</li>
            <li>Very good for rashes that are hard to cure specially for baby taking antibiotic or premature ones.</li>
            <li>Great ointment for our little one.</li>
            <li>Bepanthen is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on a fresh tattoo on the recommendation of a tattoo artist friend of mine across the pond.</li>
            <li>so I started using other creams but none of the as good as bepanthen.</li>
            <li>I knew something wasn&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>so gentle and yet quick</li>
            <li>Her face hasn&#x27;t completely healed but even within two days I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only using this as her dipper rash cream, the pediatrician in Brazil said was ok and</li>
            <li>Also I love that it has no white residue when changing a diaper.</li>
            <li>let me check amazon and sure enough like everything else they had it.</li>
            <li>Received it much sooner than informed, thank you!</li>
            <li>I have some hot spots.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go out in public with it, well, sure you CAN, but chances are you don&#x27;t want to.  </li>
            <li>while breast feeding my 10 month old baby!!!!</li>
            <li>got my  whole family using this for any thing from a diaper rash to skin conditions due to old age - great stuff.</li>
            <li>Excellent ointment for all sorts of dry skin conditions, from nappy rash, chafes, cracked nipples from nursing, to dry lips and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used it often specially when he started eating adult food.</li>
            <li>It took really long but its ok</li>
            <li>Highly recommend as a staple supply for the home first aid kit.</li>
            <li>Also good when you&#x27;ve rubbed your skin raw in new shoes.</li>
            <li>Use on the whole family, for any parts of the body.</li>
            <li>It is much oiler and creates a barrier.</li>
            <li>It is brilliant, I will no longer buy anything else even though it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bayer.</li>
            <li>it really helps on preventing rashes and it also took care of the skin..</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bepanthen n Vaseline</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>was just one more thing to add to my endless list.</li>
            <li>Normally 2 days and the rash has vanished!</li>
            <li>Love the cream for my children face and any other issue they have on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other ointment I have tried.</li>
            <li>It goes on very nicely and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Now he is older</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>this is highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>In Brazil it is highly recommended by pediatricians.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly allergic.  </li>
            <li>In the other day my face skin is so soft, looking healthy, as a baby skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use yet, but I think is normal like always as I buy in a pharmacy</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>Like my first I put the &amp;#34;diaper rash creams&amp;#34; they sell here when I could see it starting</li>
            <li>I have a rare skin condition that gets quite flaky and dry.  </li>
            <li>I been using now for a year and half, love it that does not leave a white residue.</li>
            <li>I have tried many ointments ,creams etc with little improvement of red areas on her buttocks.</li>
            <li>We used this since she was born and until she was 6 months old.</li>
            <li>old Mom,who is incont..and wears diapers.</li>
            <li>and this thing last for ever............as my daught doesnt get much rash..............</li>
            <li>wow ..</li>
            <li>My fault completely</li>
            <li>I had very high hopes for this as a dry skin aide.  </li>
            <li>Both babies have a very sensitive skin and only after putting this cream once, the redness disappears.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended !!!!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping than I expected.</li>
            <li>Now apparently they are labeling it as &amp;#34;Diaper Cream&amp;#34; officially.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> let me check amazon and sure enough like everything else they had it.</li>
            <li> Received it much sooner than informed, thank you!</li>
            <li> I have some hot spots.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go out in public with it, well, sure you CAN, but chances are you don&#x27;t want to.  </li>
            <li> while breast feeding my 10 month old baby!!!!</li>
            <li> got my  whole family using this for any thing from a diaper rash to skin conditions due to old age - great stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent ointment for all sorts of dry skin conditions, from nappy rash, chafes, cracked nipples from nursing, to dry lips and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used it often specially when he started eating adult food.</li>
            <li> It took really long but its ok</li>
            <li> Highly recommend as a staple supply for the home first aid kit.</li>
            <li> Also good when you&#x27;ve rubbed your skin raw in new shoes.</li>
            <li> Use on the whole family, for any parts of the body.</li>
            <li> It is much oiler and creates a barrier.</li>
            <li> It is brilliant, I will no longer buy anything else even though it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Thanks Bayer.</li>
            <li> it really helps on preventing rashes and it also took care of the skin..</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bepanthen n Vaseline</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> was just one more thing to add to my endless list.</li>
            <li> Normally 2 days and the rash has vanished!</li>
            <li> Love the cream for my children face and any other issue they have on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any other ointment I have tried.</li>
            <li> It goes on very nicely and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Now he is older</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> this is highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> In Brazil it is highly recommended by pediatricians.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly allergic.  </li>
            <li> In the other day my face skin is so soft, looking healthy, as a baby skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use yet, but I think is normal like always as I buy in a pharmacy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> Like my first I put the &amp;#34;diaper rash creams&amp;#34; they sell here when I could see it starting</li>
            <li> I have a rare skin condition that gets quite flaky and dry.  </li>
            <li> I been using now for a year and half, love it that does not leave a white residue.</li>
            <li> I have tried many ointments ,creams etc with little improvement of red areas on her buttocks.</li>
            <li> We used this since she was born and until she was 6 months old.</li>
            <li> old Mom,who is incont..and wears diapers.</li>
            <li> and this thing last for ever............as my daught doesnt get much rash..............</li>
            <li> wow ..</li>
            <li> My fault completely</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this as a dry skin aide.  </li>
            <li> Both babies have a very sensitive skin and only after putting this cream once, the redness disappears.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended !!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping than I expected.</li>
            <li> Now apparently they are labeling it as &amp;#34;Diaper Cream&amp;#34; officially.  </li>
            <li> It fixed the problem rather faster than I expected!</li>
            <li> /&gt;One tube will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only found two ways to repair dry lips:</li>
            <li> Put it on at bedtime, use an old pillowcase, and wipe off remaining ointment the next morning before washing face as usual.  </li>
            <li> It is a big mystery why Bephanten is not in the US market, it would have run all other rash creams out of market.</li>
            <li> My son, since beginning mixed feeding, has had a rash that has not gone away with Destin and other creams I used before.</li>
            <li> Between&lt;br /&gt;this and other products I alternate with, it helps&lt;br /&gt;heal</li>
            <li> Maybe quite expensive but the health of my child really worth it !</li>
            <li> when they fall on there knees if you have eczema dry spots</li>
            <li> We use it on burns, dry lips, insect bites, it works for almost everything.</li>
            <li> I tried every single thing you name it, people would say it worked</li>
            <li> when i see that he&#x27;s getting a little red</li>
            <li> We not only use it for diaper rash but also for little cuts and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> The product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> It also came a lot faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I use this product when my son has a very bad diaper rash, and it&#x27;s pretty much healed by the next diaper change.</li>
            <li> The estimated delivery seems very long but for each order, much less than that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it myself on dry areas and it helps in less then 24 hourd.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely recommend, do not spend money on any other nonsense.</li>
            <li> I have no choice but to try other nappy cream from the shelves.</li>
            <li> I have already told two other people about it and they are now hooked on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nappy ointment for both my babies, they get rashes if I substitute it with other nappy cream.</li>
            <li> My baby has extreme cradle cap and eczema on her face.</li>
            <li> all the other ones........</li>
            <li> I was super desperate to help my baby face.</li>
            <li> I can not change it for any other!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars even though it didn&#x27;t dramatically help with the diaper rash problem but it helped with the other two!</li>
            <li> Thecestimated arrival was in 4 week (from England) but came in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It would keep the inflammation down a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bepanthen for my little girl since she was born.</li>
            <li> My little girl got rashes after using these creams.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t do without it for my little one.</li>
            <li> This cream soothed it a little bit but wouldn&#x27;t cure it.</li>
            <li> I should have dug a little deeper though...</li>
            <li> Few months ago I was ike</li>
            <li> go within a few hours of using&lt;br /&gt;rubs</li>
            <li> When I saw her crying because of that I just started looking online for bepanthen again and found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I used to take up to two weeks to fully heal from a fairly heavy duty glycolic peel.  </li>
            <li> If anything a lot of other baby creams made her worse.</li>
            <li> also works on other bad skin abrasions such as severe burns.</li>
            <li> I already knew about it because it is commonly used in Brazil.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with my baby when she was born and no cream, I mean no cream worked until this one.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After having my babies, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy them this ointment especially for their terrible red rash.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny - This cream helped get rid of a nasty rash, after multiple ounces of prescription crap just wouldn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> In fact some of them made it worse.</li>
            <li> Do not torture your babies with useless products like vaseline, powders, or etc.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds weird</li>
            <li> I was desperate and was overjoyed when I found Bepanthen on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Too bad you can&#x27;t get this in the US.</li>
            <li> I bought the cream because my baby had a bad rash that wouldn&#x27;t go away no mater what I tried.</li>
            <li> tube annoying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m literally so shocked that this cream is working the way it is!</li>
            <li> Diaper rush gone in matter of hours (unless the rush is very bad it may require a bit longer</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> always works well i just wish they would change the tube, it splits easily.</li>
            <li> My son never got a rash because I always use Bepanthen on every diaper change. I already knew about it because it is commonly used in Brazil. It is the best for babies.</li>
            <li> Excellent ointment for all sorts of dry skin conditions, from nappy rash, chafes, cracked nipples from nursing, to dry lips and sensitive skin. Great and effective emollient. Highly recommend as a staple supply for the home first aid kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things about it from my friends with babies (this and diapers are a staple in my gifts for baby showers!) but as another use, when I got my tattoo done in Scotland, this is what I was handed for after-care! More convenient, cheaper, and easier to use than most tattoo creams. Also good when you&#x27;ve rubbed your skin raw in new shoes.</li>
            <li> It works. I used different brand for my son, only this one worked. Im from turkey and was familiar with this brand. That&#x27;s why i ordered my 5th and 6th product today. The estimated delivery seems very long but for each order, much less than that.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend, do not spend money on any other nonsense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product as a tattoo aftercare for years, it&#x27;s awesome helps my ink heal nice and fast</li>
            <li> This is the best of the best diaper cream. I even use it for my hands when they dehydrate and crack in winter when I forget the gloves. It is sofa king awesome.</li>
            <li> My baby seemed to be born with a rash, from day one she was very red. I took her many times to the pediatrician and he kept saying that was something I was eating and passing through the breast milk but I was not buying it specially b/c I cut everything from my diet possible. I tried every single thing you name it, people would say it worked I bought it: triple paste, Neosporin before the ointment, Lasinoh cream, hurts bee, powderers, and the list goes on. So my house keeper sees my struggle and say she had the same issue with her daughter and for 6 months nothing cured. Then she said her cousin, from Brazil, had a premie baby and the pediatrician subscribed Bepanthen to her, she said they sent her and it was the only thing that cured her baby. I though I would give a try thinking was just one more thing to add to my endless list. I was stunned, one day/night and my daughter woke up with nothing, baby skin literally. I&#x27;m only using this as her dipper rash cream, the pediatrician in Brazil said was ok and many moms there do it. I definitely recommend. Also I love that it has no white residue when changing a diaper. Simply THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li> i have been using this product on my baby and it works. he has not gotten any diaper rashes. when i see that he&#x27;s getting a little red i put it on and after a while you notice the redness is gone. it has no smell and the 100g tube is a lot. i ordered two at one time. i keep one in his nursery and one i use for when we are on the road.</li>
            <li> It is a big mystery why Bephanten is not in the US market, it would have run all other rash creams out of market. Just like Asprin, Bepanthen is one of the things what Bayer is known for outside US. It heals the diaper rash in light speed; you can see the difference after just one day. Do not torture your babies with useless products like vaseline, powders, or etc. Bepanthen is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have a rare skin condition that gets quite flaky and dry.  I have tried almost everything over many years.  This is the only product I have found that works.  It is un-preserved and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> it works great!!! better then any ointment out there for baby</li>
            <li> Tried a lot products, this is the only one works!!!</li>
            <li> Best cream for my baby,I would never use anything else!! Before i found this cream i tried all the zinc based creams but my baby had constant rash, not with Bepanthen. We use it on chapped lips and cuts, it is a great cream.</li>
            <li> The best cream ever! My sister sent this from sweden, it&#x27;s amazing! Clears up rash in matter of hours or couple of days. Can be used preventative as well.</li>
            <li> I used to bring this cream from Europe for three time the price. Few months ago I was ike let me check amazon and sure enough like everything else they had it. It shipped from Europe but still arrived faster then the estimated date. The price was amazing comparing to what I used to pay directlly in Europe. Plus it was free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the cream I have to say it works the best. I have tried so many creams for my kids and this one has worked by far the best. I use it myself on dry areas and it helps in less then 24 hourd. Diaper rush gone in matter of hours (unless the rush is very bad it may require a bit longer but that&#x27;s the case with every cream). Love it</li>
            <li> Amazing for my face skin. I&#x27;m doing once a week a &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; with this ointment and E-Oil 32,000 IU d-Alpha 1oz and I leave it in my face during all day and the results is FANTASTIC. In the other day my face skin is so soft, looking healthy, as a baby skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the BEST stuff for  aby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> I use it for years on my lips bf sleeping. It works really great healing and keeping my lips hydrated with no cracks. Received it much sooner than informed, thank you!</li>
            <li> Heals any rush! Use on the whole family, for any parts of the body.</li>
            <li> My son, since beginning mixed feeding, has had a rash that has not gone away with Destin and other creams I used before. I tried talcum power and my mother-in-law tried corn starch - but neither worked.  I remembered a tube of cream that a friend of my Mother&#x27;s (in England) had given her to give to me when he was born and Mum came over here. It was a tube of Bepanthen and his rash went in 4 days. It is much oiler and creates a barrier. It is brilliant, I will no longer buy anything else even though it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> you can use it for everybody in the family baby for cradle cap or rash,&lt;br /&gt;kids when they fall on there knees if you have eczema dry spots</li>
            <li> We use this on our faces, on cuts, burns anything do with skin this cream saves the day each time. 100% recommended it.</li>
            <li> This easily beats out the desitins and zinc oxides of the world. If we liberally apply this lotion on her diaper rash it&#x27;s gone within 12-24 hours. Every time. Why is this not sold in the USA? It&#x27;s fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery from the UK took about a month as advertised. Order ahead of time!</li>
            <li> Great ointment for our little one. Can&#x27;t find in U.S. stores.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds weird but this is wonderful for dry lips.  I&#x27;ve only found two ways to repair dry lips: this product and also manuka honey 15+ (I use one that is 18+) with a layer of aquaphor on top.  You can use Vaseline or coconut oil for top layer too to help create a barrier so the manuka can do it&#x27;s thing.  Bepanthen works alone though!</li>
            <li> Had been having some skin surface irritations, ordered, works, as advertised, I thank you.  Priced right, and, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Great product! I appreciate that it contains B vitamins, has a soothing effect, and doesn&#x27;t make my baby cry - no stinging! Thanks Bayer.</li>
            <li> bought it from amazon for my newborn. great product. I apply it after each diaper change and never got a rash. I also breastfeed and use it for my sore nipples. works great on nipples too. highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This ointment is amazing. It works great on redness and diapers rush .I absolutely love Bepanthen and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bepanthen for my little girl since she was born. She is almost 2 years-old now. I moved to US last year and couldn&#x27;t find this item sold anywhere here. I have no choice but to try other nappy cream from the shelves. My little girl got rashes after using these creams. I am happy that we can get Bepanthen online. Now, I only apply it twice a day and she has no skin irritant at all. I don&#x27;t have to apply it during every nappy change. I received this item promptly as promised in the shipping confirmation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!!! I have been using it for years for my lips. Try it and forget everything else out there...&lt;br /&gt;After having my babies, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy them this ointment especially for their terrible red rash. Normally 2 days and the rash has vanished!</li>
            <li> Very good for diaper rash</li>
            <li> it was suggested that I get this for psoriasis.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it and it seems to help matters out.&lt;br /&gt;One tube will last me a long time. I am using it&lt;br /&gt;on my scalp. I have some hot spots. Between&lt;br /&gt;this and other products I alternate with, it helps&lt;br /&gt;heal the skin.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Too bad you can&#x27;t get this in the US. Good stuff for all kinds of things, babies to adults. Rash to cuts etc.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner. The product was what I expected. It didn&#x27;t get rid of my baby&#x27;s rash though but helped</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I wish they sold it in the U.S.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, well packed, very happy. Ordering again.</li>
            <li> The best to treat nappy rash.</li>
            <li> got my  whole family using this for any thing from a diaper rash to skin conditions due to old age - great stuff.</li>
            <li> the best. so gentle and yet quick results.&lt;br /&gt;i use it as a preventative and as a cure.&lt;br /&gt;symptoms go within a few hours of using&lt;br /&gt;rubs in easily&lt;br /&gt;metal tube annoying cos sometimes splits&lt;br /&gt;but otherwise i love it. couldn&#x27;t do without it for my little one.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  We not only use it for diaper rash but also for little cuts and blemishes.  It seems to have outstanding healing properties.  It goes on very nicely and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Perfect for rashes &amp; any skin irritation. Everyone in the house uses it... I love this magic stuff!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this cream for my 1st baby all the time. At that time we lived in France and this cream was available in every pharmacy. When we moved to US I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere so I started using other creams but none of the as good as bepanthen. Thank you amazon for offering this product. I use it now for both my kids and I&#x27;m extremely happy with it. Both babies have a very sensitive skin and only after putting this cream once, the redness disappears.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended !!!!</li>
            <li> I started using this on my son when he was born in the UK. Now he is older but I still use it on his eczema and also on my feet at night (with socks) for cracked heels.  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for new tattoos!</li>
            <li> This stuff works like magic! I use this product when my son has a very bad diaper rash, and it&#x27;s pretty much healed by the next diaper change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I thought it&#x27;s going to be like a miracle ointment because of those reviews but it does works pretty good but this is just an ointment that works good..nothing special.  Fast shipping than I expected.</li>
            <li> Best diaper rash prevention cream in the market. Works like magic..</li>
            <li> bepanthen nappy rash is very effective for my baby.. it really helps on preventing rashes and it also took care of the skin.. this is highly recommended product. Good thing amazon still offer this item coz this was already unavailable in Philippines since 2012.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with my baby when she was born and no cream, I mean no cream worked until this one. I tried everything you name it. I been using now for a year and half, love it that does not leave a white residue. We use it on burns, dry lips, insect bites, it works for almost everything. I have already told two other people about it and they are now hooked on it. Very good for rashes that are hard to cure specially for baby taking antibiotic or premature ones. In Brazil it is highly recommended by pediatricians. Can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> Best nap out cream out there.</li>
            <li> Love the cream for my children face and any other issue they have on the skin.  It heals as well as protect it.  Shipping and the order came true just wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I use it to moisture lips.</li>
            <li> its great for diapers rash...for prevention and treatment...highly recommended</li>
            <li> I can not change it for any other!</li>
            <li> The best nappy care ointment, good texture. Maybe quite expensive but the health of my child really worth it !</li>
            <li> We used this since she was born and until she was 6 months old. No rash! None! Which now I think it&#x27;s amazing. I used to believe she was just not prone to rashes but after we stopped using this product (we couldn&#x27;t find it in our area) and we switched to something else-the rashes started. Not often, but often enough. When I saw her crying because of that I just started looking online for bepanthen again and found it on amazon. Thank God! Kind of pricy but totally worth it since she is now rash-free again! highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing! I used it for my daughters rash on her face from teething. This cream cleared everything up. I always put it on her face before bed</li>
            <li> I got it earlier than I was waiting for, maybe 2 weeks before. It was amazing. I didn&#x27;t use yet, but I think is normal like always as I buy in a pharmacy</li>
            <li> I am caregiver for 89 year old Mom,who is incont..and wears diapers. I have tried many ointments ,creams etc with little improvement of red areas on her buttocks. At each change,and there are MANY,I apply this to the two red areas.after washing and drying area. Overnight you could see the improvement!!!! Works better than any other ointment I have tried. Just ordered four more!!!!! order several as take couple weeks to arrive,come from U.K.</li>
            <li> I bought the cream because my baby had a bad rash that wouldn&#x27;t go away no mater what I tried. This cream soothed it a little bit but wouldn&#x27;t cure it. It would keep the inflammation down a little bit. What it did help with is the CRACKED NIPPLES I was battling with while breast feeding my 10 month old baby!!!!! It fixed the problem rather faster than I expected! Also, my sister-in-laws baby had some eczema like rash on his neck fold and the cream did winders! I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars even though it didn&#x27;t dramatically help with the diaper rash problem but it helped with the other two! It also came a lot faster than expected. Thecestimated arrival was in 4 week (from England) but came in less than 2 weeks. Free shipping was awesome too!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on a fresh tattoo on the recommendation of a tattoo artist friend of mine across the pond. I&#x27;ve used everything from A&amp;D to Bag Balm, shea butter and aquafer. This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used by a mile! My ink healed fast and perfectly. I will ALWAYS use this from now on. Seriously. The BEST product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Best diaper cream ever!!</li>
            <li> I read a review originally about Panthenol and how they were using it as diaper cream in Europe. Then found Bepanthen.  Tried it, worked overnight. Now apparently they are labeling it as &amp;#34;Diaper Cream&amp;#34; officially.  Can&#x27;t get it at drugstores in the US.  No diaper creams I have purchase (OTC or via a Rx) have worked on my daughter - only this stuff or Penaten (if it wasn&#x27;t too bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also works on other bad skin abrasions such as severe burns.</li>
            <li> We had this shipped to us in the US because we couldn&#x27;t find it here - that&#x27;s how good it is.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny - This cream helped get rid of a nasty rash, after multiple ounces of prescription crap just wouldn&#x27;t cut it. Obviously, every baby is different, but this cream may surprise you. For those diaper rashes that seem to not go away, give this a shot.</li>
            <li> Bought it in Mexico,  did wonders for my baby twins</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nappy ointment for both my babies, they get rashes if I substitute it with other nappy cream. And when I use it again, voila! Instant healing for their baby bottoms!</li>
            <li> We used to live in Spain, and this cream was what our pediatrician recommends to our baby, and is MAGICAL!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, very helpful for baby.</li>
            <li> My baby has extreme cradle cap and eczema on her face. I&#x27;ve tried a million creams on the market, a lot of ones that reviewers claimed work wonders for their baby...but nothing worked for my baby. If anything a lot of other baby creams made her worse. My sister gave me this cream and I never heard of it so had it somewhere in a drawer till one day I was super desperate to help my baby face. Omg!!!!!!! I&#x27;m literally so shocked that this cream is working the way it is! Her face hasn&#x27;t completely healed but even within two days I notice a huge difference. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!!!!!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know from baby rashes - this stuff is GENIUS on my face after a chemical peel.  GENIUS.  I used to take up to two weeks to fully heal from a fairly heavy duty glycolic peel.  With Bepanthen, it&#x27;s more like 4-5 days, tops.  You can&#x27;t go out in public with it, well, sure you CAN, but chances are you don&#x27;t want to.  Put it on at bedtime, use an old pillowcase, and wipe off remaining ointment the next morning before washing face as usual.  Thank me later.</li>
            <li> I used this with my eldest in UK every time his lil checks looked a bit irritated and within the day it will all be gone. Thanks to Bepanthen n Vaseline he never had a diaper rash. Couldn&#x27;t find it in US and my second got a diaper rash at 5moths that I just couldn&#x27;t get rid off. I tried everything. Like my first I put the &amp;#34;diaper rash creams&amp;#34; they sell here when I could see it starting but nothing worked. In fact some of them made it worse. I was desperate and was overjoyed when I found Bepanthen on Amazon. It took a while to get here but ever since I got it it&#x27;s miraculous power has saved my lil man from discomfort and me from heartache.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I could buy it from Target.</li>
            <li> It took really long but its ok</li>
            <li> Very effective for my baby. I used it often specially when he started eating adult food.</li>
            <li> Another very good diaper cream on usual days which leave no residue.</li>
            <li> all the other ones........doesnt work............this is the best ..............I tried .....4 different brands.............and this thing last for ever............as my daught doesnt get much rash..............I love it ...........</li>
            <li> This is just the best diaper cream ever!</li>
            <li> this is just as good as the &amp;#34;penaten&amp;#34; cream that i also purchased. it soothes instantly and within a day or so u notice dramaic differences. this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is la crème de la crème of all ointments. This is the highest quality cream there is out there, does wonders! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> the bepanthen diaper {nappy} is grate cream we been used this cream since my daughter born no nappy product can bet this you never regret useing this product [[ASIN:B001D2ASVU Bepanthen Diaper(Nappy) Care Ointment 100g]]</li>
            <li> Best cream for after Tattoo care</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes for this as a dry skin aide.  I should have dug a little deeper though... as soon as I put it on my skin... wow .. I knew something wasn&#x27;t right.  Lanolin and Lanolin oil are in it.  I&#x27;m highly allergic.  Boo!  My fault completely but I&#x27;m giving 1 star.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not being sold in US. This one was shipped from England.</li>
            <li> Good treatment for skin problems (not only for babies BTW).</li>
