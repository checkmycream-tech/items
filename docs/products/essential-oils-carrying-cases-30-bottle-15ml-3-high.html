            <li>The perfect solution for viewing my inventory of DoTERRA Essential Oils.  </li>
            <li>Pleased to recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t see paying anything more than $10 for this.</li>
            <li>It advertises being able to hol 5,10 &amp; 30ml</li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>Just perfect for me as I like to travel with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the padded carrying case.  </li>
            <li>It stretches to carry the 15ml bottles and it actually captures some oil smells in it and is wonderfully aromatic!</li>
            <li>and I love the product</li>
            <li>Needed a bigger size than the 16 holder and this is great!</li>
            <li>I love it-</li>
            <li>but I can get all my bottles in and know they are safe.</li>
            <li>I agree that it probably won&#x27;t hold all 15ml bottles, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this case.</li>
            <li>so I can have more oils with me at one time.</li>
            <li>They are all separated and safe, plus kept safely from sunlight.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my essential oils!  </li>
            <li>and i can see that my oils will be safe inside, well protected.</li>
            <li>Just the right size!!</li>
            <li>EASY TO CARRY AND CAN ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li>And it has a nice, soft handle across the top to easily carry the case.</li>
            <li>: I can fit one roller bottle in it-</li>
            <li>Works great for storing essential oils of all sizes.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was just a titch taller to accomodate 10mL roller bottles, but it is great for 5-15mL standard bottles.</li>
            <li>This is great for my doTerra Essential Oils.</li>
            <li>Great case for carrying my essential oils.</li>
            <li>The 30bottle stickes way over the top of the divider and makes the case look funny.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and would recommend it as an economical option to pricier versions.</li>
            <li>Although I wish that this had some sort of pocket, it&#x27;s exactly as I expected and is a great product.</li>
            <li>Nice soft storage.</li>
            <li>holds plenty, can&#x27;t really see what the oils are, had to purchase lid top stickers</li>
            <li>One really needs to cram the oils in this thing to fit!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, well packaged..</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my essential oil bottle holder.  </li>
            <li>Love my oil bag, it is great, when you first get it it looks small, however once you start putting your oil bottles in it</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I also love that the dividers slide so I can fit different sized bottles.</li>
            <li>Love the fabric, soft and a lot of cushion for the bottles.</li>
            <li>it get to the right size.</li>
            <li>This one is already full haha.</li>
            <li>Will order again since I&#x27;ve filled my new one up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not made very well, but it will do its job with the smaller bottles of oils that I own.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Just a note that my 15ml bottles of essential oils push up against the top.  </li>
            <li>Even the 5ml bottles sag the bottom, I cannot imagine the larger ones fitting in here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap &amp; if you&#x27;re a smoker, don&#x27;t drop an ash anywhere near it.</li>
            <li>I will be buying another one very soon!</li>
            <li>I love my bag, it is the second one I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li>I love this case, and definitely recommend buying it.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed for my oils.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I think the case is pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great little case for the price, bottles are secure and the padding is fine for carrying around the house and everyday storage.</li>
            <li>Would be better if it was a little more sturdy but it will still protect my essential oils fine.</li>
            <li>and I find it very east to carry around if needed.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is very well divided and padded for 30 bottles.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Useful for only the 5-10ml bottles; for taller bottles the zipper wouldn&#x27;t close.</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price that was paid.</li>
            <li>shipped fast seems well built but not made for 15ml bottles, besides that very nice.would work for bigger bottles if you didnt fill case.</li>
            <li>I was only able to fix 25 containers and the extra separating materials is pushed entirely against the rear of the case without any room to place the five remaining bottles in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I ran into the same problem as many other people.</li>
            <li>It has a nice pocket on the front that I like to put my small essential oil book.</li>
            <li>The 15 ml bottles also fit a little too snugly within the dividers, although, it t may just be do to the square shape of the Acura Cacia bottles.</li>
            <li>If I fill it with mostly 15ml bottles, I lose an entire row (the dividers move a little).</li>
            <li>Very convenient way to store all essential oils in one place while being protected and upright.</li>
            <li>Soft</li>
            <li>Very functional, but I would o gave it a 5 star rating if it had been made out of a different fabric.</li>
            <li>I bought the first a few months back - it is full with 30 15mL bottles and is holding up well.</li>
            <li>The quality of the fabric is a little less than I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>For the cost, I expected higher quality, I guess.</li>
            <li>If I like this soft case over my wooden case.  </li>
            <li>That may make it a tight fit, but the fabric does seem to give a little.</li>
            <li>the colors are exactly as depicted (I got black with the grey interior)</li>

            <li> the colors are exactly as depicted (I got black with the grey interior)</li>
            <li> but it needs to be in the middle, not near an edge.  </li>
            <li> I wish the individual slots didn&#x27;t connect, or weren&#x27;t open to each other.</li>
            <li> It was much smaller than I expected it to be</li>
            <li> It does not fit 30 young living 15 ml bottles.</li>
            <li> My only concern is the the handle is a little flimsy - I&#x27;m expecting it to break over time, especially with the weight of 30 bottles.</li>
            <li> so I placed these bottles in the center</li>
            <li> closed.  </li>
            <li> Something I would of expected for under $5.00, not $25</li>
            <li> I have no problem with any bottles slipping through, there is reinforcment on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Looks like they maybe a little too tall</li>
            <li> Sturdy little case.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money for something that belongs in the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Nicet little case!  </li>
            <li> So say if you had really small bottles they would get lost under the padding and you would have to take out all the oils to find the one that fell underneath the rest.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure  how the closing of the case would be affected if all the bottles were 15 ml.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t love it.  The zipper seems to want to snag at the corners.  I bought it because it had so many good reviews.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  For the cost, I expected higher quality, I guess. ETA: I can fit one roller bottle in it- but it needs to be in the middle, not near an edge.  No idea what I would do if I had multiple roller bottles.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wonderful carrier for my oils... travels well.</li>
            <li> Nice soft storage. The quality of the fabric is a little less than I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my essential oil bottle holder.  It&#x27;s just what I wanted and as pictured on the site.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I use this for my extra oils and for my blends. Holds 30 bottles and I find it very east to carry around if needed. Great purchase</li>
            <li> Excellent storage capacity for 5ml to 15ml size bottles!</li>
            <li> My daughter is enjoying this gift for her birthday.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my oils and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is a great starter case. Fits even my weird shaped bottles. The only thing I have to complain about is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s open  at the bottom, under the oils. So say if you had really small bottles they would get lost under the padding and you would have to take out all the oils to find the one that fell underneath the rest.  I wish the individual slots didn&#x27;t connect, or weren&#x27;t open to each other. I hope that makes sense.  It has a nice pocket on the front that I like to put my small essential oil book. And it has a nice, soft handle across the top to easily carry the case.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nicet little case!  Just a note that my 15ml bottles of essential oils push up against the top.  Looks like they maybe a little too tall so I placed these bottles in the center and I don&#x27;t have a problem with zipping the case closed.  However, I&#x27;m not sure  how the closing of the case would be affected if all the bottles were 15 ml.  That may make it a tight fit, but the fabric does seem to give a little. The 15 ml bottles also fit a little too snugly within the dividers, although, it t may just be do to the square shape of the Acura Cacia bottles.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the 30 bottle and 16 bottle cases.  They are perfect for storage and travel.  The perfect solution for viewing my inventory of DoTERRA Essential Oils.  Pleased to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> What a piece of garbage! Poorly made, and flimsy. Definitely returning this. Even the 5ml bottles sag the bottom, I cannot imagine the larger ones fitting in here. Don&#x27;t waste your money for something that belongs in the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I love this! I now have two! :D</li>
            <li> Actual product isn&#x27;t as quality looking as I thought it would be. The case materials feels like felt inside and out.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my doTerra bottles</li>
            <li> The truth is that it does the job. I just don&#x27;t see paying anything more than $10 for this. It&#x27;s cheap &amp; if you&#x27;re a smoker, don&#x27;t drop an ash anywhere near it. It will go up like a Christmas tree.</li>
            <li> Got what I thought was the case in the picture, but when it arrived, was something completely different.  The one I got had a styrofoam bottle holder inside, which was total garbage.  Nobody would want to use that, except for my sister, so I gave it to her after I was told to keep it, and i was given a refund.</li>
            <li> Great for most oil bottles!</li>
            <li> I received this item in a timely manner and very pleased with it.  Will order again since I&#x27;ve filled my new one up.  Would be better if it was a little more sturdy but it will still protect my essential oils fine.</li>
            <li> holds plenty, can&#x27;t really see what the oils are, had to purchase lid top stickers</li>
            <li> The carrying case is very well divided and padded for 30 bottles. It advertises being able to hol 5,10 &amp; 30ml bottles. The 30bottle stickes way over the top of the divider and makes the case look funny.</li>
            <li> great bag! great customer service!</li>
            <li> I love this case. Just perfect for me as I like to travel with my essential oils. As a result, my aunt is going to purchase one as well!</li>
            <li> cheaper than a doterra case</li>
            <li> Works great for storing essential oils of all sizes.  We use it for 5, 10 or 15 ml bottles.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> A must-have storage container for oils.  I will be buying another one very soon!</li>
            <li> I am back today to buy a second case. I bought the first a few months back - it is full with 30 15mL bottles and is holding up well. It&#x27;s a great little case for the price, bottles are secure and the padding is fine for carrying around the house and everyday storage. My only concern is the the handle is a little flimsy - I&#x27;m expecting it to break over time, especially with the weight of 30 bottles. I wish it was just a titch taller to accomodate 10mL roller bottles, but it is great for 5-15mL standard bottles. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and would recommend it as an economical option to pricier versions.</li>
            <li> Works awesome. I absolutely love it. Although I may need to order another one. This one is already full haha.</li>
            <li> Love my oil bag, it is great, when you first get it it looks small, however once you start putting your oil bottles in it it get to the right size. I love my bag, it is the second one I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny.  I love the padded carrying case.  It stretches to carry the 15ml bottles and it actually captures some oil smells in it and is wonderfully aromatic!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and I love the product</li>
            <li> One really needs to cram the oils in this thing to fit! It&#x27;s not made very well, but it will do its job with the smaller bottles of oils that I own.</li>
            <li> Although I wish that this had some sort of pocket, it&#x27;s exactly as I expected and is a great product.</li>
            <li> Needed a bigger size than the 16 holder and this is great!</li>
            <li> Very convenient way to store all essential oils in one place while being protected and upright.</li>
            <li> I love it- Soft but I can get all my bottles in and know they are safe.</li>
            <li> I love this case, and definitely recommend buying it.  No issues with bottles sliding under sections. I agree that it probably won&#x27;t hold all 15ml bottles, but that&#x27;s ok.  I have some smaller ones anyways.  It&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> very poor quality!  very disappointing for the price.  Strings &amp; knots all over from sewing.  Something I would of expected for under $5.00, not $25</li>
            <li> shipped fast seems well built but not made for 15ml bottles, besides that very nice.would work for bigger bottles if you didnt fill case.</li>
            <li> Poorly constructed, but functional.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> great for all the Doterra oils so they are in 1 container to show people how good the product works...</li>
            <li> Useful for only the 5-10ml bottles; for taller bottles the zipper wouldn&#x27;t close.</li>
            <li> I like the case- the colors are exactly as depicted (I got black with the grey interior), it&#x27;s sturdy, well build, and there&#x27;s enough padding between each individual oil to ensure they don&#x27;t have any issues with glass contacting glass. So, why only three stars? Simply put, there is not enough room in this case to hold 30 bottles if they&#x27;re all 15 mL containers. I was only able to fix 25 containers and the extra separating materials is pushed entirely against the rear of the case without any room to place the five remaining bottles in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very nice case and it works well, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s correctly advertised for its carrying capacity.</li>
            <li> I love this case. It is exactly what I needed for my oils.</li>
            <li> Love it! Perfectly designed to hold 30 bottles from 5ml to 15ml. Nice fabric, sturdy zippers, good handle for carrying. No complaints at all. It looks exactly like the picture. If you have 30ml bottles this is not the correct case to order, which is not the fault of the case or the seller. Arrived quickly, well packaged..</li>
            <li> I received this item as a gift. It was much smaller than I expected it to be and I ran into the same problem as many other people. It does not fit 30 young living 15 ml bottles. If I fill it with mostly 15ml bottles, I lose an entire row (the dividers move a little). It would work best with a mix of 5ml and 10ml bottles. I&#x27;m disappointed because I still have bottles without a case. I would have purchased something different had I know this would be a problem. Otherwise, I think the case is pretty sturdy. I leave it sitting on a shelf in my closet so I don&#x27;t have any issues with bottles falling through the bottom. I wouldn&#x27;t choose to use it for regular travel. I&#x27;m planning to purchase a separate case for that. I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price that was paid.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Sturdy little case.</li>
            <li> Very functional, but I would o gave it a 5 star rating if it had been made out of a different fabric.</li>
            <li> I wanted to carry all my oils together,and this works perfectly.  Good quality and safe for the oils for checking luggage or hand.</li>
            <li> I love this case! I have no problem with any bottles slipping through, there is reinforcment on the bottom. I also love that the dividers slide so I can fit different sized bottles.</li>
            <li> This case protects your investment of ESO&#x27;s from damage, heat and sunlight. Easy to store and carry along with a nice look and feel when presenting ESO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd case like this I bought. They are perfect for my doTERRA oil bottles.&lt;br /&gt;I like the security that the padding between the bottles have, to protect my oil bottles from breaking.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT MET MY NEEDS AND IS QUALITY MEETS ALL COMPARISON OR SIMILAR ITEMS.  EASY TO CARRY AND CAN ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li> This handy case with handle on top has been toted all over with ease. I may buy another so I can have more oils with me at one time.</li>
            <li> This is great for my doTerra Essential Oils. It can carry 30 bottles of oil. Like it says, you can put 5ml, 10ml and 15ml bottles in it. Love the fabric, soft and a lot of cushion for the bottles.</li>
            <li> Great case for carrying my essential oils. They are all separated and safe, plus kept safely from sunlight. Great case for traveling as well. I plan to buy the smaller case as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my essential oils!  Just the right size!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect. We are very happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li> I am not sure If I like this soft case over my wooden case.  It is great for transporting the oils.  Provides protection the delivery was prompt</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size. and i can see that my oils will be safe inside, well protected.</li>
