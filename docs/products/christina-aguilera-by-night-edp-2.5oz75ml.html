    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a wonderful scent that is both musky and fruity.</li>
            <li>This one is the best, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice perfume and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>bottle is beautiful and has a seductive appearance, and now for the scent.....</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure is one of the best fragrances in the celebrity world.</li>
            <li>in all this is a perfect scent for all women :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I found this in a department store and loved it.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how good it is.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this perfume.</li>
            <li>and I have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a great scent for winter and fall time :) someone told me I smelled like Dior hypnotic which I&#x27;ve never smelled before</li>
            <li>I love this perfume!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>but I lucked out and love it!  :-)</li>
            <li>I have gotten compliments since I purchased this and find myself catching a waft of it on occasion and am quite satisfied. :)</li>
            <li>As I wear it longer, the musk comes out more and more but is defiantly not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Christina Aguilera fragrance from the line.</li>
            <li>This is for powerful women who love a good fragrance.</li>
            <li>Thanks for great service and product.</li>
            <li>and I plan on ordering more of both :)</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m intrigued to try that scent now :)</li>
            <li>Omg loved it so much!</li>
            <li>I love the combo of sweet and musky and I will continue to buy this perfume when I run out!</li>
            <li>Sexy Sweet!</li>
            <li>and I am so happy to have been able to finally get more.  </li>
            <li>It is never too strong and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s crisp and sweet with an amazing undertone of light musk.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think that 1.7 ounces was way too much for me.</li>
            <li>I have used this scent for about 4 years now and always like this light parfum.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a scent quite like this one that lasts and maintains its mild, exotic, and not overly sweet scent.</li>
            <li>I own every perfume Christina aguilera has ever came out with and this is by far my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>It has some heavier musky notes but with a sweet pineapple&amp;#34;aftertaste&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>As soon as the notes of the perfume settle down it turns into a beautiful scent consisting of sandalwood, ambery notes, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Normally I am a fan of very light and airy scents, but this one I do like.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really like too strong, fruity, or floral smelling perfumes or ones that smell chemically.</li>
            <li>I had to find a new perfume because my favorite pink rose perfume was discontinued.</li>
            <li>This one is a nice soft scent, although it is soft it is by no means unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>I love smelling all the different notes and tones in it!</li>
            <li>but I actually like it better than Hypnotic Poison.  </li>
            <li>I First found this while in Ireland and have only been able to purchase again through a fragrance warehouse.  </li>
            <li>Good fragrance but not long lasting</li>
            <li>It smells really good and the fragrance last a long time after spraying it on.</li>
            <li>I smelled this perfume while I am in line at Kohls, much cheaper here.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy scents such as: ed hardy hearts and daggers and skulls and roses, Britney spears fantasy and midnight fantasy and dolce and gabbana</li>
            <li>The other perfumes from the Christina Aguilera line are just okay.</li>
            <li>(learned the hard way not to buy perfumes at Ross) and it turned out to be authentic!</li>
            <li>first spritz smells like tangerine, freesia, rhubarb ,red apple,and pineapple.</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the other reviewers, I do not get notes of pineapple, but rather tangerine and something like a dark rose scent.</li>
            <li>It is similar (but does not smell exactly the same to me) -</li>
            <li>I decided to check Amazon and added it to my wishlist for only 29 bucks for the same exact amount.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I had little bottle of this which smelled a lot nicer than the larger bottle that came from China or somewhere. Maybe it was a different formula for the perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent that is both musky and fruity. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I do not get notes of pineapple, but rather tangerine and something like a dark rose scent. It is never too strong and lasts all day. I have yet to find a scent quite like this one that lasts and maintains its mild, exotic, and not overly sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Normally I am a fan of very light and airy scents, but this one I do like.  It has some heavier musky notes but with a sweet pineapple&amp;#34;aftertaste&amp;#34;.  I have gotten compliments since I purchased this and find myself catching a waft of it on occasion and am quite satisfied. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely an eveing perfume.</li>
            <li> Let me just say, I was extremely hesitant to but this since, well, it is a star brand. We all know those don&#x27;t always turn out too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I found this in a department store and loved it. This has a hint of pineapple to it that&#x27;s crisp and sweet with an amazing undertone of light musk. On my skin the scent changes the longer I wear it! I love smelling all the different notes and tones in it! As I wear it longer, the musk comes out more and more but is defiantly not overpowering at all. I love the combo of sweet and musky and I will continue to buy this perfume when I run out! I just with they made bigger bottles!</li>
            <li> I had to find a new perfume because my favorite pink rose perfume was discontinued.

It is a very nice perfume and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Omg loved it so much! It&#x27;s a must get!! 👍🏼</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Christina Aguilera fragrance from the line. I was bummed when they didn&#x27;t sell it at my local Kohl&#x27;s anymore (same with the Avril Lavigne fragrances) so I took a risk and bought it online knowing that it could either be the real deal or a bad copy (learned the hard way not to buy perfumes at Ross) and it turned out to be authentic! I hope to leave a lasting impression with this fragrance. The other perfumes from the Christina Aguilera line are just okay. This one is the best, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  I got it because people said it was similar to Hypnotic Poison.  It is similar (but does not smell exactly the same to me) - but I actually like it better than Hypnotic Poison.  I bought it scent unsmelled and was worried I wouldn&#x27;t like it but I lucked out and love it!  :-)</li>
            <li> This is for powerful women who love a good fragrance. It is amazing how good it is. I&#x27;m sure is one of the best fragrances in the celebrity world.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I First found this while in Ireland and have only been able to purchase again through a fragrance warehouse.  They have been &amp;#34;out of stock&amp;#34; for a long time and I am so happy to have been able to finally get more.  Thanks for great service and product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this perfume. It smells really good and the fragrance last a long time after spraying it on. I would recommend getting this for yourself or another.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think that 1.7 ounces was way too much for me. I kinda got sick of it after a while though.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance!!</li>
            <li> Sexy Sweet! Smell quite similar to &amp;#34;Hypnotic Poison Dior&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance but not long lasting</li>
            <li> I own every perfume Christina aguilera has ever came out with and this is by far my absolute favorite! I have ordered this and another one made by Christina from this same seller and I have been very pleased. Both times they have been delivered before the expected date and I plan on ordering more of both :)</li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume while I am in line at Kohls, much cheaper here.  I bought two for the price of one.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift for my birthday after I stumbled acrossed it at Kohls, they wanted 55 bucks for the 1.6 ounce they have to be mad! I decided to check Amazon and added it to my wishlist for only 29 bucks for the same exact amount.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is beautiful and has a seductive appearance, and now for the scent.....&lt;br /&gt;The first spritz smells like tangerine, freesia, rhubarb ,red apple,and pineapple. As soon as the notes of the perfume settle down it turns into a beautiful scent consisting of sandalwood, ambery notes, and vanilla. It is definitely a great scent for winter and fall time :) someone told me I smelled like Dior hypnotic which I&#x27;ve never smelled before but now I&#x27;m intrigued to try that scent now :)&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a perfect scent for all women :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this helps you decide if this scent is for you I enjoy scents such as: ed hardy hearts and daggers and skulls and roses, Britney spears fantasy and midnight fantasy and dolce and gabbana pour femme.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected!!! Smells kinda like dior hypnotic poison</li>
            <li> I have used this scent for about 4 years now and always like this light parfum.</li>
