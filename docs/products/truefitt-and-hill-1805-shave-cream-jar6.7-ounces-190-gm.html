            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>After trying the Truefitt &amp; Hill sampler pack of every shaving cream and scent, my wife and I happily chose to stick with 1805.</li>
            <li>great product</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>Makes it a great value in my book.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>The cream has a great texture and lathers well.</li>
            <li>and I still get a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Just a dab will lather into the thickest, richest cream, making for a great shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Great Product - works as advertised</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, and will buy again when this runs out in 16 years or so.</li>
            <li>My husband says it&#x27;s a great shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>This shaving cream has restored some of the joy of shaving.</li>
            <li>It does a very nice job of lubricating during shaving</li>
            <li>love this stuff, the smell, the shave, just awesome.</li>
            <li>He said it was great gift! :)</li>
            <li>I am so happy for him! :)</li>
            <li>SWEDISH DREAM SEA SALT SOAP is awesome as a face soap and shave soap love the sea scent ...</li>
            <li>and it is superb -- noticeably better than Caswell-Massey&#x27;s equivalent even before it went downhill.</li>
            <li>Astra Superior Premium Platinum</li>
            <li>Astra Superior Premium Platinum</li>
            <li>They have to be doing something good.</li>
            <li>This will add a good 5-10 minutes onto your shaving time.</li>
            <li>A good shaving cream, but the scent isn&#x27;t as good as the cologne.</li>
            <li>All in all, this shave cream does the job just as good as any.</li>
            <li>Think I prefer the Trafalgar though scent wise.</li>
            <li>Good shave cream, I recommend it with a shave brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we both loved the scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very nice, not overpowering, and it whips up very easily.  </li>
            <li>In a Gentleman&#x27;s rucksack of life skills - and the experience of refining them - are a great many things.</li>
            <li>Wonderful lather, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but but- Are you able to admit that you like to sniff vanilla sometimes... and if it makes the wench happy, maybe even a flower or two??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product, period!</li>
            <li>( TOBS Eton College is my favorite ! )</li>
            <li>By far the best smelling, best conditioning, overall best shaving experience I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>TOBS just seems to have a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The shaving cream lather was excellent, while it was slightly thicker than I prefer when using my silver tip brush, it still lathered excellently.  </li>
            <li>the cream is smooth, smells great and is created using quality materials.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Your tools might differ from mine - but this lather is just completely amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice step up from the Prorasso I was using before.</li>
            <li>B000VUYG40 His Tweezerman Deluxe Shaving Brush]]</li>
            <li>Truefitt and Hill 1805 is the absolute best smelling cologne.  </li>
            <li>A Gentleman in his own making is a Gentleman determined by the quality of both his appearance and his conduct.</li>
            <li>The scents are perfect; the cream lathers really well in a scuttle.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best shaving cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Nice lather</li>
            <li>to inexperience with using this kind of shave cream/brush</li>
            <li>His son visited during the summer and also liked it, so we got him some for Christmas, along with a refill for my husband.  </li>
            <li>It works well and lathers up very easily.</li>
            <li>The best way I could describe the smell is oceanic and masculine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, great scent and smooth shave and would be a great addition to any straight shavers medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>He loved the smell, and it helped provide a smooth shave with zero irritation.  </li>
            <li>The 1805 has a great scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering; it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li>Great product, much better than any shave cream at the supermarket and worth the price.  </li>
            <li>cream itself is excellent, as would be expected from this very reputable manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I love purchasing through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have more creams and soaps than a person probably should have, and for months now, this cream is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; 90% of the time.</li>
            <li>OK, so I heard that 1805 was the top seller for T&amp;H.  </li>
            <li>You can smell it quite well during shaving time, but it becomes more subdued afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I therefore must revise my earlier comment and say this is just an excellent cream regardless of the brush you are using.  </li>
            <li>This is a product that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>Outstanding quality.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Truefill &amp; Hill gives a better shave and</li>
            <li>My husband and son-in-law love this stuff and wouldn&#x27;t shave with anything else.</li>
            <li>I prefer this (1805) to the TOBS Sandalwood (and I love sandalwood).</li>
            <li>I use the Trafalgar, Grafton, and 1805 on a rotational basis and love all three.  </li>
            <li>I have never found anything better in my 70+ years.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband after reading many reviews.</li>
            <li>I use a silver tip badger brush and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this shave cream.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>And I love the scent of 1805.</li>
            <li>Love the smell; had to try 1805 after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>This keeps his face so smooth!</li>
            <li>has a nice fragrance and equally important, the shave cream lubricates the face perfectly when using a double edge razor.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>but it is not my favorite</li>
            <li>This has been one of my favorite creams ever since I started wetshaving.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the best look no further.</li>
            <li>The prices are fair and right on target..</li>
            <li>and it creates a very rich lather.</li>
            <li>Has a nice, clean smell; not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It also  has a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nice and quick, and lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I say this due to the fact that it worked best with slightly more water than I would use with a D R Harris or TOBs cream but closer to what I expect when using the G F trumper creams.  </li>
            <li>Most reviews have touched on the qualities of this shave soap; the superior experience, high price and (in redemption of economy)</li>
            <li>If you have the time to spare, then it is WELL worth it, because the quality of shave you get out of this is just amazing.</li>
            <li>Somehow, I find 1805 shaving cream even more comfortable than the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The Truffit &amp; Hill shave soaps (1805 - my favorite) fit the taste and applicability for any Gentleman.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, The Art of Shaving does a great job of making an excellent cream.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very mild, though quite pleasing.</li>
            <li>I will probably get shot for saying this, but 1805 is kind of like a Nautica ocean scent, but WAY higher quality.  </li>
            <li>you willing to shave another man in a demonstrative display of your own heterosexuality?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But,</li>
            <li>Hands down the best shave cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I had previously purchased the Grafton cream about a month before and have been very impressed with the quality.  </li>
            <li>This one quickly became a top choice for me.</li>
            <li>Great lather and perfect for anyone new to wet shaving or veterans of this classic ritual of brush and creams.</li>

            <li>:B003BHCAGQ Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It is a very pleasant cream, but I think that the price is not justified.  </li>
            <li>I will say that this is a premium shaving cream and probably does work better with a higher end badger brush, probably best badger at the least.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>It is a true pleasure to shave in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You could use Truefitt&#x27;s pre-shave oil, but, you may be able to get away with not using it since this is a very moisturizing cream.  </li>

            <li>He really liked the smell compared to a lot of what&#x27;s out there which he said are smells for young kids.</li>
            <li>I bought him the full set- brush, pre-shave, cream, &amp; aftershave.</li>
            <li>Have this about 1 1/2 years and still a good deal left in the tub.</li>
            <li>It lathers easy, smells great, and gives a great shave with little irriatation.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to elaborate on and on in detail like some users can in their reviews, but I&#x27;ll put it like this, when I shave</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and clean, a nice and classy treat for any guy.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the light refreshing scent of this cream.  </li>
            <li>It has been a favorite of his for several years and he was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I also recommend you try their Super Badger</li>
            <li>Combine this with a Feather blade and a vintage Gillette Fatboy, Aristocrat, Sheraton, or Super Speed</li>
            <li>these are all suitable for sensitive skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream is very luxuriant and incredibly slick and smooth, and I did get an incredibly close shave, that resulted in neither razor burn nor nicks.  </li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;d certainly be interested in purchasing it again!</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it I could tell right away that it was probably the highest quality cream I had ever used.</li>
            <li>and I do love 1805 for my aftershave balm, but as far as the shaving cream is concerned...</li>
            <li>It is worth the money...</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best shave cream you&#x27;ve ever used in your life, there&#x27;s something broken in your brain.</li>
            <li>This shave cream has been my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li>tad pricey, but totally worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect lather, easy to produce, slick enough to where I don&#x27;t even notice hair being cut.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells GREAT, lathers nicely, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>once you get the right combination of water and concentrate.</li>
            <li>But not many have made clear why the acquisition of a quality shave soap (among other things of generally good quality) is in a Gentleman&#x27;s best interest.  </li>
            <li>Great lather from small amount.</li>
            <li>I found it to be light with a mild spice that leaves a pleasant undertone throughout the day, I would equate it to maybe a classic ocean faring scent, my wife says it smells more floral (I was unable to detect this floral aspect), and states that she does like the scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good lather and gentle scent (at least for me).</li>
            <li>If you are the kind of person who wakes up with just enough time to get ready and run out the door, don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild but very pleasing.</li>
            <li>So far for me this is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>It definitely has lived up to its positive feedback with my husband saying it lathered well, had a good fragrance, and was better than other shaving creams.</li>
            <li>Overall enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why exactly</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t overpower your olfactory senses and the scent wafts of a crisp cleanliness.</li>
            <li>It never fails to amaze.</li>
            <li>think the T&amp;H Ultimate Comfort might edge out 1805 in terms of the &#x27;closeness&#x27; of the shave; but this could be more reflective of me..</li>
            <li>I have tried many shaving creams and I keep coming back to T&amp;H.  </li>
            <li>I discovered this product 12 years ago when I bought my first  </li>
            <li>Index finger scoop and warm wet soaked brush works for me.</li>
            <li>Are you willing to put your neck out for your guys?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first got this for my husband Father&#x27;s Day 2012</li>
            <li>I state this only because I know the difference I achieve in lather between my pure badger brushes and my silver tip brushes as the latter are able to retain much more water.  </li>
            <li>If you want quality old school clean shaves this is it.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and you only need a little bit for a good lather,</li>
            <li>gave me my first 3 pass shave with absolutely zero razor burn or irritation.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product exactly as described</li>
            <li>I may be becoming too bias toward fresh/citrusy creams, saving more complex scents for aftershaves.</li>
            <li>I will however test this cream with my pure badger brushes  to confirm my speculation and will update this review If I find my that I am in error.</li>

            <li>, when I purchased this I also purchased a badger hair shave brush (although based on how expensive those things get I probably didn&#x27;t get a very good one), and I&#x27;ve used them together since they arrived.</li>

            <li>I have used for DE and straight razor shaving with zero issue.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for selling these.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I also find the sent very relaxing, and I tend to use it if I shave at night for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the smell since I haven&#x27;t really noticed it...</li>
            <li>It only takes a tiny bit of this soap to whip up a nice lather.</li>
            <li>However, the last jar clearly had had a change of formula, as it took much more cream to shave.</li>
            <li>Creates a wonderfully rich lather and the scent is very clean/fresh/oceanic while maintaining a masculine and professional undertone.</li>
            <li>Great smell and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>confident enough to smell fresh and sensitive enough to hold a purse for a minute or two (BUT NO LONGER!</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to shaving much more now, and I feel motivated to invest in a proper razor and brush.</li>
            <li>then you just might be worthy enough to slather this on.</li>
            <li>far as lather, this cream creates a thick and fluffy whipped up concoction that leaves your skin smooth and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relatively new to wet shaving, but so far the Trufitt &amp; Hill 1805 is my favorite shave cream.  </li>
            <li>I recently decided to splurge on a higher quality product, and after perusing Amazon and seeing all the positive revues for Truefitt &amp; Hill</li>
            <li>If anything I wish the scent were a little stronger, but I love the smell of it, and my girlfriend approves as well.</li>
            <li>But yeah, it is great, albeit quite expensive, stuff.</li>
            <li>a lasting fresh fell.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how little you need to lather up your face twice with the same brush.</li>
            <li>thing to watch out for: If you live in a desert state, like Arizona, DON&#x27;T purchase this when temperatures are over 100 degrees.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Trafalgar and I must disagree with it being labeled a musky scent; I found it light and clean but mature with a subtle hint of gin.</li>
            <li>My Husband&#x27;s skin is very sensitive to a lot of products out there</li>
            <li>It has a very classy scent to.  </li>
            <li>so glad i founf this on amazon, this was a gift for my husband last year from son, and he purchased at his barber and was expensive, so was glad i found this</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product as a gift (the first time through royalshave.com), and I went through Amazon since I had a gift card.</li>
            <li>Wow - now this is what I am talking about!  </li>
            <li>T&amp;H does have younger scent and performs well; however, it surely dries out faster than the other two.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably purchase through another website next time, as the shipping took the full amount of estimated time to arrive (ten days).</li>
            <li>Now, using Truefitt, it takes less than half the amount to get much more lather, and the lather quality not only feels silky but provides smooth, gliding shaves.</li>
            <li>Although my personal preference would be that I like the consistency offered by a brush that retains a little more water.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I alternate between a safety razor and a Fusion, but I don&#x27;t know that much about soaps/creams/razors/etc.</li>
            <li>rather classy</li>

            <li>The proper selection of tools in grooming - among other aspects of a Gentleman&#x27;s appearance - needs as practiced a touch for relevant quality as a keen sense of thrift.</li>
            <li>I have used a number of different high quality shaving creams.  </li>
            <li>My past experiences with shaving cream were primarily the spray foam variety and inexpensive shaving soap for brush use.</li>
            <li>I find that I&#x27;m burning through it fairly fast shaving everyday, but it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t say with 100% certainty that the amazing shave I get with this shave cream is exclusively the result of the shave cream and not at least partially due to the brush</li>
            <li>B000S5PV56 Merkur Classic Barbor Pole Long Handle Safety Razor</li>
            <li>lone criticism is that there was a considerable dip inside the jar that contained only air.</li>
            <li>The Trufitt &amp; Hill creams are not cheap, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>shave with the same ritual daily, only substituting one item at a time when trying new products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just as good and less expensive is the range from Taylors of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li>every day, for special days- Be a complex man.</li>
            <li>I usually stay away from the perfumed products and was a little hesitant with trying this scent, but after reading other reviews that commented on the light fresh scent I relented and decided to give it a whirl.  </li>
            <li>If you want a face that is only slightly perfurmed after a shave, but want a very high quality latherific experience then I would recommend 1805.</li>
            <li>Being new to wet shaving I&#x27;ve bought several different brands of shave cream, Truefitt &amp; Hill has turned out to be my go to cream.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to double edged shaving, you may want to pay attention to some other items in my shave rotation.  </li>

            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> After trying the Truefitt &amp; Hill sampler pack of every shaving cream and scent, my wife and I happily chose to stick with 1805.</li>

            <li> Makes it a great value in my book.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> The cream has a great texture and lathers well.</li>
            <li> and I still get a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Just a dab will lather into the thickest, richest cream, making for a great shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> Great Product - works as advertised</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, and will buy again when this runs out in 16 years or so.</li>
            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s a great shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> This shaving cream has restored some of the joy of shaving.</li>
            <li> It does a very nice job of lubricating during shaving</li>
            <li> love this stuff, the smell, the shave, just awesome.</li>
            <li> He said it was great gift! :)</li>
            <li> I am so happy for him! :)</li>
            <li> SWEDISH DREAM SEA SALT SOAP is awesome as a face soap and shave soap love the sea scent ...</li>
            <li> and it is superb -- noticeably better than Caswell-Massey&#x27;s equivalent even before it went downhill.</li>

            <li> Astra Superior Premium Platinum</li>
            <li> They have to be doing something good.</li>
            <li> This will add a good 5-10 minutes onto your shaving time.</li>
            <li> A good shaving cream, but the scent isn&#x27;t as good as the cologne.</li>
            <li> All in all, this shave cream does the job just as good as any.</li>
            <li> Think I prefer the Trafalgar though scent wise.</li>
            <li> Good shave cream, I recommend it with a shave brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we both loved the scent.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very nice, not overpowering, and it whips up very easily.  </li>
            <li> In a Gentleman&#x27;s rucksack of life skills - and the experience of refining them - are a great many things.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lather, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but but- Are you able to admit that you like to sniff vanilla sometimes... and if it makes the wench happy, maybe even a flower or two??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product, period!</li>
            <li> ( TOBS Eton College is my favorite ! )</li>
            <li> By far the best smelling, best conditioning, overall best shaving experience I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> TOBS just seems to have a more pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> The shaving cream lather was excellent, while it was slightly thicker than I prefer when using my silver tip brush, it still lathered excellently.  </li>
            <li> the cream is smooth, smells great and is created using quality materials.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Your tools might differ from mine - but this lather is just completely amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice step up from the Prorasso I was using before.</li>
            <li> B000VUYG40 His Tweezerman Deluxe Shaving Brush]]</li>
            <li> Truefitt and Hill 1805 is the absolute best smelling cologne.  </li>
            <li> A Gentleman in his own making is a Gentleman determined by the quality of both his appearance and his conduct.</li>
            <li> The scents are perfect; the cream lathers really well in a scuttle.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best shaving cream I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Nice lather</li>
            <li> to inexperience with using this kind of shave cream/brush</li>
            <li> His son visited during the summer and also liked it, so we got him some for Christmas, along with a refill for my husband.  </li>
            <li> It works well and lathers up very easily.</li>
            <li> The best way I could describe the smell is oceanic and masculine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, great scent and smooth shave and would be a great addition to any straight shavers medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> He loved the smell, and it helped provide a smooth shave with zero irritation.  </li>
            <li> The 1805 has a great scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering; it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li> Great product, much better than any shave cream at the supermarket and worth the price.  </li>
            <li> cream itself is excellent, as would be expected from this very reputable manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I love purchasing through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have more creams and soaps than a person probably should have, and for months now, this cream is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; 90% of the time.</li>
            <li> OK, so I heard that 1805 was the top seller for T&amp;H.  </li>
            <li> You can smell it quite well during shaving time, but it becomes more subdued afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I therefore must revise my earlier comment and say this is just an excellent cream regardless of the brush you are using.  </li>
            <li> This is a product that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> Outstanding quality.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Truefill &amp; Hill gives a better shave and</li>
            <li> My husband and son-in-law love this stuff and wouldn&#x27;t shave with anything else.</li>
            <li> I prefer this (1805) to the TOBS Sandalwood (and I love sandalwood).</li>
            <li> I use the Trafalgar, Grafton, and 1805 on a rotational basis and love all three.  </li>
            <li> I have never found anything better in my 70+ years.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband after reading many reviews.</li>
            <li> I use a silver tip badger brush and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this shave cream.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> And I love the scent of 1805.</li>
            <li> Love the smell; had to try 1805 after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> This keeps his face so smooth!</li>
            <li> has a nice fragrance and equally important, the shave cream lubricates the face perfectly when using a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> but it is not my favorite</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite creams ever since I started wetshaving.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the best look no further.</li>
            <li> The prices are fair and right on target..</li>
            <li> and it creates a very rich lather.</li>
            <li> Has a nice, clean smell; not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It also  has a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> It lathers up nice and quick, and lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I say this due to the fact that it worked best with slightly more water than I would use with a D R Harris or TOBs cream but closer to what I expect when using the G F trumper creams.  </li>
            <li> Most reviews have touched on the qualities of this shave soap; the superior experience, high price and (in redemption of economy)</li>
            <li> If you have the time to spare, then it is WELL worth it, because the quality of shave you get out of this is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Somehow, I find 1805 shaving cream even more comfortable than the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The Truffit &amp; Hill shave soaps (1805 - my favorite) fit the taste and applicability for any Gentleman.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, The Art of Shaving does a great job of making an excellent cream.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very mild, though quite pleasing.</li>
            <li> I will probably get shot for saying this, but 1805 is kind of like a Nautica ocean scent, but WAY higher quality.  </li>
            <li> you willing to shave another man in a demonstrative display of your own heterosexuality?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But,</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shave cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I had previously purchased the Grafton cream about a month before and have been very impressed with the quality.  </li>
            <li> This one quickly became a top choice for me.</li>

            <li> It is a very pleasant cream, but I think that the price is not justified.  </li>
            <li> I will say that this is a premium shaving cream and probably does work better with a higher end badger brush, probably best badger at the least.  </li>

            <li> He really liked the smell compared to a lot of what&#x27;s out there which he said are smells for young kids.</li>
            <li> I bought him the full set- brush, pre-shave, cream, &amp; aftershave.</li>
            <li> Have this about 1 1/2 years and still a good deal left in the tub.</li>
            <li> It lathers easy, smells great, and gives a great shave with little irriatation.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to elaborate on and on in detail like some users can in their reviews, but I&#x27;ll put it like this, when I shave</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and clean, a nice and classy treat for any guy.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the light refreshing scent of this cream.  </li>
            <li> It has been a favorite of his for several years and he was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I also recommend you try their Super Badger</li>
            <li> Combine this with a Feather blade and a vintage Gillette Fatboy, Aristocrat, Sheraton, or Super Speed</li>
            <li> these are all suitable for sensitive skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream is very luxuriant and incredibly slick and smooth, and I did get an incredibly close shave, that resulted in neither razor burn nor nicks.  </li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;d certainly be interested in purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it I could tell right away that it was probably the highest quality cream I had ever used.</li>
            <li> and I do love 1805 for my aftershave balm, but as far as the shaving cream is concerned...</li>
            <li> It is worth the money...</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best shave cream you&#x27;ve ever used in your life, there&#x27;s something broken in your brain.</li>
            <li> This shave cream has been my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li> tad pricey, but totally worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect lather, easy to produce, slick enough to where I don&#x27;t even notice hair being cut.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells GREAT, lathers nicely, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> once you get the right combination of water and concentrate.</li>
            <li> But not many have made clear why the acquisition of a quality shave soap (among other things of generally good quality) is in a Gentleman&#x27;s best interest.  </li>
            <li> Great lather from small amount.</li>
            <li> I found it to be light with a mild spice that leaves a pleasant undertone throughout the day, I would equate it to maybe a classic ocean faring scent, my wife says it smells more floral (I was unable to detect this floral aspect), and states that she does like the scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very good lather and gentle scent (at least for me).</li>
            <li> If you are the kind of person who wakes up with just enough time to get ready and run out the door, don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild but very pleasing.</li>
            <li> So far for me this is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> It definitely has lived up to its positive feedback with my husband saying it lathered well, had a good fragrance, and was better than other shaving creams.</li>
            <li> Overall enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why exactly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t overpower your olfactory senses and the scent wafts of a crisp cleanliness.</li>
            <li> It never fails to amaze.</li>
            <li> think the T&amp;H Ultimate Comfort might edge out 1805 in terms of the &#x27;closeness&#x27; of the shave; but this could be more reflective of me..</li>
            <li> I have tried many shaving creams and I keep coming back to T&amp;H.  </li>
            <li> I discovered this product 12 years ago when I bought my first  </li>

            <li> I first got this for my husband Father&#x27;s Day 2012</li>
            <li> I state this only because I know the difference I achieve in lather between my pure badger brushes and my silver tip brushes as the latter are able to retain much more water.  </li>
            <li> If you want quality old school clean shaves this is it.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and you only need a little bit for a good lather,</li>
            <li> gave me my first 3 pass shave with absolutely zero razor burn or irritation.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and product exactly as described</li>
            <li> I may be becoming too bias toward fresh/citrusy creams, saving more complex scents for aftershaves.</li>
            <li> I will however test this cream with my pure badger brushes  to confirm my speculation and will update this review If I find my that I am in error.</li>

            <li> , when I purchased this I also purchased a badger hair shave brush (although based on how expensive those things get I probably didn&#x27;t get a very good one), and I&#x27;ve used them together since they arrived.</li>

            <li> I have used for DE and straight razor shaving with zero issue.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for selling these.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I also find the sent very relaxing, and I tend to use it if I shave at night for whatever reason.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the smell since I haven&#x27;t really noticed it...</li>
            <li> It only takes a tiny bit of this soap to whip up a nice lather.</li>
            <li> However, the last jar clearly had had a change of formula, as it took much more cream to shave.</li>
            <li> Creates a wonderfully rich lather and the scent is very clean/fresh/oceanic while maintaining a masculine and professional undertone.</li>
            <li> Great smell and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> confident enough to smell fresh and sensitive enough to hold a purse for a minute or two (BUT NO LONGER!</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to shaving much more now, and I feel motivated to invest in a proper razor and brush.</li>
            <li> then you just might be worthy enough to slather this on.</li>
            <li> far as lather, this cream creates a thick and fluffy whipped up concoction that leaves your skin smooth and smelling great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to wet shaving, but so far the Trufitt &amp; Hill 1805 is my favorite shave cream.  </li>
            <li> I recently decided to splurge on a higher quality product, and after perusing Amazon and seeing all the positive revues for Truefitt &amp; Hill</li>
            <li> If anything I wish the scent were a little stronger, but I love the smell of it, and my girlfriend approves as well.</li>
            <li> But yeah, it is great, albeit quite expensive, stuff.</li>
            <li> a lasting fresh fell.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how little you need to lather up your face twice with the same brush.</li>
            <li> thing to watch out for: If you live in a desert state, like Arizona, DON&#x27;T purchase this when temperatures are over 100 degrees.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Trafalgar and I must disagree with it being labeled a musky scent; I found it light and clean but mature with a subtle hint of gin.</li>
            <li> My Husband&#x27;s skin is very sensitive to a lot of products out there</li>
            <li> It has a very classy scent to.  </li>
            <li> so glad i founf this on amazon, this was a gift for my husband last year from son, and he purchased at his barber and was expensive, so was glad i found this</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product as a gift (the first time through royalshave.com), and I went through Amazon since I had a gift card.</li>
            <li> Wow - now this is what I am talking about!  </li>
            <li> T&amp;H does have younger scent and performs well; however, it surely dries out faster than the other two.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably purchase through another website next time, as the shipping took the full amount of estimated time to arrive (ten days).</li>
            <li> Now, using Truefitt, it takes less than half the amount to get much more lather, and the lather quality not only feels silky but provides smooth, gliding shaves.</li>
            <li> Although my personal preference would be that I like the consistency offered by a brush that retains a little more water.&lt;br</li>

            <li> The proper selection of tools in grooming - among other aspects of a Gentleman&#x27;s appearance - needs as practiced a touch for relevant quality as a keen sense of thrift.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of different high quality shaving creams.  </li>
            <li> My past experiences with shaving cream were primarily the spray foam variety and inexpensive shaving soap for brush use.</li>
            <li> I find that I&#x27;m burning through it fairly fast shaving everyday, but it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t say with 100% certainty that the amazing shave I get with this shave cream is exclusively the result of the shave cream and not at least partially due to the brush</li>
            <li> B000S5PV56 Merkur Classic Barbor Pole Long Handle Safety Razor</li>
            <li> lone criticism is that there was a considerable dip inside the jar that contained only air.</li>
            <li> The Trufitt &amp; Hill creams are not cheap, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> shave with the same ritual daily, only substituting one item at a time when trying new products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just as good and less expensive is the range from Taylors of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li> every day, for special days- Be a complex man.</li>
            <li> I usually stay away from the perfumed products and was a little hesitant with trying this scent, but after reading other reviews that commented on the light fresh scent I relented and decided to give it a whirl.  </li>
            <li> If you want a face that is only slightly perfurmed after a shave, but want a very high quality latherific experience then I would recommend 1805.</li>
            <li> Being new to wet shaving I&#x27;ve bought several different brands of shave cream, Truefitt &amp; Hill has turned out to be my go to cream.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re new to double edged shaving, you may want to pay attention to some other items in my shave rotation.  </li>
            <li> It is really expensive but it lasts a long time and it give a better shave than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I used any Truefitt &amp; Hill product, I was kind of skeptical because I previously used The Art of Shaving creams.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not let water get in the container, as the cream will no longer be airy, but flat an runny.</li>
            <li> Just remember, you do NOT need to put much on the brush, hardly anything, and it lathers up great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The shaving cream does not dry out my skin or irritate it, and a little dab goes a long way, usually enough for two passes.</li>
            <li> T&amp;H has been in business this long for a reason!  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get past the smell it smells like an old ladys perfume .</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried enough creams to say &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; -- but you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> about two, maybe three months though and have about half left.</li>
            <li> An amiable, honorable, and trustworthy fellow will garner respect enough for his character just a man well dressed and groomed will be respected for his active awareness of detail, hygiene, and image; a Gentleman is a man who actively fosters both these facets and their refining over the course of his life.  </li>
            <li> As I work in a medical practice I do not like to wear heavy scents, this was not an issue with the 1805 fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would not hold lather for all three of my passes and my final touch up pass, but the concern proved false as there was ample lather for the complete shave.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive, but the scent is nice but too subtle for my taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the same &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; razors I have used with numerous other commonly found shave creams/gels and the difference was immediately noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Clean and replace shaving gear while this is allowed to sit on face, followed by cold water rinse.)&lt;br /&gt;</li>

            <li> I met the UPS driver at my door but just from the time it spent in the delivery van, the cream separated and was slightly gelatinous.</li>
            <li> should last months at least.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Tough beard...this is what you have been looking for. I have tried a great deal of them. This works best with a brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love purchasing through Amazon. The prices are fair and right on target.. You should really order this product for it really works..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of different shaving creams. This one quickly became a top choice for me. It lathers easy, smells great, and gives a great shave with little irriatation.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard for me to elaborate on and on in detail like some users can in their reviews, but I&#x27;ll put it like this, when I shave I have more creams and soaps than a person probably should have, and for months now, this cream is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; 90% of the time. The very first time I used it I could tell right away that it was probably the highest quality cream I had ever used.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, the smell, the shave, just awesome. Nice step up from the Prorasso I was using before. I find that I&#x27;m burning through it fairly fast shaving everyday, but it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> OK, so I heard that 1805 was the top seller for T&amp;H.  I had previously purchased the Grafton cream about a month before and have been very impressed with the quality.  Trafalgar was a total dive, so you can see my review there.    I will probably get shot for saying this, but 1805 is kind of like a Nautica ocean scent, but WAY higher quality.  You can smell it quite well during shaving time, but it becomes more subdued afterwards.  If you want a face that is only slightly perfurmed after a shave, but want a very high quality latherific experience then I would recommend 1805.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and you only need a little bit for a good lather, should last months at least.</li>
            <li> After trying the Truefitt &amp; Hill sampler pack of every shaving cream and scent, my wife and I happily chose to stick with 1805. Somehow, I find 1805 shaving cream even more comfortable than the [[ASIN:B000F5MBLG Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream Travel Tube, 3.5 oz.]]. It&#x27;s expensive, but if you&#x27;re looking for quality then here it is. I&#x27;d say this tub can last &gt; 6 months with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My list of Amazon-acquired shaving supplies:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003BHCAGQ Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000S5PV56 Merkur Classic Barbor Pole Long Handle Safety Razor #38 + 10 Free DE Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000F5NRQY Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Pre-Shave Oil, 2 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000RG8D6K Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Aftershave Balm]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00020UQQQ Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Shave Cream Jar]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004COMB5W Osma Styptic Pencil, Hemo Stop]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001G5HZCY Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades 30 Ct]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Razor Blades]]</li>
            <li> Great smell and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> so glad i founf this on amazon, this was a gift for my husband last year from son, and he purchased at his barber and was expensive, so was glad i found this and i order it for my husdnad for christmas and he loves it. great product</li>
            <li> As with all Truefitt &amp; Hill products this is an excellent shaving cream.  I was pleasantly surprised by the light refreshing scent of this cream.  I usually stay away from the perfumed products and was a little hesitant with trying this scent, but after reading other reviews that commented on the light fresh scent I relented and decided to give it a whirl.  As I work in a medical practice I do not like to wear heavy scents, this was not an issue with the 1805 fragrance.  I found it to be light with a mild spice that leaves a pleasant undertone throughout the day, I would equate it to maybe a classic ocean faring scent, my wife says it smells more floral (I was unable to detect this floral aspect), and states that she does like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is excellent, as would be expected from this very reputable manufacturer. There were no disappointments to be found here.  The cream is very luxuriant and incredibly slick and smooth, and I did get an incredibly close shave, that resulted in neither razor burn nor nicks.  I will say that this is a premium shaving cream and probably does work better with a higher end badger brush, probably best badger at the least.  I say this due to the fact that it worked best with slightly more water than I would use with a D R Harris or TOBs cream but closer to what I expect when using the G F trumper creams.  I state this only because I know the difference I achieve in lather between my pure badger brushes and my silver tip brushes as the latter are able to retain much more water.  I do not view this as a negative as this is a premium cream and thereby may be expected to work optimally with premium accessories (this is of course an assumption on my part).  I will however test this cream with my pure badger brushes  to confirm my speculation and will update this review If I find my that I am in error. (I apologize to any boar brush users as I am unable to test this, as I do not own one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!  I must admit that I was mistaken in my earlier conclusion about brushes.  I used my least expensive pure badger [[ASIN:B000VUYG40 His Tweezerman Deluxe Shaving Brush]] (my travel brush) thinking I would work up from here.  The shaving cream lather was excellent, while it was slightly thicker than I prefer when using my silver tip brush, it still lathered excellently.  I was concerned that it would not hold lather for all three of my passes and my final touch up pass, but the concern proved false as there was ample lather for the complete shave.  I did add drips of water to base of brush through lathering process in order to thin a little as it did remain a bit thicker on the brush.  I therefore must revise my earlier comment and say this is just an excellent cream regardless of the brush you are using.  Although my personal preference would be that I like the consistency offered by a brush that retains a little more water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave with the same ritual daily, only substituting one item at a time when trying new products.&lt;br /&gt; 1.

            <li> This is a product that I have used for many years. It works well and lathers up very easily. It also  has a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of different high quality shaving creams.  This is the second time I have tried Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805.  It is a very pleasant cream, but I think that the price is not justified.  Just as good and less expensive is the range from Taylors of Old Bond Street.</li>
            <li> I can see why generations of English Royalty and dignitaries prefer this brand.  This is truly a luxurious shaving cream fit for a King.  Did you know that they found a tub of Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving cream in the ruins of the Titanic?  It&#x27;s true.  Look on Truefitt&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I used any Truefitt &amp; Hill product, I was kind of skeptical because I previously used The Art of Shaving creams.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, The Art of Shaving does a great job of making an excellent cream.  But I must say, you really get what you pay for.  If I had to rate this cream, I would say it is ten steps above The Art of Shaving&#x27;s products.  And the tub seems to last forever.  I am addicted to the way Truefitt&#x27;s 1805 smells!  It awakens your senses in the morning.  It is a true pleasure to shave in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as lather, this cream creates a thick and fluffy whipped up concoction that leaves your skin smooth and smelling great.  I thought the fragrance would irritate my skin.  It didn&#x27;t at all.  You may want to try a Truefitt sample pack.  You can purchase it by going directly on their website so that you can sample all of their creams and fragrances. You could use Truefitt&#x27;s pre-shave oil, but, you may be able to get away with not using it since this is a very moisturizing cream.  The best way I could describe the smell is oceanic and masculine.  After I&#x27;m done with my three shave passes, I apply [[ASIN:B000RG8D6K Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Aftershave Balm]] and then [[ASIN:B000YOOJ6I Trufitt &amp; Hill 1805 Cologne]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to double edged shaving, you may want to pay attention to some other items in my shave rotation.

            <li> If you&#x27;re a morning person and enjoy shaving, get this. If you are the kind of person who wakes up with just enough time to get ready and run out the door, don&#x27;t even bother. This will add a good 5-10 minutes onto your shaving time. If you have the time to spare, then it is WELL worth it, because the quality of shave you get out of this is just amazing. Not to mention my girlfriend is obsessed with my face afterwards because of the scent and feel.</li>
            <li> Very good but over priced</li>
            <li> Truefitt and Hill 1805 is the absolute best smelling cologne.  The shave cream is the best he has ever used.  It has a great lather and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Four stars for such a luxurious lather as T&amp;F always seems to deliver... and I do love 1805 for my aftershave balm, but as far as the shaving cream is concerned... I don&#x27;t need to order it again. I may be becoming too bias toward fresh/citrusy creams, saving more complex scents for aftershaves.</li>
            <li> I always buy the Truefitt &amp; Hill shave products.  the cream is smooth, smells great and is created using quality materials.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my father on his birthday. He really liked the smell compared to a lot of what&#x27;s out there which he said are smells for young kids. I bought him the full set- brush, pre-shave, cream, &amp; aftershave. He said it was great gift! :)</li>
            <li> Most reviews have touched on the qualities of this shave soap; the superior experience, high price and (in redemption of economy) the viability of sparing use are valid and important in every sense.  But not many have made clear why the acquisition of a quality shave soap (among other things of generally good quality) is in a Gentleman&#x27;s best interest.  In a Gentleman&#x27;s rucksack of life skills - and the experience of refining them - are a great many things. A Gentleman in his own making is a Gentleman determined by the quality of both his appearance and his conduct. An amiable, honorable, and trustworthy fellow will garner respect enough for his character just a man well dressed and groomed will be respected for his active awareness of detail, hygiene, and image; a Gentleman is a man who actively fosters both these facets and their refining over the course of his life.  A Gentleman&#x27;s appearance requires a diligence in maintaining it so. The proper selection of tools in grooming - among other aspects of a Gentleman&#x27;s appearance - needs as practiced a touch for relevant quality as a keen sense of thrift. The Truffit &amp; Hill shave soaps (1805 - my favorite) fit the taste and applicability for any Gentleman. Shave well, my friends.</li>
            <li> Outstanding quality. A little expensive, but the scent is nice but too subtle for my taste. I like a scent that wakes me up in the morning like Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805. Overall enjoyable to use. I only gave it 4 for the scent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this product, period! Have this about 1 1/2 years and still a good deal left in the tub. Makes it a great value in my book.</li>
            <li> As another review said- very little is needed! - and it creates a very rich lather.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will be my primary shaving creme moving forward.</li>
            <li> Had some problem finding the 1805 Shave cream for a while but it is back and I love it. When out, tried another quality brand but it just didn&#x27;t have the same results. Truefill &amp; Hill gives a better shave and a lasting fresh fell.</li>
            <li> My husband always had skin problems with shaving creams that came in a can. Using this method of shaving and this product, no skin problems and the smoothest skin around! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells GREAT, lathers nicely, and a little goes a long way. I alternate between a safety razor and a Fusion, but I don&#x27;t know that much about soaps/creams/razors/etc. But yeah, it is great, albeit quite expensive, stuff.</li>
            <li> My husband and son-in-law love this stuff and wouldn&#x27;t shave with anything else.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. I prefer this (1805) to the TOBS Sandalwood (and I love sandalwood). The scent is mild but very pleasing. For me, the cardamom really comes out when I lather. Excellent protection and glide. This combined with a feather blade gave me my first 3 pass shave with absolutely zero razor burn or irritation.</li>
            <li> I use the Trafalgar, Grafton, and 1805 on a rotational basis and love all three.  The scents are perfect; the cream lathers really well in a scuttle.  I have used for DE and straight razor shaving with zero issue.  It is worth the money...these tubs last forever.  You do not need a lot and can lather on your face, in a scuttle, in a mug, in your hand, etc.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best shaving cream I have ever used. It is amazing how little you need to lather up your face twice with the same brush. I have never found anything better in my 70+ years.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shaving creams i have owned!</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my son for Christmas.  It has been a favorite of his for several years and he was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband after reading many reviews. It definitely has lived up to its positive feedback with my husband saying it lathered well, had a good fragrance, and was better than other shaving creams.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Lathers up great (especially with a brush!). And it&#x27;s a great smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relatively new to wet shaving, but so far the Trufitt &amp; Hill 1805 is my favorite shave cream.  The scent is very mild, though quite pleasing. It lathers fantastically.  I&#x27;ve already ordered the Grafton, but haven&#x27;t received it yet. The Trufitt &amp; Hill creams are not cheap, but totally worth it.  I use a silver tip badger brush and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> very good quality  great present  rather classy</li>
            <li> I love this shave cream. I tried to marry it but that&#x27;s illegal in Arizona. I bought some for my dad a few years ago and I&#x27;ve been using it myself ever since. I don&#x27;t know why exactly but the fragrance just appeals to me. It doesn&#x27;t overpower your olfactory senses and the scent wafts of a crisp cleanliness. It only takes a tiny bit of this soap to whip up a nice lather. It also comes in a bakelite jar just like it would have 50 years ago. If you are used to creams like Barbasol or Gillette, buy this now. Do it. If you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best shave cream you&#x27;ve ever used in your life, there&#x27;s something broken in your brain. I also recommend you try their Super Badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to watch out for: If you live in a desert state, like Arizona, DON&#x27;T purchase this when temperatures are over 100 degrees. I met the UPS driver at my door but just from the time it spent in the delivery van, the cream separated and was slightly gelatinous. Whenever I need some of this in the summer, I seek out local sellers. Since this has nothing to do with the product itself, I didn&#x27;t remove any stars.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent, excellent shaving cream.  Only takes a nickle sized dab to get a 3 pass head shave.  I will be ordering again when I run out in 6-8 months.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. T&amp;H has been in business this long for a reason!  The cream has a great texture and lathers well.</li>
            <li> This shave cream has been my favorite so far.  The scent is very nice, not overpowering, and it whips up very easily.  It does a very nice job of lubricating during shaving and I find that I can go over an area a couple times and I still get a great shave.  I will definitely be buying this again in the future.</li>
            <li> The best shaving cream I have ever used.  Trust, I have tried them all, nothing compares to TH.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best shave cream I have ever used.  The 1805 has a great scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering; it&#x27;s just right.  Just a dab will lather into the thickest, richest cream, making for a great shaving experience.  Do yourself a favor and pull the trigger on this purchase - it&#x27;s worth every cent.</li>
            <li> My past experiences with shaving cream were primarily the spray foam variety and inexpensive shaving soap for brush use. I recently decided to splurge on a higher quality product, and after perusing Amazon and seeing all the positive revues for Truefitt &amp; Hill I went for it. I ordered the Trafalgar and I must disagree with it being labeled a musky scent; I found it light and clean but mature with a subtle hint of gin. If anything I wish the scent were a little stronger, but I love the smell of it, and my girlfriend approves as well. I actually look forward to shaving much more now, and I feel motivated to invest in a proper razor and brush. The shaving cream does not dry out my skin or irritate it, and a little dab goes a long way, usually enough for two passes. Although the T&amp;H is expensive, I think the tub will last me up to a year (I only shave once a week or so). I know I&#x27;d certainly be interested in purchasing it again!</li>
            <li> Thanks for selling these.  My Husband&#x27;s skin is very sensitive to a lot of products out there so this is one of the few things he can use.  I am so happy for him! :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get past the smell it smells like an old ladys perfume . the product worked well I tossed it in the trash after first use due to the nasty scent .My SWEDISH DREAM SEA SALT SOAP is awesome as a face soap and shave soap love the sea scent ...</li>
            <li> Great Product - works as advertised</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been shaving with Plisson and Simpsons brushes, using Caswell-Massey (almond) lather shave cream. However, the last jar clearly had had a change of formula, as it took much more cream to shave. Too, instead of feeling creamy it felt like some weird chemical concoction. Disappointed, and based on Amazon user comments, I tried Truefitt &amp; Hill&#x27;s shaving cream and it is superb -- noticeably better than Caswell-Massey&#x27;s equivalent even before it went downhill. Now, using Truefitt, it takes less than half the amount to get much more lather, and the lather quality not only feels silky but provides smooth, gliding shaves. It&#x27;s no wonder this stuff has been around for 200 years. I just wish I&#x27;d known about it earlier, but a tip o&#x27; the hat to fellow Amazonians for their observations that proved to be so helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lone criticism is that there was a considerable dip inside the jar that contained only air. Time will tell whether this was one-up or is the way they always fill their jars.</li>
            <li> A good shaving cream, but the scent isn&#x27;t as good as the cologne. I still use the aftershave balm and the cologne, but I switched to TOBS Eton College, which also has a citrus-like scent. TOBS just seems to have a more pleasant scent. All in all, this shave cream does the job just as good as any.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and it makes shaving a pleasure every time. Has a nice, clean smell; not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product as a gift (the first time through royalshave.com), and I went through Amazon since I had a gift card. I&#x27;ll probably purchase through another website next time, as the shipping took the full amount of estimated time to arrive (ten days). The product smells wonderful and the recipient loves this gift.</li>
            <li> The title states it - this, for me, is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Yes it is more expensive than others.  But I use approximately 1/2 the amount (or less) than I do with either TOBS or Proraso.  Mind you I still rather like the Proraso Green, but this is provides the best shave, no matter the blade.  (I&#x27;ve tried it with Feather, Merkur and Dorco.)</li>
            <li> This is so cheap to use. You use very little, and it lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not let water get in the container, as the cream will no longer be airy, but flat an runny.</li>
            <li> I started using this only after I was growing a little tired of using Taylor Of Old Bond Street (Avacado, Jermyn Street and Eton College). I&#x27;m glad I did. While TOBS is really wonderful, in my opinion T&amp;H trumps it. And I love the scent of 1805. I have used 1805 in a scuttle, in a regular shaving bowl, and face lathering - using a silver tip badger. It never fails to amaze. Combine this with a Feather blade and a vintage Gillette Fatboy, Aristocrat, Sheraton, or Super Speed and I&#x27;m in heaven. Your tools might differ from mine - but this lather is just completely amazing. Perfect lather, easy to produce, slick enough to where I don&#x27;t even notice hair being cut. So far for me this is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> Love the smell; had to try 1805 after reading the reviews. As far as the scent, it&#x27;s one of my favorites. I heard someone describe it as similar to walking past Abercrombie &amp; Fitch... I&#x27;m not sure about that, I guess I haven&#x27;t walked by A&amp;F in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the T&amp;H Ultimate Comfort might edge out 1805 in terms of the &#x27;closeness&#x27; of the shave; but this could be more reflective of me.. (who knows...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, great scent and smooth shave and would be a great addition to any straight shavers medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Smells very good. Doesnt have the musty smell like Sandal Wood</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product last Christmas.  It is the best shave cream I have ever used leaving the skin feeling great.  It has a very classy scent to.  If used properly a jar will last you six months.</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use anything else now.  This keeps his face so smooth!</li>
            <li> I have tried many shaving creams and I keep coming back to T&amp;H.  It is really expensive but it lasts a long time and it give a better shave than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Sometimes I just open my jar to smell it. Creates a wonderfully rich lather and the scent is very clean/fresh/oceanic while maintaining a masculine and professional undertone.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lather, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Think I prefer the Trafalgar though scent wise. This is a bit too flowery, but I&#x27;d still use this every day with no problem.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> Best smelling shave cream ever!!  I discovered this product 12 years ago when I bought my first  badger hair shave brush. I have tried several brands and scents since...none that match this one for fragrance. Great lather and perfect for anyone new to wet shaving or veterans of this classic ritual of brush and creams.</li>
            <li> I have been using Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort shave cream for a couple of years and decided to try something different. 1805 shave cream has a nice fragrance and equally important, the shave cream lubricates the face perfectly when using a double edge razor. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Wow - now this is what I am talking about!  By far the best smelling, best conditioning, overall best shaving experience I have ever had.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great product, much better than any shave cream at the supermarket and worth the price.  It lasts for a long time.  Fast shipping and product exactly as described</li>
            <li> Best shaing cream since 1805.</li>
            <li> Smells and performs great! My favorite.</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING; I LIKE THE BEST OF THE BEST, AND I THINK THIS IS THE BEST IN SHAVING CREAMS</li>
            <li> Nice lather once you get the right combination of water and concentrate. Index finger scoop and warm wet soaked brush works for me.</li>
            <li> Very good lather and gentle scent (at least for me). Just remember, you do NOT need to put much on the brush, hardly anything, and it lathers up great.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried enough creams to say &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; -- but you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Great leather! Very good cream, the smell is very good too but it is not my favorite ( TOBS Eton College is my favorite ! )</li>
            <li> Ive only used TOBS Sandalwood and AOS Ocean Kelp creams. T&amp;H does have younger scent and performs well; however, it surely dries out faster than the other two.  Overall, a great cream.</li>
            <li> Are you a complex MAN?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you like complex problems? With complex solutions? Are you a LEADER? Are you willing to put your neck out for your guys?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you willing to shave another man in a demonstrative display of your own heterosexuality?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, but but- Are you able to admit that you like to sniff vanilla sometimes... and if it makes the wench happy, maybe even a flower or two??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you sometimes prefer rum to scotch? Or maybe a choking over a snuggle? A stab instead of a slap, perhaps? Oh?! You naughty...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But... sometimes! Maybe you like to stand on the stern and let the sea air blow through your barnacle-laden underparts, and feel the sea spray on your scurvy-soaked buttocks!! You cast caution to the wind and challenge Davey Jones from your canoe on the lake to come out his Damn Self and in the depths of a drunken orgy you once killed a guy! Wait?! What?!!? A Guy...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think you&#x27;re a complex man- confident enough to smell fresh and sensitive enough to hold a purse for a minute or two (BUT NO LONGER! DAMNIT WOMAN THERE ARE RULES) then you just might be worthy enough to slather this on. Undertake this task with the gravitas befitting the occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every day, for special days- Be a complex man. Shave with 1805.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have no idea why the year 1805 is important, GO AWAY.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite creams ever since I started wetshaving. It lathers up nice and quick, and lasts for quite a while. I also find the sent very relaxing, and I tend to use it if I shave at night for whatever reason. Great purchase, and will buy again when this runs out in 16 years or so.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-great smell&lt;br /&gt;-only takes a small dab&lt;br /&gt;-soothes skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-a tad pricey, but totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I got my father and hubby both shave sets for father&#x27;s day.  My dad is an old spice guy, but I wanted to get him something nicer.  Needless to say, Truefitt and Hill&#x27;s 1805 has converted him.  He loved the smell, and it helped provide a smooth shave with zero irritation.  I&#x27;ve now gotten calls from both of my brothers asking where I got this awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> BLUF: Good shave cream, I recommend it with a shave brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I purchased this I also purchased a badger hair shave brush (although based on how expensive those things get I probably didn&#x27;t get a very good one), and I&#x27;ve used them together since they arrived. So I can&#x27;t say with 100% certainty that the amazing shave I get with this shave cream is exclusively the result of the shave cream and not at least partially due to the brush; however I&#x27;m basically getting the best shave ever with this shave cream. I&#x27;m still using the same &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; razors I have used with numerous other commonly found shave creams/gels and the difference was immediately noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this shave cream I have a smoother shave, and zero razor burn. In the past when I&#x27;d put some cologne on after shaving it would burn a little... and there&#x27;s none with this shaving cream. I can&#x27;t comment on the smell since I haven&#x27;t really noticed it... so either I&#x27;m bad at smelling things or it&#x27;s just not that strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to inexperience with using this kind of shave cream/brush I went through quite a bit of it a lot faster than I should have so I can&#x27;t really comment on longevity either unfortunately. I have had it for probably about two, maybe three months though and have about half left.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the best look no further. A little goes a long way. Being new to wet shaving I&#x27;ve bought several different brands of shave cream, Truefitt &amp; Hill has turned out to be my go to cream.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, searched the web. This is the one for me. Great lather from small amount. I am ordering my 2nd one now. One lasts me about 8 months twice a week shave. If you want quality old school clean shaves this is it.</li>
            <li> I first got this for my husband Father&#x27;s Day 2012 and we both loved the scent.  My husband says it&#x27;s a great shaving cream.  It&#x27;s expensive but the jar lasted him 6 months.  His son visited during the summer and also liked it, so we got him some for Christmas, along with a refill for my husband.  The scent is fresh and clean, a nice and classy treat for any guy.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream has restored some of the joy of shaving. It&#x27;s not a medicinal scent, but something my girlfriend loves. (I&#x27;m now banned from use of Gillette shaving creams...) Compact, long-lasting jar: probably takes me 6 months to go through it. Finally, it does the job, softening the whiskers and preventing cuts. I can&#x27;t recommend Truefitt &amp; Hill enough.</li>
