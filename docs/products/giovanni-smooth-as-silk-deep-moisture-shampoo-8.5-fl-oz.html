            <li>Nice for afro hair.</li>
            <li>He really liked it</li>
            <li>I was using the popular Avalon Organics Thickening Shampoo and also their Conditioner</li>
            <li>It smells good, cleans well and leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>No nasty parabens or chemicals.</li>
            <li>I love Giovanni&#x27;s line they have many for colored hair or not.  </li>
            <li>Paul Brown is ok.   </li>
            <li>This is now my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Love Giovanni products and buying from Amazon helps to save you money.  </li>
            <li>I can tell that it leaves my hair healthy by the way it holds my hair waves and curls.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the smell of this shampoo too.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I finally have found the perfect shampoo for me.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I was on vacation and needed a shampoo and conditioner, when I saw the ingredients I was not too sure</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe its called Smooth as Silk!</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful, clean, shiny, moisturized, light, full...</li>
            <li>Leave in for a long time for best results.  </li>
            <li>Avalon organics pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Aveda pretty good but for conditioner I need to use a bit of the moss one.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m using Giovanni my hair (and scalp) feel cleaner, more moisturized, and my fine hair has more body.</li>
            <li>I think this product works best when you let your hair air dry after use.</li>
            <li>I had thought given that it was SLS free, that it was safer than most comparable shampoos</li>
            <li>I have used this particular Giovanni product before, LOVED it.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo and liked it at first.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to people with relaxed, or natural hair because it is very awesome for hair</li>
            <li>I use Giovanni Smooth as Silk Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li>I often use it with the Smooth as Silk Xtreme Hair Infusion Treatment, and my hair turns out smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Started using this because I liked the leave in conditioner so much, I figured I should just use them all.</li>
            <li>Truly smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the smooth as silk conditioner with it of course.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell and a silky feel on my skin, but washing my hair with it is a different story.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is either.</li>
            <li>Has a good smell and isn&#x27;t too girly or masculine, so my spouse and I can both use it.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I haven&#x27;t yet found a good shampoo that is 100% natural that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for about a month, and right from the jump, my hair felt better.</li>
            <li>hair looks smooth and clean after using this shampoo (with the matching conditioner)</li>
            <li>My hair feels really clean, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>My hair feels and smells clean, but not like any sort of perfumey odor.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and good lather without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>But when i finally did, i loved it, it felt like i just put relaxer and washed it after.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I could ever say about it, is I don&#x27;t have frizz.</li>
            <li>Maybe get a sample first, but you cannot regret it!</li>
            <li>I use the 50-50 shampoo first to really clean my hair then use this moisturizing shampoo and follow up with one of the Giovanni conditioners.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re worth it.\\</li>
            <li>So far, I absolutely love this shampoo and the hello hydration shampoo and conditioner 2 in 1.  </li>
            <li>But am pleased so far.</li>
            <li>Smells like fresh tangerine or something citrus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some success with high-protein leave-ins (</li>
            <li>This is the only time I&#x27;ve liked my hair wavy.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time writing a good review for products because i am so picky, bt this one is smthg else, a je-ne-sais-quoi, yes, try it!</li>
            <li>for my fine, curly hair, this is the only shampoo that gives me a clean and shiny head of hair.  </li>
            <li>After using it my hair is much more moist, less frizzy, more manageable and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>It made my hair super super soft.  </li>
            <li>Glad I only bought the trial size.</li>
            <li>Finally I tried this shampoo and a Giovanni conditioner many months ago and have had no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li>A friend suggested this line of products and upon my first use, I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>so I will stick with conditioners only as they are better for my hair anyway.</li>
            <li>Great for thick hair as well.</li>
            <li>this, along with the Giovanni Smooth as Silk conditioner, the Direct leave in conditioner, and the VitaPro fusion treatment seems to help a lot.</li>
            <li>The Cosmetics Ingredient Review Board advises that it should not be used at more than a 5% concentration, and should only be used in wash-off products.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo that I&#x27;ve used that keeps hair feeling great and not stringy like other shampoos do.</li>
            <li>This is just as good as Aveda if not better</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt more dry, it feels like I washed with Dawn soap.</li>
            <li>when I towel dried it--felt more like I had used a deep-clean dish detergent rather than shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Soft (but not so soft that it won&#x27;t hold a style), shiny, easy to comb through</li>
            <li>Infusium 23, for one), but they always build up too much and end up making my hair kind of a mess eventually.</li>
            <li>After two or three washes with Giovanni Smooth as Silk, my hair looked so much shinier that I felt like a shampoo commercial model.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo left it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>Also very porous.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried shampoos that are supposed to do everything from curl to de-frizz to shine to soften and have never noticed a real difference with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have never lost so much hair with a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I had to go behind it with one of my better more moisturizing conditioning co/wash products.</li>
            <li>It left my hair clean and was gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>It got my hair so clean that it actually squeaked</li>
            <li>but they seemed ok since it had some organic ingredients, still the label is very deceiving making you think that its an organic shampoo like other reviewers posted but its not!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used natural dish soap as a shampoo, and it worked pretty well for my hair.</li>
            <li>My brillo pad of coarse, frizzy hair at the nape (dubbed my \\&quot;pubes\\&quot;) looks almost as straight and shiny and calm as the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>and wow what a positive difference.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend both the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Loves Protein, Loves Moisture so anything high in protein is up my ally.</li>
            <li>I have often noticed that when I buy all-natural shampoos, they don&#x27;t suds up as well as normal shampoos.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks, I have to say, my hair has not felt this healthy since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>I tried several and several products, but none fit my hair.</li>
            <li>Hair very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>it is all natural and still works SO well!  </li>
            <li>In the past month, I&#x27;ve noticed more hair falling out.</li>
            <li>I have never felt this not even with cheaper non natural shampoos ever!</li>
            <li>The first ingredient listed on the bottle is Aqua, and the second is Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, a -synthetic- surfactant used as a detergent, skin conditioning agent, and emulsifier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never expected such drastic results from a vegan shampoo; Giovanni is 100% worth the price.</li>
            <li>and im the all natural of the natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those unfortunates who, as I age, is sensitive to everything under the sun.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been seaching for products to maintain my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I used to have stick straight hair in my younger days, and it&#x27;s gradually morphed into a wavy situation.</li>
            <li>The first month or so I used it my hair was soft, but after that it became dry.</li>
            <li>when wet or dry, no smell (I&#x27;m not crazy about my hair smelling like strawberry shampoo all day for instance!), and just 100%.  </li>
            <li>but I am feel I am gonna cry if I continue loosing so much hair in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li>So anyways, my sister in law who has the long, thick, soft american hair told me that after a few washes, her hair felt so soft and great.</li>
            <li>And I am using NO other products.</li>
            <li>(Btw, i have the non soft african hair and put relaxer in it).</li>
            <li>this shampoo is far from their title &amp;#34;smooth as silk deep moisture&amp;#34; My hair tangles and has no shine after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>In fact, it did the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>I found that the two combined left my hair extremely soft, cuticles were not as raised (with a ACV rinse) and it gave me the extra moisture I need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen this shampoo at my university&#x27;s marketplace, and since it was a &#x27;salon-quality&#x27; shampoo, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Since it was on sale at my local Marshall&#x27;s, I bought a giant bottle complete with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate is NOW listed as the second ingredient so the list is complete; BUT I still feel the same way about the ingredient itself]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x27;Under certain conditions, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate can break down and form carcinogenic nitrosamines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American woman that recently went from relaxed to natural hair, so I&#x27;ve been experimenting with products that will keep my hair moisturized and</li>
            <li>They are the only natural shampoo products that have worked on my dry hair.</li>

            <li> It made my hair super super soft.  </li>
            <li> Glad I only bought the trial size.</li>
            <li> Finally I tried this shampoo and a Giovanni conditioner many months ago and have had no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested this line of products and upon my first use, I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> so I will stick with conditioners only as they are better for my hair anyway.</li>
            <li> Great for thick hair as well.</li>
            <li> this, along with the Giovanni Smooth as Silk conditioner, the Direct leave in conditioner, and the VitaPro fusion treatment seems to help a lot.</li>
            <li> The Cosmetics Ingredient Review Board advises that it should not be used at more than a 5% concentration, and should only be used in wash-off products.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that I&#x27;ve used that keeps hair feeling great and not stringy like other shampoos do.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as Aveda if not better</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt more dry, it feels like I washed with Dawn soap.</li>
            <li> when I towel dried it--felt more like I had used a deep-clean dish detergent rather than shampoo!  </li>
            <li> Soft (but not so soft that it won&#x27;t hold a style), shiny, easy to comb through</li>
            <li> Infusium 23, for one), but they always build up too much and end up making my hair kind of a mess eventually.</li>
            <li> After two or three washes with Giovanni Smooth as Silk, my hair looked so much shinier that I felt like a shampoo commercial model.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo left it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> Also very porous.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shampoos that are supposed to do everything from curl to de-frizz to shine to soften and have never noticed a real difference with my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have never lost so much hair with a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had to go behind it with one of my better more moisturizing conditioning co/wash products.</li>
            <li> It left my hair clean and was gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> It got my hair so clean that it actually squeaked</li>
            <li> but they seemed ok since it had some organic ingredients, still the label is very deceiving making you think that its an organic shampoo like other reviewers posted but its not!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used natural dish soap as a shampoo, and it worked pretty well for my hair.</li>
            <li> My brillo pad of coarse, frizzy hair at the nape (dubbed my \\&quot;pubes\\&quot;) looks almost as straight and shiny and calm as the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> and wow what a positive difference.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend both the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Loves Protein, Loves Moisture so anything high in protein is up my ally.</li>
            <li> I have often noticed that when I buy all-natural shampoos, they don&#x27;t suds up as well as normal shampoos.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I have to say, my hair has not felt this healthy since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I tried several and several products, but none fit my hair.</li>
            <li> Hair very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> it is all natural and still works SO well!  </li>
            <li> In the past month, I&#x27;ve noticed more hair falling out.</li>
            <li> I have never felt this not even with cheaper non natural shampoos ever!</li>
            <li> The first ingredient listed on the bottle is Aqua, and the second is Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, a -synthetic- surfactant used as a detergent, skin conditioning agent, and emulsifier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never expected such drastic results from a vegan shampoo; Giovanni is 100% worth the price.</li>
            <li> and im the all natural of the natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those unfortunates who, as I age, is sensitive to everything under the sun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seaching for products to maintain my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I used to have stick straight hair in my younger days, and it&#x27;s gradually morphed into a wavy situation.</li>
            <li> The first month or so I used it my hair was soft, but after that it became dry.</li>
            <li> when wet or dry, no smell (I&#x27;m not crazy about my hair smelling like strawberry shampoo all day for instance!), and just 100%.  </li>
            <li> but I am feel I am gonna cry if I continue loosing so much hair in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li> So anyways, my sister in law who has the long, thick, soft american hair told me that after a few washes, her hair felt so soft and great.</li>
            <li> And I am using NO other products.</li>
            <li> (Btw, i have the non soft african hair and put relaxer in it).</li>
            <li> this shampoo is far from their title &amp;#34;smooth as silk deep moisture&amp;#34; My hair tangles and has no shine after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> In fact, it did the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> I found that the two combined left my hair extremely soft, cuticles were not as raised (with a ACV rinse) and it gave me the extra moisture I need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this shampoo at my university&#x27;s marketplace, and since it was a &#x27;salon-quality&#x27; shampoo, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Since it was on sale at my local Marshall&#x27;s, I bought a giant bottle complete with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate is NOW listed as the second ingredient so the list is complete; BUT I still feel the same way about the ingredient itself]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x27;Under certain conditions, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate can break down and form carcinogenic nitrosamines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman that recently went from relaxed to natural hair, so I&#x27;ve been experimenting with products that will keep my hair moisturized and</li>
            <li> They are the only natural shampoo products that have worked on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> or it would have completely destroyed my long hair, no thanks.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Since I still had a lot of other conditioners, I did not other this brand&#x27;s conditioner yet.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo strips your hair leaving it coarse and feeling dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and brittle, and in no way did this shampoo give my hair &#x27;deep moisture&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It ended up making my hair very dry, and left build up on my roots.</li>
            <li> I rate this product very highly due to the fact I showed it to my Hair Stylist and see definitely approved it for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that for some alot of protein makes hair dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> the product I received in the mail from this shipper was discolored and leaves my hair extremely dry and almost brittle feeling.</li>
            <li> anyway after using the shampoo and conditioner amy hair felt so dry and tangled</li>
            <li> have to evaluate the cost effectiveness; as I have long, thick hair and product usually depletes quickly.  </li>
            <li> Works like a charm on my dry curly lifeguard hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and brittle form heat /chemical damage.</li>
            <li> Product works to tame my unruly coarse, curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair extremely brittle.</li>
            <li> I would probably stay away from other Giovanni&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will buy again in the future</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with the conditioner for over a year and a half now</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half the price, even in the store.</li>
            <li> Ive been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that have a lot less chemicals or non because someone in my family has asthma.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and curly and not as thick as I would like it yet.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy hair that is hard to control.</li>
            <li> Dry, hard, etc.</li>
            <li> Also, I really couldn&#x27;t stand the scent of this product; it has artificial orange smell.</li>
            <li> On a mission to reduce the number of toxins in and around me, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo/conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Try it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> have dyed thin hair, and this shampoo left my hair frizzy and course by the end of the wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it two days, but it&#x27;s a dramatic difference.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde highlights and thicker hair that is prone to frizz with the wrong products.....</li>
            <li> The texture was very weird, almost like soft jello and instead of moisturizing it sucks all the moisture out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I will only use all natural and organic products on my head, it is too close to my brain to risk all the nasty chemicals, I also dont want seeping into the ocean and earth.  </li>
            <li> I know it sounds like I must be exaggerating, but this stuff is gold, to the point that I felt compelled to share with all of you people struggling with frizz, dryness, greasiness (I had it all) and just plain weird hair.</li>
            <li> I am thinking that either something changed in the formula (freaking product improvements that always seem to be for the worse) or I need to take a break from it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely evil would you want to live in a cage to be proded and harassed every day.</li>
            <li> Sad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about hair products.  </li>
            <li> Even with drug store brand shampoo, I&#x27;ve never had such a terrible experience.</li>
            <li> It made my hair break and impossible to comb through even though I used the conditioner afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not too bad either.</li>
            <li> I was sooo disappointed with this product after all the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> Too bad Ulta quit selling it!!</li>
            <li> It was horrible!</li>
            <li> my hair felt horrible, I will return this product ASAP.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice product. Has a good smell and isn&#x27;t too girly or masculine, so my spouse and I can both use it. Hair very soft afterwards. No nasty parabens or chemicals.</li>
            <li> I use Giovanni Smooth as Silk Shampoo and Conditioner and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. After using it my hair is much more moist, less frizzy, more manageable and looks much healthier. It has a nice scent and good lather without all the harsh chemicals. Highly recommend both the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was sooo disappointed with this product after all the rave reviews. This shampoo strips your hair leaving it coarse and feeling dry. I had to go behind it with one of my better more moisturizing conditioning co/wash products. Glad I only bought the trial size.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t respond the wayI thought it would. What works for others doesn&#x27;t necessairly work you.</li>
            <li> I use for color treated overprocessed curly hair, works great, my hair color stays looks great.  Leave in for a long time for best results.  I love Giovanni&#x27;s line they have many for colored hair or not.  My hair is overprocessed it feels great. Also like Eo organics.  I will only use all natural and organic products on my head, it is too close to my brain to risk all the nasty chemicals, I also dont want seeping into the ocean and earth.  Avalon organics pretty good.  Nature&#x27;s gate not so good but quite a bargain. Aveda pretty good but for conditioner I need to use a bit of the moss one.  Paul Brown is ok.   Dont ever use products tested on Animals! Absolutely evil would you want to live in a cage to be proded and harassed every day. Sad.  I will maybe try the baking soda and apple cider im scared and im the all natural of the natural.  My hairdresser said to rinse with a conditioner so that you dont have to wash every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this shampoo. I have dry, frizzy hair that is hard to control. This shampoo left it smooth and manageable. It has a good consistency and works into a good lather. This is now my favorite shampoo. I often use it with the Smooth as Silk Xtreme Hair Infusion Treatment, and my hair turns out smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Started using this because I liked the leave in conditioner so much, I figured I should just use them all. Too bad Ulta quit selling it!!</li>
            <li> I thought the smell would be stronger</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and the matching conditioner after reading rave reviews on several hair forums and youtube.  I have 3a-3b hair dyed, and ends still have some relaxer in it. My hair is very dry and brittle form heat /chemical damage. Also very porous.   I found that the two combined left my hair extremely soft, cuticles were not as raised (with a ACV rinse) and it gave me the extra moisture I need. For those complaining that it left their hair dry/hard it has a lot of protein in it and maybe your hair can&#x27;t take a lot of protein. I&#x27;ve read that for some alot of protein makes hair dry and brittle.  My hair is  like a sponge. Loves Protein, Loves Moisture so anything high in protein is up my ally. These products are definitely part of my hair arsenal.</li>
            <li> I should have read that it is for chemically treated hair.  My hair is long and curly and not as thick as I would like it yet.  It was as if I had just washed my hair with eggs and nothing added. Definitely no moisture at all.  It made my hair break and impossible to comb through even though I used the conditioner afterwards.  It smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those unfortunates who, as I age, is sensitive to everything under the sun.  I&#x27;ve searched for several years for a combination of shampoo/conditioner that won&#x27;t make me itch!  Finally I tried this shampoo and a Giovanni conditioner many months ago and have had no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have often noticed that when I buy all-natural shampoos, they don&#x27;t suds up as well as normal shampoos.  This one works well, though, and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical about hair products.  I&#x27;ve tried shampoos that are supposed to do everything from curl to de-frizz to shine to soften and have never noticed a real difference with my hair.  Not this time!  After two or three washes with Giovanni Smooth as Silk, my hair looked so much shinier that I felt like a shampoo commercial model.  I actually stood in front of the mirror tossing my hair around and sultrily whispering \\&quot;Because you&#x27;re worth it.\\&quot;  I never expected such drastic results from a vegan shampoo; Giovanni is 100% worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  Absolutely love it!!! It made my hair super super soft.  Since I still had a lot of other conditioners, I did not other this brand&#x27;s conditioner yet.  From the experience with the shampoo.  I am planning to get the conditioner. So far, I absolutely love this shampoo and the hello hydration shampoo and conditioner 2 in 1.  Imagine this shampoo gives me the same result as a 2 in 1.  That&#x27;s amazing.  Truly smooth as silk.  By the way, I have 4a/4b hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with the conditioner for over a year and a half now and I love them. They are the only natural shampoo products that have worked on my dry hair. It smells good, cleans well and leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth. This product is not tested on animals, is organic and has no animal ingredients in it, perfect for the vegan lifestyle :) I will be devastated if they stop making this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been seaching for products to maintain my natural hair.  A friend suggested this line of products and upon my first use, I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will have to evaluate the cost effectiveness; as I have long, thick hair and product usually depletes quickly.  But am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, organic - doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn.  Love Giovanni products and buying from Amazon helps to save you money.  Health food store, more expensive.</li>
            <li> Great for my 3B/3C ethnic / blasian hair!  The difference between this shampoo and others is great!  This is the only shampoo that I&#x27;ve used that keeps hair feeling great and not stringy like other shampoos do. I can tell that it leaves my hair healthy by the way it holds my hair waves and curls. Absolutely love the smell of this shampoo too. Best ever!</li>
            <li> This is just as good as Aveda if not better and it&#x27;s half the price, even in the store. My hair feels really clean, not greasy at all. The conditioner is great too.</li>
            <li> ...after reading some of the one star reviews here, I&#x27;m concerned about some of the ingredients in this product. I had thought given that it was SLS free, that it was safer than most comparable shampoos, now I&#x27;m not so sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks smooth and clean after using this shampoo (with the matching conditioner) but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. I prefer organic products whenever possible too, and only some of the ingredients in this one,actually are.</li>
            <li> I started using this product last year. It left my hair clean and was gentle on my hair. However, the last bottle I purchased and used seems to leave my hair stressed out. It just does not feel the same. I am thinking that either something changed in the formula (freaking product improvements that always seem to be for the worse) or I need to take a break from it.</li>
            <li> Nice for afro hair. The smell is not too bad either. This leaves my hair clean and soft. I find it pricey though so I will stick with conditioners only as they are better for my hair anyway.</li>
            <li> Ive been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that have a lot less chemicals or non because someone in my family has asthma. I tried several and several products, but none fit my hair. (Btw, i have the non soft african hair and put relaxer in it). So anyways, my sister in law who has the long, thick, soft american hair told me that after a few washes, her hair felt so soft and great. So thinking that it works like that just because of her hair type, i waited to try it. But when i finally did, i loved it, it felt like i just put relaxer and washed it after. A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Give it a try! Maybe get a sample first, but you cannot regret it! I have a hard time writing a good review for products because i am so picky, bt this one is smthg else, a je-ne-sais-quoi, yes, try it!</li>
            <li> It cleaned my hair but it was not silk</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells great and has done wonders for my hair. I think this product works best when you let your hair air dry after use.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I use the 50-50 shampoo first to really clean my hair then use this moisturizing shampoo and follow up with one of the Giovanni conditioners.  You only need a dime-sized amount to get a lot of lather.  Since adding this shampoo to my hair-cleaning regimen, my hair feels healthier.</li>
            <li> I have tried this shampoo for over a week now hoping my hair just needed to get used to it. My hair has never felt more dry, it feels like I washed with Dawn soap. It has made my hair extremely brittle. I have never lost so much hair with a shampoo and conditioner. I have been using it with the conditioner and it just aweful for me. I am throwing it away. I gave it a good go but I am feel I am gonna cry if I continue loosing so much hair in such a short period of time. The only good thing I could ever say about it, is I don&#x27;t have frizz.</li>
            <li> I like Giovanni products, but they are not really 100% natural. They have a lot of chemical ingredients that do worry me. I bought this because I haven&#x27;t yet found a good shampoo that is 100% natural that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. I&#x27;ve even used natural dish soap as a shampoo, and it worked pretty well for my hair. I may just go back to using that.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm on my dry curly lifeguard hair! Great for thick hair as well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to people with relaxed, or natural hair because it is very awesome for hair</li>
            <li> It made my head itch.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is far from their title &amp;#34;smooth as silk deep moisture&amp;#34; My hair tangles and has no shine after using this shampoo. Also, I really couldn&#x27;t stand the scent of this product; it has artificial orange smell. I would probably stay away from other Giovanni&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> for my fine, curly hair, this is the only shampoo that gives me a clean and shiny head of hair.  I finally have found the perfect shampoo for me.</li>
            <li> On a mission to reduce the number of toxins in and around me, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few \\&quot;natural\\&quot; shampoo/conditioners.  This one outperforms them ALL!  I LOOOOOOVE IT!  I&#x27;ve only used it two days, but it&#x27;s a dramatic difference.  My hair looks gorgeous!  Soft (but not so soft that it won&#x27;t hold a style), shiny, easy to comb through when wet or dry, no smell (I&#x27;m not crazy about my hair smelling like strawberry shampoo all day for instance!), and just 100%.  I can&#x27;t stress it enough.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I&#x27;m using the smooth as silk conditioner with it of course.  The smell in the shower is not overpowering, but I like that it also doesn&#x27;t stick around after the rinse.  My hair feels and smells clean, but not like any sort of perfumey odor.  I&#x27;m just amazed at this product b/c it is all natural and still works SO well!  I have blonde highlights and thicker hair that is prone to frizz with the wrong products.....this shampoo/conditioner amazes me because I don&#x27;t need any pre-styling products to have shiny gorgeous hair!  Buy it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  Great lather.  But it does have a perfumey scent. Not sure I will buy again in the future</li>
            <li> Cleans well, lathers well. Smells like fresh tangerine or something citrus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a love/hate affair with this shampoo.  It has a great smell and a silky feel on my skin, but washing my hair with it is a different story.  It got my hair so clean that it actually squeaked when I towel dried it--felt more like I had used a deep-clean dish detergent rather than shampoo!  And, believe me, you&#x27;ll need conditioner.  No comb or brush can get through your locks after shampooing with this product.  Having said that, I&#x27;m still enamoured with the smell and texture of this shampoo, and while I no longer use it on my hair, it&#x27;s great for washing up after I finish working in the garden.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of shampoos, not to mention leave-in products. I&#x27;ve had some success with high-protein leave-ins (Infusium 23, for one), but they always build up too much and end up making my hair kind of a mess eventually. Dry, hard, etc. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for about a month, and right from the jump, my hair felt better. After a few weeks, I have to say, my hair has not felt this healthy since I was a teenager. My brillo pad of coarse, frizzy hair at the nape (dubbed my \\&quot;pubes\\&quot;) looks almost as straight and shiny and calm as the rest of my hair. And I am using NO other products. No leave-ins. No styling gels or creams. Nada. And I&#x27;m not using a flat iron. I did not hope for this in any shampoo. I used to have stick straight hair in my younger days, and it&#x27;s gradually morphed into a wavy situation. This is the only time I&#x27;ve liked my hair wavy. It looks beautiful, clean, shiny, moisturized, light, full...I know it sounds like I must be exaggerating, but this stuff is gold, to the point that I felt compelled to share with all of you people struggling with frizz, dryness, greasiness (I had it all) and just plain weird hair. I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it is either. My boyfriend just started using it, and I didn&#x27;t have to twist him arm to try it. I think he&#x27;s noticed my hair looks good. Try it for a few weeks. Give it time to totally amaze you. I&#x27;m just hoping my hair doesn&#x27;t tire of it in some way. Please....</li>
            <li> Shampoo is ok but conditioner is great.  Just received product will have to give it some time for my hair to get use to</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and liked it at first. It ended up making my hair very dry, and left build up on my roots. The first month or so I used it my hair was soft, but after that it became dry.</li>
            <li> The bottle I bought was a 1,000 ml dispenser, but the same shampoo. It was horrible! The texture was very weird, almost like soft jello and instead of moisturizing it sucks all the moisture out of your hair. I had to throw it out or it would have completely destroyed my long hair, no thanks.</li>
            <li> I have used this particular Giovanni product before, LOVED it.&lt;br /&gt;But the product I received in the mail from this shipper was discolored and leaves my hair extremely dry and almost brittle feeling. If I didn&#x27;t use it with the Conditioner from the same line (but bought from a store), my hair would be unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo should be WHITE, not Orangish/Yellow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this shampoo at my university&#x27;s marketplace, and since it was a &#x27;salon-quality&#x27; shampoo, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Since it was on sale at my local Marshall&#x27;s, I bought a giant bottle complete with a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dyed thin hair, and this shampoo left my hair frizzy and course by the end of the wash. My hair is dry and brittle, and in no way did this shampoo give my hair &#x27;deep moisture&#x27;.  In fact, it did the complete opposite. In the past month, I&#x27;ve noticed more hair falling out. Even with drug store brand shampoo, I&#x27;ve never had such a terrible experience. Warning!</li>
            <li> I bought it because I was on vacation and needed a shampoo and conditioner, when I saw the ingredients I was not too sure but they seemed ok since it had some organic ingredients, still the label is very deceiving making you think that its an organic shampoo like other reviewers posted but its not! anyway after using the shampoo and conditioner amy hair felt so dry and tangled, It felt like I washed with dishwasher detergent! I have never felt this not even with cheaper non natural shampoos ever! my hair felt horrible, I will return this product ASAP. I can&#x27;t believe its called Smooth as Silk!</li>
            <li> I rate this product very highly due to the fact I showed it to my Hair Stylist and see definitely approved it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman that recently went from relaxed to natural hair, so I&#x27;ve been experimenting with products that will keep my hair moisturized and this, along with the Giovanni Smooth as Silk conditioner, the Direct leave in conditioner, and the VitaPro fusion treatment seems to help a lot.</li>
            <li> works great if you pair it with the smooth as silk conditioner , best combo ive used in that price range</li>
            <li> I bought this as well as the the Giovanni Deep Moisture Conditioner for my husband.  He really liked it so I decided to try it and wow what a positive difference.  I was using the popular Avalon Organics Thickening Shampoo and also their Conditioner but they re-formulated the conditioner and it has never been the same which in turn caused me to get a scalp irritation.  Now that I&#x27;m using Giovanni my hair (and scalp) feel cleaner, more moisturized, and my fine hair has more body.</li>
            <li> Discovered it while shopping in Tokyo of all places. Product works to tame my unruly coarse, curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> [Edited to add:  Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate is NOW listed as the second ingredient so the list is complete; BUT I still feel the same way about the ingredient itself]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s different from the one on the bottle and is deceptive.  The first ingredient listed on the bottle is Aqua, and the second is Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, a -synthetic- surfactant used as a detergent, skin conditioning agent, and emulsifier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Under certain conditions, Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate can break down and form carcinogenic nitrosamines. The Cosmetics Ingredient Review Board advises that it should not be used at more than a 5% concentration, and should only be used in wash-off products. Sodium lauroyl sarcosinate has the same initials as sodium lauryl sulfate, and the same risks.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The botanical ingredients listed on this page are on the bottle too, afterwards; and not as organic.  Though above the list &#x27;certified organic botanicals&#x27;(sic) are mentioned. When I purchase products with organic ingredients, each item that&#x27;s organic is individually listed as organic on the ingredient list. There is not one listed as organic on the bottle, unlike the list on this page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I based my purchase from the ingredients list on this page and would have never ordered it based on what I know now. I wish my scanner was working properly, if anyone post a picture of the list on the back of the bottle, please do!</li>
