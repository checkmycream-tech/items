            <li>Best product for easy eyebrow hair removal.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job as I have done myself with these strips.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Hope everyone else has good results like I did.</li>
            <li>Then, it&#x27;s off and running to beautiful brows effortlessly, pain free, bumpless and bat those eyes!</li>
            <li>Great for travel too when you cannot get to a salon and also for touching up in between waxings.</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>The shapers take all of it off the first time and shape your eyebrow perfectly!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these strips!  </li>
            <li>I have been looking all over for it and was pleased to find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>So glad I found it here!  </li>
            <li>so glad I found them again!</li>
            <li>I am allergic to the wax at the hairdresser, so it&#x27;s nice to have a product that I can use at home.</li>
            <li>Then warm the strips in my hands by rubbing them between my palms until warm.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect product for anyone with really problem brows.  </li>
            <li>sure your skin in freshly cleaned for best results.</li>
            <li>Finally, I tried these, and for the very first time, in all my plucking/waxing history, I had perfectly shaped, beautiful eyebrows WITH NO REDNESS OR PAIN!!  </li>
            <li>Love the product and was very glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Very easy and painless to use.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>But to each their own. :)</li>
            <li>Love love love this!</li>
            <li>So glad to find them.</li>
            <li>Every time it will rip off your top layer of skin.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s not 30 minutes with the tweezers</li>
            <li>For me, the upper brow shapers work perfectly; the lower brow shapers need a bit of tweaking for the shape I prefer.</li>
            <li>I bought 4 or 5 box&#x27;s as the rewiews seemed ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>Love these strips.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I love these,</li>
            <li>A very quick and not-too-painful way to get rid of stray eyebrow hair.  </li>
            <li>They are so easy to use too.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I never found another product as easy to use as this one is.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use and work well.</li>
            <li>I made sure the skin was clean and free of oil and placed the strip where it belongs.</li>
            <li>Cheap &amp; easy</li>
            <li>The hair came off just fine..</li>
            <li>( I have a huge patch of irritated skin that is peeling under my eye..</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have to clean up sticky spills from the wax kit, and it fits easily into my makeup kit for travel.</li>
            <li>Works great on my coarse eyebrows and helps shape them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this product, and I hope everyone else loves it as much as I do so that it will stick around.  </li>
            <li>the adhesive strips aren&#x27;t very sticky so they weren&#x27;t effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i do recommend these if you have the time to get your brows just right :)</li>
            <li>So quick and easy... and cheap.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was impressively quick.</li>
            <li>You have to start with perfectly clean skin.</li>
            <li>There were only a couple of minutes of redness and tingling, and then it completely went away, and my eyebrows are perfect.  </li>
            <li>I use a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol to clean off the oils around and on my eyebrows before I begin.  </li>
            <li>Me, my boss and everyone in the office love these so much we keep em in our desk drawers and do each others brows.</li>
            <li>They are better than what my daughter used to get me and they work really well</li>
            <li>Thought they would work better than they did, maybe I am not doing it right, but not a bad product, would be nice for teen or tweens who are just learning how to shape eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I then pull the skin taut and remove the strip quickly against the direction of the hair.     </li>
            <li>They are easy and convenient to use and work very well.</li>
            <li>when you read reviews about only being able to use one strip once, they aren&#x27;t kidding!</li>
            <li>All in all I really like the product!!</li>
            <li>I also like that I rarely feel any stickiness when using this product.</li>
            <li>This product is a complete lie, nothing more than a scotch tape.  </li>
            <li>The clear strips are easy to apply and do a great job with little pain.</li>
            <li>i have a soothing aloe gel that i bought for my brazilians that i just slop right on the itchy bumps and</li>
            <li>so I figured people just weren&#x27;t using them right..</li>
            <li>These are easy, fool-proof and don&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>If you make sure your skin is completely clean and dry they will work.  </li>
            <li>It feels exactly like you&#x27;re putting scotch tape on your face.</li>
            <li>They work great for me a least.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy these at the drug store and big box stores.  </li>
            <li>They really work!  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to pull in the opposite direction of the hair growth.</li>
            <li>They never know exactly where to start.  </li>
            <li>These are the only thing I use, I just love them and Walmart quit carrying them.  </li>
            <li>They work for me but there are some steps you have to really be aware of.</li>
            <li>I am pretty savvy in the beauty world</li>
            <li>All in all this product is good to remove the hair maybe for a few stray hairs in between going to the salon if you dont want to tweeze, but it is definately not your go to product.</li>
            <li>Can take a couple or three strips to really do the job, but very fast</li>
            <li>This product irritates my skin less than hot wax at the salon or the tweezer sessions, but it is just as effective.    </li>
            <li>They are shaped so they are pretty much foolproof.  </li>
            <li>I can do my own brows in less than 5 minutes for about 75 cents.</li>
            <li>By the way, these  little strips work great for removing hair on my upper lip too!</li>
            <li>You only have the curve that&#x27;s available</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I do not have much time to run out and get them done at a salon.  </li>
            <li>They save me so much time and hassle.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t do absolutely anything for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>They work really well</li>
            <li>If your skin is the least bit oily, I&#x27;d suggest a good cleansing with soap and water, then use an astringent on your skin.</li>
            <li>and I do not have to use as many to get my brows trimmed and cleaned up as I did with the other brand.</li>
            <li>That particular store no longer carried it</li>
            <li>Dont waste your money, this is nothing more than shaped scotch tape.</li>
            <li>I then press it down firmly all along the strip and then pull against the direction of my hair growth and it quickly removes the unwanted hairs and gives me a nice shape.  </li>
            <li>I have used several different eye brow waxing strips before and so far this is the quickest and easiest way to clean up my eyebrows!</li>
            <li>These strips wisk off every single bit of hair that I want removed quickly and with no pain or bumps.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and these strips ripped off a piece of skin about the size of a pencil eraser!</li>
            <li>Apply pressure immediately after and it doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few moments of redness after using these, but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you wash the area to be waxed as oils and makeup on face make it hard for the strips to stick to the hair.</li>
            <li>Neither time did any of the strips stick enough to remove much if any hair, resulting in my wife having to use tweezers to complete the job.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Just 2 days ago I had my brows waxed professionally</li>
            <li>I also still have bumps and redness from the professional job and none of that with these strips.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this at the dollar store near my home, but they stopped carrying it, so I ordered it online.</li>
            <li>I bought a whole case to last me the year.</li>
            <li>I have TR&amp;eacute;S sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some not-so-great reviews, but personally, I LOVE these, and highly recommend at least trying them out!</li>
            <li>I cut the long strips in half, as I find working with a shorter piece more convenient.</li>
            <li>I start with clean skin by using a toner to clean off my skin so my pores aren&#x27;t wide open and subject to inflammation.</li>
            <li>I rub firmly about 10 times in the direction of the hair to warm the wax on the strip and get it down to the skin.</li>
            <li>The crucial thing to remember when using these strips is that your skin has to be freshly washed and dry.</li>
            <li>usually my sensitive skin calms right down within about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I do keep these on hand too because you can&#x27;t beat them for quick and convenient if you have unexpected plans and realize it&#x27;s been entirely too long since you&#x27;ve properly shaped</li>
            <li>This product doesn’t really work, It gives false advertising on the labels and does not work except for on fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Up to now I have been using Sudden Change, but decided to try Hair Off Instant Eyebrow Shapers since the price for the 6 pack was much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>(READ)So the only thing I really need to say is that this does not work at all, I bought this when I was younger</li>
            <li>I actually prefer hard hot wax and an orange stick to apply it for exact shaping when I do my brows at home.</li>
            <li>I have tried several times to give them up and have my brows professionally waxed...</li>
            <li>Totally beats the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li>These are virtually impossible to find in the drug stores anymore, so I was beyond thrilled to find them here!  </li>
            <li>Better than those nasty wax strips you can buy at beauty supply stores, for sure!   </li>
            <li>It was the easiest, most pain-free method I have ever used, and I will never have ugly eyebrows again thanks to these!    </li>
            <li>I have to cut them to fit right but is less painful than hot wax and a lot easier</li>
            <li>A lot of the wax strips you have to cut to the shape you want, harder to clean residue from the wax up, and they usually make me break out.  </li>

            <li> All in all I really like the product!!</li>
            <li> I also like that I rarely feel any stickiness when using this product.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete lie, nothing more than a scotch tape.  </li>
            <li> The clear strips are easy to apply and do a great job with little pain.</li>
            <li> i have a soothing aloe gel that i bought for my brazilians that i just slop right on the itchy bumps and</li>
            <li> so I figured people just weren&#x27;t using them right..</li>
            <li> These are easy, fool-proof and don&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> If you make sure your skin is completely clean and dry they will work.  </li>
            <li> It feels exactly like you&#x27;re putting scotch tape on your face.</li>
            <li> They work great for me a least.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy these at the drug store and big box stores.  </li>
            <li> They really work!  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to pull in the opposite direction of the hair growth.</li>
            <li> They never know exactly where to start.  </li>
            <li> These are the only thing I use, I just love them and Walmart quit carrying them.  </li>
            <li> They work for me but there are some steps you have to really be aware of.</li>
            <li> I am pretty savvy in the beauty world</li>
            <li> All in all this product is good to remove the hair maybe for a few stray hairs in between going to the salon if you dont want to tweeze, but it is definately not your go to product.</li>
            <li> Can take a couple or three strips to really do the job, but very fast</li>
            <li> This product irritates my skin less than hot wax at the salon or the tweezer sessions, but it is just as effective.    </li>
            <li> They are shaped so they are pretty much foolproof.  </li>
            <li> I can do my own brows in less than 5 minutes for about 75 cents.</li>
            <li> By the way, these  little strips work great for removing hair on my upper lip too!</li>
            <li> You only have the curve that&#x27;s available</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I do not have much time to run out and get them done at a salon.  </li>
            <li> They save me so much time and hassle.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t do absolutely anything for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> They work really well</li>
            <li> If your skin is the least bit oily, I&#x27;d suggest a good cleansing with soap and water, then use an astringent on your skin.</li>
            <li> and I do not have to use as many to get my brows trimmed and cleaned up as I did with the other brand.</li>
            <li> That particular store no longer carried it</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money, this is nothing more than shaped scotch tape.</li>
            <li> I then press it down firmly all along the strip and then pull against the direction of my hair growth and it quickly removes the unwanted hairs and gives me a nice shape.  </li>
            <li> I have used several different eye brow waxing strips before and so far this is the quickest and easiest way to clean up my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> These strips wisk off every single bit of hair that I want removed quickly and with no pain or bumps.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and these strips ripped off a piece of skin about the size of a pencil eraser!</li>
            <li> Apply pressure immediately after and it doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few moments of redness after using these, but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you wash the area to be waxed as oils and makeup on face make it hard for the strips to stick to the hair.</li>
            <li> Neither time did any of the strips stick enough to remove much if any hair, resulting in my wife having to use tweezers to complete the job.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Just 2 days ago I had my brows waxed professionally</li>
            <li> I also still have bumps and redness from the professional job and none of that with these strips.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at the dollar store near my home, but they stopped carrying it, so I ordered it online.</li>
            <li> I bought a whole case to last me the year.</li>
            <li> I have TR&amp;eacute;S sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some not-so-great reviews, but personally, I LOVE these, and highly recommend at least trying them out!</li>
            <li> I cut the long strips in half, as I find working with a shorter piece more convenient.</li>
            <li> I start with clean skin by using a toner to clean off my skin so my pores aren&#x27;t wide open and subject to inflammation.</li>
            <li> I rub firmly about 10 times in the direction of the hair to warm the wax on the strip and get it down to the skin.</li>
            <li> The crucial thing to remember when using these strips is that your skin has to be freshly washed and dry.</li>
            <li> usually my sensitive skin calms right down within about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I do keep these on hand too because you can&#x27;t beat them for quick and convenient if you have unexpected plans and realize it&#x27;s been entirely too long since you&#x27;ve properly shaped</li>
            <li> This product doesn’t really work, It gives false advertising on the labels and does not work except for on fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Up to now I have been using Sudden Change, but decided to try Hair Off Instant Eyebrow Shapers since the price for the 6 pack was much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> (READ)So the only thing I really need to say is that this does not work at all, I bought this when I was younger</li>
            <li> I actually prefer hard hot wax and an orange stick to apply it for exact shaping when I do my brows at home.</li>
            <li> I have tried several times to give them up and have my brows professionally waxed...</li>
            <li> Totally beats the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li> These are virtually impossible to find in the drug stores anymore, so I was beyond thrilled to find them here!  </li>
            <li> Better than those nasty wax strips you can buy at beauty supply stores, for sure!   </li>
            <li> It was the easiest, most pain-free method I have ever used, and I will never have ugly eyebrows again thanks to these!    </li>
            <li> I have to cut them to fit right but is less painful than hot wax and a lot easier</li>
            <li> A lot of the wax strips you have to cut to the shape you want, harder to clean residue from the wax up, and they usually make me break out.  </li>
            <li> Apply the strips rubbing down firmly in the same direction as the hair growth, then pull up quickly against the hair growth.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and a whole lot less expensive than the salon.</li>
            <li> You have to clean the area around your eyebrows before use or your natural oils will render them useless.  </li>
            <li> Typically, because I have sensitive skin, my eyebrows would remain red and itchy/painful for a couple of days.    </li>
            <li> I bought this for the hair on my chin &amp; eyebrows, I was hopeing it would last longer or as long as tweezing.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think the results last quite as long as a salon though.</li>
            <li> i have to say these are pretty painless, and they are great for upkeep between expensive and painful salon visits.</li>
            <li> After 3 tries, it finally removed one eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> These will do the job completely as long as you do so.  </li>
            <li> I never used to do my brows because it takes so long</li>
            <li> I have thick eyebrows that can be very unruly..</li>
            <li> The last time I tried it, it actually stung a little bit, so it seemed it should have worked.</li>
            <li> I have very dark, coarse, stubborn hair that is difficult to remove, but I find this product incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li> That being said, you have to wash your face, freeing it of oil, and dry it thoroughly before using these.  </li>
            <li> Mine are so weird it takes a few, but it sure beats the horrid looks at the beauty shop.  </li>
            <li> let them dry and let the pain begin..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always left with little red, itchy, irritating bumps(not much to look at either!), even when the spa uses their after-tonic.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other products and spent a lot of money for nothing.  </li>
            <li> For the upper lip I use the wider strips, cut in half.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it usually takes several strips for one eyebrow</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product as it does not live up to its hype!</li>
            <li> Not much irritation either</li>
            <li> had to use almost entire package to remove a few hairs.</li>
            <li> to say I adore this product and have never had an issue with them not working though one must know how to use them and a couple of tries will be needed if you&#x27;ve never used them to acquire your desired shape.</li>
            <li> I have found these to work extremely well.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and they don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if they sat in the warehouse too long</li>
            <li> the least little thing will cause me to turn red, break out, etc.</li>
            <li> I will say that sometimes stragglers get left behind, but I&#x27;d rather pluck one hair than EVERY SINGLE HAIR by hand!</li>
            <li> This way I do half an eyebrow at a time, and it&#x27;s easier to match your eyebrow shape.</li>
            <li> this is a fool proof product for those of us who hate to spend money and time getting our eyebrows waxed, just place on eyebrow and pull quickly easy, convenient can do on your schedule in the convenience of your home.</li>
            <li> It even comes with little ones for the stray hairs.</li>
            <li> and I still have to do a little tweezing afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I definitely wasted my money.</li>
            <li> another waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I have tried it all - the roll on wax with strips, the wax you smear on and peel off, the wax you smear on and pull off with strips, the strips with wax already on them, and just plain ole plucking.    </li>
            <li> and i let them get pretty bad before i gave these a go, and</li>
            <li> The pre shapes do not fit the natural curve of my eyebrows so putting the lower strip on is awkward and a waste of time.</li>
            <li> They were all too messy and too hard to use.</li>
            <li> I use mostly to get hairs growing between brows (that awful unibrow effect).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money if your hair is thick.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money buying this!</li>
            <li> do work well for me at least.</li>
            <li> My wife used it three times, but all with negative results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;oh, and you know those itchy bumps you get after you go to a salon and get those suckers waxed?</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair</li>
            <li> not half as bad though.</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly, however it is terrible.  </li>
            <li> like I do with other brand cold wax strips.</li>
            <li> Only can use it on the chin, not the eyebrows:(</li>
            <li> LEFT:(</li>
            <li> i have very thick eyebrows</li>
            <li> your brows.&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the strips can be lined up or angled as needed to approximate the shape you want your brows in.</li>
            <li> they do work for not being that expensive.</li>
            <li> The strips are not at a correct arch for my eyebrows and it was difficult to cut them to the correct shape..</li>
            <li> I was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t find these in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> , she has very thin wispy eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> bad news every time.  </li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> This product is worthless.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awful product!</li>
            <li> but this is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The local retailer where I used to buy them no longer handles them.  So glad to find them. I have used them for years.  They are easy and convenient to use and work very well. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> this is a fool proof product for those of us who hate to spend money and time getting our eyebrows waxed, just place on eyebrow and pull quickly easy, convenient can do on your schedule in the convenience of your home. I wish I would have found this product sooner</li>
            <li> These are virtually impossible to find in the drug stores anymore, so I was beyond thrilled to find them here!  I have tried several times to give them up and have my brows professionally waxed...bad news every time.  I&#x27;m always left with little red, itchy, irritating bumps(not much to look at either!), even when the spa uses their after-tonic.  These are easy, fool-proof and don&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve read some not-so-great reviews, but personally, I LOVE these, and highly recommend at least trying them out!</li>
            <li> These work great for me.  I am allergic to the wax at the hairdresser, so it&#x27;s nice to have a product that I can use at home.</li>
            <li> If you know how to use them, they work great.  Not much irritation either</li>
            <li> Absolutely awful product! nothing but shaped tape and did not remove hair. had to use almost entire package to remove a few hairs. the ones for the bottom of the eyebrow are not shaped properly for under the eyebrow. Left me extremely red and irritated. do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have found these to work extremely well. I am happy to have found them here as I can no longer find them in the stores. Just 2 days ago I had my brows waxed professionally and they didn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job as I have done myself with these strips. I also still have bumps and redness from the professional job and none of that with these strips. These strips wisk off every single bit of hair that I want removed quickly and with no pain or bumps. Inexpensive beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safe to say I adore this product and have never had an issue with them not working though one must know how to use them and a couple of tries will be needed if you&#x27;ve never used them to acquire your desired shape. Then, it&#x27;s off and running to beautiful brows effortlessly, pain free, bumpless and bat those eyes!</li>
            <li> These strips are amazing! So quick and easy... and cheap.  If you make sure your skin is completely clean and dry they will work.  Love them!</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly, however it is terrible.  It didn&#x27;t take the hair off, but it did take skin off!  Can&#x27;t recommend anyone buy this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product and was very glad to find it on Amazon.  My local Wal-Mart quit handling it.  Will definitely order again</li>
            <li> I definitely wasted my money. These do not work. It feels exactly like you&#x27;re putting scotch tape on your face. Sometimes it will rip out 2 or 3 hairs, sometimes it will rip nothing. Every time it will rip off your top layer of skin. The pre shapes do not fit the natural curve of my eyebrows so putting the lower strip on is awkward and a waste of time. I do not recommend this product. I have switched to using the blue Bliss microwaveable wax (which is messy but actually works very well) and tweezing.</li>
            <li> I love these. These are the best hair solution I&#x27;ve EVER used and I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li> I buy these every time I go to Walmart, now that I see I can get them on here for a 6 pack. I&#x27;m def going to start getting them here. They work great for me a least. No bumps or any of that, just a tad red and then it goes away. Nothing like when I had it done at the Salon. I myself would recommend them. But to each their own. :)</li>
            <li> A very quick and not-too-painful way to get rid of stray eyebrow hair.  I use mostly to get hairs growing between brows (that awful unibrow effect).  Can take a couple or three strips to really do the job, but very fast and they pack a lot of strips in each box.</li>
            <li> Occasionally find these at Wal-Mart but can&#x27;t count on that. Me, my boss and everyone in the office love these so much we keep em in our desk drawers and do each others brows. Better than those nasty wax strips you can buy at beauty supply stores, for sure!   Please keep making them!</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money, this is nothing more than shaped scotch tape. These do not work.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer hard hot wax and an orange stick to apply it for exact shaping when I do my brows at home. But I do keep these on hand too because you can&#x27;t beat them for quick and convenient if you have unexpected plans and realize it&#x27;s been entirely too long since you&#x27;ve properly shaped your brows.&lt;br /&gt;The shape of the strips can be lined up or angled as needed to approximate the shape you want your brows in. You only have the curve that&#x27;s available so working out how you want to use them might take a bit of getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;They do work well for me at least. Not at all like using tape. I start with clean skin by using a toner to clean off my skin so my pores aren&#x27;t wide open and subject to inflammation. Then warm the strips in my hands by rubbing them between my palms until warm. Apply the strips rubbing down firmly in the same direction as the hair growth, then pull up quickly against the hair growth. Apply pressure immediately after and it doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few moments of redness after using these, but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used these for about a year and have put them in my shopping cart here because I can&#x27;t find them in my local store anymore. I can do my own brows in less than 5 minutes for about 75 cents. I love it because it&#x27;s not 30 minutes with the tweezers, I don&#x27;t have to clean up sticky spills from the wax kit, and it fits easily into my makeup kit for travel. I don&#x27;t have to make an appointment or spend $10-30 for a brow wax at the salon that may or may not turn out well and may or may not be under perfectly sanitary conditions. This product irritates my skin less than hot wax at the salon or the tweezer sessions, but it is just as effective.    I have very dark, coarse, stubborn hair that is difficult to remove, but I find this product incredibly easy to use. Those who are complaining or calling it \\&quot;scotch tape\\&quot; simply aren&#x27;t following the directions. You have to start with perfectly clean skin. You cannot be wearing makeup or moisturizer. Oily skin like mine will probably need a toner. I press one of the strips over the portion of brow I wish removed. I rub firmly about 10 times in the direction of the hair to warm the wax on the strip and get it down to the skin. I then pull the skin taut and remove the strip quickly against the direction of the hair.     Each strip can only be used once. For me, the upper brow shapers work perfectly; the lower brow shapers need a bit of tweaking for the shape I prefer. All in all, it&#x27;s a great product and works as promised.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and these strips ripped off a piece of skin about the size of a pencil eraser! There&#x27;s nice scab there for almost a week now...not happy!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the hair on my chin &amp; eyebrows, I was hopeing it would last longer or as long as tweezing. It didn&#x27;t take off ANY hair. If you have thick hair IT WILL NOT WORK. I bought 4 or 5 box&#x27;s as the rewiews seemed ok. I gave them to  my daughter-in-law, she has very thin wispy eyebrow hair. It worked for her. But this did not take off ONE piece of my hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money if your hair is thick. I ended up buying Nair for the face &amp; it works great!!  Only can use it on the chin, not the eyebrows:(</li>
            <li> I guess these are meant for a specific type of eyebrows. They did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> yet again no option for NO STARS!!!! another waste of money. these irritate the skin before they actually pull out any hair.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all. It is a waste of money and time. It is like using scotch tape on your eyebrows. Worthless.</li>
            <li> This item does not do what it states! My wife used it three times, but all with negative results. Neither time did any of the strips stick enough to remove much if any hair, resulting in my wife having to use tweezers to complete the job. Don&#x27;t buy this product as it does not live up to its hype!</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy these at the drug store and big box stores.  If you can&#x27;t make it to the salon, these are AWESOME.  They are so easy to use too.  I have teenage girls and they are always asking me to tweeze.  When I found these, they were great.  When I couldn&#x27;t find them anymore I was so upset and then found them here so I stocked up.  They are shaped so they are pretty much foolproof.  I have tried other brands and they don&#x27;t work.  These do!</li>
            <li> Love love love this! Nothing else compares. The shapers take all of it off the first time and shape your eyebrow perfectly! It even comes with little ones for the stray hairs.</li>
            <li> After 3 tries, it finally removed one eyebrow hair. I looked at the instructions to see if I was missing something, but there wasn&#x27;t much to miss - press on and pull off. The last time I tried it, it actually stung a little bit, so it seemed it should have worked. This product is worthless.</li>
            <li> They really work!  Cheap &amp; easy</li>
            <li> I love this product. Up to now I have been using Sudden Change, but decided to try Hair Off Instant Eyebrow Shapers since the price for the 6 pack was much cheaper.  They both do an excellent job. I cut the long strips in half, as I find working with a shorter piece more convenient. This way I do half an eyebrow at a time, and it&#x27;s easier to match your eyebrow shape. The crucial thing to remember when using these strips is that your skin has to be freshly washed and dry. Do not use a moisturizing face wash or a moisturizing soap as any lotion/grease residue from these products will prevent the strips from sticking to your hair. I use regular soap to wash my face and moisturize after I am done removing all the hair. By the way, these  little strips work great for removing hair on my upper lip too! For the upper lip I use the wider strips, cut in half. Just make sure to pull in the opposite direction of the hair growth.</li>
            <li> Works great on my coarse eyebrows and helps shape them. Easy to use. I used to buy this at the dollar store near my home, but they stopped carrying it, so I ordered it online. Delivery was fast. I also like that I rarely feel any stickiness when using this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these strips!  I use to buy them at my local store.  But they stopped carrying them.  I do not have much time to run out and get them done at a salon.  So these strips do a great job for me.</li>
            <li> these things are amazing! I have to cut them to fit right but is less painful than hot wax and a lot easier</li>
            <li> I have tried it all - the roll on wax with strips, the wax you smear on and peel off, the wax you smear on and pull off with strips, the strips with wax already on them, and just plain ole plucking.    While I mastered the smear-it-on-pull-it-off-with-a-strip method, I always found I was out of strips, with a lot of wax left.  Plus, it was troublesome to keep the wax at the correct temperature.    Finally, I tried these, and for the very first time, in all my plucking/waxing history, I had perfectly shaped, beautiful eyebrows WITH NO REDNESS OR PAIN!!  (This includes dozens of trips to the spa where pain and redness occurred).  There were only a couple of minutes of redness and tingling, and then it completely went away, and my eyebrows are perfect.  Typically, because I have sensitive skin, my eyebrows would remain red and itchy/painful for a couple of days.    I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this product, and I hope everyone else loves it as much as I do so that it will stick around.  It was the easiest, most pain-free method I have ever used, and I will never have ugly eyebrows again thanks to these!    -----    Update on 3/16/2010:    I am still using these strips and have never been happier with an at-home eyebrow waxing product.  I have to contest those who compare this to \\&quot;scotch tape\\&quot;.  That being said, you have to wash your face, freeing it of oil, and dry it thoroughly before using these.  These will do the job completely as long as you do so.  Great product.  Still very happy!</li>
            <li> This product doesn’t really work, It gives false advertising on the labels and does not work except for on fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these things!! They save me so much time and hassle.  Totally beats the old fashioned way.  I will say that sometimes stragglers get left behind, but I&#x27;d rather pluck one hair than EVERY SINGLE HAIR by hand!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, works great. I have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete lie, nothing more than a scotch tape.  Dont waste your money buying this! You&#x27;ll regret it like i do now!</li>
            <li> I love these.  You do have to read the instructions to get them to work well.  You have to clean the area around your eyebrows before use or your natural oils will render them useless.  I use a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol to clean off the oils around and on my eyebrows before I begin.  Then I take off a strip and place it where I want it.  I then press it down firmly all along the strip and then pull against the direction of my hair growth and it quickly removes the unwanted hairs and gives me a nice shape.  It eliminates plucking for me.  I bought a whole case to last me the year.</li>
            <li> I would not buy instant eyebrow shaper from Amazon because you can buy it at Fred&#x27;s (18 sets of pre-cut shapers) for  around $4.00.</li>
            <li> I got this product because my daughter in law and her daughters told me they were great I used it and kept trying to use it but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me so I gave them all to the girls</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product for anyone with really problem brows.  Mine are so weird it takes a few, but it sure beats the horrid looks at the beauty shop.  They never know exactly where to start.  Perfect solution, a perfect wax at home.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this item for years at The Family Dollar. I have great results with it and was upset that The Family Dollar stopped carrying it about a year ago. I have been looking all over for it and was pleased to find it on Amazon! The clear strips are easy to apply and do a great job with little pain. Make sure that you wash the area to be waxed as oils and makeup on face make it hard for the strips to stick to the hair.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product on a regular basis at a store in our area.  That particular store no longer carried it so I searched all the stores around and could not find one that had it.  So glad I found it here!  I have tried numerous other products and spent a lot of money for nothing.  They were all too messy and too hard to use. I never found another product as easy to use as this one is.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> (READ)So the only thing I really need to say is that this does not work at all, I bought this when I was younger and I didn&#x27;t do absolutely anything for my eyebrows. If you want to be fooled be my guest but this is horrible.</li>
            <li> My daughter got me started years ago on eyebrow shapers and when she no longer could get them for me I was very disappointed. I found these on Amazon and decided to try them. They are better than what my daughter used to get me and they work really well and I do not have to use as many to get my brows trimmed and cleaned up as I did with the other brand. They are easy to use and a whole lot less expensive than the salon. Great for travel too when you cannot get to a salon and also for touching up in between waxings.</li>
            <li> they do work for not being that expensive. yes, the shaping takes a bit of skill, but it&#x27;s nothing that can&#x27;t be mastered! when you read reviews about only being able to use one strip once, they aren&#x27;t kidding! the glue only seems to stick just once. i have to say these are pretty painless, and they are great for upkeep between expensive and painful salon visits. i don&#x27;t think the results last quite as long as a salon though. i have very thick eyebrows and i let them get pretty bad before i gave these a go, and like i said, they did their job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh, and you know those itchy bumps you get after you go to a salon and get those suckers waxed? i got the same bumps from these! not half as bad though. i have a soothing aloe gel that i bought for my brazilians that i just slop right on the itchy bumps and usually my sensitive skin calms right down within about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do recommend these if you have the time to get your brows just right :)</li>
            <li> I never used to do my brows because it takes so long and I don&#x27;t do a good job.  These are the only thing I use, I just love them and Walmart quit carrying them.  I hope they continue to make them.</li>
            <li> Thought they would work better than they did, maybe I am not doing it right, but not a bad product, would be nice for teen or tweens who are just learning how to shape eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have used several different eye brow waxing strips before and so far this is the quickest and easiest way to clean up my eyebrows! A lot of the wax strips you have to cut to the shape you want, harder to clean residue from the wax up, and they usually make me break out.  The Hair off eyebrow shapers are pre cut and no waxy residue.  The only drawback is that it usually takes several strips for one eyebrow and I still have to do a little tweezing afterwards.  All in all I really like the product!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Anyone can use this item to dyi and save money and time going to the salon! I&#x27;ve been using this for years and will continue to use it!!</li>
            <li> Use these all the time!  They do an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your skin in freshly cleaned for best results.</li>
            <li> I order this product so that I can have perfect eyebrows. I made sure the skin was clean and free of oil and placed the strip where it belongs. I am not sure if they sat in the warehouse too long but it didn&#x27;t grip the hairs and it didn&#x27;t remove anything. I eventually gave up and went to a salon to have my eyebrows done.</li>
            <li> These eyebrow waxers are easy to use and are a perfect solution for shaping your eyebrows just as you want.  Very easy and painless to use.</li>
            <li> Could not find these in the store anymore. They are terrific! Best product for easy eyebrow hair removal. I&#x27;ve been a fan of Hair Off for years. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was impressively quick.</li>
            <li> Love these strips.  They are easy to use and work well.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these at Walmart and simply could not find them in any of the Supercenters around our area. I have TR&amp;eacute;S sensitive skin and the least little thing will cause me to turn red, break out, etc. but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with these strips. They work for me but there are some steps you have to really be aware of. If your skin is the least bit oily, I&#x27;d suggest a good cleansing with soap and water, then use an astringent on your skin. Oily skin will produce a less-than-desired  result. I found this out through trial and error. Great product for me. Hope everyone else has good results like I did.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to use this product.. I am pretty savvy in the beauty world so I figured people just weren&#x27;t using them right.. HOWEVER..I have thick eyebrows that can be very unruly.. hence why I bought this product. I cleaned my eyebrows with dove soap.. and applied alcohol.. let them dry and let the pain begin.. The strips are not at a correct arch for my eyebrows and it was difficult to cut them to the correct shape.. The hair came off just fine.. but so did my skin:( I have a huge patch of irritated skin that is peeling under my eye.. others can&#x27;t notice but I do. All in all this product is good to remove the hair maybe for a few stray hairs in between going to the salon if you dont want to tweeze, but it is definately not your go to product. AND I HAVE 5 BOXES LEFT:(</li>
            <li> I was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t find these in stores anymore. They work really well and I don&#x27;t get a rash from them like I do with other brand cold wax strips. They are very easy to use. My daughter and I love these, so glad I found them again!</li>
            <li> the adhesive strips aren&#x27;t very sticky so they weren&#x27;t effective.  A waste of money really.</li>
