            <li>Great Product - Thank you John Frieda -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>br /&gt;before shampooing, and I did that, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>I discovered it on Amazon again, at a great price, and just tried it again this week.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great for that.</li>
            <li>This works great to refresh your color.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product!  </li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I have some gray and it makes my hair look real healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to keep your hair color looking bright, takes away that brassiness you sometimes get.  </li>
            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>I think maybe it&#x27;s best to concentrate this stuff on the length of your hair and make sure you don&#x27;t massage it into your scalp or roots of your hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and the color comes off your hands once you move on to washing up after application.</li>
            <li>And, for being so easy to use, just blob it on in the shower with no mirror, it came out perfect.</li>
            <li>Glaze is perfect alone or compliment to the precision hair color, easy to do alone and 100% gray coverage and gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>I wound up with really bright hair.  </li>
            <li>it adds a bright shine with some color.  </li>
            <li>Good service.</li>
            <li>Good product, makes hair shiny, and reduces brassiness of grays.  </li>

            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I put a conditioner on my hair, work it in really good.  </li>

            <li>I ended up using quite a bit of product (about 2 good squeezes, maybe 1/12 of the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for shine</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the John Frieda brilliant brunette product line and use the shampoo, conditioner and the glaze.</li>

            <li>I love this product please don&#x27;t ever take it away!  </li>

            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this John Frieda color glaze!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>In between colorings, this keeps the color and shine for just awhile more!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>You may love it too!</li>
            <li>Love stuff!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Like I said, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to use and adds great</li>
            <li>This is just an all around amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product is so amazing I&#x27;ve stopped the salon treatments all together.</li>
            <li>I wish I knew about this amazing product years ago.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and does a wonderful job on my hair.</li>
            <li>but it did leave a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Every body always ask me about my hair color and how nice it looks.  </li>
            <li>Gives hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li>It is not a hair color, however it gives a nice tint.</li>
            <li>I have my own way of doing it.</li>
            <li>Finally, it kind of reeks.</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry because it washes off nicely, you may need to scrub a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It adds color, so if you don&#x27;t feel like dying your hair but want a change, this is nice.</li>
            <li>and I found it be somewhat effective in masking my greys, but not quite what I wanted, so I decided to experiment.</li>
            <li>instantly&lt;br /&gt;- smells nice</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know the difference.  </li>
            <li>GOOD  makes my hair look better  and covers gray hair</li>
            <li>Always makes hair look nice and shiney</li>
            <li>and then kind of massage it into the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>But it is nice</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is just great inbetween coloring my hair to keep it looking fresh and&lt;br /&gt;fast to do while in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It does leave a nice color and shine, but be sure to condition hair</li>
            <li>and my husband says my hair smells nice:)</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>have very light brown hair that is greying.  </li>
            <li>I do not highlight or dye my hair, but I do use this product and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>so glad that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>I love this glaze.</li>
            <li>I just love John Frieda products.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love using this product to make my hair a bit darker and to ensure that my sun-lights don&#x27;t appear too brassy.  </li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love tis stuff &amp; have purchased it for many years.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look healthy either.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>but I suspect with more use (every week)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.....</li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>My hair is so healthy looking and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I get non stop compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>but I mostly focus on the top of my head.</li>
            <li>This glaze covers my gray and leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered more of it and also ordered the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I can see where I need to put it most.</li>
            <li>I LOVE John Frieda products and this is not the exception!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She used the glaze for blonds and looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in the stores around me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can get this on Amazon, since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>3+ minutes will have gone by for sure.     </li>
            <li>Normally I love John Frieda</li>
            <li>I will not buy any more glaze products from this company.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better it works with time.  </li>
            <li>It worked for about a week, but rinsed out to more brassiness.  </li>
            <li>my hair color started looking more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It had gone up to $60 or more a bottle on ebay.</li>
            <li>Thank you to whomever brought this wonderful product back.</li>

            <li>Enjoying the Joyhn Frieda beauty product.  </li>
            <li>I never knew these things existed and am so glad to be able to find Frieda products at this site.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Added a nice shine, but did not do much color wise for my greys.</li>
            <li>am certainly glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li>The more you use it, the more shine it adds.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using this glaze does give me more body</li>
            <li>Some products I have used do my hair oily or even more</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
            <li>I just use this after most times I wash my hair per week.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>The price was better on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on the color and shine.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff....</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I love the feel of my hair after I use it</li>
            <li>And be sure to scrub, scrub, scrub your hands with some soap while you&#x27;re waiting for the product to do its thing in your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this color glaze for a couple months and have been quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I will use again tomorrow and see more of the results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to go back to the salon before I need a cut and this product is a WONDERFUL solution and ever so easy.</li>
            <li>and it covers all my grey roots perfectly.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty good for hair</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been available where I live for years, so I am delighted to find on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>Although the color says brunette, with my brown and gray hair the color comes out to be more redish in the sunlight but brown in the indoor light which is interesting.  </li>
            <li>Product is very economical and a nice treat for a quick in-home salon look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but you better have some conditioner handy: it really dries your hair.</li>
            <li>I have blondish-brown hair that is easily streaked by the sun.  </li>
            <li>I know that the product coats the hair, but I believe that it does protect your hair from damage and easily washes out with a clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, takes 3 minutes in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Made it easy to work into the hair.</li>
            <li>This was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>After applying it to your hair, use soap, rubbing your hands together and it easily comes off.</li>
            <li>After applying it to your hair, use soap, rubbing your hands together and it easily comes off.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use in the shower after shampooing and conditioning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>easy to use (3-5 minutes in the shower)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product - I have used this for years and it helps the color last longer and look more lustrous.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, also.</li>
            <li>Nice color and left a good feel to hair.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily and makes fine hair easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Brilliant Brunette Luminous Color Glaze by John Freida is very simple to use, fast and effective.</li>
            <li>I then rinse this stuff out of my hair and apply the John Frieda brilliant brunette to my hair focusing on the lighter spots or any grey areas.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair great color and gloss and even creates nice highlights so the color looks so real and natural.</li>
            <li>It will stain your hands if you don&#x27;t wash them with soap immediately after, but soap works fine and if you have any drips a q tip dipped in rubbing alcohol will take care of it.  </li>
            <li>It does make my hair softer, but I have fine hair as it is</li>
            <li>this product does make your hair super shiny, soft and it just feels great.</li>
            <li>This was a great temporary fix for me, though I doubt I&#x27;ll keep the product around to use long-term as I simply don&#x27;t have the patience to use it during my morning shower as recommended.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need the color refresher but the glaze makes my hair feel so nice</li>
            <li>And after use my hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thinking, AS I SAID, and should have bought the &amp;#34;CLEAR GLAZE&amp;#34;, John Frieda had available.</li>
            <li>I recommended that a friend with light brown hair try it.</li>
            <li>I use this once or twice a week, and it blends my gray hair into a light brown, so it looks like I have highlights.</li>
            <li>The color is varied, so the brown colors are shiny and the grays are platinum-ish and light.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>It looked a bit shinier and was really smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I use it two to three times a week in the shower, and my hair always appears to be a light shade of brown with lots of natural-looking variations of tone.</li>
            <li>It stains and honestly my hair is much shiner without it.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The product does stain your skin so it is important to wash the face and hands after you&#x27;ve applied it to the hair.  </li>
            <li>this is  a great product...can only get on line....</li>
            <li>(This stuff would make a great instant tan if you&#x27;re going for a too-long-in-the-booth look.)</li>
            <li>covers grey hairs, and beautiful shine....................</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wash your hands right away after applying.</li>
            <li>I used an old applicator from when I used to color my hair to apply this Brilliant Brunette mainly to roots.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly allergic to most hair color and have experimented with so many over the years until I found one that I can tolerate without my head itching and getting sores on my head and neck.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, so I don&#x27;t know if someone with a different hair texture would get the same excellent results.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and vibrant and amazing every day.</li>
            <li>Smells good, hair feels smooth and tints my gray to a soft golden brown that blends well.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased this glaze to help keep the rich brown color I wanted from that dye.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair more shining and straight!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It keeps your hair color looking fresh &amp; also adds shine!</li>
            <li>I just use it in the shower - shampoo, condition, rinse, squeeze excess water out, put a dollop of glaze on my palm and then rub into the crown of my head first (mostly around where I part my hair)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30% grey and this is great in between colorings.</li>
            <li>I use brilliant brunette which is much darker than it actually comes out on my hair.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff every time I clean my hair</li>
            <li>The color is deep and rich mahogany brown and the shine is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I like to add a special shine to my hair with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it when I go on dates with my boyfriend or special occasions.  </li>
            <li>and this would give my hair a light golden brown tone on the ends since that&#x27;s where i would i apply it to.</li>
            <li>It prolongs the greying process and leaves hair nice n soft</li>
            <li>Glosser Cool</li>
            <li>Love this so much</li>
            <li>It was a nice, natural color as well.</li>
            <li>In fact I have brown hair with a good deal of red in it</li>
            <li>I used this product several years ago and loved it but could no longer find it in the store.  </li>
            <li>you take good care of your hair, and you have a deep brunette color like me, this isn&#x27;t going to create miracles.  </li>
            <li>Good price for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Split ends disappear, my hair is bouncy and full but sleek, shiny and SUPER</li>
            <li>So I was hoping this would help w/ the quick fading of the John Frieda FoAm dye.</li>
            <li>After a quick wash and condition I apply the glaze, pin up my hair and finish my shower, rinsing my hair thoroughly before leaving the shower.</li>
            <li>It made my hair darker quickly.</li>
            <li>but after I rinse product out, I do a quick re-wash of face and neck</li>
            <li>I do not have many grays, but the ones I do have appear more covered -  this glaze is not a hair dye but does a tiny bit of sneaky coverings...</li>
            <li>Very pretty color on the hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and am very pleased with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the shower, after the shampoo, and while the conditioner is doing it&#x27;s job, apply a generous amount to the needed areas (hairline mostly), &amp; let it do its job for 3-5 minutes then just rinse as normal.</li>
            <li>You can tell it&#x27;s from dye, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant or overpowering and it goes away after one wash.    </li>
            <li>had numerous complements on &amp;#34;my hair color&amp;#34; after using... so it gives a tinted appearance a tiny bit but, honestly think its more of a healthy shine, giving a multi-dimensional / highlighted look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used Dark Chocolate Brown which is a gorgeous rich color, but I noticed it faded so quick.</li>
            <li>but then everyone would have pretty hair like mine!</li>
            <li>A REASONABLE PRICE AGAIN!!</li>
            <li>At first I was elated !  </li>
            <li>The problem that I have, and the reason I probably won&#x27;t continue with this product, is that it makes my fine hair appear very oily and unwashed.</li>
            <li>John Frieda Liquid color glaze does a great job in covering my few gray hairs.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of gray hair just a few around my hairline in the front and this works great to cover them up.</li>
            <li>I now have shiny healthy soft hair with amazing blonde highlights.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all that effective as conditioner, so I mix it with my regular conditioner, too.</li>
            <li>a dye it works with the gray to make highlights which creates multidimensional color, much more natural looking then</li>
            <li>but it was worth a shot to find something to keep my grays covered.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t shiny and it didn&#x27;t look good on a young - relatively young, girl.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>With these downsides, it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>is more manageable, Glaze is soft but like glass, Just a hint of color to hide roots</li>
            <li>It looks much more natural than a dye because there&#x27;s no outgrowth line.</li>
            <li>It does have a distinct scent - but not offensive.</li>
            <li>I tried to use semi permanent hair color to cover the gray without changing my natural color but it lightened the top layers of my hair and made it a reddish tone.  </li>
            <li>I rarely have to dye my hair anymore.</li>
            <li>fun for me, since I do all the laundry.</li>
            <li>Great product for slightly graying brunette hair.... diminishes the gray without having to color my hair!</li>
            <li>I use this product in the shower 2 -3 times per week and it definitely gives me a consistently more golden, rich brown color.</li>
            <li>(mild coconut-ish?)&lt;br /&gt;- gives roots some lift&lt;br /&gt;- not terribly expensive</li>
            <li>I use this product between colorings to keep the color rich looking and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>You do have to wash your hands right away or they will be stained, but that is all.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the idea, right?</li>
            <li>And some days if it doesn&#x27;t get rinsed just right</li>
            <li>I love the warm tones it gives my hair and no more &#x27;roots&#x27; to deal with.  </li>
            <li>After 3 min or so of being in my hair, it pretty much rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I have more brown than gray right now and am hoping I can make the transition to gray by only using this product and not ever having to use a permanent hair coloring.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and does seem to work for making your color last a little longer, but it stained my hands and face so easily.  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel good, and also makes your hair a little softer.</li>
            <li>so I find myself having to use styling product to get a bit more lift if I&#x27;m not going for the super shiny, straight, flat look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results, my main concern was the growth of grey hairs between color appointments and this is making the trick!</li>
            <li>It must have the same ingredients that is used in most hair colors.  </li>
            <li>This product did exactly that.</li>
            <li>I started off using it every day for the first week just to get it where I wanted it</li>
            <li>and everybody wanted to know how much I paid for those high-lights!  </li>
            <li>When I bought this, the first time, I wasn&#x27;t quite thinking correctly.</li>
            <li>BACK and really in more ways than just hair color.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>use this product one time per week and its effects lasts for a whole week!</li>
            <li>using this make sure you squeeze out all the water you possibly can.</li>
            <li>I do have color treated hair but this makes my roots a funny orange/brassy tone...plus, you have to use a lot in order for it to cover all of your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this color glaze since it first came out.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot in one bottle so it should last you a couple of months, even if you are using it more than once a week.</li>
            <li>Dye will leave a residue on your hands at first, but as you rinse out your hair it will wash off.</li>
            <li>I also get lots of compliments on shine after I first use this product, and I have to say I noticed it too.</li>
            <li>After the first year my usage then went to once a month.</li>
            <li>Covers my gray with a light brown  color that blends well with my natural medium brown color.  </li>
            <li>I have definitely had better.</li>
            <li>It made my hair seem MORE red and even a bit lighter.</li>
            <li>My friend even commented it looked more red.</li>
            <li>I did not read the instructions when I used it the first time</li>
            <li>So first you wash your scalp with some separate shampoo</li>
            <li>I have been using it about every other day, just love the way it  makes my hair look and feel!</li>
            <li>But it seems to make my hair shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the results and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>I also bought a toner shampoo which I used first.</li>
            <li>Remember it takes a few applications before the color takes good effect and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover my gray, but does blend it a bit, so I&#x27;m not so rushed to color as quick as I normally might.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser complemented my brunette hair the other day and asked if I dyed it since the color was so nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super smooth, lays flat, and doesn&#x27;t want to do anything else.  </li>
            <li>If your hair were lighter or darker than mine I would bet you&#x27;d have to use it more often to get the same results, but since my hair is already borderline I don&#x27;t have to do as much.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best kept secret to color hair with a natural effect.</li>
            <li>and there was glaze all over the top, you know, kind of like on something after you use it a few times, especially a liquid type product.  </li>
            <li>first time I unknowingly used too much and didn&#x27;t use it again for a while.</li>
            <li>looks and feels better than it has in a long while.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use it so pretty much just stopped.  </li>
            <li>My favorite way to tint grey hair just a bit without any roots to worry about.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice and blends my silver hairs so that they look like highlights within my dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dark and slightly warm.</li>
            <li>This gives my brunette hair a nice depth of dark color, makes it shinny, and coats it to make it feel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product mostly to keep the brassiness out of my highlights (soft caramel brown - lowlights really) and  to help blend those whites in a little better</li>
            <li>After my first use, my hair was super soft and managable and very shiny.  </li>
            <li>this products makes my hair a little darker not brassy and I love it!  </li>
            <li>My hair felt dry and had a lot of static after using it.</li>
            <li>It did have a very particular smell, but I didn&#x27;t dislike it.</li>
            <li>Plus it makes my hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>My professional color fades fairly quickly and I get a washed out look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a highlighter, an accenter, an enhancer, not a dramatic color changer.</li>
            <li>Still, I had a gob of the stuff sitting on a large patch of grout that set, so it can stain grout.  </li>
            <li>Now, I apply it on *dry* hair before I shower and leave it on for about 5 minutes (yes, it does stain, so be careful with surfaces in your bathroom, but a Magic Eraser will get it out of most; I wash my hands after applying it and any stubborns stains on my hands and stains elsewhere on my skin come out in the shower with a loofah).</li>
            <li>my brown hair looks very even</li>
            <li>my hair grows really fast and with this can go 5-6 weeks.</li>
            <li>works very well to touch up color between beauty parlor visits.</li>
            <li>After 3-4 weeks of using this product I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it was working.</li>
            <li>It covered some, but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it does much for the color of my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really see much improvement in shine.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>Not too much shine either.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to boost their hair color.</li>
            <li>I feel it is much healthier for my hair than dying it.</li>
            <li>It was, also, relatively cheap enough buying it through AMAZON SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE.</li>
            <li>It smells so much nicer and made me hair a lot silkier.</li>
            <li>I sometimes leave the john frieda on for five minutes or sometimes an hour depending on how much time I have.</li>
            <li>Even use dabs straight on hair to cover gray.</li>
            <li>I have very damaged hair, and after using this I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets really bleached out because I spend quite a bit of time outdoors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use this until I have too much gray hair for this to be a feasible solution.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if I see a color change or really a difference in the look.  </li>
            <li>Is it so much to ask to use a box?</li>
            <li>This works really well for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to dye my hair until I absolutely have.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had totally messed up my color by using a permanent hair color (in light brown) that was supposed to fight brassiness.  </li>
            <li>The real test is my bathroom mirror, which is where my hair looks the brightest.  </li>
            <li>and I just can&#x27;t believe they are the real thing.</li>
            <li>and I just can&#x27;t believe they are the real thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready for a trip to California</li>
            <li>Then squeeze out as much water as you can and apply the gloss.  </li>
            <li>But it was much softer and fluffier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shine really isn&#x27;t that noticeable.  </li>
            <li>your roots show is just a fact of your hair growing out and nothing can really be done besides a permanent color (took me years and years to figure all the hype for products to hide your grow out doesn&#x27;t work besides hair color).  </li>
            <li>Worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Very gray resistant hair may not absorb any color.</li>
            <li>This is an affordable hair product and if you want to make your hair real shiny</li>
            <li>Recommend highly!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works SO much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>My hair IS very porous.</li>
            <li>I have medium to light brown hair and I am starting to get stray grays.  </li>
            <li>I had used it for years but then stopped when it became no longer available to buy locally in stores.</li>
            <li>Maybe they were expecting too much?</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions, it doesn&#x27;t do much for covering grays.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care about it so much...</li>
            <li>I already use the John Frieda foam colour (currently using light ash brown) and found this glaze while looking for another batch of permanent color.</li>
            <li>It adds a bit of shine and much a bit of a color pick me up in between coloring.</li>
            <li>I use this at the roots only and it gives my greys a light brown tint so that they look almost like highlights.</li>
            <li>It took out \\&quot;some\\&quot; of the brassiness but not as much as I wanted.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend it if you are trying to enhance your natural color and have shorter hair so you don&#x27;t have to worry about static and flyaway hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gives me a nice shiny color and covers the few grays I have...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far cheaper than going to the salon, and pretty much foolproof as well!</li>
            <li>Just as a mention I have also tried the clear glaze and it only gets slightly better results.</li>
            <li>I usually have pretty nice hair.  </li>
            <li>hair to blend in the tones to avoid the stark light/dark contrast while adding a nice shine.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair in better condition rather than worse, and I think it&#x27;s helped postpone the day when I have to find a colorist. :)</li>
            <li>, I have also noticed that my hair is smoother, just make sure not to overdone it because it could feel a bit heavy or greasy, I try to apply it fast because your hands will grab the color and then leave it for at least 5 minutes, all in all very nice product</li>
            <li>I have it set in Amazon to ship a new bottle once a month I use it so much!</li>
            <li>apply product with my hands; it does stain but wash off immediately after with soap- and use a soft nail brush and it will come right</li>
            <li>My hair is now back to its original color.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to all types of dyes and rinses and most every other product on the market to color my hair.  </li>
            <li>Other days I think this product adds a lovely shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for &#x27;color&#x27; for several years now and my hair is mostly light brown with lighter high - lights with this product.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and gives me a highlighted look instead of going grey!</li>
            <li>really keeps color vibrant and hair shiny and helps hide those pesky roots to extend time betwen dyeing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it to hide my gray roots as I let them grow out, it certainly makes them MUCH less noticeable for sure.</li>
            <li>Now i know i will not waste my time or gas and order first here.  </li>
            <li>I still open it up and get to the glaze itself and it just seems like it was not that full</li>
            <li>If in the future I want to go completely gray and stop using this, it is not a problem, as what it highlights blends in with the gray just fine.</li>
            <li>If you spend enough time perfecting your technique, it would probably provide a good shine to hair that just needs a little boost.</li>
            <li>And they now sell new at Ulta!</li>
            <li>With wet hands the product easily falls onto the floor, or on you.</li>
            <li>being said, the area where I use the glaze the most is shinier and has less volume</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to find this product several different places to no avail, so was pleased to find this seller and buy at decent price.</li>
            <li>what my natural hair color was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for how to use this:  wet hair thoroughly in the shower, ring it out, apply the glaze mostly to the hairline and where you part your hair.</li>
            <li>However, it seems that the only liquid shine available is clear.  </li>
            <li>I noticed another commenter stated that it made their hair more red, and I had the same issue, as well.</li>
            <li>This product is great to add just a little bit of color to the grays and really brings depth to my dark brown hair color.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I now only use this about once every three months to touch up the new gray to look more blonde.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- lays your wild hairs flat and smooth</li>
            <li>1)The glaze effect keeps my hairline and part soft, smooth, and free of frizz and coarseness that usually occurs as new gray hair is growing in or color is wearing out.  </li>
            <li>I have a little gray hair, mostly in my bangs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, it does have a faint dye smell.</li>
            <li>My natural color is so much lighter.</li>
            <li>It says rinse until water runs clear,i dont care how much i use, it always runs clear.</li>
            <li>While it did leave my hair with the \\&quot;just-dyed\\&quot; smell, it was worth the overall effects.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t normally stain my grout.  </li>
            <li>Every time I&#x27;m complimented on my &amp;#34;stunning&amp;#34; hair color, I offer up that it&#x27;s my normal color</li>
            <li>I am reasonably gray under the pretty honey blonde my hairdresser conjers once every 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money, you&#x27;re better off buying a semi-permanent dye.</li>
            <li>I towel dried my hair then applied mostly to my gray roots which now are an inch or two</li>
            <li>Good but not great.</li>
            <li>I got highlights that were way too blond and was able to dim them down with this.</li>
            <li>Not only are the highlighted strands staying just right, it seems to leave just a touch of gold on my whites and helps with the blending.</li>
            <li>I love this glaze, as it has become hard to find at my local store I got on Amazon and was able to get it here, thx I will be back.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve looked for years for the perfect combo to transform my coarse, thick, frizzy mixed race hair, and this will definitely stay in my arsenal.</li>
            <li>It washes off skin with enough rubbing, but it&#x27;s better to just be careful and not let it set/sit on skin.</li>
            <li>but it weighs my fine hair down.  </li>
            <li>It has also increased the shine in my hair and made it very soft.</li>
            <li>looks very natural, not like a dye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hair is very soft and shiny as well.</li>
            <li>On a daily basis I use ORS replenishing conditioner on my hair first.</li>
            <li>This product, in the dark/espresso version, is just enough of a hit that my hair looks brunette consistently.</li>
            <li>These highlights look so natural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this several times, exactly according to directions, and have yet to see any effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I will agree with the reviewer who says it may leave your hair more oily than usual.</li>
            <li>I could not get past the overwhelming coconut oil smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does stain the hands when applying the product, but it disappears very quickly with a little soap.</li>
            <li>My little grey hairs get highlighted and it ads a really nice color to</li>
            <li>I have dyed brown hair and use this at most once per week, so needless to say due to my own fault</li>
            <li>Just the right touch of color to the grey</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep buying this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>The roots disappeared within a few months of using this, easily.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair a little dry, but whenever i use it everyone tells me how nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not too sure of, is my scalp seems to itch for a couple of days afterwards, so I have cut down the times I use it.</li>
            <li>have fine long (flat - blah) hair -</li>
            <li>With a few uses, the color built up so that my gray hairs are slightly warmer and more golden</li>
            <li>I bought it from Amazon Prime, not even a different buyer, otherwise that would have been a little bit more understandable.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed my hair out I had brown hair with all the red high lights … exactly as I had before I&#x27;d gone white !!!</li>
            <li>This really controls the red tint in my hair that happens after a week of a professional color.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t always take the product clear to the end of my hair.</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like to think about is what these products do to your scalp and how much of it enters your system.</li>
            <li>Yes, this one works very well on covering white hair.</li>
            <li>This product is a gentle formulation that won&#x27;t damage hair and actually improved the feel and appearance of my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft and silky after using this glaze.  </li>
            <li>This makes your hair SO soft and the color looks professional.</li>
            <li>After having all the dyed color cut off with a snazzy cut, I didn&#x27;t like the &#x27;coldness&#x27; of my natural color.  </li>
            <li>all natural</li>
            <li>I was 28 years old when it happened.</li>
            <li>but, still, it was a complete piece of cake.</li>
            <li>I GOT MY OLD &amp;#34;SELF&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t look so old …</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel so old …</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t act so old.</li>
            <li>As a bonus it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>It covers my increasingly gray hair, it leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Have a clip ready to put your hair up because the color will stain your neck and back.</li>
            <li>, make sure you leave it in for at least 3 mins or the color will wash out.</li>
            <li>I have been using the glaze for at least a year and am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>My natural color is medium ash brown.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day (curly hair; frequent washing dries it out), so I apply the glaze on days when I won&#x27;t be washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I am 48 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times, then just colored my hair permanently, since it is too much hassle and overall</li>
            <li>My natural hair color is now predominantly silver.  </li>
            <li>It is a very temporary color glaze that lasts until the next shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to run when it rains and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>and it did not make my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>Even if you aren&#x27;t looking for color enhancement and you just want soft shiny hair</li>
            <li>Adds a couple of weeks between professional coloring.</li>
            <li>Feels like too much of a gamble to use this product on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think the smell of the product is fine, smells like lotion to me , plus it is only on my hair for three minutes every other day</li>
            <li>No mess.  </li>
            <li>This product is for people who prefer subtle healthy looking hair.  </li>
            <li>I had had medium brown hair with red high lights -</li>
            <li>My white hair turns to light brown which can hiding in my black hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is more of a light brown to dirty blonde.</li>
            <li>This keeps my dyed dark brown hair color looking fresh and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the consistency of shampoo, but opaque dark brown with golden sparkles in it.  </li>
            <li>The instructions also say to wash hands after applying, no matter how quick you apply your hands wind up stained a little.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t recommend using it very often as I feel it does dry up your hair.</li>
            <li>I then put Argon oil on the very tips of the end of my hair which helps when I blow dry and curl it.</li>
            <li>and I want my hair glossy and sleek - ready to combat the dry, sun-drenched and salty air.  </li>
            <li>Problem is, dry hair doesn&#x27;t allow product to spread very well.  </li>
            <li>lightly towel dried it, but some still rubbed off on my white towels.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time experimenting with color, as an African American Woman who relaxes her hair, I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t further damage my mousy locks.</li>
            <li>There is no other product on the market that I know of to help keep your color for a longer period of time between colorings.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be the same, but I think the formula has changed because it just did not do anything for me, even after using the entire bottle following the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>You do have to be careful to wash it off your shower/sink right away if some splatters as it will stain like regular hair dye.  </li>
            <li>Will get the clear next time to try.</li>
            <li>Leaving the product on 5-8 minutes darkened my hair almost back to my natural color.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to use this color to help cover my roots while I let my natural color grow back.  </li>
            <li>Jaw literally falling open - they&#x27;d never guessed it wasn&#x27;t natural.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and apply it every AM to areas where my roots show, using an old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Since I was interested in covering grays, I started at my scalp and would then rub and comb the product down to the ends of my shoulder-blade-length hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in order to cheaply hide a few grey hairs that have appeared recently, and it does work for that purpose.</li>
            <li>brightens my dark hair and calms down the grey. : )  </li>
            <li>I naturally have red undertones, and dye my hair with ash colors to counteract the red.</li>
            <li>It made a big difference and really toned down the brassiness and left my hair soft, even though I didn&#x27;t use conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have brown hair with dark blond highlights and was hoping I could use this to help blend the highlights as my hair grows, but it really does nothing.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t love this as much as I&#x27;d hoped from the other reviews.</li>
            <li>Normally this sounds great, considering my American friends are always straightening their hair like crazy to tame it, while mine stays flat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read reviews on weird color results, dryness, etc., but - for me - absolutely none of this has ever been true.</li>
            <li>As it builds the colour and sheen gets richer, but it is not flat like hair dye.</li>
            <li>I have used John Frieda glazes in the past, and they left my hair looking and feeling smoother and shinier right away.</li>
            <li>As I grew out the old ugly hair color, my hair went from damaged to amazing.</li>

            <li> This product does a great job of restoring color and shine!</li>
            <li> I use it three times a week to keep the best color, so a bottle lasts about three weeks.</li>

            <li> Great Product - Thank you John Frieda -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> br /&gt;before shampooing, and I did that, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I discovered it on Amazon again, at a great price, and just tried it again this week.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great for that.</li>
            <li> This works great to refresh your color.</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  </li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I have some gray and it makes my hair look real healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great way to keep your hair color looking bright, takes away that brassiness you sometimes get.  </li>
            <li> :o)</li>
            <li> I think maybe it&#x27;s best to concentrate this stuff on the length of your hair and make sure you don&#x27;t massage it into your scalp or roots of your hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and the color comes off your hands once you move on to washing up after application.</li>
            <li> And, for being so easy to use, just blob it on in the shower with no mirror, it came out perfect.</li>
            <li> Glaze is perfect alone or compliment to the precision hair color, easy to do alone and 100% gray coverage and gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> I wound up with really bright hair.  </li>
            <li> it adds a bright shine with some color.  </li>
            <li> Good service.</li>
            <li> Good product, makes hair shiny, and reduces brassiness of grays.  </li>

            <li> Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using John Frieda&#x27;s Brilliant Brunette Liquid Shine Luminous Color Glaze for over a year and love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ended up using quite a bit of product (about 2 good squeezes, maybe 1/12 of the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for shine</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the John Frieda brilliant brunette product line and use the shampoo, conditioner and the glaze.</li>

            <li> Very pleased -</li>
            <li> glaze is great - gives your hair bit of a shine like a healthy booster.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I love this product please don&#x27;t ever take it away!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon!</li>

            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this John Frieda color glaze!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> In between colorings, this keeps the color and shine for just awhile more!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> You may love it too!</li>
            <li> Love stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Like I said, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to use and adds great</li>
            <li> This is just an all around amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing I&#x27;ve stopped the salon treatments all together.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this amazing product years ago.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and does a wonderful job on my hair.</li>
            <li> but it did leave a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Every body always ask me about my hair color and how nice it looks.  </li>
            <li> Gives hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li> It is not a hair color, however it gives a nice tint.</li>
            <li> I have my own way of doing it.</li>
            <li> Finally, it kind of reeks.</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry because it washes off nicely, you may need to scrub a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It adds color, so if you don&#x27;t feel like dying your hair but want a change, this is nice.</li>
            <li> and I found it be somewhat effective in masking my greys, but not quite what I wanted, so I decided to experiment.</li>
            <li> instantly&lt;br /&gt;- smells nice</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know the difference.  </li>
            <li> GOOD  makes my hair look better  and covers gray hair</li>
            <li> Always makes hair look nice and shiney</li>
            <li> and then kind of massage it into the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> But it is nice</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is just great inbetween coloring my hair to keep it looking fresh and&lt;br /&gt;fast to do while in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It does leave a nice color and shine, but be sure to condition hair</li>
            <li> and my husband says my hair smells nice:)</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> have very light brown hair that is greying.  </li>
            <li> I do not highlight or dye my hair, but I do use this product and LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> so glad that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I love this glaze.</li>
            <li> I just love John Frieda products.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love using this product to make my hair a bit darker and to ensure that my sun-lights don&#x27;t appear too brassy.  </li>
            <li> I love the color.</li>
            <li> I love tis stuff &amp; have purchased it for many years.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look healthy either.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> but I suspect with more use (every week)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.....</li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> My hair is so healthy looking and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I get non stop compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> but I mostly focus on the top of my head.</li>
            <li> This glaze covers my gray and leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered more of it and also ordered the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I can see where I need to put it most.</li>
            <li> I LOVE John Frieda products and this is not the exception!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She used the glaze for blonds and looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in the stores around me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I can get this on Amazon, since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> 3+ minutes will have gone by for sure.     </li>
            <li> Normally I love John Frieda</li>
            <li> I will not buy any more glaze products from this company.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better it works with time.  </li>
            <li> It worked for about a week, but rinsed out to more brassiness.  </li>
            <li> my hair color started looking more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It had gone up to $60 or more a bottle on ebay.</li>
            <li> Thank you to whomever brought this wonderful product back.</li>

            <li> Enjoying the Joyhn Frieda beauty product.  </li>
            <li> I never knew these things existed and am so glad to be able to find Frieda products at this site.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Added a nice shine, but did not do much color wise for my greys.</li>
            <li> am certainly glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li> The more you use it, the more shine it adds.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using this glaze does give me more body</li>
            <li> Some products I have used do my hair oily or even more</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
            <li> I just use this after most times I wash my hair per week.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> The price was better on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on the color and shine.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff....</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I love the feel of my hair after I use it</li>
            <li> And be sure to scrub, scrub, scrub your hands with some soap while you&#x27;re waiting for the product to do its thing in your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color glaze for a couple months and have been quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I will use again tomorrow and see more of the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to go back to the salon before I need a cut and this product is a WONDERFUL solution and ever so easy.</li>
            <li> and it covers all my grey roots perfectly.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty good for hair</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been available where I live for years, so I am delighted to find on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Although the color says brunette, with my brown and gray hair the color comes out to be more redish in the sunlight but brown in the indoor light which is interesting.  </li>
            <li> Product is very economical and a nice treat for a quick in-home salon look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but you better have some conditioner handy: it really dries your hair.</li>
            <li> I have blondish-brown hair that is easily streaked by the sun.  </li>
            <li> I know that the product coats the hair, but I believe that it does protect your hair from damage and easily washes out with a clarifying shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, takes 3 minutes in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Made it easy to work into the hair.</li>
            <li> This was easy to use.  </li>
            <li> After applying it to your hair, use soap, rubbing your hands together and it easily comes off.</li>
            <li> After applying it to your hair, use soap, rubbing your hands together and it easily comes off.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use in the shower after shampooing and conditioning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> easy to use (3-5 minutes in the shower)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product - I have used this for years and it helps the color last longer and look more lustrous.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, also.</li>
            <li> Nice color and left a good feel to hair.</li>
            <li> Washes out easily and makes fine hair easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> Brilliant Brunette Luminous Color Glaze by John Freida is very simple to use, fast and effective.</li>
            <li> I then rinse this stuff out of my hair and apply the John Frieda brilliant brunette to my hair focusing on the lighter spots or any grey areas.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair great color and gloss and even creates nice highlights so the color looks so real and natural.</li>
            <li> It will stain your hands if you don&#x27;t wash them with soap immediately after, but soap works fine and if you have any drips a q tip dipped in rubbing alcohol will take care of it.  </li>
            <li> It does make my hair softer, but I have fine hair as it is</li>
            <li> this product does make your hair super shiny, soft and it just feels great.</li>
            <li> This was a great temporary fix for me, though I doubt I&#x27;ll keep the product around to use long-term as I simply don&#x27;t have the patience to use it during my morning shower as recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need the color refresher but the glaze makes my hair feel so nice</li>
            <li> And after use my hair is smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thinking, AS I SAID, and should have bought the &amp;#34;CLEAR GLAZE&amp;#34;, John Frieda had available.</li>
            <li> I recommended that a friend with light brown hair try it.</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice a week, and it blends my gray hair into a light brown, so it looks like I have highlights.</li>
            <li> The color is varied, so the brown colors are shiny and the grays are platinum-ish and light.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> It looked a bit shinier and was really smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I use it two to three times a week in the shower, and my hair always appears to be a light shade of brown with lots of natural-looking variations of tone.</li>
            <li> It stains and honestly my hair is much shiner without it.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The product does stain your skin so it is important to wash the face and hands after you&#x27;ve applied it to the hair.  </li>
            <li> this is  a great product...can only get on line....</li>
            <li> (This stuff would make a great instant tan if you&#x27;re going for a too-long-in-the-booth look.)</li>
            <li> covers grey hairs, and beautiful shine....................</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wash your hands right away after applying.</li>
            <li> I used an old applicator from when I used to color my hair to apply this Brilliant Brunette mainly to roots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly allergic to most hair color and have experimented with so many over the years until I found one that I can tolerate without my head itching and getting sores on my head and neck.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so I don&#x27;t know if someone with a different hair texture would get the same excellent results.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and vibrant and amazing every day.</li>
            <li> Smells good, hair feels smooth and tints my gray to a soft golden brown that blends well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased this glaze to help keep the rich brown color I wanted from that dye.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair more shining and straight!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It keeps your hair color looking fresh &amp; also adds shine!</li>
            <li> I just use it in the shower - shampoo, condition, rinse, squeeze excess water out, put a dollop of glaze on my palm and then rub into the crown of my head first (mostly around where I part my hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30% grey and this is great in between colorings.</li>
            <li> I use brilliant brunette which is much darker than it actually comes out on my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every time I clean my hair</li>
            <li> The color is deep and rich mahogany brown and the shine is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I like to add a special shine to my hair with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it when I go on dates with my boyfriend or special occasions.  </li>
            <li> and this would give my hair a light golden brown tone on the ends since that&#x27;s where i would i apply it to.</li>
            <li> It prolongs the greying process and leaves hair nice n soft</li>
            <li> Glosser Cool</li>
            <li> Love this so much</li>
            <li> It was a nice, natural color as well.</li>
            <li> In fact I have brown hair with a good deal of red in it</li>
            <li> I used this product several years ago and loved it but could no longer find it in the store.  </li>
            <li> you take good care of your hair, and you have a deep brunette color like me, this isn&#x27;t going to create miracles.  </li>
            <li> Good price for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Split ends disappear, my hair is bouncy and full but sleek, shiny and SUPER</li>
            <li> So I was hoping this would help w/ the quick fading of the John Frieda FoAm dye.</li>
            <li> After a quick wash and condition I apply the glaze, pin up my hair and finish my shower, rinsing my hair thoroughly before leaving the shower.</li>
            <li> It made my hair darker quickly.</li>
            <li> but after I rinse product out, I do a quick re-wash of face and neck</li>
            <li> I do not have many grays, but the ones I do have appear more covered -  this glaze is not a hair dye but does a tiny bit of sneaky coverings...</li>
            <li> Very pretty color on the hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and am very pleased with the outcome.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the shower, after the shampoo, and while the conditioner is doing it&#x27;s job, apply a generous amount to the needed areas (hairline mostly), &amp; let it do its job for 3-5 minutes then just rinse as normal.</li>
            <li> You can tell it&#x27;s from dye, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant or overpowering and it goes away after one wash.    </li>
            <li> had numerous complements on &amp;#34;my hair color&amp;#34; after using... so it gives a tinted appearance a tiny bit but, honestly think its more of a healthy shine, giving a multi-dimensional / highlighted look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used Dark Chocolate Brown which is a gorgeous rich color, but I noticed it faded so quick.</li>
            <li> but then everyone would have pretty hair like mine!</li>
            <li> A REASONABLE PRICE AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> At first I was elated !  </li>
            <li> The problem that I have, and the reason I probably won&#x27;t continue with this product, is that it makes my fine hair appear very oily and unwashed.</li>
            <li> John Frieda Liquid color glaze does a great job in covering my few gray hairs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of gray hair just a few around my hairline in the front and this works great to cover them up.</li>
            <li> I now have shiny healthy soft hair with amazing blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all that effective as conditioner, so I mix it with my regular conditioner, too.</li>
            <li> a dye it works with the gray to make highlights which creates multidimensional color, much more natural looking then</li>
            <li> but it was worth a shot to find something to keep my grays covered.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t shiny and it didn&#x27;t look good on a young - relatively young, girl.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> With these downsides, it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> is more manageable, Glaze is soft but like glass, Just a hint of color to hide roots</li>
            <li> It looks much more natural than a dye because there&#x27;s no outgrowth line.</li>
            <li> It does have a distinct scent - but not offensive.</li>
            <li> I tried to use semi permanent hair color to cover the gray without changing my natural color but it lightened the top layers of my hair and made it a reddish tone.  </li>
            <li> I rarely have to dye my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> fun for me, since I do all the laundry.</li>
            <li> Great product for slightly graying brunette hair.... diminishes the gray without having to color my hair!</li>
            <li> I use this product in the shower 2 -3 times per week and it definitely gives me a consistently more golden, rich brown color.</li>
            <li> (mild coconut-ish?)&lt;br /&gt;- gives roots some lift&lt;br /&gt;- not terribly expensive</li>
            <li> I use this product between colorings to keep the color rich looking and it really does work.  </li>
            <li> You do have to wash your hands right away or they will be stained, but that is all.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the idea, right?</li>
            <li> And some days if it doesn&#x27;t get rinsed just right</li>
            <li> I love the warm tones it gives my hair and no more &#x27;roots&#x27; to deal with.  </li>
            <li> After 3 min or so of being in my hair, it pretty much rinses clean.</li>
            <li> I have more brown than gray right now and am hoping I can make the transition to gray by only using this product and not ever having to use a permanent hair coloring.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and does seem to work for making your color last a little longer, but it stained my hands and face so easily.  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel good, and also makes your hair a little softer.</li>
            <li> so I find myself having to use styling product to get a bit more lift if I&#x27;m not going for the super shiny, straight, flat look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results, my main concern was the growth of grey hairs between color appointments and this is making the trick!</li>
            <li> It must have the same ingredients that is used in most hair colors.  </li>
            <li> This product did exactly that.</li>
            <li> I started off using it every day for the first week just to get it where I wanted it</li>
            <li> and everybody wanted to know how much I paid for those high-lights!  </li>
            <li> When I bought this, the first time, I wasn&#x27;t quite thinking correctly.</li>
            <li> BACK and really in more ways than just hair color.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> use this product one time per week and its effects lasts for a whole week!</li>
            <li> using this make sure you squeeze out all the water you possibly can.</li>
            <li> I do have color treated hair but this makes my roots a funny orange/brassy tone...plus, you have to use a lot in order for it to cover all of your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color glaze since it first came out.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot in one bottle so it should last you a couple of months, even if you are using it more than once a week.</li>
            <li> Dye will leave a residue on your hands at first, but as you rinse out your hair it will wash off.</li>
            <li> I also get lots of compliments on shine after I first use this product, and I have to say I noticed it too.</li>
            <li> After the first year my usage then went to once a month.</li>
            <li> Covers my gray with a light brown  color that blends well with my natural medium brown color.  </li>
            <li> I have definitely had better.</li>
            <li> It made my hair seem MORE red and even a bit lighter.</li>
            <li> My friend even commented it looked more red.</li>
            <li> I did not read the instructions when I used it the first time</li>
            <li> So first you wash your scalp with some separate shampoo</li>
            <li> I have been using it about every other day, just love the way it  makes my hair look and feel!</li>
            <li> But it seems to make my hair shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the results and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I also bought a toner shampoo which I used first.</li>
            <li> Remember it takes a few applications before the color takes good effect and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover my gray, but does blend it a bit, so I&#x27;m not so rushed to color as quick as I normally might.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser complemented my brunette hair the other day and asked if I dyed it since the color was so nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super smooth, lays flat, and doesn&#x27;t want to do anything else.  </li>
            <li> If your hair were lighter or darker than mine I would bet you&#x27;d have to use it more often to get the same results, but since my hair is already borderline I don&#x27;t have to do as much.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best kept secret to color hair with a natural effect.</li>
            <li> and there was glaze all over the top, you know, kind of like on something after you use it a few times, especially a liquid type product.  </li>
            <li> first time I unknowingly used too much and didn&#x27;t use it again for a while.</li>
            <li> looks and feels better than it has in a long while.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it so pretty much just stopped.  </li>
            <li> My favorite way to tint grey hair just a bit without any roots to worry about.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice and blends my silver hairs so that they look like highlights within my dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark and slightly warm.</li>
            <li> This gives my brunette hair a nice depth of dark color, makes it shinny, and coats it to make it feel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product mostly to keep the brassiness out of my highlights (soft caramel brown - lowlights really) and  to help blend those whites in a little better</li>
            <li> After my first use, my hair was super soft and managable and very shiny.  </li>
            <li> this products makes my hair a little darker not brassy and I love it!  </li>
            <li> My hair felt dry and had a lot of static after using it.</li>
            <li> It did have a very particular smell, but I didn&#x27;t dislike it.</li>
            <li> Plus it makes my hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> My professional color fades fairly quickly and I get a washed out look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a highlighter, an accenter, an enhancer, not a dramatic color changer.</li>
            <li> Still, I had a gob of the stuff sitting on a large patch of grout that set, so it can stain grout.  </li>
            <li> Now, I apply it on *dry* hair before I shower and leave it on for about 5 minutes (yes, it does stain, so be careful with surfaces in your bathroom, but a Magic Eraser will get it out of most; I wash my hands after applying it and any stubborns stains on my hands and stains elsewhere on my skin come out in the shower with a loofah).</li>
            <li> my brown hair looks very even</li>
            <li> my hair grows really fast and with this can go 5-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> works very well to touch up color between beauty parlor visits.</li>
            <li> After 3-4 weeks of using this product I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it was working.</li>
            <li> It covered some, but not as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it does much for the color of my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really see much improvement in shine.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> Not too much shine either.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants to boost their hair color.</li>
            <li> I feel it is much healthier for my hair than dying it.</li>
            <li> It was, also, relatively cheap enough buying it through AMAZON SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE.</li>
            <li> It smells so much nicer and made me hair a lot silkier.</li>
            <li> I sometimes leave the john frieda on for five minutes or sometimes an hour depending on how much time I have.</li>
            <li> Even use dabs straight on hair to cover gray.</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair, and after using this I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets really bleached out because I spend quite a bit of time outdoors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this until I have too much gray hair for this to be a feasible solution.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I see a color change or really a difference in the look.  </li>
            <li> Is it so much to ask to use a box?</li>
            <li> This works really well for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to dye my hair until I absolutely have.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had totally messed up my color by using a permanent hair color (in light brown) that was supposed to fight brassiness.  </li>
            <li> The real test is my bathroom mirror, which is where my hair looks the brightest.  </li>
            <li> and I just can&#x27;t believe they are the real thing.</li>
            <li> and I just can&#x27;t believe they are the real thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting ready for a trip to California</li>
            <li> Then squeeze out as much water as you can and apply the gloss.  </li>
            <li> But it was much softer and fluffier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shine really isn&#x27;t that noticeable.  </li>
            <li> your roots show is just a fact of your hair growing out and nothing can really be done besides a permanent color (took me years and years to figure all the hype for products to hide your grow out doesn&#x27;t work besides hair color).  </li>
            <li> Worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Very gray resistant hair may not absorb any color.</li>
            <li> This is an affordable hair product and if you want to make your hair real shiny</li>
            <li> Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works SO much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> My hair IS very porous.</li>
            <li> I have medium to light brown hair and I am starting to get stray grays.  </li>
            <li> I had used it for years but then stopped when it became no longer available to buy locally in stores.</li>
            <li> Maybe they were expecting too much?</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions, it doesn&#x27;t do much for covering grays.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about it so much...</li>
            <li> I already use the John Frieda foam colour (currently using light ash brown) and found this glaze while looking for another batch of permanent color.</li>
            <li> It adds a bit of shine and much a bit of a color pick me up in between coloring.</li>
            <li> I use this at the roots only and it gives my greys a light brown tint so that they look almost like highlights.</li>
            <li> It took out \\&quot;some\\&quot; of the brassiness but not as much as I wanted.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend it if you are trying to enhance your natural color and have shorter hair so you don&#x27;t have to worry about static and flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gives me a nice shiny color and covers the few grays I have...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far cheaper than going to the salon, and pretty much foolproof as well!</li>
            <li> Just as a mention I have also tried the clear glaze and it only gets slightly better results.</li>
            <li> I usually have pretty nice hair.  </li>
            <li> hair to blend in the tones to avoid the stark light/dark contrast while adding a nice shine.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair in better condition rather than worse, and I think it&#x27;s helped postpone the day when I have to find a colorist. :)</li>
            <li> , I have also noticed that my hair is smoother, just make sure not to overdone it because it could feel a bit heavy or greasy, I try to apply it fast because your hands will grab the color and then leave it for at least 5 minutes, all in all very nice product</li>
            <li> I have it set in Amazon to ship a new bottle once a month I use it so much!</li>
            <li> apply product with my hands; it does stain but wash off immediately after with soap- and use a soft nail brush and it will come right</li>
            <li> My hair is now back to its original color.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to all types of dyes and rinses and most every other product on the market to color my hair.  </li>
            <li> Other days I think this product adds a lovely shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for &#x27;color&#x27; for several years now and my hair is mostly light brown with lighter high - lights with this product.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and gives me a highlighted look instead of going grey!</li>
            <li> really keeps color vibrant and hair shiny and helps hide those pesky roots to extend time betwen dyeing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to hide my gray roots as I let them grow out, it certainly makes them MUCH less noticeable for sure.</li>
            <li> Now i know i will not waste my time or gas and order first here.  </li>
            <li> I still open it up and get to the glaze itself and it just seems like it was not that full</li>
            <li> If in the future I want to go completely gray and stop using this, it is not a problem, as what it highlights blends in with the gray just fine.</li>
            <li> If you spend enough time perfecting your technique, it would probably provide a good shine to hair that just needs a little boost.</li>
            <li> And they now sell new at Ulta!</li>
            <li> With wet hands the product easily falls onto the floor, or on you.</li>
            <li> being said, the area where I use the glaze the most is shinier and has less volume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to find this product several different places to no avail, so was pleased to find this seller and buy at decent price.</li>
            <li> what my natural hair color was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for how to use this:  wet hair thoroughly in the shower, ring it out, apply the glaze mostly to the hairline and where you part your hair.</li>
            <li> However, it seems that the only liquid shine available is clear.  </li>
            <li> I noticed another commenter stated that it made their hair more red, and I had the same issue, as well.</li>
            <li> This product is great to add just a little bit of color to the grays and really brings depth to my dark brown hair color.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I now only use this about once every three months to touch up the new gray to look more blonde.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- lays your wild hairs flat and smooth</li>
            <li> 1)The glaze effect keeps my hairline and part soft, smooth, and free of frizz and coarseness that usually occurs as new gray hair is growing in or color is wearing out.  </li>
            <li> I have a little gray hair, mostly in my bangs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, it does have a faint dye smell.</li>
            <li> My natural color is so much lighter.</li>
            <li> It says rinse until water runs clear,i dont care how much i use, it always runs clear.</li>
            <li> While it did leave my hair with the \\&quot;just-dyed\\&quot; smell, it was worth the overall effects.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t normally stain my grout.  </li>
            <li> Every time I&#x27;m complimented on my &amp;#34;stunning&amp;#34; hair color, I offer up that it&#x27;s my normal color</li>
            <li> I am reasonably gray under the pretty honey blonde my hairdresser conjers once every 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money, you&#x27;re better off buying a semi-permanent dye.</li>
            <li> I towel dried my hair then applied mostly to my gray roots which now are an inch or two</li>
            <li> Good but not great.</li>
            <li> I got highlights that were way too blond and was able to dim them down with this.</li>
            <li> Not only are the highlighted strands staying just right, it seems to leave just a touch of gold on my whites and helps with the blending.</li>
            <li> I love this glaze, as it has become hard to find at my local store I got on Amazon and was able to get it here, thx I will be back.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve looked for years for the perfect combo to transform my coarse, thick, frizzy mixed race hair, and this will definitely stay in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> It washes off skin with enough rubbing, but it&#x27;s better to just be careful and not let it set/sit on skin.</li>
            <li> but it weighs my fine hair down.  </li>
            <li> It has also increased the shine in my hair and made it very soft.</li>
            <li> looks very natural, not like a dye.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hair is very soft and shiny as well.</li>
            <li> On a daily basis I use ORS replenishing conditioner on my hair first.</li>
            <li> This product, in the dark/espresso version, is just enough of a hit that my hair looks brunette consistently.</li>
            <li> These highlights look so natural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times, exactly according to directions, and have yet to see any effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I will agree with the reviewer who says it may leave your hair more oily than usual.</li>
            <li> I could not get past the overwhelming coconut oil smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does stain the hands when applying the product, but it disappears very quickly with a little soap.</li>
            <li> My little grey hairs get highlighted and it ads a really nice color to</li>
            <li> I have dyed brown hair and use this at most once per week, so needless to say due to my own fault</li>
            <li> Just the right touch of color to the grey</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep buying this product as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> The roots disappeared within a few months of using this, easily.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair a little dry, but whenever i use it everyone tells me how nice my hair looks.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not too sure of, is my scalp seems to itch for a couple of days afterwards, so I have cut down the times I use it.</li>
            <li> have fine long (flat - blah) hair -</li>
            <li> With a few uses, the color built up so that my gray hairs are slightly warmer and more golden</li>
            <li> I bought it from Amazon Prime, not even a different buyer, otherwise that would have been a little bit more understandable.</li>
            <li> When I rinsed my hair out I had brown hair with all the red high lights … exactly as I had before I&#x27;d gone white !!!</li>
            <li> This really controls the red tint in my hair that happens after a week of a professional color.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t always take the product clear to the end of my hair.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like to think about is what these products do to your scalp and how much of it enters your system.</li>
            <li> Yes, this one works very well on covering white hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a gentle formulation that won&#x27;t damage hair and actually improved the feel and appearance of my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft and silky after using this glaze.  </li>
            <li> This makes your hair SO soft and the color looks professional.</li>
            <li> After having all the dyed color cut off with a snazzy cut, I didn&#x27;t like the &#x27;coldness&#x27; of my natural color.  </li>
            <li> all natural</li>
            <li> I was 28 years old when it happened.</li>
            <li> but, still, it was a complete piece of cake.</li>
            <li> I GOT MY OLD &amp;#34;SELF&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t look so old …</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel so old …</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t act so old.</li>
            <li> As a bonus it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> It covers my increasingly gray hair, it leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Have a clip ready to put your hair up because the color will stain your neck and back.</li>
            <li> , make sure you leave it in for at least 3 mins or the color will wash out.</li>
            <li> I have been using the glaze for at least a year and am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> My natural color is medium ash brown.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day (curly hair; frequent washing dries it out), so I apply the glaze on days when I won&#x27;t be washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I am 48 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times, then just colored my hair permanently, since it is too much hassle and overall</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is now predominantly silver.  </li>
            <li> It is a very temporary color glaze that lasts until the next shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to run when it rains and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> and it did not make my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> Even if you aren&#x27;t looking for color enhancement and you just want soft shiny hair</li>
            <li> Adds a couple of weeks between professional coloring.</li>
            <li> Feels like too much of a gamble to use this product on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think the smell of the product is fine, smells like lotion to me , plus it is only on my hair for three minutes every other day</li>
            <li> No mess.  </li>
            <li> This product is for people who prefer subtle healthy looking hair.  </li>
            <li> I had had medium brown hair with red high lights -</li>
            <li> My white hair turns to light brown which can hiding in my black hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is more of a light brown to dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> This keeps my dyed dark brown hair color looking fresh and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the consistency of shampoo, but opaque dark brown with golden sparkles in it.  </li>
            <li> The instructions also say to wash hands after applying, no matter how quick you apply your hands wind up stained a little.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t recommend using it very often as I feel it does dry up your hair.</li>
            <li> I then put Argon oil on the very tips of the end of my hair which helps when I blow dry and curl it.</li>
            <li> and I want my hair glossy and sleek - ready to combat the dry, sun-drenched and salty air.  </li>
            <li> Problem is, dry hair doesn&#x27;t allow product to spread very well.  </li>
            <li> lightly towel dried it, but some still rubbed off on my white towels.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time experimenting with color, as an African American Woman who relaxes her hair, I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t further damage my mousy locks.</li>
            <li> There is no other product on the market that I know of to help keep your color for a longer period of time between colorings.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be the same, but I think the formula has changed because it just did not do anything for me, even after using the entire bottle following the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful to wash it off your shower/sink right away if some splatters as it will stain like regular hair dye.  </li>
            <li> Will get the clear next time to try.</li>
            <li> Leaving the product on 5-8 minutes darkened my hair almost back to my natural color.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use this color to help cover my roots while I let my natural color grow back.  </li>
            <li> Jaw literally falling open - they&#x27;d never guessed it wasn&#x27;t natural.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and apply it every AM to areas where my roots show, using an old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Since I was interested in covering grays, I started at my scalp and would then rub and comb the product down to the ends of my shoulder-blade-length hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in order to cheaply hide a few grey hairs that have appeared recently, and it does work for that purpose.</li>
            <li> brightens my dark hair and calms down the grey. : )  </li>
            <li> I naturally have red undertones, and dye my hair with ash colors to counteract the red.</li>
            <li> It made a big difference and really toned down the brassiness and left my hair soft, even though I didn&#x27;t use conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have brown hair with dark blond highlights and was hoping I could use this to help blend the highlights as my hair grows, but it really does nothing.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t love this as much as I&#x27;d hoped from the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Normally this sounds great, considering my American friends are always straightening their hair like crazy to tame it, while mine stays flat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews on weird color results, dryness, etc., but - for me - absolutely none of this has ever been true.</li>
            <li> As it builds the colour and sheen gets richer, but it is not flat like hair dye.</li>
            <li> I have used John Frieda glazes in the past, and they left my hair looking and feeling smoother and shinier right away.</li>
            <li> As I grew out the old ugly hair color, my hair went from damaged to amazing.</li>
            <li> I think people who are having success with this might have a different hair texture than mine - possibly thick or wavy/curly haired people can use this without the greasiness issue.</li>
            <li> I like this product line a lot, but this particular item did almost nothing for my hair (and did make a big mess in the tub).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has made my kinky, curly, full, thick and rough hair seem shinier, which is a bonus, but I think Id rather have had a shine or glossing product that didn&#x27;t deposit any color at all.</li>
            <li> Not much color change mind you, but the whites don&#x27;t &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; so much where my hair parts and the darker roots coming in are less noticeable</li>
            <li> I have dirty blonde hair that can look more blonde or brunette depending on the season or amount of sunlight hitting it.</li>
            <li> I only have to use it once every couple weeks, meaning the bottle lasts a long time</li>
            <li> This product just flat out</li>
            <li> Especially with long, mid-back length hair.  </li>
            <li> As long as I continue applying it regularly, the roots never show.</li>
            <li> Some days I rinse too well (or didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough) and it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve even used the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to the instructions (which were missing from the box, by the way), you shampoo and condition your hair like normal.  </li>
            <li> I found this product let me highlight my hair less frequently, saving time and money</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses a glaze to lift the color, and this product works like the professional products with less cost.</li>
            <li> I put it in my dry hair about ten minutes or so before I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> The product also made my hair feel gross and dry.</li>
            <li> The only gray that resists coloring is a few strands at the temples and in front of my ears, but even that adds to the natural appearance.  </li>
            <li> This gloss doesn&#x27;t really cover the gray, but it makes it less stark (my hair is brown-black and has some scattered gray throughout--less than 5% gray, but enough to notice without coloring it).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice that much of a difference in the color, but I have really hard water, so perhaps it&#x27;s a losing battle against my color fading.</li>
            <li> I always use a conditioner because I have long hair</li>
            <li> I use this to tint the grey that I have and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> a heavy one color dye which you&#x27;d then have to apply highlights on to get close to a natural appearance.</li>
            <li> I use this to cover up my grey hair.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s not natural.</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s not natural color - that it comes from a bottle (and I tell them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to gray, but I&#x27;m not ready to start dying  my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so long that it doesn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li> i am finding it harder each time i try to buy this at the local stores.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to cover the up the grey hairs that are beginning to show up.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t see my grey hairs at all now</li>
            <li> 3 weeks between the time the grey starts showing &amp; when it&#x27;s time to reapply.</li>
            <li> I saw no real difference in either my hair color or shine after multiple uses so this product was a complete waste for me.</li>
            <li> As long as you wash your hands immediately, don&#x27;t find a need for gloves.&lt;br /&gt;Having</li>
            <li> I used it for a while and saw no discernible difference in grey hair coverage.  </li>
            <li> It also only takes me a couple dollops (quarter-sized amounts) for each use (one for the roots, one for the ends) to spread it evenly, and my hair is a quarter ways down my back.     </li>
            <li> This glaze didn&#x27;t ever last very long though, which is probably why it is not very damaging.</li>
            <li> (my hair is very long, just pass my butt.</li>
            <li> I dab 1 - 2 teaspoons along my temples after I towel dry my hair then brush it in thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I tried violet shampoos and conditioners, but those didn&#x27;t work well either and made my hair really dry.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any lingering scent when the hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> Like grout, it&#x27;s not normally a problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half-Japanese, so my hair is a dark brown yet behaves like silky Asian hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair hardly ever falls out and it is very soft after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> so the brown product wouldn&#x27;t drip down my back and leave a drip stain.  </li>
            <li> On my brown/white hair, it turned blond then yellow then pink!!  </li>
            <li> before using it, otherwise your hair will feel like a dry broom!~</li>
            <li> The product left our hair heavy with a strange fragrance.</li>
            <li> The only color boost I could see was to my hands &amp; fingers - not worth the bother or the money spent.</li>
            <li> I have a few grey hairs but not enough to need to color my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff was super runny which made it really difficult to try to apply it on my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  The smoothness help is still true, but I have found that the color added an orange tint to my hair which was very unappealing.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair very dry, and about 1/4 of my hair fell out.  </li>
            <li> Just a slight hint of red with not much of a line of demarcation.</li>
            <li> Actually dries my hair a little.</li>
            <li> The little bit of grey i have is still grey and my hair is not any shinier.</li>
            <li> If you leave it on for at least 3 mins, and you rinse the water it clear because the color is on your head.</li>
            <li> The respondent indicated that this is not a hair dye, and should not be expected to dye the hair.</li>
            <li> Box for the glaze itself was very bashed in, it looks like it was in worse shape than the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Would not buy again, and absolutely NOT from this seller.  </li>
            <li> every time you shampoo or wet hair in shower and just put some in between shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> Curling my hair is a pain, as is getting the roots to fluff up.  </li>
            <li> Only takes a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I used this product and expected it to do something for my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product does not really do much of anything.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this glaze to help cover up a few grays between colorings and to give me some overall shine.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this....</li>
            <li> Again empty promises.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews before purchasing and was glad to find out that it did not make my hair smell bad, nor does it make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I have some grey , not full head.......</li>
            <li> It has all the highs and lows and subtle changes in shade that any natural hair color has.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy because it actually does deposit color onto your hair so be careful to rinse out the shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this in a white bathtub too and very little color rinses out.</li>
            <li> it helped hide my grey (just a few strands around the temples), but I couldn&#x27;t handle smelling it all day.</li>
            <li> I like that you have to rinse your hair after applying because some other stuff I tried (Fancifull, I think)</li>
            <li> I do find it difficult to massage into my hair after first washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have not used in other ways.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by other reviewers - this stuff stains.</li>
            <li> It came half empty.</li>
            <li> It might color the hair a little bit, but it leaves them very dry.</li>
            <li> After a month my hair still faded to a caramel brown color instead of staying dark brown.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money</li>
            <li> Not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how dark I was coloring my hair all of those years.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE CASH.</li>
            <li> In other words, wash your hands as soon as you get the color on your hair, and be very careful not to let your strands stain your ears/chest/shoulders while you wait a few mins for the glaze to work</li>
            <li> However, I noticed the one in this order was noticeably watered down.</li>
            <li> This tones down any brass, adds a touch of color and blends out greys.  </li>
            <li> I then massage it down to my scalp.</li>
            <li> This time, I flipped my hair upside down to wash out the gloss.  </li>
            <li> No way I was letting it wash down my</li>
            <li> I need to tone it down.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover the gray but it does tone it down .  </li>
            <li> Make sure you apply it evenly!&lt;br /&gt;Smell is unpleasant!</li>
            <li> I use a little around my hairline  and in my part every other shampoo</li>
            <li> I have very long hair past my waist</li>
            <li> - I have very long hair and usually end up using about 3 - 4 tablespoons (and use 1x per week, and shampoo 2x per week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came out flat &amp; dull.</li>
            <li> My only complaint it that the product is a little too runny.</li>
            <li> almost black hair, thickish, wavy</li>
            <li> However.. this DOES make my hair look and feel way smoother and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> John Frieda will leave a slight brown stain on your head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also less fuss, time and money than a dye-job.  </li>
            <li> cow!</li>
            <li> Update: Holy cow!</li>
            <li> gray less  </li>
            <li> It gives my brown hair a boost of color, shine, and softness, and makes my gray less noticeable.</li>
            <li> And, if you go to bed with even slightly damp hair, you might just wake up with a brown-colored pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not full coverage,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also disappointed that this product did not make my hair shiny at all - it actually looks much duller than before I used it.</li>
            <li> I read a few people complain about it being a mess in the tub</li>
            <li> While waiting I use a little exfoliating scrub soap on my hands and hairline, finish body washing, shaving and whatnot, then rinse.</li>
            <li> i even use a little and leave it in like a leave in conditioner on the ends of my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why other reviewers have felt that it dried out their hair...</li>
            <li> and i have very dark brown</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy - I&#x27;ve accidentally stained by scalp and ears a couple times.</li>
            <li> (Using the product all over was way too heavy.  </li>
            <li> It covers my gray without being harsh.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go through hair coloring every few weeks.</li>
            <li> - I had to keep up with it - every few weeks</li>
            <li> It also covered the few grays a bit</li>
            <li> Every few days I take baking soda, mix it with water and let it run through my hair and massage my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been doing this routine for a few years and my hair is the healthiest it has ever been in my life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> am a 63 year old women, who has the unfortunate luck of being alergic to hair coloring.  </li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and have seen no difference in shine or color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to use this in the shower everyday.  </li>
            <li> Just leave it in for a few minutes after shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> After my hair dried, you would never had known I used this product.</li>
            <li> Messy and ineffective on my hair.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need any harsh dyes to cover my grays.</li>
            <li> I can use this glazing with no issues - I find it to be not oily or heavy.  </li>
            <li> Then rinsed and towel dried my hair again.  </li>
            <li> It was also messy and time-consuming to color my hair at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this off and on for a few years.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I now remember what I have been missing.</li>
            <li> My hair stays shiny and feels thicker/stronger when I use this a few times a week</li>
            <li> dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> For years, I used different brands of permanent hair coloring to cover the gray, but I hated how my hair would look purple or orangish right after coloring, and after a few weeks the roots would start showing.</li>
            <li> Finally ordered this after reading raving reviews; got this package in the mail that wasn&#x27;t even a box; a sloppy envelope with no protective packaging.</li>
            <li> I have all over color done at least once every 6-8 weeks and lowlights every other coloring.</li>
            <li> it just plain looks greasy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any enhancement to the shine or color of my hair, but it did seem a little softer than usual.</li>
            <li> The first year I used this color glaze to grow out my hair color roots and multiple-shades of bad hair color.</li>
            <li> I usually wake up looking like someone dumped water on my hair and it dried that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost black at the roots, which mean my whites come in like silver glitter.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use this product my hair looks a little brassy and dull...</li>
            <li> The color is subtle and if your hair gets too dark, you can just skip using it a couple days a week.</li>
            <li> Not pleased that the manufacturer would do this, but it still works.</li>
            <li> But it has kept my colored brown hair brown and not bleach out for the past 3 1/2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t difficult if you&#x27;re showering at the same time.</li>
            <li> I also was unfortunate enough to get some on my ear</li>
            <li> Then, I hop in the shower, rinse it out, and condition my hair as usual.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again, but I&#x27;m docking it a star because for a daily use product, this stuff is expensive.  </li>
            <li> (but I usually leave on about 8 - 10) and rinse hair thoroughly before exiting shower.  </li>
            <li> Too messy!</li>
            <li> Very messy, stains hands; had to wash them with shampoo to get the stain off even within seconds.  </li>
            <li> Not a very good glaze.  </li>
            <li> Still, the dye has a very strong and bad smell, leaving my hair to also smell bad during the day.</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry and was difficult to style.</li>
            <li> It was discontinued, and hard to find.</li>
            <li> It was discontinued, and hard to find.</li>
            <li> And I try to leave it in for at least the recommended amount of time (3+ minutes).</li>
            <li> Another reviewer complained that their hair felt greasy after using it, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem.</li>
            <li> know some people have complained about the glaze consistency and the skin staining, but I don&#x27;t seem to have a problem with the process at all.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why it is so difficult to track down in stores</li>
            <li> My hair stinks for days, even after a few washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just read that someone&#x27;s annoyed response to another review that complained the product didn&#x27;t work to cover grey.</li>
            <li> Not the usual formula!  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely ridiculous.</li>
            <li> in fact, this item came so fast i was shocked!  </li>
            <li> I found the consistency of the glaze a little difficult to apply in the shower.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty awful in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The last few years of coloring my hair, hair color wouldn&#x27;t take correctly and my hair looked awful.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t give away my secret.</li>
            <li> So tired of having to color every two weeks because the grays keep showing through.</li>
            <li> I was tired of dying my hair - always having to have the roots touched up.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and do not like to color it because of the damage it causes.</li>
            <li> I am now addicted to this product.  </li>
            <li> (scrub like a mad person to remove)&lt;br /&gt;- stains your white bath towels a bit (bleach like crazy to</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed for my wasted of money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product caused itching as well.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this to help cover up a semi-permanent dye job gone wrong.  </li>
            <li> I used it years ago but then was unable to find it until now.  </li>
            <li> but, also, it was expensive.</li>
            <li> I look like I have my hair done by expensive professionals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to rinse it all off the scalp without scrubbing it - which would remove it from the gray roots I&#x27;m trying to cover.</li>
            <li> Made for folks like me who aren&#x27;t crazy about going to s salon...</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> Very very faint almost non existent, the scent won&#x27;t stay on your hair or give you a headache or anything.</li>
            <li> Just can&#x27;t say a bad word.</li>
            <li> The bad thing is, my hair lacks volume, dimension, and texture.  </li>
            <li> crap.</li>
            <li> Yucky chemical crap storm</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> I always hated the way my hair took home hair dye or even non permanent color.</li>
            <li> I hated having to use hair color ever two weeks taking upwards of an hour at a time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blech!</li>
            <li> It will leave that \\&quot;just been dyed\\&quot; odor on your hair, but it is not the worst of the dye smells out there.</li>
            <li> but this product is the worst.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair look horrible or anything which is</li>
            <li> I would also like to add that it smells terrible!</li>
            <li> If your hair looked awful before (from dying, or sun damage, or saltwater damage), then this might be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But my gray hair is so shockingly gray</li>
            <li> noticeable- not that shocking as the gray grows out.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do not highlight or dye my hair, but I do use this product and LOVE it.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of gray, so cannot speak to how well it covers gray.  When I don&#x27;t use this product my hair looks a little brassy and dull...this products makes my hair a little darker not brassy and I love it!  I have it set in Amazon to ship a new bottle once a month I use it so much!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product.  I&#x27;m highly allergic to most hair color and have experimented with so many over the years until I found one that I can tolerate without my head itching and getting sores on my head and neck.  Unfortunately, this product caused itching as well.  It must have the same ingredients that is used in most hair colors.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but you better have some conditioner handy: it really dries your hair.</li>
            <li> I am about 30% gray and I like this product.  It smells nice and blends my silver hairs so that they look like highlights within my dark brown hair.  Washes out easily and makes fine hair easy to manage.  Will stain.</li>
            <li> The product left our hair heavy with a strange fragrance.The change in hair colour was not as apart as advertised.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I use it only a couple of times a week and my hair looks really good!</li>
            <li> It is just great inbetween coloring my hair to keep it looking fresh and&lt;br /&gt;fast to do while in the shower.  Best to save a towel for it though -- can&lt;br /&gt;stain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results, my main concern was the growth of grey hairs between color appointments and this is making the trick! my brown hair looks very even and now I can prolong the dye application, I have also noticed that my hair is smoother, just make sure not to overdone it because it could feel a bit heavy or greasy, I try to apply it fast because your hands will grab the color and then leave it for at least 5 minutes, all in all very nice product and I will repurchase!</li>
            <li> John Frieda Liquid color glaze does a great job in covering my few gray hairs.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.</li>
            <li> I like to use 3x week starting about 2 weeks after each dye job. really keeps color vibrant and hair shiny and helps hide those pesky roots to extend time betwen dyeing. my hair grows really fast and with this can go 5-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to find this product several different places to no avail, so was pleased to find this seller and buy at decent price. Good service.</li>
            <li> Now that it is fall, I was wanting a non-permanent product to blend in my summer highlights. This product did exactly that. It has also increased the shine in my hair and made it very soft. I read the other reviews before purchasing and was glad to find out that it did not make my hair smell bad, nor does it make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help cover up a semi-permanent dye job gone wrong.  I used the glaze daily for about two weeks until I could get in to see my stylist.  Leaving the product on 5-8 minutes darkened my hair almost back to my natural color.  While it did leave my hair with the \\&quot;just-dyed\\&quot; smell, it was worth the overall effects.  This was a great temporary fix for me, though I doubt I&#x27;ll keep the product around to use long-term as I simply don&#x27;t have the patience to use it during my morning shower as recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need the color refresher but the glaze makes my hair feel so nice</li>
            <li> this has helped me to not have to use demi permanent color on my hair in between my salon lowlights. my hair doesn&#x27;t look faded anymore when I use this. first time I unknowingly used too much and didn&#x27;t use it again for a while. the next time I used about the same amount that I would use as a conditioner and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I use brilliant brunette which is much darker than it actually comes out on my hair. My hair is more of a light brown to dirty blonde. I think if I used a color you would expect me to use, it wouldn&#x27;t do anything. Someone said it stained their fingernails so I use just the palm of one hand to apply it in the shower after I wash my hair. Only thing I don&#x27;t like to think about is what these products do to your scalp and how much of it enters your system.</li>
            <li> I used it for only a week and did not see any color change but I had to stop using it because it made my hair oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Glaze with every shower, because I don&#x27;t like dying my hair.  The demi permanent dye that&#x27;s on it washes off in 4-6 weeks, according to the package.  I&#x27;ve gone a couple of months and the gray is only starting to peek through.  Glaze makes the color last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glaze is non-irritating, and I don&#x27;t smell and odor.  I just put it on after shampooing and conditioning, shower the rest of my body, then rinse the glaze off.  It doesn&#x27;t normally stain my grout.  Still, I had a gob of the stuff sitting on a large patch of grout that set, so it can stain grout.  It stained my shoulder once, also.  That washed out by the next day.  Like grout, it&#x27;s not normally a problem.  Just don&#x27;t give it time to set.</li>
            <li> Yes, this one works very well on covering white hair. My white hair turns to light brown which can hiding in my black hair. And after use my hair is smooth and shiny. Just can&#x27;t say a bad word.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!  Have been putting a handful in my hair every time I shampoo for the last 2 years.  Knocks the &#x27;white&#x27; off my grays and leaves them looking like red highlights amongst my curly auburn hair.  Beats dyes and battling roots to pieces.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- For me, it added back color that had washed out in between highlighting treatments&lt;br /&gt;- I only have to use it once every couple weeks, meaning the bottle lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;- I found this product let me highlight my hair less frequently, saving time and money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s messy - I&#x27;ve accidentally stained by scalp and ears a couple times. It washes off skin with enough rubbing, but it&#x27;s better to just be careful and not let it set/sit on skin. In other words, wash your hands as soon as you get the color on your hair, and be very careful not to let your strands stain your ears/chest/shoulders while you wait a few mins for the glaze to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this glaze, as it has become hard to find at my local store I got on Amazon and was able to get it here, thx I will be back.  The glaze adds texture and shine along with the depth of color thx</li>
            <li> I used to use this back in 2008 and i have very dark brown almost black hair, thickish, wavy and this would give my hair a light golden brown tone on the ends since that&#x27;s where i would i apply it to. I don&#x27;t know why i stopped using it but i am going to get myself another bottle. It&#x27;s a great product, it does have a faint dye smell. Very very faint almost non existent, the scent won&#x27;t stay on your hair or give you a headache or anything. It&#x27;s like instead of coloring your hair with dye and ruinning it use this instead! Works great :)</li>
            <li> Good product, makes hair shiny, and reduces brassiness of grays.  It does not color the grays but just mellows them.  I can no longer find this product in stores so glad that Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> works very well to touch up color between beauty parlor visits.</li>
            <li> I love this product please don&#x27;t ever take it away!  It is gentle and does a wonderful job on my hair.</li>
            <li> This glaze has solved my in-between-colorings problems.  1)The glaze effect keeps my hairline and part soft, smooth, and free of frizz and coarseness that usually occurs as new gray hair is growing in or color is wearing out.  2)The color keeps my part and hairline (even my 100% gray temples)colored and blended in, eliminating the need to touch up my roots.  I am so happy to have discovered this product.  I apply it only to my part area and hairline, rubbing it in to problem areas, then without rinsing, I apply my regular cleansing conditioner that I use instead of shampoo all over, and let it all sit while doing the rest of my shower. I do this every day. (Using the product all over was way too heavy.  Don&#x27;t plan on doing that on a regular basis.)  Remember it takes a few applications before the color takes good effect and the glaze effect gets smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The smoothness help is still true, but I have found that the color added an orange tint to my hair which was very unappealing.  For this reason, I have had to stop using it.  This may or may not be an issue for you.</li>
            <li> So I was hoping this would help w/ the quick fading of the John Frieda FoAm dye. I used Dark Chocolate Brown which is a gorgeous rich color, but I noticed it faded so quick. I had purchased this glaze to help keep the rich brown color I wanted from that dye. After 3-4 weeks of using this product I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it was working. I would leave it on for 5min in shower every time. My hair felt dryer after each use. After a month my hair still faded to a caramel brown color instead of staying dark brown. Probably not going to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this color to help cover my roots while I let my natural color grow back.  It covered some, but not as much as I had hoped. I always use a conditioner because I have long hair but since you use this product after your conditioner it was like it took away all the benefits of the conditioner.  My hair felt dry and had a lot of static after using it. but it did leave a nice shine. I would only recommend it if you are trying to enhance your natural color and have shorter hair so you don&#x27;t have to worry about static and flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> I love this glaze. I use this to tint the grey that I have and it works wonders. No need for dyes.</li>
            <li> Just what my greying blond wife wanted to not be herself.  But though she is happy, I did not succeed.  It is like buying cigarettes for a cancer survivor.  I hated it.</li>
            <li> I have used and loved this product for years. However, I noticed the one in this order was noticeably watered down. It&#x27;s already expensive; now you have to use more for the same effect. Not pleased that the manufacturer would do this, but it still works.</li>
            <li> I just love John Frieda products.  Every body always ask me about my hair color and how nice it looks.  I have some gray and it makes my hair look real healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It prolongs the greying process and leaves hair nice n soft</li>
            <li> I am blown away by the John Frieda collection. I just started using their shampoo/conditioner/leave-in spray and nourishing lotion, plus the glaze for brunettes and their precision hair color and my hair looks and feels better than it has in a long while. The products do just what they say. I give them all 5 stars... Glaze is perfect alone or compliment to the precision hair color, easy to do alone and 100% gray coverage and gorgeous color.</li>
            <li> Seems to have been repackaged!  Not the usual formula!  And they now sell new at Ulta!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it adds any color to my hair but does appear shinier.  I have been using it once a week &amp; I think the change has been gradual.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it does much for the color of my hair at all.  I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in color. and I use it 2-3 times a week. However.. this DOES make my hair look and feel way smoother and less frizzy.  Makes it shine as well!</li>
            <li> You do have to keep up with it at a minimum of 3X per week. I started off using it every day for the first week just to get it where I wanted it and then maintain it with 3 treaments per week. I&#x27;m using it to hide my gray roots as I let them grow out, it certainly makes them MUCH less noticeable for sure. Makes the grays look like intentional highlights. I&#x27;m happy with it and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Gives hair a nice shine. It is not a hair color, however it gives a nice tint. I have been using it for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would cover some gray, but it does not. Can&#x27;t really see much improvement in shine.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t love this as much as I&#x27;d hoped from the other reviews. It&#x27;s not all that effective as conditioner, so I mix it with my regular conditioner, too. I don&#x27;t notice that much of a difference in the color, but I have really hard water, so perhaps it&#x27;s a losing battle against my color fading.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  It did stain my bath though, but did wonders on the gray hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a winner.  I am not sure why it is so difficult to track down in stores and I am grateful to have identified it through reviews.  I have blondish-brown hair that is easily streaked by the sun.  I love using this product to make my hair a bit darker and to ensure that my sun-lights don&#x27;t appear too brassy.  This product is a gentle formulation that won&#x27;t damage hair and actually improved the feel and appearance of my hair.  My hair is shiny and soft and silky after using this glaze.  I know that the product coats the hair, but I believe that it does protect your hair from damage and easily washes out with a clarifying shampoo.  Five stars and please don&#x27;t discontinue this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Brilliant Brunette Luminous Color Glaze by John Freida is very simple to use, fast and effective. I use it once to twice a week at the start of my shower. After a quick wash and condition I apply the glaze, pin up my hair and finish my shower, rinsing my hair thoroughly before leaving the shower. I love the color. It&#x27;s dark and slightly warm. It covers my gray without being harsh. Since it&#x27;s a glaze rather than a dye it works with the gray to make highlights which creates multidimensional color, much more natural looking then a heavy one color dye which you&#x27;d then have to apply highlights on to get close to a natural appearance.</li>
            <li> great for rood touch up between coloring.</li>
            <li> The only color boost I could see was to my hands &amp; fingers - not worth the bother or the money spent.</li>
            <li> It think this is a great product. It does exactly what it says and is easy to use. The smell is pleasant and the color comes off your hands once you move on to washing up after application. I am using it in conjunction with the JF color shampoo and conditioner.   My only complaint it that the product is a little too runny. With wet hands the product easily falls onto the floor, or on you.</li>
            <li> I use this product in the shower 2 -3 times per week and it definitely gives me a consistently more golden, rich brown color. I love it!! It smells good, not like dye. Great alternative to smelly hair dye or pricey salon color. My hairdresser complemented my brunette hair the other day and asked if I dyed it since the color was so nice.</li>
            <li> I like to add a special shine to my hair with this stuff. I get lots of compliments on my hair but I don&#x27;t give away my secret. Sorry! Not an ad for the product, but then everyone would have pretty hair like mine!</li>
            <li> John Frieda Brilliante Brunette is actually a good product. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but it was worth a shot to find something to keep my grays covered. So tired of having to color every two weeks because the grays keep showing through. This product is like a color rinse that you use in the shower after a shampoo. I follow it with my conditioner. It&#x27;s a little messy because it actually does deposit color onto your hair so be careful to rinse out the shower well when you&#x27;done. The grays take on a lighter brown hue that actually look like highlights.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff.  have very light brown hair that is greying.  This tones down any brass, adds a touch of color and blends out greys.  Very satisfied with product</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about. Actually dries my hair a little. Not too much shine either.</li>
            <li> I use this to cover up my grey hair.  It is easy to apply, takes 3 minutes in the shower.  Color intensifies with each shampoo.  Makes  my salt and pepper gray/brown hair look brown with blond highlights.  I get a lot of compliments on my hair.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  Easy to use and gives me a highlighted look instead of going grey!</li>
            <li> A great product for me, I have used it for years! I would recommend it to anyone who wants to boost their hair color.</li>
            <li> Why would they discontinue this! I bought several- This really controls the red tint in my hair that happens after a week of a professional color. This makes your hair SO soft and the color looks professional.</li>
            <li> I love tis stuff &amp; have purchased it for many years. It makes my hair look great by turning my 50% gray hair to blond highlights &amp; the brown is just warmed up. I have not had to color my hair for years since I started Using this brunette glaze.  I always hated the way my hair took home hair dye or even non permanent color. It came out flat &amp; dull. SO HAPPY TO SEE THIS IS BACK &amp; AT A REASONABLE PRICE AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> I was tired of dying my hair - always having to have the roots touched up.  After having all the dyed color cut off with a snazzy cut, I didn&#x27;t like the &#x27;coldness&#x27; of my natural color.  I tried John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Liquid Shine... Glaze and everybody wanted to know how much I paid for those high-lights!  I love the warm tones it gives my hair and no more &#x27;roots&#x27; to deal with.  I&#x27;ve been using this for &#x27;color&#x27; for several years now and my hair is mostly light brown with lighter high - lights with this product.  I feel it is much healthier for my hair than dying it.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses a glaze to lift the color, and this product works like the professional products with less cost.</li>
            <li> Messy&lt;br /&gt;Stains towels&lt;br /&gt;More ends up on shower floor getting it from hand, to getting it to your head.  Slippery.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle design sucks&lt;br /&gt;Wont buy again</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in my town and keeps me from having to color all my hair.  brightens my dark hair and calms down the grey. : )  Very pleased - I used it years ago but then was unable to find it until now.  Love it.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, the first time, I wasn&#x27;t quite thinking correctly. I had had medium brown hair with red high lights - all natural - I guess you could call it auburn. I&#x27;d been in an auto accident and the stress to my system turned my hair white (gray?). It didn&#x27;t look healthy either. It wasn&#x27;t shiny and it didn&#x27;t look good on a young - relatively young, girl. I was 28 years old when it happened. When, I finally thought I&#x27;d do something about it, I looked for a &amp;#34;glaze&amp;#34; just to help with the shine. Just to help it look healthier. I wasn&#x27;t concerned about color. I did hair for 10 years, before my auto accident. I didn&#x27;t want to go through hair coloring every few weeks. Not only was it a pain but, also, it was expensive. I wasn&#x27;t thinking, AS I SAID, and should have bought the &amp;#34;CLEAR GLAZE&amp;#34;, John Frieda had available. But, NO, I screwed up and bought &amp;#34;Brilliant BRUNETTE Colour Glaze&amp;#34;. Truly forgetting I&#x27;m no longer BROWN HAIRED. I used it in the shower, after shampooing and conditioning, per the instructions. When I rinsed my hair out I had brown hair with all the red high lights … exactly as I had before I&#x27;d gone white !!! I swear to God !  At first I was elated !  My lord ! It looked like it always did, I couldn&#x27;t believe it ! Then, I thought &amp;#34;Oh, crap. I forgot…I should have bought &amp;#34;CLEAR&amp;#34; ! It didn&#x27;t wash out or wear away, either. And, for being so easy to use, just blob it on in the shower with no mirror, it came out perfect. Well, alright, I would follow the standard &amp;#34;T-Part&amp;#34; that hair stylists use but, still, it was a complete piece of cake. It was, also, relatively cheap enough buying it through AMAZON SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE. Which was good because now I was screwed - I had to keep up with it - every few weeks (my hair is very long, just pass my butt. But, I&#x27;M SO GLAD I SCREWED UP !!! I GOT MY OLD &amp;#34;SELF&amp;#34; BACK and really in more ways than just hair color. It did wonders for my ego, too. Didn&#x27;t look so old …Didn&#x27;t feel so old … Didn&#x27;t act so old. I&#x27;ve turned several people on to it over the years. They&#x27;ve all been very happy. It doesn&#x27;t just do a &amp;#34;blanket&amp;#34;, uniform cover-up. It has all the highs and lows and subtle changes in shade that any natural hair color has. You can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s not natural. Every time I&#x27;m complimented on my &amp;#34;stunning&amp;#34; hair color, I offer up that it&#x27;s my normal color but, it&#x27;s not natural color - that it comes from a bottle (and I tell them WHY) they are always stunned. Jaw literally falling open - they&#x27;d never guessed it wasn&#x27;t natural. And wouldn&#x27;t believe me, if it wasn&#x27;t for someone else I would be with, confirming it for me. Y U P …  AMAZING! FANTASTIC! WONDERFUL!   THE BEST MISTAKE I&#x27;VE EVER MADE !!!</li>
            <li> Blends gray, makes my hair shine ... what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and gives your hair a nice shine and softness. The color is subtle and if your hair gets too dark, you can just skip using it a couple days a week.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve used it for years. I&#x27;m starting to gray, but I&#x27;m not ready to start dying  my hair. This product does the trick! As a bonus it makes my hair feel soft. They stopped selling it locally.  I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Update- I recently decided to try a different product also from John Frieda - \\&quot;John Frieda Precision Foam Hair Color, Glosser Cool Brunette\\&quot;. It smells so much nicer and made me hair a lot silkier. It also covered the few grays a bit but I suspect with more use (every week) they will disappear from sight a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives me a nice shiny color and covers the few grays I have... what I don&#x27;t like is the lingering smell on my hair. I also don&#x27;t recommend using it very often as I feel it does dry up your hair. I read a few people complain about it being a mess in the tub but I found that washing off any product from the tub and hands immediately did the trick.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff..... I get lots of compliments on my hair color/highlights.  Just the right touch of color to the grey</li>
            <li> I used to get my hair colored at a salon every 6 weeks at a cost approaching $100.  9 months ago I started using John Frieda&#x27;s Brunette Color Glaze and have not had a salon color since.  I love the product, I use it every time I shampoo.  It covers my increasingly gray hair, it leaves my hair soft and shiny.  And it saves me about $75 every 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The product helps me wait longer between coloring my hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color on the hair. Ships reliably and packed well. Good price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair.  I put a conditioner on my hair, work it in really good.  Then I use this shine stuff and leave it on for 5 minutes to 20 minutes then wash it out and recondition my hair.  My hair is so healthy looking and shiny.  I get non stop compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not color my hair anymore.  I use this stuff every time I clean my hair and it covers all my grey roots perfectly.  I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:I actually don&#x27;t use this as directed. I have my own way of doing it. I do not use shampoo on my hair. Every few days I take baking soda, mix it with water and let it run through my hair and massage my scalp. On a daily basis I use ORS replenishing conditioner on my hair first. Sometimes I leave it on all night and sometimes I just put it on for 15 minutes. I then rinse this stuff out of my hair and apply the John Frieda brilliant brunette to my hair focusing on the lighter spots or any grey areas. I then massage it down to my scalp. I sometimes leave the john frieda on for five minutes or sometimes an hour depending on how much time I have. I have very long hair past my waist so I don&#x27;t always take the product clear to the end of my hair. I do it every once in a while but I mostly focus on the top of my head. Then after the John Frieda sits on my hair I take my shower and rinse the John Frieda out of my hair and condition my hair with Nexxus Kerafix conditioner and rinse it out. I then put Argon oil on the very tips of the end of my hair which helps when I blow dry and curl it. I have been doing this routine for a few years and my hair is the healthiest it has ever been in my life.&lt;br /&gt;I also do some deep conditioners on my hair with olive oil a couple times a month and a mix with cayenne pepper in it to stimulate my roots which makes my hair grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never get split ends. My hair hardly ever falls out and it is very soft after I blow dry it. I get tons and tons of compliments on my hair. I buy 8 bottles of this John Frieda a month through the subscribe and save which saves me $3.00 a bottle instead of ordering it only when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The John Frieda will leave a slight brown stain on your head. My hair is so long that it doesn&#x27;t matter to me. The stain washes out when I use the baking soda or when I use the ORS replenishing conditioner. It is not permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been doing this routine I have not dyed my hair once since. I use to use the 28 day one that was not permanent. My little grey hairs get highlighted and it ads a really nice color to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions on the bottle say to shampoo your hair then condition your hair while your in the shower. After you rinse the conditioner you are suppose to wring out the water and then apply the John Frieda from the root to the ends and leave on for three minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  i get compliments on my hair all the time.  I am a brunette with about 30% gray hair.  This glaze covers my gray and leaves my hair looking shiny and healthy.  Although the color says brunette, with my brown and gray hair the color comes out to be more redish in the sunlight but brown in the indoor light which is interesting.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This keeps my dyed dark brown hair color looking fresh and shiny.  Wear gloves when you apply it......it will turn your hands brown. Love this so much I just ordered more of it and also ordered the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Use it in between color. Even use dabs straight on hair to cover gray. Easy to use</li>
            <li> it helped hide my grey (just a few strands around the temples), but I couldn&#x27;t handle smelling it all day. it smells like self tanner.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in order to cheaply hide a few grey hairs that have appeared recently, and it does work for that purpose. As others have noted, it doesn&#x27;t completely mask the grey, but rather makes grey hair appear blonde. The problem that I have, and the reason I probably won&#x27;t continue with this product, is that it makes my fine hair appear very oily and unwashed. I think people who are having success with this might have a different hair texture than mine - possibly thick or wavy/curly haired people can use this without the greasiness issue. I&#x27;m also disappointed that this product did not make my hair shiny at all - it actually looks much duller than before I used it. Finally, it kind of reeks. My hair stinks for days, even after a few washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just read that someone&#x27;s annoyed response to another review that complained the product didn&#x27;t work to cover grey. The respondent indicated that this is not a hair dye, and should not be expected to dye the hair. But, of course, it is. That&#x27;s how it works to &amp;#34;enhance&amp;#34; color or however you want to phrase it: by dying the hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  Does a good job of covering the roots.  Helps me stretch my colorings a week or two.  Only downfall is the fragrance.  Kind of smells like a tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> i am finding it harder each time i try to buy this at the local stores.  when i have this problem, i always turn to Amazon.com and voila!  in fact, this item came so fast i was shocked!  Now i know i will not waste my time or gas and order first here.  good job!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have a lot of gray in the front and this color glaze hides it well. However, I don&#x27;t use it the way it suggests on the bottle. I put it in my dry hair about ten minutes or so before I wash my hair. It works just as well that way and I can see where I need to put it most.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair more shining and straight! I LOVE John Frieda products and this is not the exception!&lt;br /&gt;I use this product one time per week and its effects lasts for a whole week!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and there is a reason why. I have thin hair and do not like to color it because of the damage it causes. This gives my brunette hair a nice depth of dark color, makes it shinny, and coats it to make it feel thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this make sure you squeeze out all the water you possibly can. Have a clip ready to put your hair up because the color will stain your neck and back. That is some of the best advice I can give is put it in and clip it up. You will see what I am talking about when you put it in your hand and it will leave a stain. Don&#x27;t worry because it washes off nicely, you may need to scrub a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure you leave it in for at least 3 mins or the color will wash out. I did this one day when I thought &amp;#34;eh, it doesn&#x27;t need to stay in that long&amp;#34;, and I saw brown water coming from my hair. If you leave it on for at least 3 mins, and you rinse the water it clear because the color is on your head.</li>
            <li> I do have color treated hair but this makes my roots a funny orange/brassy tone...plus, you have to use a lot in order for it to cover all of your hair. Blech!</li>
            <li> Helps stretch the time between salon coloring visits to cover the dull/grayish color @ the roots. Freshens things up, adds just a touch of color and shine.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have dyed brown hair and use this at most once per week, so needless to say due to my own fault I haven&#x27;t noticed any color change.  But the gloss itself, after using, leaves my hair so silky and shiny.  I&#x27;m not sure why other reviewers have felt that it dried out their hair... I have very damaged hair, and after using this I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner.  Split ends disappear, my hair is bouncy and full but sleek, shiny and SUPER soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve looked for years for the perfect combo to transform my coarse, thick, frizzy mixed race hair, and this will definitely stay in my arsenal.</li>
            <li> In middle age my hair was losing its luster--not yet gray, but getting mousey. I have been using the glaze for at least a year and am extremely pleased. I followed another reviewer&#x27;s recommendation to use the product every time I wash my hair. My hair is now back to its original color. I recommended that a friend with light brown hair try it. She used the glaze for blonds and looks fabulous! Great product!</li>
            <li> I was actually surprise that this product did work for me.  My hair gets really bleached out because I spend quite a bit of time outdoors and I dislike hats, so this product was recommend to me.  But it has kept my colored brown hair brown and not bleach out for the past 3 1/2 weeks.  The only thing I&#x27;m not too sure of, is my scalp seems to itch for a couple of days afterwards, so I have cut down the times I use it.</li>
            <li> am a 63 year old women, who has the unfortunate luck of being alergic to hair coloring.  Thank God that I found this product.  I have been using it for about 2.5 years now and it actually leaves color in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I haven&#x27;t been able to find this product in the stores around me.  They seem to have stopped putting it on the shelves.  I don&#x27;t know if they discontinued it or not.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product, without it I would be completely white.</li>
            <li> This was my first time experimenting with color, as an African American Woman who relaxes her hair, I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t further damage my mousy locks. This color glaze did everything that it said it would do, gave me a boost of color, while leaving my hair silky and shiny. It did have a very particular smell, but I didn&#x27;t dislike it. The consistency was a pro as well. Made it easy to work into the hair. This glaze didn&#x27;t ever last very long though, which is probably why it is not very damaging. I would buy again if the colors were expanded.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use between colors. I have a white stripe and the glaze gives it a tint of color until I can get back to the salon. Not full coverage, but it&#x27;s pretty good for hair that&#x27;s so resistant to dye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color glaze since it first came out. I have a little gray hair, mostly in my bangs. I use this once or twice a week, and it blends my gray hair into a light brown, so it looks like I have highlights. The best part is that I don&#x27;t have any lines of demarcation. I&#x27;ll use this until I have too much gray hair for this to be a feasible solution. I&#x27;m so glad I can get this on Amazon, since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I have dirty blonde hair that can look more blonde or brunette depending on the season or amount of sunlight hitting it. This product, in the dark/espresso version, is just enough of a hit that my hair looks brunette consistently. The product says to use it on a regular basis, or 2-3/wk but I only use it once or maybe twice a week. If your hair were lighter or darker than mine I would bet you&#x27;d have to use it more often to get the same results, but since my hair is already borderline I don&#x27;t have to do as much.     There&#x27;s a lot in one bottle so it should last you a couple of months, even if you are using it more than once a week. It also only takes me a couple dollops (quarter-sized amounts) for each use (one for the roots, one for the ends) to spread it evenly, and my hair is a quarter ways down my back.     The color change is immediately noticeable for me, but like I said, my color is borderline already. It just needs an extra hit.    It will leave that \\&quot;just been dyed\\&quot; odor on your hair, but it is not the worst of the dye smells out there. You can tell it&#x27;s from dye, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant or overpowering and it goes away after one wash.    Dye will leave a residue on your hands at first, but as you rinse out your hair it will wash off. Will not leave marks on sink or bathtub. Same goes for skin surrounding hairline.    And I try to leave it in for at least the recommended amount of time (3+ minutes). This isn&#x27;t difficult if you&#x27;re showering at the same time. Just shampoo/condition, put it in, then do everything else in a shower (wash, shave, rinse face, whatever) and 3+ minutes will have gone by for sure.     I also get lots of compliments on shine after I first use this product, and I have to say I noticed it too. It definitely gives off the shine of a salon dye! I also get compliments on the color as well, so it mustn&#x27;t just be me who notices something!    I will definitely keep buying this product as long as it&#x27;s available. It&#x27;s far cheaper than going to the salon, and pretty much foolproof as well!</li>
            <li> There is no other product on the market that I know of to help keep your color for a longer period of time between colorings. Just be sure to wash your hands right away after applying.</li>
            <li> I dab 1 - 2 teaspoons along my temples after I towel dry my hair then brush it in thoroughly.  I don&#x27;t rinse it out.  No mess.  The color is varied, so the brown colors are shiny and the grays are platinum-ish and light.  This product is for people who prefer subtle healthy looking hair.  It&#x27;s also less fuss, time and money than a dye-job.  No skunk stripes ever.</li>
            <li> I am reasonably gray under the pretty honey blonde my hairdresser conjers once every 8 weeks. Once a week, in between, I put this product on my roots at my part and along my hairline. I leave in for 3-5 minutes and voila, no roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product lets me go eight weeks between coloring, for pennies. Gotta love it!</li>
            <li> Great product for slightly graying brunette hair.... diminishes the gray without having to color my hair!</li>
            <li> Normally I love John Frieda but this product is the worst. I have used this a few times and have seen no difference in shine or color. It is runny which makes it drip everywhere. The instructions also say to wash hands after applying, no matter how quick you apply your hands wind up stained a little. It looks like you palms got a tan. I also was unfortunate enough to get some on my ear and it was also brown no matter how I tried to scrub. It stayed that way for over a week and it was very obvious. Just as a mention I have also tried the clear glaze and it only gets slightly better results. I will not buy any more glaze products from this company. It&#x27;s not worth the money and I paid $10 for this at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Finally ordered this after reading raving reviews; got this package in the mail that wasn&#x27;t even a box; a sloppy envelope with no protective packaging. Box for the glaze itself was very bashed in, it looks like it was in worse shape than the packaging.  I still open it up and get to the glaze itself and it just seems like it was not that full and there was glaze all over the top, you know, kind of like on something after you use it a few times, especially a liquid type product.  Very disappointed about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself, I have been using it as directed.  Love how it makes my hair feel but it weighs my fine hair down.  Don&#x27;t know if I see a color change or really a difference in the look.  I don&#x27;t have time to use this in the shower everyday.  Very messy, stains hands; had to wash them with shampoo to get the stain off even within seconds.  The smell is pretty awful in my opinion.  Would not buy again, and absolutely NOT from this seller.  Is it so much to ask to use a box?</li>
            <li> This works really well for me. I don&#x27;t have a lot of gray hair just a few around my hairline in the front and this works great to cover them up. I don&#x27;t want to dye my hair until I absolutely have.</li>
            <li> Nice color and left a good feel to hair. Smells good.</li>
            <li> Another thing I can never find in stores, anymore. It makes my hair a little dry, but whenever i use it everyone tells me how nice my hair looks. Shiny and brighter. It adds color, so if you don&#x27;t feel like dying your hair but want a change, this is nice. I got highlights that were way too blond and was able to dim them down with this. Just leave it in for a few minutes after shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I do like the improved richness of color when I use this.</li>
            <li> Good product...good price....excellent service</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference when using this product. I used it every time washing my hair as noted in the instructions, but my hair remained the same color and texture. My hair did not feel greasy or anything after using it - I actually found it easier to comb out my hair after showering, but I did not purchase this to act as a detangler. After my hair dried, you would never had known I used this product. I have used John Frieda glazes in the past, and they left my hair looking and feeling smoother and shinier right away. I thought this product would be the same, but I think the formula has changed because it just did not do anything for me, even after using the entire bottle following the instructions exactly. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does stain the hands when applying the product, but it disappears very quickly with a little soap.</li>
            <li> This is just an all around amazing product. Glazing at my salon is $40 and it just doesn&#x27;t last all the way between appointments. This product is so amazing I&#x27;ve stopped the salon treatments all together. My hair is shiny and vibrant and amazing every day.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and does seem to work for making your color last a little longer, but it stained my hands and face so easily.  I didn&#x27;t want to have to put on gloves or make a big production out of everything everytime I wanted to use it so pretty much just stopped.  Not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time and it worked great.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better it works with time.  I had totally messed up my color by using a permanent hair color (in light brown) that was supposed to fight brassiness.  It didn&#x27;t.  I wound up with really bright hair.  My natural color is medium ash brown.  Anyway, I called the \\&quot;hotline\\&quot; for the product and was told to try a darker permanent color over it.  It worked for about a week, but rinsed out to more brassiness.  I tried violet shampoos and conditioners, but those didn&#x27;t work well either and made my hair really dry.  This was easy to use.  I like that you have to rinse your hair after applying because some other stuff I tried (Fancifull, I think) you don&#x27;t rinse and it didn&#x27;t do as good a job as this one.  The real test is my bathroom mirror, which is where my hair looks the brightest.  It made a big difference and really toned down the brassiness and left my hair soft, even though I didn&#x27;t use conditioner.  Like I said, I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens the next time I use it.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product does work. It made my hair darker quickly. It was a nice, natural color as well. Still, the dye has a very strong and bad smell, leaving my hair to also smell bad during the day. The product also made my hair feel gross and dry. With these downsides, it isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product. My hair felt dry and was difficult to style. It also rubbed off on my towels.</li>
            <li> Did not impress me at all.  Messy and ineffective on my hair.  Didn&#x27;t finish the bottle and I&#x27;m always reluctant to apply it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover the up the grey hairs that are beginning to show up. I used it as directed and I found it be somewhat effective in masking my greys, but not quite what I wanted, so I decided to experiment. Now, I apply it on *dry* hair before I shower and leave it on for about 5 minutes (yes, it does stain, so be careful with surfaces in your bathroom, but a Magic Eraser will get it out of most; I wash my hands after applying it and any stubborns stains on my hands and stains elsewhere on my skin come out in the shower with a loofah). Then, I hop in the shower, rinse it out, and condition my hair as usual. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day (curly hair; frequent washing dries it out), so I apply the glaze on days when I won&#x27;t be washing my hair. I do it about once or twice a week and you can&#x27;t see my grey hairs at all now (it only took a couple of applications with this method for that to happen).</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I use this to stretch my time between visits to the salon. It will help cover the grays at my roots and give me an extra week or so before needing to go to the salon. Plus it makes my hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> The first year I used this color glaze to grow out my hair color roots and multiple-shades of bad hair color. The roots disappeared within a few months of using this, easily. Then I just needed to grow out the damage from hair color which took another year. I had to stop using regular hair color because it was ruining my hair and causing hair loss. I am 48 years old. I used hair color from the ages of 20 to 46! The last few years of coloring my hair, hair color wouldn&#x27;t take correctly and my hair looked awful. Immediately after using John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Color Glaze my hair color started looking more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I used this about once every two weeks. After the first year my usage then went to once a month. I now only use this about once every three months to touch up the new gray to look more blonde. As I grew out the old ugly hair color, my hair went from damaged to amazing. I now have shiny healthy soft hair with amazing blonde highlights. I look like I have my hair done by expensive professionals. I get stopped and complimented on my hair now. I wish I knew about this amazing product years ago. I hated having to use hair color ever two weeks taking upwards of an hour at a time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If in the future I want to go completely gray and stop using this, it is not a problem, as what it highlights blends in with the gray just fine. I just get a kick out of having blonde highlights, who wouldn&#x27;t? These highlights look so natural! It is amazing. I did not realize how dark I was coloring my hair all of those years. My natural color is so much lighter. I guess after coloring for 26 years, I forgot what my natural hair color was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for how to use this:  wet hair thoroughly in the shower, ring it out, apply the glaze mostly to the hairline and where you part your hair. Leave it in for about two minutes, rinse, THEN shampoo and condition. Shampooing after helps to keep any color off of the scalp. It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the color boost or shine doing it this way. Yes, it can stain your hands if you leave it on your hands. After applying it to your hair, use soap, rubbing your hands together and it easily comes off. No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review helps others who want to stop using permanent hair color and grow out their roots! Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/12/2016 Update:&lt;br /&gt;Holy cow! This is finally back on Amazon. It was discontinued, and hard to find. It had gone up to $60 or more a bottle on ebay. Now it is back on Amazon? I think this made my year. I was trying to make one bottle last me this last year. I like how it gives my gray gold highlights and I missed that! Now I can use it again. I am so happy. Thank you to whomever brought this wonderful product back. Oh yeah, I bought three bottles last week and I just can&#x27;t believe they are the real thing. They are, if anyone was wondering.his way. Yes, it can stain your hands if you leave it on your hands. After applying it to your hair, use soap, rubbing your hands together and it easily comes off.

            <li> Enjoying the Joyhn Frieda beauty product.  I never knew these things existed and am so glad to be able to find Frieda products at this site.</li>
            <li> It might color the hair a little bit, but it leaves them very dry. You definetely need some leave-in conditioner after this product. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times, then just colored my hair permanently, since it is too much hassle and overall the hair do not look terrific after it.</li>
            <li> It does leave a nice color and shine, but be sure to condition hair&lt;br /&gt;thoroughly before using it, otherwise your hair will feel like a dry broom!~</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and am very pleased with the outcome.  However, it seems that the only liquid shine available is clear.  This truly disappoints me, since it was the temporary color that I sought.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I have used it for years. It is a glossing treatment that you apply at home, with colour in it. As it builds the colour and sheen gets richer, but it is not flat like hair dye. It leaves hair feeling thicker and conditioned. It hasn&#x27;t been available where I live for years, so I am delighted to find on Amazon.com! A must buy!</li>
            <li> This product has not added a &amp;#34;hint of glossy brown color&amp;#34; to my hair - it has however, stained my fingernails brown.  I do follow the instructions and wash my hands after applying, but that hasn&#x27;t prevented nail discoloration.  This product does seem to make me hair feel softer.  It hasn&#x27;t done anything to my hair color despite multiple applications.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Covers my gray with a light brown  color that blends well with my natural medium brown color.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I use a rinse/temporary color vs. permanent color and the glaze is a lifesaver for me. I have approx. 3 weeks between the time the grey starts showing &amp; when it&#x27;s time to reapply. It&#x27;s also easy to use and adds great shine.&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m in the shower, after the shampoo, and while the conditioner is doing it&#x27;s job, apply a generous amount to the needed areas (hairline mostly), &amp; let it do its job for 3-5 minutes then just rinse as normal. Some say you need to wear gloves when applying because it will stain your hands, but I just wash mine immediately &amp; problem solved. If you get some on your face use a freshner or alcohol on a cotton pad to remove the stain.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps your hair color looking fresh &amp; also adds shine! I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best kept secret to color hair with a natural effect. Love it.</li>
            <li> Not a very good glaze.  I have definitely had better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It adds shine and extends time between coloring my hair!</li>
            <li> This Glaze works a miracle.  Leaves just enough color to prolong hair color.&lt;br /&gt;I would use this even if I didn&#x27;t color just for the highlights and sparkle&lt;br /&gt;Use every time you shampoo or wet hair in shower and just put some in between shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is more manageable, Glaze is soft but like glass, Just a hint of color to hide roots&lt;br /&gt;and give beautiful highlights.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough and use All the time.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Smells good, hair feels smooth and tints my gray to a soft golden brown that blends well.</li>
            <li> Just tried this John Frieda Glaze and I have to say that this is a great product at a great price.  After my first use, my hair was super soft and managable and very shiny.  It&#x27;s a great way to keep your hair color looking bright, takes away that brassiness you sometimes get.  You do have to be careful to wash it off your shower/sink right away if some splatters as it will stain like regular hair dye.  I&#x27;m hooked on this and will purchase again and again.  Love it!  :o)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair look horrible or anything which is why Im giving it 2 instead of one and it&#x27;s cheap but .... It didn&#x27;t make it shinier or \\&quot;richer\\&quot; color. In fact I have brown hair with a good deal of red in it and I got this hoping to darken up my hair and even out red tones. It made my hair seem MORE red and even a bit lighter. My friend even commented it looked more red. It smells gross too.</li>
            <li> This stuff was super runny which made it really difficult to try to apply it on my hair. It ended up getting everywhere. I saw no real difference in either my hair color or shine after multiple uses so this product was a complete waste for me. I would also like to add that it smells terrible! I noticed another commenter stated that it made their hair more red, and I had the same issue, as well. I naturally have red undertones, and dye my hair with ash colors to counteract the red. If you have similar hair, you may want to avoid this since it seems to bring out the red.</li>
            <li> I used this product several years ago and loved it but could no longer find it in the store.  I have some gray hair but I don&#x27;t want to get into the habit of dying it.  This product is great to add just a little bit of color to the grays and really brings depth to my dark brown hair color.</li>
            <li> It came half empty. This is absolutely ridiculous. I bought it from Amazon Prime, not even a different buyer, otherwise that would have been a little bit more understandable.</li>
            <li> My favorite way to tint grey hair just a bit without any roots to worry about.  Will stain your hands (temporarily) so wear plastic gloves and you&#x27;ll be set.</li>
            <li> Added a nice shine, but did not do much color wise for my greys.</li>
            <li> For between coloring your hair. Good product.</li>
            <li> This product just flat out down&#x27;t work.  I have used it 5-6 times and have seen no difference.  I have brown hair with dark blond highlights and was hoping I could use this to help blend the highlights as my hair grows, but it really does nothing.  It will stain your hands if you don&#x27;t wash them with soap immediately after, but soap works fine and if you have any drips a q tip dipped in rubbing alcohol will take care of it.  It does make my hair softer, but I have fine hair as it is so I don&#x27;t need extra softness.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money, you&#x27;re better off buying a semi-permanent dye.</li>
            <li> I like this product line a lot, but this particular item did almost nothing for my hair (and did make a big mess in the tub). I didn&#x27;t notice any enhancement to the shine or color of my hair, but it did seem a little softer than usual.</li>
            <li> I have been using John Frieda&#x27;s Brilliant Brunette Liquid Shine Luminous Color Glaze for over a year and love it!&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use in the shower after shampooing and conditioning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have scattered gray strands of hair, and twice a week treatment will give me some highlights.&lt;br /&gt;It looks very natural, not like a dye.&lt;br /&gt;I am certainly glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li> I use a little around my hairline  and in my part every other shampoo so I don&#x27;t need any harsh dyes to cover my grays. It looks much more natural than a dye because there&#x27;s no outgrowth line.</li>
            <li> I usually have pretty nice hair.  I&#x27;m half-Japanese, so my hair is a dark brown yet behaves like silky Asian hair.  Normally this sounds great, considering my American friends are always straightening their hair like crazy to tame it, while mine stays flat.  The bad thing is, my hair lacks volume, dimension, and texture.  It&#x27;s super smooth, lays flat, and doesn&#x27;t want to do anything else.  Curling my hair is a pain, as is getting the roots to fluff up.  I usually wake up looking like someone dumped water on my hair and it dried that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I figured the best thing I could do is go with what I had and work it.  I&#x27;m getting ready for a trip to California and I want my hair glossy and sleek - ready to combat the dry, sun-drenched and salty air.  So I bought this on Amazon and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the instructions (which were missing from the box, by the way), you shampoo and condition your hair like normal.  Then squeeze out as much water as you can and apply the gloss.  It&#x27;s the consistency of shampoo, but opaque dark brown with golden sparkles in it.  You&#x27;re supposed to slather this all over your hair from roots to tips.  Problem is, dry hair doesn&#x27;t allow product to spread very well.  Especially with long, mid-back length hair.  I ended up using quite a bit of product (about 2 good squeezes, maybe 1/12 of the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately my hands stained, and I freaked out when it didn&#x27;t come off.  I rubbed the product all over my hair and put it up in a clip.  Then (I was thinking ahead here!), I put on a shower cap so the brown product wouldn&#x27;t drip down my back and leave a drip stain.  Then I finished up my shower, shaved, and came back to my hair.  This time, I flipped my hair upside down to wash out the gloss.  No way I was letting it wash down my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lightly towel dried it, but some still rubbed off on my white towels.  It wasn&#x27;t until I used the hairdryer that I noticed the gloss was working.  My hair didn&#x27;t tangle or frizz up.  It looked a bit shinier and was really smooth to the touch.  It also gave my hair volume, which was nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it didn&#x27;t do was emphasize the brunette or dimensions of my hair.  The added shine was probably...I&#x27;d say...my hair was about 25% shinier.  But it was much softer and fluffier than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- actually gives your hair some shine&lt;br /&gt;- lays your wild hairs flat and smooth&lt;br /&gt;- adds volume!  yaaaaaayyyy!!!&lt;br /&gt;- detangles instantly&lt;br /&gt;- smells nice (mild coconut-ish?)&lt;br /&gt;- gives roots some lift&lt;br /&gt;- not terribly expensive&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t stain your bathtub&lt;br /&gt;- easy to use (3-5 minutes in the shower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- if you have longer than shoulder-length hair, you use a lot&lt;br /&gt;- stains your hands a tiny bit (scrub like a mad person to remove)&lt;br /&gt;- stains your white bath towels a bit (bleach like crazy to remove)&lt;br /&gt;- a bit pricey considering you&#x27;re supposed to use it daily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy this again, but I&#x27;m docking it a star because for a daily use product, this stuff is expensive.  I might get 10-12 uses out of it.  Considering I wash my hair daily (again, oily Japanese hair), this would break the bank.  The more you use it, the more shine it adds.  But I&#x27;ll save this for a weekly routine to revitalize my hair.  The shine really isn&#x27;t that noticeable.  If your hair looked awful before (from dying, or sun damage, or saltwater damage), then this might be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take good care of your hair, and you have a deep brunette color like me, this isn&#x27;t going to create miracles.  I like the volume, so I&#x27;ll use it when I go on dates with my boyfriend or special occasions.  But certainly not a daily use item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the John Frieda Shine Shock Gloss from Amazon.  You might want to check out that review to see what Gloss vs. Glaze is.  I got two very different results.[[ASIN:B000GCZZZC John Frieda BrilliantBrunette Shine Shock Glosser - 2.4 oz]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using this glaze does give me more body but that&#x27;s about all.  I do find it difficult to massage into my hair after first washing my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried with gloves and without gloves.  As long as you wash your hands immediately, don&#x27;t find a need for gloves.&lt;br /&gt;Having your roots show is just a fact of your hair growing out and nothing can really be done besides a permanent color (took me years and years to figure all the hype for products to hide your grow out doesn&#x27;t work besides hair color).  Doubt if I&#x27;ll ever buy again,&lt;br /&gt;not because of the product, but because it just does nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Great Product - Thank you John Frieda -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very simple to use - shampoo and condition as you would - ring out hair and apply root to tip - I have very long hair and usually end up using about 3 - 4 tablespoons (and use 1x per week, and shampoo 2x per week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying, I pin my hair up and finish my shower. Leave on 3 mins (but I usually leave on about 8 - 10) and rinse hair thoroughly before exiting shower.  I have not noticed any staining around the face or neck areas... but after I rinse product out, I do a quick re-wash of face and neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply product with my hands; it does stain but wash off immediately after with soap- and use a soft nail brush and it will come right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This glaze is great - gives your hair bit of a shine like a healthy booster.  I do not have many grays, but the ones I do have appear more covered -  this glaze is not a hair dye but does a tiny bit of sneaky coverings... Product is very economical and a nice treat for a quick in-home salon look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have had numerous complements on &amp;#34;my hair color&amp;#34; after using... so it gives a tinted appearance a tiny bit but, honestly think its more of a healthy shine, giving a multi-dimensional / highlighted look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine long (flat - blah) hair - Some products I have used do my hair oily or even more life-less.  I can use this glazing with no issues - I find it to be not oily or heavy.  It does have a distinct scent - but not offensive.</li>
            <li> Used this for touch up to even out color.  Worked very well.  Only takes a few minutes.  Good price for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I towel dried my hair then applied mostly to my gray roots which now are an inch or two - intention is to go gray.  But my gray hair is so shockingly gray I need to tone it down.  I used an old applicator from when I used to color my hair to apply this Brilliant Brunette mainly to roots.  Then instead of leaving on only 3 minutes I left on 30 minutes.  Then rinsed and towel dried my hair again.  Viola -. gray less  noticeable- not that shocking as the gray grows out.  I will use this product to grow out my gray.</li>
            <li> I love this John Frieda color glaze! My natural hair color is now predominantly silver.  For years, I used different brands of permanent hair coloring to cover the gray, but I hated how my hair would look purple or orangish right after coloring, and after a few weeks the roots would start showing. It was also messy and time-consuming to color my hair at home. Then I discovered this color glaze.  I use it two to three times a week in the shower, and my hair always appears to be a light shade of brown with lots of natural-looking variations of tone. As long as I continue applying it regularly, the roots never show. The only gray that resists coloring is a few strands at the temples and in front of my ears, but even that adds to the natural appearance.  It is very easy to use.  You just rub some through your hair after shampooing, leave it on a couple of minutes, and rinse.  No muss, no fuss!  You do have to wash your hands right away or they will be stained, but that is all.  The shower doesn&#x27;t seem to stain, and towel-drying doesn&#x27;t ruin the towels.  Another reviewer complained that their hair felt greasy after using it, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem. I have very fine hair, so I don&#x27;t know if someone with a different hair texture would get the same excellent results.  The bottle says that it will not cover gray, but for me, it definitely does.  I would be so upset if John Frieda quit making this product!</li>
            <li> It stains and honestly my hair is much shiner without it.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week after coloring to help keep the shine.  I love it.  I also have JF Gloss for brunettes.  I honestly don&#x27;t know the difference.  Both give the same result.</li>
            <li> I did not read the instructions when I used it the first time and I used it as the non color glaze, that instructs you to apply for 20 minutes&lt;br /&gt;before shampooing, and I did that, and it worked great.  it adds a bright shine with some color.  I have not used in other ways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times, exactly according to directions, and have yet to see any effect on my hair.  I definitely can see the residue on my hands after use, I just can&#x27;t see any difference on my hair.</li>
            <li> GOOD  makes my hair look better  and covers gray hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this off and on for a few years. It does what it says its going to do... just wash your hands well, as it can stain.</li>
            <li> I color my brunette hair on a regular basis.  I use this product between colorings to keep the color rich looking and it really does work.  My hairdresser has even noticed the difference in my hair.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I am allergic to all types of dyes and rinses and most every other product on the market to color my hair.  This product is fantastic.  It covers all the gray and makes my hair look beautiful.</li>
            <li> Works well with the system. Dries my hair out if I don&#x27;t follow it up with a leave-in conditioner. Good but not great.</li>
            <li> I used this product and expected it to do something for my hair.  It did not.  I am really disappointed for my wasted of money.</li>
            <li> This does help to extend hair coloring applications.  Remember this is not a permanent hair color.  It is a very temporary color glaze that lasts until the next shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to run when it rains and looks natural.  Very gray resistant hair may not absorb any color.</li>
            <li> This is an affordable hair product and if you want to make your hair real shiny then you gotta use it. It makes your hair feel good, and also makes your hair a little softer. Before I used the product I read some reviews online about it and I agree with some of the people who have said that they felt their hair became oilier after using it. I have found out the best way of using this hair glaze is by not massaging or rubbing it onto your skin. Just touch it to your hair and that&#x27;s it. However the drawback to this method is you will still have to use a separate product to wash your scalp. So first you wash your scalp with some separate shampoo and then you use this hair glaze.</li>
            <li> This product does not really do much of anything.  I used it for a while and saw no discernible difference in grey hair coverage.  NOT WORTH THE CASH.</li>
            <li> Always makes hair look nice and shiney</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my hair color almost daily. The Brilliant Brunette Glaze allows for time between visits to the salon. The color is deep and rich mahogany brown and the shine is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product. I&#x27;ve been using this color glaze for about 5 years now. It keeps my hair color from fading and I could go longer between hair dyes.</li>
            <li> I have brown hair that has bleached out over the summer. This product does a great job of restoring color and shine! I have been using it about every other day, just love the way it  makes my hair look and feel! Recommend highly!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s amazing! It gives my hair great color and gloss and even creates nice highlights so the color looks so real and natural. I use it three times a week to keep the best color, so a bottle lasts about three weeks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my hair.  No improvement in color and it did not make my hair soft.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Hair looks healthier, shinier and even feels thicker.  I am now addicted to this product.  (Follow instructions and wash your hands.)</li>
            <li> In between colorings, this keeps the color and shine for just awhile more!  Wish I had heard of this YEARS ago!</li>
            <li> I have thick dark brown hair. It&#x27;s almost black at the roots, which mean my whites come in like silver glitter. I&#x27;ve been using this product mostly to keep the brassiness out of my highlights (soft caramel brown - lowlights really) and  to help blend those whites in a little better so I can go longer between coloring/touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works SO much better than I expected. Not only are the highlighted strands staying just right, it seems to leave just a touch of gold on my whites and helps with the blending. Not much color change mind you, but the whites don&#x27;t &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; so much where my hair parts and the darker roots coming in are less noticeable now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people have complained about the glaze consistency and the skin staining, but I don&#x27;t seem to have a problem with the process at all. I just use it in the shower - shampoo, condition, rinse, squeeze excess water out, put a dollop of glaze on my palm and then rub into the crown of my head first (mostly around where I part my hair) and then kind of massage it into the rest of my hair. My hair is about shoulder length. While waiting I use a little exfoliating scrub soap on my hands and hairline, finish body washing, shaving and whatnot, then rinse. After 3 min or so of being in my hair, it pretty much rinses clean. I&#x27;ve tried this in a white bathtub too and very little color rinses out. My hair IS very porous. I have all over color done at least once every 6-8 weeks and lowlights every other coloring. I think this $9 bottle will let me stretch that timeline closer to 8-9 weeks. Win! I use the glaze about 3 times a week and I think I stretch the bottle out to last me a month at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the area where I use the glaze the most is shinier and has less volume so I find myself having to use styling product to get a bit more lift if I&#x27;m not going for the super shiny, straight, flat look.</li>
            <li> I have medium to light brown hair and I am starting to get stray grays.  I tried to use semi permanent hair color to cover the gray without changing my natural color but it lightened the top layers of my hair and made it a reddish tone.  I wanted something that would help to darken the lightened hair so it could blend while growing out.  This glaze worked well for that but it also blends away the gray! Lagniappe!  This is what I will use from now on as it also makes my hair feel silky and my husband says my hair smells nice:)</li>
            <li> I went back to my hair stylist. She asked if I had gone to someone else to color my hair. I hadn&#x27;t I just had used John Frieda Brilliant Brunette Liquid Shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been over 4 years. I no longer color my hair. I just use this after most times I wash my hair per week. Love it! Also creates shine &amp; gloss. And covers my gray!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years. The price was better on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product! I had used it for years but then stopped when it became no longer available to buy locally in stores. I discovered it on Amazon again, at a great price, and just tried it again this week. I now remember what I have been missing. It gives my brown hair a boost of color, shine, and softness, and makes my gray less noticeable. I have more brown than gray right now and am hoping I can make the transition to gray by only using this product and not ever having to use a permanent hair coloring. Time will tell! I have decided to put this on a subscription so that I am never without it again! I don&#x27;t understand how some can say that it does &amp;#34;nothing&amp;#34; for them. Maybe they were expecting too much? It&#x27;s a highlighter, an accenter, an enhancer, not a dramatic color changer. Try it once. You may love it too!</li>
            <li> Good for shine but I didn&#x27;t see a noticeable difference on my grays and won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the John Frieda brilliant brunette product line and use the shampoo, conditioner and the glaze.</li>
            <li> But it seems to make my hair shiny and pretty. This is my second purchase, so I must like it enough. It smells good.</li>
            <li> this product does make your hair super shiny, soft and it just feels great. I will agree with the reviewer who says it may leave your hair more oily than usual. I think maybe it&#x27;s best to concentrate this stuff on the length of your hair and make sure you don&#x27;t massage it into your scalp or roots of your hair. Even if you aren&#x27;t looking for color enhancement and you just want soft shiny hair this stuff is great for that. i even use a little and leave it in like a leave in conditioner on the ends of my hair and i can tell it protects during heat styling and makes my hair have zero frizz !</li>
            <li> Adds a couple of weeks between professional coloring.</li>
            <li> Make sure you apply it evenly!&lt;br /&gt;Smell is unpleasant!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I rarely have to dye my hair anymore. I&#x27;m 30% grey and this is great in between colorings. My hair stays shiny and feels thicker/stronger when I use this a few times a week (basically everytime I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month.  It doesn&#x27;t cover the gray but it does tone it down .  I think the smell of the product is fine, smells like lotion to me , plus it is only on my hair for three minutes every other day so I don&#x27;t consider it a problem.  I have not noticed any lingering scent when the hair is dry.  The product does stain your skin so it is important to wash the face and hands after you&#x27;ve applied it to the hair.  Hair texture seems the same with the product so no concerns on that front.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the results and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It works but if one day you forget to apply it, its gone.</li>
            <li> I could not get past the overwhelming coconut oil smell.</li>
            <li> this is  a great product...can only get on line....covers grey hairs, and beautiful shine....................I have some grey , not full head.......</li>
            <li> Great product - I have used this for years and it helps the color last longer and look more lustrous.  I can go 8 weeks+ before needing to color again.</li>
            <li> The John Frieda glaze adds just enough color to &amp;#34;going gray&amp;#34; hair to blend in the tones to avoid the stark light/dark contrast while adding a nice shine. Easy to use, also.</li>
            <li> While additional shine is obvious, the only color stain that is obvious is on the skin of my scalp and face.</li>
            <li> Love stuff! Covers all my greys!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I started using the brunette shine about 2 years ago. My professional color fades fairly quickly and I get a washed out look. I don&#x27;t want to go back to the salon before I need a cut and this product is a WONDERFUL solution and ever so easy. I&#x27;ve read reviews on weird color results, dryness, etc., but - for me - absolutely none of this has ever been true. I use it 2 to 3 times a week. Like I said, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This works great to refresh your color.</li>
            <li> Gloss? Yes. Color or gray coverage? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable shine to hair after several uses, but no appreciable color, or gray coverage, at crown, temples, part, or within the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has made my kinky, curly, full, thick and rough hair seem shinier, which is a bonus, but I think Id rather have had a shine or glossing product that didn&#x27;t deposit any color at all. Too messy! Gets everywhere, but doesn&#x27;t last. And, if you go to bed with even slightly damp hair, you might just wake up with a brown-colored pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No fun for me, since I do all the laundry.</li>
            <li> Yucky chemical crap storm</li>
            <li> Have used this glaze for years! It is great for extending the time between salon colorings! I have short hair and apply it every AM to areas where my roots show, using an old toothbrush. And I don&#x27;t rinse it off, contrary to the directions. If you follow the directions, it doesn&#x27;t do much for covering grays. (I wish they still carried the blonde shade. I would mix it with brown for a lighter shade of brown.)</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on the color and shine.  And I never have grow out between coloring jobs.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.... Made for folks like me who aren&#x27;t crazy about going to s salon...&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the shower every 2ndorthord time and it maintains my naturL gray in a darker blonde color.. Well done and my son says it takes years off my looks... I don&#x27;t care about it so much... But it is nice</li>
            <li> I love it it makes my hair look so good and I love the feel of my hair after I use it</li>
            <li> I purchased this glaze to help cover up a few grays between colorings and to give me some overall shine. I already use the John Frieda foam colour (currently using light ash brown) and found this glaze while looking for another batch of permanent color. I though it might extend the time between colorings just a bit. I found the consistency of the glaze a little difficult to apply in the shower. I often found it sliding off my wet/damp hair before I could get it rubbed in. Since I was interested in covering grays, I started at my scalp and would then rub and comb the product down to the ends of my shoulder-blade-length hair. As mentioned by other reviewers - this stuff stains. That&#x27;s the idea, right? But note that it stains skin as well as hair. It&#x27;s difficult to rinse it all off the scalp without scrubbing it - which would remove it from the gray roots I&#x27;m trying to cover. And be sure to scrub, scrub, scrub your hands with some soap while you&#x27;re waiting for the product to do its thing in your hair. (This stuff would make a great instant tan if you&#x27;re going for a too-long-in-the-booth look.) Some days I rinse too well (or didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough) and it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve even used the product. Other days I think this product adds a lovely shine. And some days if it doesn&#x27;t get rinsed just right it just plain looks greasy. Feels like too much of a gamble to use this product on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it for covering grays (even if only temporarily) because of the scalp staining issue. If you spend enough time perfecting your technique, it would probably provide a good shine to hair that just needs a little boost.</li>
            <li> On my brown/white hair, it turned blond then yellow then pink!!  I had to strip it out with Oops.  Made my hair very dry, and about 1/4 of my hair fell out.  Be careful with this....</li>
            <li> This gloss doesn&#x27;t really cover the gray, but it makes it less stark (my hair is brown-black and has some scattered gray throughout--less than 5% gray, but enough to notice without coloring it).  With a few uses, the color built up so that my gray hairs are slightly warmer and more golden--you can see them, but they don&#x27;t stand out. I like that it leaves my hair in better condition rather than worse, and I think it&#x27;s helped postpone the day when I have to find a colorist. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color glaze for a couple months and have been quite satisfied. It adds a bit of shine and much a bit of a color pick me up in between coloring. It doesn&#x27;t cover my gray, but does blend it a bit, so I&#x27;m not so rushed to color as quick as I normally might. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this staining my scalp or face that I couldn&#x27;t remove immediately.</li>
            <li> I have a few grey hairs but not enough to need to color my hair. I use this at the roots only and it gives my greys a light brown tint so that they look almost like highlights. A lifesaver between colors or if you want to grow out your hair without dying.</li>
            <li> I bought this today when I noticed my recently highlighted hair was turning brassy. I also bought a toner shampoo which I used first. It took out \\&quot;some\\&quot; of the brassiness but not as much as I wanted. I found this at my local drug store and said what the heck, maybe it will help with the brassiness. It did after one use. My hair is still \\&quot;alittle\\&quot; brassy but defiantly a big difference. I will use again tomorrow and see more of the results. It also made the brown that is not highlighted beautiful!! Hair is very soft and shiny as well.</li>
            <li> Not a big difference in the shine. Maybe if I used it once a week and it built up on my hair. Would not get a color glaze next time either. I have brown hair that had some color put in months ago and I am growing it out. Just a slight hint of red with not much of a line of demarcation. This does not deposit any color on my hair to help that but it leaves spots around my hairline that needs to be scrubbed off. Will get the clear next time to try.</li>
            <li> I have been useing this about6 weeks,i didnt see any difference when i started and i still dont see a differece. Again empty promises. It says rinse until water runs clear,i dont care how much i use, it always runs clear. dont waste your money. The little bit of grey i have is still grey and my hair is not any shinier. but my wallet feels lighter.</li>
