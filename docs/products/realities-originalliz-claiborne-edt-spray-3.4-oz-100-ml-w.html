            <li>Lasts a good long time &amp; is good quality.</li>
            <li>I had an opportunity to \\&quot;go back\\&quot; to my \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; and I&#x27;m glad I did!!</li>

            <li>I have worn this perfume for 24 years and hope that it is always available.  </li>
            <li>And the price is fantastic...</li>
            <li>The scent is a clean, light smell ,not over whelming.</li>
            <li>I love it and thank you very much for having it.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>IT SMELLS GREAT ON ME AND STAYS WITH ME ALL DAY LONG</li>
            <li>But i love my Liz Claiborne Realities was the first perfume i bought my self when i was a teenager .I</li>
            <li>It smells nothing like this original version</li>
            <li>My wife has been using the original version of this item for YEARS and loves it.</li>
            <li>It was in the original carton and in cellophane.</li>
            <li>I believe this is the original that was made years ago and</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that the only perfume opening I like better is Roma, which is saying a lot for Realities (or, maybe a lot about my nose &amp; experience?).</li>
            <li>It was nice to see the old formula still available on the internet.  </li>
            <li>She is a special woman and a survivor of cancer twice.</li>
            <li>When I finally found it at amazon at an incredible price, I did not hesitate to buy it and bring back that memorable fragance.</li>
            <li>It is fresh and light.  </li>
            <li>First one I bought was fine.</li>
            <li>On paper, the white florals are better blended &amp; more pleasing.</li>
            <li>My order arrived quickly and was as advertized.</li>
            <li>the smell is mild but lasts all day.</li>
            <li>though there has been a steady price increase over the years, I am happy to pay more since none of the local shops by me carry the older version, this version.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better then the new Reality scent.</li>
            <li>I was a fan of this fragrance years ago, but with all of the new fragrances over the years, I didn&#x27;t wear any more.</li>
            <li>My significant other loved the perfume.</li>
            <li>i loved this scent when it first came out but couldnt afford it back then..</li>
            <li>Delivery was almost 3 weeks but worth the wait unless you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li>It was ok but not the same scent as the original Realities that I have used for years.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and quick shipment.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li>so I never have to worry about buying her the right one ;)</li>
            <li>Product was shipped super fast and arrived as promised.</li>
            <li>opening is one of my favorites, and I have very high standards for openings!</li>
            <li>This is the original version of Realities perfume that is no longer available except online or occasionally at Marshalls or TJMaxx.</li>
            <li>and this is the first one that I&#x27;ve a problem with.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance its sweet, but not much  </li>
            <li>should of known better it says Elizabeth Arden  it does smell different on me .</li>
            <li>This brings back so many memories of when I was dating my wife in college.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>She already is looking for more in the future.</li>
            <li>Can only buy it on line now:)</li>
            <li>This came without damage to product and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very green, very fresh, very unusual, and very strong.</li>
            <li>I have worn this perfume in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>Awesome price for something that is so hard to find!!!</li>
            <li>The scent is not as full and strong as what i have previously purchased in a department store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The sprayer doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>thanks amazon .</li>
            <li>I am upset this is packaged to seem like the real Realities by Liz Claiborne</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this perfume!</li>
            <li>someone says, \\&quot;someone smells really</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon, my wallet</li>
            <li>thanks you too.</li>
            <li>I ordered this perfume for a friend cause she found it on amazon at an incredible price, but when she opened and use it she says it&#x27;s a fake</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really, this product is ageless (both in value and in market age range)</li>
            <li>i cant believe i got this much fragrance for 20 bucks</li>
            <li>Thanks it was a hassle finding this perfume in the states</li>
            <li>Came in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>I would really like to return it and purchase it again and have it shipped from another place.</li>
            <li>I have been using this perfume since 1984 and will be very dissapointed if I can no longer purchase it.</li>
            <li>It is just not the same as the original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the same as the original one by Liz Clairborne.</li>
            <li>I started wearing this perfume back in my high school days, and even then the smell would fit for a teenager.</li>
            <li>This particular version is what she really</li>
            <li>I think I can fix it, but at this price you would think that they could produce a simple atomizer that worked cleanly.</li>
            <li>hadn&#x27;t seen it advertised ,so i was afraid that it(like many of my favorite things)had been discontinued!</li>
            <li>I always order this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my Mom, who has worn this exact scent since I was a young child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accept</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s watered down for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li>But I have been lucky enough to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>B0002JBH88 Realities (Classic) by Liz Claiborne for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Toilette Spray]]</li>
            <li>I highly encourage Amazon not to offer this deceptive product.</li>
            <li>I used to wear this in High School.</li>
            <li>It is a light, slightly floral fresh scent, not heavy or spicy and at $19.95 for 3.4 oz&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Before buying it on Amazon I spent months looking for it in stores and duty free shops at airports.</li>
            <li>It is heavy and more suited to evening wear.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me when we were young!</li>
            <li>I may not suggest this for young women though!</li>
            <li>She did a trial spray and the product was satisfactory but the little sprayer button does not function easily.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, fresh and floral, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as it did in years past.</li>
            <li>I purchased the old version of \\&quot;Realities\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Best scent EVER~ hate that Liz claiborne discontinued it..</li>
            <li>I have ordered this a few times, and it is the original Realities scent- not the newer one.</li>
            <li>but this one is an everyday and special occasion wear.  </li>
            <li>You either like or don&#x27;t like the light floral small of Realities.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad scent and will use it because too expensive to throw away but don&#x27;t like it like the truly original realities.</li>
            <li>I chose this particular bottle because I wanted the original  and was not sure if the newer bottle styles contained the same formula.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite but very hard to find</li>
            <li>please keep that in mind when you are considering  purchasing  parfumes or scents that were developed from your younger days.</li>
            <li>The new formula is definitely not the same.</li>
            <li>I was having a hard time finding the original realities from Liz Clairborne.  </li>
            <li>So be warned if your looking for that sweet smell of realities from your memories you will be soured by the reality of this scent.</li>
            <li>What can I say about a scent/product that I&#x27;ve worn for almost 17 years other than it must mean I love it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> not the original product like the picture shows !</li>

            <li> I have worn this perfume for 24 years and hope that it is always available.  </li>
            <li> And the price is fantastic...</li>
            <li> The scent is a clean, light smell ,not over whelming.</li>
            <li> I love it and thank you very much for having it.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> IT SMELLS GREAT ON ME AND STAYS WITH ME ALL DAY LONG</li>
            <li> But i love my Liz Claiborne Realities was the first perfume i bought my self when i was a teenager .I</li>
            <li> It smells nothing like this original version</li>
            <li> My wife has been using the original version of this item for YEARS and loves it.</li>
            <li> It was in the original carton and in cellophane.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the original that was made years ago and</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that the only perfume opening I like better is Roma, which is saying a lot for Realities (or, maybe a lot about my nose &amp; experience?).</li>
            <li> It was nice to see the old formula still available on the internet.  </li>
            <li> She is a special woman and a survivor of cancer twice.</li>
            <li> When I finally found it at amazon at an incredible price, I did not hesitate to buy it and bring back that memorable fragance.</li>
            <li> It is fresh and light.  </li>
            <li> First one I bought was fine.</li>
            <li> On paper, the white florals are better blended &amp; more pleasing.</li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly and was as advertized.</li>
            <li> the smell is mild but lasts all day.</li>
            <li> though there has been a steady price increase over the years, I am happy to pay more since none of the local shops by me carry the older version, this version.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better then the new Reality scent.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of this fragrance years ago, but with all of the new fragrances over the years, I didn&#x27;t wear any more.</li>
            <li> My significant other loved the perfume.</li>
            <li> i loved this scent when it first came out but couldnt afford it back then..</li>
            <li> Delivery was almost 3 weeks but worth the wait unless you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> It was ok but not the same scent as the original Realities that I have used for years.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li> so I never have to worry about buying her the right one ;)</li>
            <li> Product was shipped super fast and arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> opening is one of my favorites, and I have very high standards for openings!</li>
            <li> This is the original version of Realities perfume that is no longer available except online or occasionally at Marshalls or TJMaxx.</li>
            <li> and this is the first one that I&#x27;ve a problem with.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance its sweet, but not much  </li>
            <li> should of known better it says Elizabeth Arden  it does smell different on me .</li>
            <li> This brings back so many memories of when I was dating my wife in college.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> She already is looking for more in the future.</li>
            <li> Can only buy it on line now:)</li>
            <li> This came without damage to product and it was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very green, very fresh, very unusual, and very strong.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for something that is so hard to find!!!</li>
            <li> The scent is not as full and strong as what i have previously purchased in a department store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The sprayer doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> thanks amazon .</li>
            <li> I am upset this is packaged to seem like the real Realities by Liz Claiborne</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this perfume!</li>
            <li> someone says, \\&quot;someone smells really</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon, my wallet</li>
            <li> thanks you too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for a friend cause she found it on amazon at an incredible price, but when she opened and use it she says it&#x27;s a fake</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Really, this product is ageless (both in value and in market age range)</li>
            <li> i cant believe i got this much fragrance for 20 bucks</li>
            <li> Thanks it was a hassle finding this perfume in the states</li>
            <li> Came in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I would really like to return it and purchase it again and have it shipped from another place.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume since 1984 and will be very dissapointed if I can no longer purchase it.</li>
            <li> It is just not the same as the original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the original one by Liz Clairborne.</li>
            <li> I started wearing this perfume back in my high school days, and even then the smell would fit for a teenager.</li>
            <li> This particular version is what she really</li>
            <li> I think I can fix it, but at this price you would think that they could produce a simple atomizer that worked cleanly.</li>
            <li> hadn&#x27;t seen it advertised ,so i was afraid that it(like many of my favorite things)had been discontinued!</li>
            <li> I always order this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my Mom, who has worn this exact scent since I was a young child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accept</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s watered down for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li> But I have been lucky enough to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> B0002JBH88 Realities (Classic) by Liz Claiborne for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Toilette Spray]]</li>
            <li> I highly encourage Amazon not to offer this deceptive product.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this in High School.</li>
            <li> It is a light, slightly floral fresh scent, not heavy or spicy and at $19.95 for 3.4 oz&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Before buying it on Amazon I spent months looking for it in stores and duty free shops at airports.</li>
            <li> It is heavy and more suited to evening wear.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me when we were young!</li>
            <li> I may not suggest this for young women though!</li>
            <li> She did a trial spray and the product was satisfactory but the little sprayer button does not function easily.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, fresh and floral, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as it did in years past.</li>
            <li> I purchased the old version of \\&quot;Realities\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Best scent EVER~ hate that Liz claiborne discontinued it..</li>
            <li> I have ordered this a few times, and it is the original Realities scent- not the newer one.</li>
            <li> but this one is an everyday and special occasion wear.  </li>
            <li> You either like or don&#x27;t like the light floral small of Realities.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad scent and will use it because too expensive to throw away but don&#x27;t like it like the truly original realities.</li>
            <li> I chose this particular bottle because I wanted the original  and was not sure if the newer bottle styles contained the same formula.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite but very hard to find</li>
            <li> please keep that in mind when you are considering  purchasing  parfumes or scents that were developed from your younger days.</li>
            <li> The new formula is definitely not the same.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding the original realities from Liz Clairborne.  </li>
            <li> So be warned if your looking for that sweet smell of realities from your memories you will be soured by the reality of this scent.</li>
            <li> What can I say about a scent/product that I&#x27;ve worn for almost 17 years other than it must mean I love it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, about a hour out, it becomes far too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> The fragrance does not last long.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG...</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed as I took a lot of time reading the reviews and also making sure I had ordered the original Realities.</li>
            <li> and I was so afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it.  </li>
            <li> she loves this perfume and has had it for a long time.</li>
            <li> She has been wanting this for a long time.</li>
            <li> AS LONG.  </li>
            <li> I bought this at $40 because the LC brand was $155 for only other choice.</li>
            <li> its also a risk like  buying aged wines.when parfume is not stored properly  or used like wines they have a tendency to settle or lose aromas and various other expected properties.</li>
            <li> However, the bottle I received must have been a left over and sat on the shelf for quite a long time because it smells a little rancid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered several of these previously</li>
            <li> the wife tried the other variant of this product (eau d&#x27; cologne) and didn&#x27;t like it as it never lasted long on you.</li>
            <li> I have another bottle that I ordered a few years ago and the scent is NOT the same.</li>
            <li> was it priced lower than any other site but also at the stores...</li>
            <li> The opening is a bit biting &amp; sharp, perhaps the chamomile, sage &amp; carnation, but I&#x27;d swear there was ginger in there too.</li>
            <li> The bottle was half empty</li>
            <li> Hard to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely misrepresented and fraudulent to sell this toilette water as Realities!  </li>
            <li> It smells just like I remember, but I&#x27;m not sure the fragrance lasts very long.</li>
            <li> I received mine undamaged in less than the time specified.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my mom thinking that it was just as the one she previously had.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> After that, Realities begins to soften into an everyday floral.</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;realities for women\\&quot; is a liz claiborne fragrance i wore a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Not strong.  </li>
            <li> but it is not strong as it use to be</li>
            <li> , i been wanting to get it is not easy to find it</li>
            <li> , scent is very weak and doesn&#x27;t last not even 30 minutes, worst of all this item is marked as not returnable, so be aware.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Realities is usually credited to Ann Gottlieb, whose resume includes Lola, Covet, Bang, 5th Ave., among others.</li>
            <li> The scent is very minimal, not a great buy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a Little weak with the smell</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume and it is hard to find on the market.</li>
            <li> Hard to find since out of production now.....love the scent</li>
            <li> Thank you for my Realities, it is getting hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Now i see its only $22and am kinda mad about it.</li>
            <li> It is very unfortunate that it is not the same.</li>
            <li> just too bad I have to go to such lengths to obtain it – wish it was still in the stores</li>
            <li> I was not happy.</li>
            <li> Have bought several times from \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot; and noticed the scent decline each time and think it has lost its power, too bad!</li>
            <li> However, at the outrageous price since last summer, I will no longer be</li>
            <li> Wearable only in winter months on me, otherwise it&#x27;s cloying, almost disgusting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was just disappointing for my wife</li>
            <li> However, for the past couple of years, since they stopped producing Realities, this product smells terrible and has no likeness to Realities.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when they discontinued Realities in department stores.  </li>
            <li> I always wear this perfume and I&#x27;m disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so was truly disappointed.</li>
            <li> You would not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, when I opened the bottle and presented it to my wife, we both were quite dissappointed, and I was terribly embarrased by giving something faked.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the product. I have used it for years.  However, at the outrageous price since last summer, I will no longer be&lt;br /&gt;buying this product through Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This is my only fragrance – I have worn it for years – everyone loves it – just too bad I have to go to such lengths to obtain it – wish it was still in the stores</li>
            <li> The sprayer doesn&#x27;t work very well.  I&#x27;ve ordered several of these previously and this is the first one that I&#x27;ve a problem with.</li>
            <li> I ABSOULUTLY LOVE THIS PROUDUCT IT SMELLS GREAT ON ME AND STAYS WITH ME ALL DAY LONG I USE REALATIES EVERY DAY THANK YOU FOR HAVING IT MAKE SURE YOU DONT DO AWAY WITH IT THANK YOU LOVE LIZ CLAIBORNE</li>
            <li> I ordered this and had it before I could blink not only was it priced lower than any other site but also at the stores...I love Amazon and how they do business, I&#x27;m not only a happy camper but a fabulous smelling one, Thanks!</li>
            <li> Stop selling this!  It is NOT Realities.  I loved Realities &amp; wore it for years &amp; received many compliments.  However, for the past couple of years, since they stopped producing Realities, this product smells terrible and has no likeness to Realities.  It is extremely misrepresented and fraudulent to sell this toilette water as Realities!  I highly encourage Amazon not to offer this deceptive product.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother she loves this perfume and has had it for a long time. she couldnt find it in the stores so thats why I got it here.</li>
            <li> I purchased Realities by Liz since this was the perfume my sweetheart used to wear during our dating,then she went for a secret,heavenly fragance. When I finally found it at amazon at an incredible price, I did not hesitate to buy it and bring back that memorable fragance. However, when I opened the bottle and presented it to my wife, we both were quite dissappointed, and I was terribly embarrased by giving something faked. We will never order perfumes through amazon. They are not reliable any more.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance its sweet, but not much  a friend of mine gave to me 11 yrs ago on my b-day, i been wanting to get it is not easy to find it I looked everywhere for it . thanks amazon .</li>
            <li> The first 15 minutes are incredible.  It&#x27;s very green, very fresh, very unusual, and very strong. The opening is a bit biting &amp; sharp, perhaps the chamomile, sage &amp; carnation, but I&#x27;d swear there was ginger in there too. Better on me than on paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening is one of my favorites, and I have very high standards for openings! I can honestly say that the only perfume opening I like better is Roma, which is saying a lot for Realities (or, maybe a lot about my nose &amp; experience?). Anyway ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening is where Realities is at for me. After that, Realities begins to soften into an everyday floral. Unfortunately, about a hour out, it becomes far too sweet for me. Likely the combination of lily &amp; jasmine, which my skin just throws out there. Wearable only in winter months on me, otherwise it&#x27;s cloying, almost disgusting. Goes to a powdery sweetness hours &amp; hours out. Lasts a good long time &amp; is good quality. Amazing that this thing is an EDT - they don&#x27;t make EDTs like this anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people comment about the peaches in Realities, but the white flowers are too dominant on me. On paper, the white florals are better blended &amp; more pleasing. I have a bottle for nostalgic reasons more than anything else ... and for that opening ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realities is usually credited to Ann Gottlieb, whose resume includes Lola, Covet, Bang, 5th Ave., among others.</li>
            <li> I am upset this is packaged to seem like the real Realities by Liz Claiborne but it&#x27;s not.  I bought this at $40 because the LC brand was $155 for only other choice. Now i see its only $22and am kinda mad about it. What i got from EA fragrances is a knock-off. Wasted money. Have to re-use it often like i would a body spray not a perfume.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter.  She said it is not the same scent that it used to be.  Did something change?</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like strong scents then you should try this. Very fine fragrance. I have stuck with it for years cos I am very sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;realities for women\\&quot; is a liz claiborne fragrance i wore a few years ago. hadn&#x27;t seen it advertised ,so i was afraid that it(like many of my favorite things)had been discontinued! i was very happy to find it on amazon and ordered it for my daughter&#x27;s birthday! very happy with entire experience!</li>
            <li> not the original product like the picture shows ! should of known better it says Elizabeth Arden  it does smell different on me . But i love my Liz Claiborne Realities was the first perfume i bought my self when i was a teenager .I miss it ! BRING IT BACK Liz !</li>
            <li> i like this for my wife is a very good for your life and your work thank for yuo service</li>
            <li> Product was shipped super fast and arrived as promised. My wife loves this perfume and it is hard to find on the market. Much better then the new Reality scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for something that is so hard to find!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and price!  Hard to find in local stores.  Delivery was almost 3 weeks but worth the wait unless you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Mother loves this!! She does always smell great;-)</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and fast shipped. I was a fan of this fragrance years ago, but with all of the new fragrances over the years, I didn&#x27;t wear any more. I had an opportunity to \\&quot;go back\\&quot; to my \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; and I&#x27;m glad I did!!</li>
            <li> I love my realities. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the \\&quot;old\\&quot; version of this fragrance so it&#x27;s nice to see it still offered.</li>
            <li> Very pleased!! Best price around, and arrived on time!</li>
            <li> It was nice to see the old formula still available on the internet.  This brings back so many memories of when I was dating my wife in college.  The new formula is definitely not the same.</li>
            <li> WE HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO UNTIL THEY STOP MAKING IT OR CHANGE IT IN ANY WAY!</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I found one of my FAVORITE fragrances on your website.  Thank-you, thank-you!!! I was so disappointed when they discontinued Realities in department stores.  Thank-you again AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed. I always wear this perfume and I&#x27;m disappointed with this purchase. The fragrance does not last long. It is just not the same as the original.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for 24 years and hope that it is always available.  I received mine undamaged in less than the time specified.</li>
            <li> This is the original version of Realities perfume that is no longer available except online or occasionally at Marshalls or TJMaxx. It&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance, though, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon offers it. My order arrived quickly and was as advertized. I highly recommend this perfume!</li>
            <li> What can I say about a scent/product that I&#x27;ve worn for almost 17 years other than it must mean I love it.  This is my signature scent.  I use others here and there but this is my mainstay.  Evey time I wear it someone says, \\&quot;someone smells really good\\&quot;  :). It is a light, slightly floral fresh scent, not heavy or spicy and at $19.95 for 3.4 oz&#x27;s I purchased \\&quot;2\\&quot;.  That is the best price I have ever seen.  Thanks Amazon, my wallet thanks you too.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, as advertised, in good condition, good price. Would purchase again. (Still love the fragrance.)</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to review ?  You either like or don&#x27;t like the light floral small of Realities.  I have been wearing it for years.  For whatever reason the only place I can find to purchase it these days is Amazon.com to whom I say thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for a friend cause she found it on amazon at an incredible price, but when she opened and use it she says it&#x27;s a fake, scent is very weak and doesn&#x27;t last not even 30 minutes, worst of all this item is marked as not returnable, so be aware. I have read similar stories here on amazon, I will never buy a perfume again from amazon.</li>
            <li> I received the box containing the Realities spray and it was on time and in perfect condition.  It is my wifes favorite scent and I bought it for her for her birthday.  She loves it and I love how convient it is to order things from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Glad to know that I can still get this. I thought I was going to have to change. I have gotten so many compliments on this and hope I will still be able to get it when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 1996 and I love it! I do have a problem finding this product at times. But I have been lucky enough to find it on Amazon. I hope I will always be able to find it. Is there any chance they will put it back on the market?  Thanks</li>
            <li> Realities by Liz Clayborne has updated it&#x27;s scent and I don&#x27;t like it as well as the \\&quot;old\\&quot; Realities. I&#x27;m so glad to be able to purchase the old fragrance which is a beautiful scent!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the perfume...one of my favorite scents EVER!!!!  And the price is fantastic...Thanks Amazon.com</li>
            <li> I bought it for my girlfriend because I love it.  It reminds me when we were young!</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding the original realities from Liz Clairborne.  Found it on amazon, ordered immediately, so that I would not lose out.  Was exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother in law and she loved it. I may not suggest this for young women though!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is the best fragance by Liz Caliborne. Before buying it on Amazon I spent months looking for it in stores and duty free shops at airports. I finally found it here, bought 1 bottle, arrived in time and everything went well... I already bought a second bottle. I am really glad I found it!!</li>
            <li> perfume is great. I have been wearing this perfume for over 20 yrs. It is a  great smell.  I recommend this perfume to anyone. you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best scent EVER~ hate that Liz claiborne discontinued it..</li>
            <li> It was ok but not the same scent as the original Realities that I have used for years. Was very disappointed as I took a lot of time reading the reviews and also making sure I had ordered the original Realities. Looked on many web sites but have had good luck on amazon so was truly disappointed. Didn&#x27;t send it back because I had thrown away the package it came in. Not a bad scent and will use it because too expensive to throw away but don&#x27;t like it like the truly original realities.</li>
            <li> Ive been every where to find this product and everyone has told me that it was no longer made. I went on to Amazon.com and found immediately! I used to wear Realities by Liz Claiborne years ago and totally forgot about it as time went on. I love it and thank you very much for having it.[[ASIN:B0002JBH88 Realities (Classic) by Liz Claiborne for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Toilette Spray]]</li>
            <li> My significant other loved the perfume. She already is looking for more in the future. I couldn&#x27;t have made a better choice for her special day.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my mom thinking that it was just as the one she previously had.  The scent is very minimal, not a great buy.</li>
            <li> Have loved this fragrance since it came out almost twenty years ago. Can only buy it on line now:)</li>
            <li> I am SO thrilled that this fragrance is available again. Thank you Elizabeth Arden!&lt;br /&gt;My shipment was perfect.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a wonderful scent and my wife loves it. Almost every time she puts it on someone comments on how great the scent is. I wish it was a little cheaper. When I find it online at a good price I purchase two bottles .</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume I ever had and still using it over 25 years.</li>
            <li> I started wearing this perfume back in my high school days, and even then the smell would fit for a teenager. And now that I am in my mid thirties, this smell also fits women my age. Really, this product is ageless (both in value and in market age range)</li>
            <li> I have ordered this a few times, and it is the original Realities scent- not the newer one. (Ew.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is amazing, and always comes on time and packaged nicely... I always order this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my Mom, who has worn this exact scent since I was a young child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accept no imitations or &#x27;newer&#x27; versions. This one is the best, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though there has been a steady price increase over the years, I am happy to pay more since none of the local shops by me carry the older version, this version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells divine. It lasts literally all day. You would not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mother-in-law. She has been wanting this for a long time. It was her favorite fragrance!!! I am so glad I found it on Amazon. She is a special woman and a survivor of cancer twice. She enjoys the scent daily, not taking for granted the gifts she has been given.</li>
            <li> the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
            <li> This is my favorite every-day perfume.  Not strong.  It is fresh and light.  It concerns me that the company has bee phasing it out and has brought in another version with the same name.  It is heavy and more suited to evening wear.  It smells nothing like this original version</li>
            <li> If Momma&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> This has been my mom&#x27;s fav perfume for years.  I was glad to see it was still being made!! I will continue to purchase this product</li>
            <li> Some perfumes you only wear sometimes but this one is an everyday and special occasion wear.  I am never dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn this perfume in 25 years, but when I saw the great price I thought I&#x27;d give it another try. The scent was just as I remembered,excellent product and price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume by Liz Claiborne ....you can no longer buy it in the stores , so I am very happy that Iam able to purchase it through Amazon !!!  Very happy with this product !!!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these and one was leaking when it arrived. It smells just like I remember, but I&#x27;m not sure the fragrance lasts very long.</li>
            <li> GREAT smell it do smell the same but it is not strong as it use to be it&#x27;s a Little weak with the smell but it is the same smell</li>
            <li> this is my favorite but very hard to find</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchased so I knew there was the possibility it would be different. ... And it definatly is not the same. I have another bottle that I ordered a few years ago and the scent is NOT the same. It is very unfortunate that it is not the same. So be warned if your looking for that sweet smell of realities from your memories you will be soured by the reality of this scent.</li>
            <li> the smell is mild but lasts all day. smells good</li>
            <li> My wife has been using the original version of this item for YEARS and loves it. It&#x27;s all she wears so I never have to worry about buying her the right one ;)</li>
            <li> the wife tried the other variant of this product (eau d&#x27; cologne) and didn&#x27;t like it as it never lasted long on you. This particular version is what she really likes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in apparently good shape from the shipping. She did a trial spray and the product was satisfactory but the little sprayer button does not function easily. I think I can fix it, but at this price you would think that they could produce a simple atomizer that worked cleanly.</li>
            <li> This came without damage to product and it was exactly what I ordered. This scent is beautiful and makes me feel beautiful and happy.</li>
            <li> anyone who crosses my path, KNOWS this is the ONLY scent I wear!  Strangers (both men and women of all ages) stop me on a daily basis to ask what it is....</li>
            <li> i cant believe i got this much fragrance for 20 bucks no shipping or tax and right to my own front door!  i loved this scent when it first came out but couldnt afford it back then..im so glad that it can be found and purchased through amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buyers need to keep in mind that this fragrance was made many years ago and a lot of rules and regulations within the industry have changed. a lot of the ingrediants allowed back then are not  allowed now or have been banned. industry standards have changed and with that so have some of the expectations of parfumes. please keep that in mind when you are considering  purchasing  parfumes or scents that were developed from your younger days. its also a risk like  buying aged wines.when parfume is not stored properly  or used like wines they have a tendency to settle or lose aromas and various other expected properties.</li>
            <li> ANYTHING THAT I HAVE RECENTLY BOUGHT EITHER DOES NOT SMELL THE SAME AS I REMEMBER OR IT DOES NOT LAST AS LONG.  I STILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is my moms favorite perfume and we can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. She was so happy that we found it online.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find the old realities because my mom and I love this fragance and can&#x27;t stop using it.  I am so happy with amazon for having the perfume available for us to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Liz</li>
            <li> Mom loves it. Thanks it was a hassle finding this perfume in the states</li>
            <li> I love this scent, fresh and floral, although it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as it did in years past.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is wonderful I used to wear this in High School. I love this smell its a wonderful product and at such a great price. I would recommend this to all my family and friends I give it a five star. Thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased the old version of \\&quot;Realities\\&quot; (The only one in my opinion). It was in the original carton and in cellophane. The blue spritzer is turned off to one side but it doesn&#x27;t affect the perfume at all. It was for myself so I didn&#x27;t mind. Good bargain. Came in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> The scent is not as full and strong as what i have previously purchased in a department store.&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t buy online again.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this perfume from Amazon and have always been very satisfied. I know it ships from different places but this time I received it from Tuccini. It just doesn&#x27;t smell the same and it doesn&#x27;t even spray like the others. I can&#x27;t explain it but it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s watered down for lack of a better word. I would really like to return it and purchase it again and have it shipped from another place.</li>
            <li> IT MAY BE ME BUT IT DOSEN&#x27;T SMELL AS GOOD AS IT USE TO  ..AND THE FRAGRANCE  DOES NOT LAST VERY LONG...THE SPRAYER STICKS ALL THE TIME AND TAKES TWO HANDS TO PRESS AND SPRAY... I GUESS I WON&#x27;T ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> Hard to find since out of production now.....love the scent</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume in the past and loved it. I chose this particular bottle because I wanted the original  and was not sure if the newer bottle styles contained the same formula. However, the bottle I received must have been a left over and sat on the shelf for quite a long time because it smells a little rancid. I was not happy.</li>
            <li> Smells just like I remember. My grandmother was thrilled!</li>
            <li> The bottle was half empty it looked like it had  leaked all over the box&lt;br /&gt;It was just disappointing for my wife</li>
            <li> I believe this is the original that was made years ago and the shelf life has caused the scent to fade so will not purchase again. Have bought several times from \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot; and noticed the scent decline each time and think it has lost its power, too bad!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same as the original one by Liz Clairborne. I use to have people ask me what the name of my spray was, but didn&#x27;t with this one. Also ,I could smell the scent on my clothes but not with the one that I just bought from you.</li>
            <li> Spray bottle does not spray properly. First one I bought was fine.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents and at a price I could afford.i would recommend it to anyone.THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume since 1984 and will be very dissapointed if I can no longer purchase it.</li>
            <li> So nice to have my favorite perfume. You were quick to ship and received with joy!  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> . I receive many compliments. The scent is a clean, light smell ,not over whelming.This is my favorite perefume by Liz Claiborne.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Thank you for my Realities, it is getting hard to find.  The price was great!&lt;br /&gt;I love this perfume and have used it for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I have used liz Claiborne &amp;#34;realities&amp;#34; for probably 15 years or more and I was so afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find it.  thank you for having it on hand!</li>
