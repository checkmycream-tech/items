            <li> LOVE IT, MY LADY IS CRAZY ABOUT IT</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell like the miss dior cherries i had before, the name changed and the smell is different a little bit</li>
            <li> this perfume does not smell the same as other bottles of the same I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Be careful...</li>
            <li> Classy, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> This is what was previously called Miss Cherie.  </li>
            <li> She used the Cherie previously and I was confused about the name change</li>
            <li> Heard her say nothing negative about the scent, etc.</li>
            <li> This item is a fake and is NOT authentic Miss Dior perfume.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this lite scent.</li>
            <li> but this fake Miss Dior doesn&#x27;t smell so bad</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people who use it and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad on anyone.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is NOT Miss Dior Cherie, this is the &amp;#34;originale&amp;#34; version, if you&#x27;re looking for &amp;#34;cherie&amp;#34;, this option is not for you</li>
            <li> I happen to have Miss Dior Cherie from years ago and compared the two scents.  They are not the same smells at all but this fake Miss Dior doesn&#x27;t smell so bad so I&#x27;ll deal with it.</li>
            <li> EDIT: Amazon gave me a full refund within half an hour of emailing them about the issue. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the level of service provided!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I ordered was not what I received. The rose colored bottle in the photograph is what my wife wanted for Christmas, instead I received a yellow bottle of Miss Dior EDT \\&quot;Originale\\&quot; which smells like the time my grandma&#x27;s wig fell in a urinal trench (don&#x27;t ask, long story).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The site says perfume can&#x27;t be returned, but I&#x27;m out $80 through no fault of my own. Hopefully Amazon makes it right.</li>
            <li> The proccess was excelent and is very good product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and was a wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She really liked it and also it was really good to have her around with that scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody was complimenting her all the time, it makes people happy around you.</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell like the miss dior cherries i had before, the name changed and the smell is different a little bit</li>
            <li> This item is a fake and is NOT authentic Miss Dior perfume. When this is compared to the real deal it is very easy to tell it is fake. USE CAUTION!</li>
            <li> Happy wife, happy life.  She used the Cherie previously and I was confused about the name change but this is the right one.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite. Saved big on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. It smells wonderful and feminine. I know a lot of people who use it and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad on anyone. I&#x27;m about to order a second bottle of it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, MY LADY IS CRAZY ABOUT IT</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for almost two years and it is my absolute favorite!....I still can&#x27;t get enough of it and everytime I go out it is the one I grab....its divine!!!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my mother and she loved it. Amazon has it at the best price than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a Christmas for my teen-aged daughter.  Nice, light fragrance that is perfect for the young adult.  Arrived on time and as described.  Love it.</li>
            <li> mislabeled/misrepresented, it should be clarified that this is the most recent scent released by Dior, not the older Miss Dior Cherie</li>
            <li> Be careful... this perfume does not smell the same as other bottles of the same I have bought in the past. It is not even close.......</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this lite scent. Very femimine and not overpowering. I always have a bottle of Miss Dior Cherie on hand</li>
            <li> delightful smell lasts for the entire day when used along with the body lotion</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the perfume...has been asking for it for a couple years.  Heard her say nothing negative about the scent, etc.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend this Christmas and it&#x27;s amazing! Not too strong or overpowering. Classy, subtle scent. Much prefer this to the newer versions</li>
            <li> This is what was previously called Miss Cherie.  I don&#x27;t know why they changed the name.</li>
