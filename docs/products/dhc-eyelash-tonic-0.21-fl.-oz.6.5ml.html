            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s water based, most of it evaporates anyway</li>
            <li>I recommond it to you  :  )</li>
            <li>Okay, so it DOES straighten lashes a bit.....</li>
            <li>This is a great price for this eyelash tonic (it&#x27;s more directly from DHC).  </li>

            <li>And when using during the day, apply first, wait for it to dry, then apply mascara.  </li>
            <li>After using it for about six weeks, the only difference I noticed in my lashes were that they did not curl naturally anymore.  </li>
            <li>Also, the product really irritated my eyes, and I constantly woke up with red, burning eyes, no matter how careful I was to keep it away from my eyes and only on my lashes.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product so much! My eyelashes look better with and without mascara. I can&#x27;t go a day without using it. It lasts for a long time too! I&#x27;ve been using the same one for over a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more effective to the lower lashes. Not oily, and can be applied before mascara. I apply it twice a day after washing my face.</li>
            <li> It is really fast and very useful!I like it!  Not oily , very fresh and soft like water,just be careful when you use it,do not put it into your eyes!</li>
            <li> Bon produit non gras, facile à appliquer, que ce soit le soir après le démaquillage ou le matin avant le mascara. Pour obtenir un résultat visible, je pense qu&#x27;il faut attendre au moins un mois. Là c&#x27;est encore trop tôt.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item of ebay and may i say it works super fast!  I used it for two days and wore no eye makeup during that time.  By the end of the two days, i had super long lashes! I could NOT believe it!!!  I will definetly buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for this eyelash tonic (it&#x27;s more directly from DHC).  When used consistently, it adds length, width, strength and definition to lashes, usually within 2 week.  When put on before bed, expect some crusties in the morning.  And when using during the day, apply first, wait for it to dry, then apply mascara.  But this DEFINITELY works</li>
            <li> its trouble some to use....and I don&#x27;t notice any big difference to my eye lashes... it has been months now...</li>
            <li> This product works well on my eyelash !!!! My eyelash grows longer (but straight) and more.!!!!! I definitely want to recommend this product to others and keep using it. I really love it. Thank you DHC!!!!</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s water based, most of it evaporates anyway so what conditioning is really going on? If anything you can condition your lashes using oil or moisturizer with your finger. Think---would you condition your hair with a gel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curved brush does not deliver enough product on the bristles so you constantly have to rebrush over and over, and is virtually useless. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I love DHC but this product is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it really works.  It is really a good deal and conditions and improves your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This product is great!! I really appreciate!! The price is not high. Ship fast.I keep using it every morning and I find my eye lashes grow a little bit longer!!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my lashes sorry.  Used it every night and day and did not see a difference at all What a rip off.</li>
            <li> It is great gift ,I like it. It just as what I expected. I recommond it to you  :  )</li>
            <li> I really love this product! Really see a huge difference in my eyebrows and eyelashes. Will reorder this product. Love that it is a natural product.</li>
            <li> I used this consistently for several weeks and saw a difference in just about 10 days or so. My lashes were thicker and looked more even to each other (one of my eyes has thicker lashes than the other, and it was frustrating, haha)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t know what the ingredients are, and that kinda makes me wonder...</li>
            <li> I bought it at April 29. I did not receive but I did receive other orders. Maybe that product is so small that someone forget to pack it.</li>
            <li> Keep using, you&#x27;ll be surprise.but don&#x27;t use too much every times, or frequently. that might let your eyes feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product after reading the reviews.  After using it for about six weeks, the only difference I noticed in my lashes were that they did not curl naturally anymore.  For some reason, it just straightened them all out.  Yuk.  Also, the product really irritated my eyes, and I constantly woke up with red, burning eyes, no matter how careful I was to keep it away from my eyes and only on my lashes. I got better results from the local drugstore version of eyelash serum.</li>
            <li> Good!!! And thanks for the snack :)</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helping or not.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it working since the price is right, but there is no doubt it does. Start at the lash line and coat both upper and lower lashes. Okay, so it DOES straighten lashes a bit.....HOWEVER, use an eyelash curler and a coat of mascara and enjoy. Highly recommend for women like me who wear a lot of makeup. Use morning and night. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
