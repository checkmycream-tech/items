            <li>it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous and this is perfect to pair up with the urban decay naked 3 palette because of its perfect rosy hue.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely layer able which is great for those who want more color.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Lovely color.</li>
            <li>then most photo examples I saw online.  </li>
            <li>Also the color is more neutral than I though, which is a plus since I wanted shadows that I can use during the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 2&#x27;fer :)</li>
            <li>Tried this eye studio color tattoo cream gel and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful, but they were not as dark or as bright as I thought they would be.  </li>
            <li>The color is light and lovely.</li>
            <li>And with a light touch, it is even appropriate during the daytime.</li>

            <li>I really love this color, so pretty.</li>
            <li>It washes off cleanly with ivory soap and water.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I feel asleep with it on one night and was surprised to see it looking just as good the next day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and on my skin ( very pale) it comes off as a neutral pearlescent pink...not nearly as rich looking as in the pot if used with a light hand.  </li>
            <li>It looks really pretty on</li>
            <li>This color is really pretty and can be layered.  </li>
            <li>Powders tend to emphasize lines more, it seems, while this is a younger look.  </li>
            <li>I like to wear this every once in a while because it really just makes your eyes pop!</li>
            <li>It is long lasting pigmented and smooth but it drys quickly and not all the colors has the same quality some of them are patchy but the the one I got was good</li>
            <li>The positive reviews were what prompted me to purchase this</li>
            <li>I love this shade of pink, it&#x27;s not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>This is a creamy, pigmented, shimmery eyeshadow that really pops.</li>
            <li>However, It doesn&#x27;t really blend well.</li>
            <li>Very polished.</li>
            <li>I love this concept and the pink color of this product.</li>
            <li>this really does stay on all day</li>
            <li>If you put other eyeshadow on top of it, that stays on, too.  </li>
            <li>The colors are nice and long lasting.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 42), but this stays smooth all day long.</li>
            <li>The commercial makes them look way better than they actually are.  </li>
            <li>This one is a light pink that is very shimmery and glittery.</li>
            <li>It lasts for a long time and has a natural, light, creamy appearance, or just pure color instead of a powder.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light pink color and is sparkly too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really very natural looking otherwise.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color( inked in pink )</li>
            <li>The original picture makes it look dark, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>and it really makes the coral color pop and makes it last all day without creasing, however I do use a shadow primer to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft.</li>
            <li>I have no idea why this isn&#x27;t sold in stores near me.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all which is rare for a long lasting formula.</li>
            <li>Fairly light pink, doesn&#x27;t crease and stays for a long time!</li>
            <li>It is not loud, but a pretty pink.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t care for pink eyeshadow</li>
            <li>There are a few others in other colors that I like, but Inked in Pink is my favorite.</li>

            <li> Fairly light pink, doesn&#x27;t crease and stays for a long time!</li>
            <li> It is not loud, but a pretty pink.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t care for pink eyeshadow</li>
            <li> There are a few others in other colors that I like, but Inked in Pink is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed is the formula is a little dry (for lack of a better word) - I feel like I need to rub my delicate eye skin a little harder than I would like to in order to transfer the color from my fingertips to my eyelid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but gives enough shimmer and soft color to look polished at work (and not ready for the club).  </li>
            <li> Although it is pink it still shows up in the coral family.</li>
            <li> I purchased Inked in Pink.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be long lasting, at least it stayed for the 8 or so hours I wore it.</li>
            <li> I was worried about getting this shade since I don&#x27;t do a lot of pink shadow and have a darker completion (brown eyes, olive skin tone, very dark brown hair)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested the &amp;#34;24 hours&amp;#34;, but it does have lasting power from applying in the morning to removing late at night.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish they also came in matte.</li>
            <li> and it works better for a pinkish base.  </li>
            <li> and I just add a little brown in my crease and blend it out</li>
            <li> I use my finger to smear a little on.</li>
            <li> I want a natural look, or I use it as a base for other colors.</li>
            <li> I am late 50&#x27;s</li>
            <li> subtle color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually go for eyeshadow with shimmer but found that this is very subtle.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow can also double as a base.</li>
            <li> Very subtle.</li>
            <li> I used to hate pink eyeshadow on me, but with this I changed my mind!</li>
            <li> I use it as a base for when I wear coral color.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base</li>
            <li> Like this product as a base.  </li>

            <li> I love this shade of pink, it&#x27;s not overpowering.  It works great alone for days I want a natural look, or I use it as a base for other colors. I haven&#x27;t tested the &amp;#34;24 hours&amp;#34;, but it does have lasting power from applying in the morning to removing late at night.</li>
            <li> Awesome eyeshadow! I think I&#x27;ve bought all the shades! Oh...it never creases!</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account. I use this quiet often. I use it as a base for when I wear coral color. Although it is pink it still shows up in the coral family. I put this on my lid and then put coral color over it and it really makes the coral color pop and makes it last all day without creasing, however I do use a shadow primer to. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I purchased Inked in Pink.  I don&#x27;t usually go for eyeshadow with shimmer but found that this is very subtle. It&#x27;s very light and on my skin ( very pale) it comes off as a neutral pearlescent pink...not nearly as rich looking as in the pot if used with a light hand.  It is absolutely layer able which is great for those who want more color. It&#x27;s really very natural looking otherwise. it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all which is rare for a long lasting formula. Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li> bought it for my gf.&lt;br /&gt;works as it should. colours the eye lid.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t see why it doesnt deserve 5 stars.</li>
            <li> great eye make up especially for summer time!</li>
            <li> I just love it. It&#x27;s so creamy I use it as a base and I just add a little brown in my crease and blend it out and it just gives it a nice pop</li>
            <li> This product stays on until I take it off. It washes off cleanly with ivory soap and water. The colors are nice and long lasting. I like how it sparkles as well. This is my 4th shade. Lovely color.</li>
            <li> I was worried about getting this shade since I don&#x27;t do a lot of pink shadow and have a darker completion (brown eyes, olive skin tone, very dark brown hair) then most photo examples I saw online.  But this is now my go-to color for work.  It&#x27;s subtle but gives enough shimmer and soft color to look polished at work (and not ready for the club).  I have to admit that I feel asleep with it on one night and was surprised to see it looking just as good the next day.  Color stayed even on the lids and didn&#x27;t crease.</li>
            <li> Nice color.  Lighter than it looks online but I still like it.</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow!!  The positive reviews were what prompted me to purchase this and I was not disappointed.  It looks really pretty on and it does stay all day.</li>
            <li> I like the texture. It&#x27;s really soft. Also the color is more neutral than I though, which is a plus since I wanted shadows that I can use during the day. Plus I put it on in the morning and it lasts until the very next day</li>
            <li> BRILLIANT product. I have no idea why this isn&#x27;t sold in stores near me. Powder shadow tends to cake on me (I&#x27;m 42), but this stays smooth all day long. YAY! The color is light and lovely. My only complaint is that I wish they also came in matte. Not everyone loves the sparkle look all the time.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful, but they were not as dark or as bright as I thought they would be.  The commercial makes them look way better than they actually are.  Still, I like them.</li>
            <li> This cream eyeshadow is gorgeous although I find myself layering for the color to show up but once I&#x27;ve layered the color it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous and this is perfect to pair up with the urban decay naked 3 palette because of its perfect rosy hue. Love,love,love!</li>
            <li> not as hypoallergenic as they claim.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting pigmented and smooth but it drys quickly and not all the colors has the same quality some of them are patchy but the the one I got was good</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.  I have told all my girlfriends about it!  This color is really pretty and can be layered.  Stays on all day without a touch up.  If you put other eyeshadow on top of it, that stays on, too.  There are a few others in other colors that I like, but Inked in Pink is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a creamy, pigmented, shimmery eyeshadow that really pops. However, It doesn&#x27;t really blend well. It seems to be long lasting, at least it stayed for the 8 or so hours I wore it. I really love this color, so pretty. This eyeshadow can also double as a base. It&#x27;s a 2&#x27;fer :)</li>
            <li> Very pretty color( inked in pink ) last all day!</li>
            <li> subtle color. I have brown skin - I&#x27;m from India, and its perfect for office wear. Very subtle. Very polished. I use my finger to smear a little on.</li>
            <li> Nice formula and pretty coloe.</li>
            <li> Tried this eye studio color tattoo cream gel and love it.  It lasts for a long time and has a natural, light, creamy appearance, or just pure color instead of a powder.  Powders tend to emphasize lines more, it seems, while this is a younger look.  Haven&#x27;t seen cream gels for eye shadows, so was delighted to find this.  It stays on your eyelid for longer than a powder.</li>
            <li> I love this concept and the pink color of this product. It is not loud, but a pretty pink. And with a light touch, it is even appropriate during the daytime. It is long-lasting, as well. The only thing I noticed is the formula is a little dry (for lack of a better word) - I feel like I need to rub my delicate eye skin a little harder than I would like to in order to transfer the color from my fingertips to my eyelid. This might just be a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Fairly light pink, doesn&#x27;t crease and stays for a long time! The original picture makes it look dark, but it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a light pink color and is sparkly too. I used to hate pink eyeshadow on me, but with this I changed my mind! I love it and is easy to apply. One of the best eyeshadows I have.</li>
            <li> Lovely color, it does crease on me unfortunately. I will continue to use and repurchase though.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Like this product as a base.  I am late 50&#x27;s and it works better for a pinkish base.  Under 40 would work well either way as this is a creamy formula.</li>
            <li> this really does stay on all day I apply it about 3pm and work 3rd shift and it never needs to be reapplied</li>
            <li> Another Amazing color by the Maybelline Color Tattoos! This one is a light pink that is very shimmery and glittery. It looks gorgeous on its own or to mix it with other colors! I like to wear this every once in a while because it really just makes your eyes pop! I normally don&#x27;t care for pink eyeshadow but I had to make an exception for this gorgeous color!</li>
