    <ol>
            <li>Great for blow drying the hair.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and found this gel cream to be one of the best for all day hold.  </li>
            <li>Maybe its protective qualities are good</li>
            <li>Good product that I still like, but</li>
            <li>I had used Redken&#x27;s Blown Away 09 and loved it, then they discontinued it and replaced it with the Duo Shield.  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>The product kind of just seeps out at its own pace.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best product I have found for my hair as of yet.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any build up and the more I have been using it, the better my hair is behaving.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>I used to get Blown Away - it was a much better product, but I don&#x27;t think it is available anymore.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product and the quick service.</li>
            <li>, MY FINE HAIR GETS THE VOLUME</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who has fine and / or color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I first fell in love with this product when my hair stylist first used it in my hair.</li>
            <li>and I find that my hair seems to dry faster with shiny smooth results, nice body and no frizz.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product to used after you shampoo and your hair is wet to get it ready for blow drying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a couple dollops of this gives me a nice amount of hold for waves in my asian hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried Duo Shield 07</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>My fine but full head of hair needs a product to boost volume but not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I was really amazed</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very porous and affected by humidity</li>
            <li>but this product really helped with this.  </li>
            <li>this is a new product by Redken, replacing the pure gell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine color treated hair that tends to wave and curl and takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li>I found that if I shake the product prior to dispensing it is more thoroughly dispenses equally.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by the woman who cuts my hair because of my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>And, I have naturally curly hair that will frizz in the humidity of Louisiana.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be tacky on my thick but fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I can barely get a comb through it after using this.  </li>
            <li>how silky soft it left my hair.  </li>
            <li>Even using a small amount, the product makes my dark blond, fairly fine hair completely gunky.  </li>
            <li>I had the lid screwed on tightly, yet somehow large portions of the outside gel manages to constantly leak out.</li>
            <li>Will be looking for a new gel other than Redken.</li>

            <li> I was looking for a product with some hold that doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch and flake like crazy thoughout the day. This was recommended to me by the woman who cuts my hair because of my sensitive scalp. I find that a couple dollops of this gives me a nice amount of hold for waves in my asian hair. The only downside is that there&#x27;s no guarantee you&#x27;ll get the ratio of cream to gel that you wanted. The product kind of just seeps out at its own pace.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to used after you shampoo and your hair is wet to get it ready for blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair hold it&#x27;s shape! LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, Redken, but this product is horrible - at least for me.  Even using a small amount, the product makes my dark blond, fairly fine hair completely gunky.  I can barely get a comb through it after using this.  It makes my hair extra frizzy, too.  Maybe its protective qualities are good but there&#x27;s no way for me to tell.  I&#x27;ve used other heat protective products and none of them did this to my hair.  It&#x27;s too late for a return to I&#x27;m either going to give it a way or toss it.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and found this gel cream to be one of the best for all day hold.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great for blow drying the hair.  It gives the hair body.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the product and the quick service.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product at all. It flattened my hair and it just did not feel &amp;#34;right&amp;#34;. I used to get Blown Away - it was a much better product, but I don&#x27;t think it is available anymore.</li>
            <li> I have fine color treated hair that tends to wave and curl and takes forever to dry.  I had previously used Redken Blown Away 09 for years.  The first time I tried Duo Shield 07 I was really amazed how silky soft it left my hair.  I use it everytime I shampoo and blow dry and I find that my hair seems to dry faster with shiny smooth results, nice body and no frizz.  I haven&#x27;t seen any build up and the more I have been using it, the better my hair is behaving.  I really love this product.</li>
            <li> Good product that I still like, but somehow they need to improve packaging.  I had the lid screwed on tightly, yet somehow large portions of the outside gel manages to constantly leak out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS, MY FINE HAIR GETS THE VOLUME IT NEEDS WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It seems to be tacky on my thick but fine hair.  Not a good match for my type that needs body.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My hair is very porous and affected by humidity but this product really helped with this.  Prior to my purchasing this product there were some reviews that were critical of the packaging and dispensing of the product.  I found that if I shake the product prior to dispensing it is more thoroughly dispenses equally.</li>
            <li> My fine but full head of hair needs a product to boost volume but not weigh it down. Found this at a salon a few years ago, and it delivered. Couldn&#x27;t find it again, until now via Amazon, yay!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  I would recommend it to anyone who has fine and / or color treated hair.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best product I have found for my hair as of yet.  I was using about 4 products after washing my hair and now I only use this and a leave-in conditioner.  The Duo Shield not only protects my hair but also keeps my style all day.  And, I have naturally curly hair that will frizz in the humidity of Louisiana.  This has made that frizz almost non-existent.  Love this!</li>
            <li> I had used Redken&#x27;s Blown Away 09 and loved it, then they discontinued it and replaced it with the Duo Shield.  What a disappointment!!!  The Duo Shield leaves my hair dull and sticky.  Will be looking for a new gel other than Redken.</li>
            <li> I first fell in love with this product when my hair stylist first used it in my hair. It does wonders. I use it every day</li>
            <li> this is a new product by Redken, replacing the pure gell.&lt;br /&gt;It is half gel and half conditioner, and I find it very greasy&lt;br /&gt;on the hair, defeating the purpose of giving the hair body</li>
