            <li>Amazing size to try the product.</li>
            <li>Thank you I liked that the product is what it claims to be.</li>
            <li>At 33yo I can honestly say...</li>
            <li>and nice travel size to take on getaways and air travel</li>
            <li>best moisturizer I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this travel size product because I saw so many rave reviews from beauty bloggers and the product is nice</li>
            <li>I agree with most makeup artist and beauty counter store seller  told me.</li>
            <li>Glad I got to see what the &amp;#34;fuss&amp;#34; was all about.</li>
            <li>:) It smells, and has the consistency of Nivea body creme.</li>
            <li>Anyway, glad I tried the creme.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS CREAM AND</li>
            <li>THIS TRAVEL SIZE MAKES IT MORE AFFORDABLE.</li>
            <li>Love this cream and with the full-size price tag</li>
            <li>but I was looking for something more &amp;#34;fancy.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s even  authentic La Mer</li>
            <li>for that price i was expecting better results.</li>
            <li>Butter for the face as it glides on and does magic for your face, and I kid you not.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when it came!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the difficulty in applying it due to the thickness, but my face felt great in the AM!</li>
            <li>Find it lightly fragrant and so smooth</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this product really is.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it was Nivea repackaged</li>
            <li>Many drug store products I have tried are far better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and I was pleased with the transaction, just not the product itself.</li>
            <li>If you consider that a 1 ounce jar lasts most women 1+ years, then $150 price tag isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>but I plan on buying the full 1 ounce size.</li>
            <li>so they don t confiscate the full jar</li>
            <li>As with most cult products- highly over rated.</li>
            <li>It is good for a trial size, but could be bigger, right?</li>
            <li>Great way to sample this  creme before purchasing  the expensive full size to se if you like it.&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing and this is definitely the way to buy affordably</li>
            <li>Its worth the price.</li>
            <li>The container is very small about the size of my fingertip--but it is a perfect sample size and keeps me from using too much.</li>
            <li>Just the right moisture not too greasy.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product super expensive but amazing for dry skin not really a wrinkle reducer but an excellent cream</li>
            <li>While it feels lovely to the touch, silky on the skin, provides a sense of instant hydration, I have not noticed any marked improvement on skin texture, feel, nor reduction/ minimization of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting enough for more than one application.  </li>
            <li>and I was glad when I finished this tiny jar</li>
            <li>I of course bought trial sizes first</li>
            <li>I like the product so much that I want to continue buying it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen mostly positive reviews for La Mer, and I understand why.</li>
            <li>The texture of La Mer is a little bit creamier and so easier to apply on the face because it spreads nicely</li>
            <li>It did not do much aside be greasy and filmy</li>
            <li>very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>this is a very affordable alternative.  </li>
            <li>but I would definitely not buy this in a full size when it is so comparable to Nivea.</li>
            <li>This was nothing more than a little sample that is given away at makeup counters .</li>
            <li>lol Sorry but its the truth.</li>
            <li>Nothing dramatic but definitely a superior moisturizer to anything I have used before.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product about ten years ago, and that space station were using it for burns.</li>
            <li>I find Kiehl&#x27;s delivers same bang for much lower buck</li>
            <li>I was excited to get my package earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>A high price for a low performance creme.</li>
            <li>i tried  lots of different brands But Lamer Creme de La Mer is just ordinary cream that feels and smell like  cheap drugstore moisturizer</li>
            <li>It was never widely advertised then,I had to research it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice cream, but way too expensive.  </li>
            <li>, I am just not sure it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly small, but worth the sample$12 to experience luxury.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly small, but worth the sample$12 to experience luxury.</li>
            <li> just got the package and was excited to open this little jar, but find the cream is almost dried up and</li>
            <li> I always by the small one because I can&#x27;t afford the big one, but this stuff works, it last about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I did not read carefully, so the error was mine.  </li>
            <li> BUT I JUST BUY THIS SMALL ONE AND MAKE IT LAST</li>
            <li> Such a ridiculously small container.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not willing to buy again.</li>
            <li> I do see a difference in dark circles and dryness.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money for one or two applications.  </li>
            <li> it is too thik and my face looks very shine plus it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> You need very little and it is highly emollient and thick!  A+++</li>
            <li> Not worth the price !</li>
            <li> so I jumped at this chance to buy it for just  a few dollars.</li>
            <li> Thank God I didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience with these 2 small trial sizes, I will now invest in what has got to the finest moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> Keep a small one in my hand bag for my lips.</li>
            <li> I know this is an expensive item, but the sample size is not labeled as such and</li>
            <li> so no more $500 gift sets for me,</li>
            <li> ; Imagine my surprise when I got this product and it smells and looks the same as his much less expensive creme!</li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream and has a slight scent which does go away after a while.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A HARD TIME SPENDING $150.00 FOR THE 1.OZ JAR</li>
            <li> It was very small</li>
            <li> I use to be obsessed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> What I did not know was that it was totally wrong for my skin in my 30&#x27;s,</li>
            <li> , Iimmediately ordered the one ounce size even though it was quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Disappointing  </li>
            <li> My bad.  </li>
            <li> Doubtful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i tried  lots of different brands But Lamer Creme de La Mer is just ordinary cream that feels and smell like  cheap drugstore moisturizer CeraVe. I agree with most makeup artist and beauty counter store seller  told me. its just a brand period.</li>
            <li> Miracle in a jar. Skin was good to start w..... Now I hear, you look really good.... U always look good but there&#x27;s a extra layer........ Burned my forearms used cream on them. This stuff heals!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a travel size so it&#x27;s VERY tiny, and it cost a lot. I&#x27;ve seen this creme in magazines and I know the regular size runs a couple of hundred bucks. Glad I got to see what the &amp;#34;fuss&amp;#34; was all about. Saw great improvements in my skin for the two days the creme lasted. :) It smells, and has the consistency of Nivea body creme. Wonder if I can use Nivea on my face and get the same results? Doubtful. Anyway, glad I tried the creme.</li>
            <li> best moisturizer I&#x27;ve had so far. It&#x27;s pricey though. I&#x27;d like the price reduced a bit.I am happy with most amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and prompt service! Very satisfied!  Thank you I liked that the product is what it claims to be.</li>
            <li> WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!!!!! You can&#x27;t get La Mer products of any kind for this price, please don&#x27;t use this on your skin, it could be dangerous.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer ! There is nothing out there that can beat this. You need very little and it is highly emollient and thick!  A+++</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look, smell or feel the same. I bought it because of the convenient travel size. I am pretty sure it was Nivea repackaged and I have the massive pimple to prove it.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience with these 2 small trial sizes, I will now invest in what has got to the finest moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever come across. I&#x27;ve seen mostly positive reviews for La Mer, and I understand why. My airplane dehydration is gone in a week. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product about ten years ago, and that space station were using it for burns. It was never widely advertised then,I had to research it. Find it lightly fragrant and so smooth love it. Keep a small one in my hand bag for my lips.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream and has a slight scent which does go away after a while. I had always wanted to try it, but the price stopped me. This was a great chance to see why all the stars use it.I didn&#x27;t care for the difficulty in applying it due to the thickness, but my face felt great in the AM!</li>
            <li> I know this is an expensive item, but the sample size is not labeled as such and I thought I was getting enough for more than one application.  Disappointing  Can&#x27;t judge effectiveness with such a minute quantity.</li>
            <li> Trial size was perfect for me to try out this hyped cream.  I got it for $2 and change.  The shipping was 5 times that!  It&#x27;s a nice cream, but way too expensive.  I find Kiehl&#x27;s delivers same bang for much lower buck</li>
            <li> I was excited to get my package earlier than expected. The product is amazing and this is definitely the way to buy affordably</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CREAM AND THIS TRAVEL SIZE MAKES IT MORE AFFORDABLE. I HAVE A HARD TIME SPENDING $150.00 FOR THE 1.OZ JAR BUT I JUST BUY THIS SMALL ONE AND MAKE IT LAST ABOUT A MONTH.</li>
            <li> I use to be obsessed with this stuff. I have been on a budget for a while so no more $500 gift sets for me, but I wanted to have LA MER back in my life so I jumped at this chance to buy it for just  a few dollars. It was very small but I knew that. What I did not know was that it was totally wrong for my skin in my 30&#x27;s, I 1st purchased this product when I was just 20, 21yo. At 33yo I can honestly say...I&#x27;m over it! It did not do much aside be greasy and filmy and I was glad when I finished this tiny jar so I could use it for something I loved when I travel...lol Sorry but its the truth. If you want to try it - buy it. Its worth the price. It shipped fast and I was pleased with the transaction, just not the product itself.</li>
            <li> I have been using this creme for about a month. I do see a difference in dark circles and dryness. The container is very small about the size of my fingertip--but it is a perfect sample size and keeps me from using too much. I will definitely be reordering this product. It is convenient and, when sold in this volume, inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This product is not a luxury item that is just about the name and prestige. It actually IS wonderful. I have noticed a change in my skin in just a short week of using. Nothing dramatic but definitely a superior moisturizer to anything I have used before. I have used all sorts of moisturizers in all price ranges. Nothing compares to this. If you consider that a 1 ounce jar lasts most women 1+ years, then $150 price tag isn&#x27;t much. That is only $12.50 a month. I of course bought trial sizes first but I plan on buying the full 1 ounce size.I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this product really is.</li>
            <li> just got the package and was excited to open this little jar, but find the cream is almost dried up and the cream surface just reminds me of a drought-hit land. i have ordered 3 jars and all of them are in this condition. very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This product does not have any product name on it whatsoever.  LaMer does not appear anywhere on the container or packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s La Mer; what is not to like?  It is good for a trial size, but could be bigger, right?</li>
            <li> Such a ridiculously small container.  Not worth the money for one or two applications.  I will not be ordering again</li>
            <li> Love this cream and with the full-size price tag this is a very affordable alternative.  My skin has not looked this good in years!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product super expensive but amazing for dry skin not really a wrinkle reducer but an excellent cream</li>
            <li> I bought this travel size product because I saw so many rave reviews from beauty bloggers and the product is nice, I am just not sure it is worth the price. My husband uses Nivea creme and he has amazing skin but I was looking for something more &amp;#34;fancy.&amp;#34; Imagine my surprise when I got this product and it smells and looks the same as his much less expensive creme! The texture of La Mer is a little bit creamier and so easier to apply on the face because it spreads nicely but I would definitely not buy this in a full size when it is so comparable to Nivea.</li>
            <li> Someone will have to explain what all the fuss is over this cream. I had to try it. Thank God I didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money. As with most cult products- highly over rated.</li>
            <li> I have used this crème before and I love it. I carry this in my pocketbook. It is the perfect size for any size handbag</li>
            <li> This is the miracle cream it is touted to be.  You see results almost immediately.  Iwas so impressed, Iimmediately ordered the one ounce size even though it was quite expensive.</li>
            <li> I always by the small one because I can&#x27;t afford the big one, but this stuff works, it last about 3 weeks and I was using it 3 times a day. It just makes my skin feel and look so good. Just the right moisture not too greasy.</li>
            <li> I herd and read comments about this product. Many drug store products I have tried are far better. A high price for a low performance creme.</li>
            <li> Amazing size to try the product. I like the product so much that I want to continue buying it! I will be doing so!</li>
            <li> I purchased this sample because I wanted to see what all the hub bub was about. While it feels lovely to the touch, silky on the skin, provides a sense of instant hydration, I have not noticed any marked improvement on skin texture, feel, nor reduction/ minimization of fine lines. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Great way to sample this  creme before purchasing  the expensive full size to se if you like it.&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased. and nice travel size to take on getaways and air travel so they don t confiscate the full jar</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this moisturizer. I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s even  authentic La Mer but I&#x27;m not willing to buy again.</li>
            <li> This was nothing more than a little sample that is given away at makeup counters . Not worth the price !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly small, but worth the sample$12 to experience luxury. I will be buying it again. I was so excited when it came!</li>
            <li> it is too thik and my face looks very shine plus it is too expensive. for that price i was expecting better results.</li>
            <li> This is perfection in a jar! Butter for the face as it glides on and does magic for your face, and I kid you not. The nice ladies at La Mer will tell you that with this perfect product, you never need eye cream. This product does everything you can imagine, and it leaves your skin so dewy and moist, you will never use anything else on your face. Anyone with a touch of Rosea will also love this!</li>
            <li> I did not read carefully, so the error was mine.  I thought if I purchased the one ounce jar, I could buy the travel size for $10 in the same shipment.  My bad.  Otherwise the rating would be 5 stars.</li>
