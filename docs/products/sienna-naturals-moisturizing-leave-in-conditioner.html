            <li>It&#x27;s been 12 hours since I did her hair &amp; it still looks great</li>
            <li>I am happy I decided to branch out yet again and try something I have never used before.</li>
            <li>I did not find it added a great deal of body though.</li>
            <li>It also makes a very nice lotion.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, just not for me.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This I love!</li>
            <li>I like this leave in; just that my hair wanted more moisture!</li>
            <li>Great conditioner for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells stronger than I would have liked, but if I rinse it out</li>
            <li>I put another oil for shine over it that has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Should be excellent for those with normal hair.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes my hair just great, but most importantly - IT HAS NO SMELL.  </li>
            <li>Light hold, smells good, moisturizers, and detangles...</li>

            <li>My favorite is the leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>it is okay.</li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased every time.</li>
            <li>The smell is exotic, not fruity.  </li>
            <li>It dries very fast - good for using on hands.  </li>
            <li>so easy.</li>
            <li>If you have children with tangle issues or fine hair like mine...</li>
            <li>This light weight leave-in</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it gives my extremely dry curly hair great slip and moisture with no build up.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special about this I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again,</li>
            <li>I love that this product has very high quality ingredients but does not cost an arm and a leg</li>
            <li>Love the whole collection.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I have color treated hair, and this really provides the moisture I need to leave my hair looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>and I do not have oily/hard residue or a super itchy scalp by the end of the week on wash day.  </li>
            <li>It takes a day or so for it to calm down some, LOL.</li>
            <li>Absolute heaven!!  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for something with more natural ingredients and without dimethicone in it.</li>
            <li>My hair always gets tons of static in it when I use products that contain dimethicone, which is a silicone oil used in a lot of leave in conditioners whether they are drugstore, natural, or organic products.</li>
            <li>I did hope for more body, but will buy again for the detangling affect that is like no other I&#x27;ve tried (including Wen).</li>
            <li>Although I like the Nexxus conditioner&#x27;s initial texture a little better, this one still works great</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, it loosens my curls for a little bit of stretch, which is great for if I am really rushed and have to do a wash and go.</li>
            <li>This is very important because I use this almost daily</li>
            <li>First time ever hearing of or trying this product</li>
            <li>This way you sure it really stays in your hair and doesn&#x27;t drip with extra water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not surprised I love this product since I&#x27;ve used the hair/body shampoo (trial size), plus the reviews helped.  </li>
            <li>but now i get the large bottle because I don&#x27;t ever want to run out.</li>
            <li>It works fine, since my hair gets oily just next to its roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, anyway, after this conditioner the hair feels very soft and smooth (except my dried ends, but I didn&#x27;t expect that they would magically change).</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It as also very convenient in the sense,</li>
            <li>Will purchase again, plus the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients in this product, especially the baobab oil, I have sensitive skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li>This is the first leave in that makes my hair so wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li>I dont have time for fancy hairstyles and just want my products to be reasonably priced, provide my hair moisture, and leave my hair feeling &#x27;natural&#x27; without a lot of build up.  </li>
            <li>I have that wild look - very puffed up....</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every 2 days for last couple years, and when I wash it I try to put shampoo just on my scalp, so it won&#x27;t contact the rest of my hair and won&#x27;t dry it more.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for over 10 years, and the one thing that has been consistent about my hair care routine is that it has to be SIMPLE!</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair feeling nourished and soft even after my hair dries.  </li>
            <li>leaves my twists silky soft.  </li>
            <li>was looking for something natural, which would help me to moisture the ends of my hair, make it easier to brush and that I won&#x27;t have to wash it away.</li>
            <li>so soft making twisting my hair</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I hesitate to look at the ingredients in my old conditioner.</li>
            <li>The soft hint of a scent is just that... soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair soft without leaving residue</li>
            <li>Before trying this, I&#x27;d stripped back my hair moisture products to just water and coconut oil because I was fed up with all of the &#x27;gunk&#x27; most other products left in my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and sort of thin.</li>
            <li>So, the ends of my hair is the main issue - they are prone to get dry and split.</li>
            <li>I am a long time natural, for 10 years.  </li>

            <li> I also bought a new brush (this very popular one, which untangle your hair without pulling it out; little plastic thing for $10 (!); made me so mad, but it works, so I am not complaining), so I am not sure who does the &amp;#34;untangling&amp;#34; trick - a brush or this conditioner.</li>

            <li> term effect - unknown (may come back to update it couple month later</li>
            <li> Most leave-ins (other than the expensive Wen variety) doesn&#x27;t seem to work well.</li>
            <li> My hair reaches about waist length when stretched.  </li>
            <li> but I know it tends to get dry</li>
            <li> When I wash it and it is dry</li>
            <li> My hair is just extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product for long enough to say if it prevents split or dried ends.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer to put it on a dumb hair (my hair dries naturally), after I already got out of the shower and walked around the house for 15 min.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use Wen first of all (which is rather expensive).</li>
            <li> that if you for example forgot to put it in your hair in time, you can just make your hair a little bit wet again and put the conditioner in (making it wet helps to spread the product well)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is a natural and sort of not great (to me) smell.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking greasy!</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews - it doesn&#x27;t make your hair neither heavy nor oily/greasy.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this leave is used by my entire household, so we order often.</li>
            <li> Before saying anything about the product, let me tell you a little bit about myself and what were my expectations when I were purchasing this item.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think my days of wandering through the endless forest of hair products has ended (at least when it comes to shampoo and conditioner).</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to describe my hair</li>
            <li> I usually section it into four braids and leave it until it dries.</li>
            <li> (I mean I do - like 1 in a year).</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for Nexxus leave-in conditioner which has gotten ridiculous in price.</li>
            <li> + under the sun I lose my color and it becomes this brassy color (which I hate).</li>

            <li> It has no smell!  It moisturizes my hair just great, but most importantly - IT HAS NO SMELL.  Absolute heaven!!  It also makes a very nice lotion.  It dries very fast - good for using on hands.  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Good product. My 4c hair loves it</li>
            <li> I have been natural for over 10 years, and the one thing that has been consistent about my hair care routine is that it has to be SIMPLE! I dont have time for fancy hairstyles and just want my products to be reasonably priced, provide my hair moisture, and leave my hair feeling &#x27;natural&#x27; without a lot of build up.  Before trying this, I&#x27;d stripped back my hair moisture products to just water and coconut oil because I was fed up with all of the &#x27;gunk&#x27; most other products left in my hair.  I am now using this leave-in conditioner and love it for way it leaves my hair feeling nourished and soft even after my hair dries.  As an added bonus, it loosens my curls for a little bit of stretch, which is great for if I am really rushed and have to do a wash and go.</li>
            <li> I am a long time natural, for 10 years.  I wear my hair in twists for 90% of the time.  My hair reaches about waist length when stretched.  I wash my hair only once a week and I workout a lot.  I needed a product to provide daily moisture without build up.  This light weight leave-in leaves my twists silky soft.  I can&#x27;t stop putting my hands in my hair all day!  My hair just soaks it up and I do not have oily/hard residue or a super itchy scalp by the end of the week on wash day.  I love that this product has very high quality ingredients but does not cost an arm and a leg AND it&#x27;s on Amazon Prime...FREE SHIPPING!  This is very important because I use this almost daily and I am not trying to break the bank on hair products!</li>
            <li> This is the first leave in that makes my hair so wonderfully soft. I purchased the small bottle first but now i get the large bottle because I don&#x27;t ever want to run out. Very good for type 4 hair.</li>

My hair is very fine and sort of thin. However it find a way to get tangled a lot! I am trying to grow my hair, so I don&#x27;t cut it (I mean I do - like 1 in a year).

It as also very convenient in the sense, that if you for example forgot to put it in your hair in time, you can just make your hair a little bit wet again and put the conditioner in (making it wet helps to spread the product well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;it won&#x27;t harm you for sure.&lt;br /&gt;the majority of ingredients are natural.&lt;br /&gt;it somewhat helps to brush your hair without pulling it out&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily/greasy&lt;br /&gt;long term effect - unknown (may come back to update it couple month later if I won&#x27;t forget)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions? - ask under my comment :)lps to spread the product well)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;it won&#x27;t harm you for sure.&lt;br /&gt;the majority of ingredients are natural.&lt;br /&gt;it somewhat helps to brush your hair without pulling it out&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily/greasy&lt;br /&gt;long term effect - unknown (may come back to update it couple month later if I won&#x27;t forget)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Questions? - ask under my comment :)</li>
            <li> Love the whole collection. My favorite is the leave-in conditioner.  I have a 4b hair and and the leave-in makes my hair feel so soft making twisting my hair so easy. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner. I have been looking for something with more natural ingredients and without dimethicone in it. My hair always gets tons of static in it when I use products that contain dimethicone, which is a silicone oil used in a lot of leave in conditioners whether they are drugstore, natural, or organic products. This conditioner is wonderful. It leaves my hair feeling very soft, not weighed down, and not oily at all. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I have color treated hair, and this really provides the moisture I need to leave my hair looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> It smells stronger than I would have liked, but if I rinse it out it is okay.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for Nexxus leave-in conditioner which has gotten ridiculous in price. Saw one on Amazon for like $60. Give me a break. Although I like the Nexxus conditioner&#x27;s initial texture a little better, this one still works great and it&#x27;s all natural. I hesitate to look at the ingredients in my old conditioner. Very happy with my choice.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and smells great!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! My daughter is 4 &amp; I&#x27;ve been searching for a product like this. It&#x27;s been 12 hours since I did her hair &amp; it still looks great &amp; she even wore a winter hat outside at recess today &amp; had dance class.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for fine hair.  A small amount goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking greasy!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to describe my hair but I know it tends to get dry and I believe it would be considered on the coarse side. When I wash it and it is dry I have that wild look - very puffed up....I suppose one would say it is frizzy and dizzy looking. I usually section it into four braids and leave it until it dries. It takes a day or so for it to calm down some, LOL. I do not like using the blow dryer but I do use heated tools which I think may be doing my hair in. I have tried a variety of products for my hair. First time ever hearing of or trying this product and oh my! I am so happy! Knowing first off that it is made up of natural ingredients is great and the way my hair felt after using it is just wonderful! I ordered both this leave in conditioner and the shampoo. I am in love. I am happy I decided to branch out yet again and try something I have never used before. I think my days of wandering through the endless forest of hair products has ended (at least when it comes to shampoo and conditioner).</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I LOVE this product line. Seriously, this leave is used by my entire household, so we order often. I use the leave I&#x27;m as a rinse out, as a shampoo when I co-poo (co-wash) and as a leave in. I&#x27;m pleased every time. The soft hint of a scent is just that... soft. Non greasy and I have no issues with tangles when I use it. I LOVE it best combined with Sienna Naturals Shampoo :-)</li>
            <li> This I love! It removes all my tangles. I use Wen first of all (which is rather expensive). Most leave-ins (other than the expensive Wen variety) doesn&#x27;t seem to work well. This removes all my tangles. I did not find it added a great deal of body though. The smell is a natural and sort of not great (to me) smell. I put another oil for shine over it that has a nice smell. This will not give shine. I did hope for more body, but will buy again for the detangling affect that is like no other I&#x27;ve tried (including Wen). It release all my tangles which my hair is soooo tangly. If you have children with tangle issues or fine hair like mine...you will like the detangling. The rest...hmmm...It might improve the hair, but I have not had it long enough to testify to this. I can&#x27;t see added body or shine...but wonderful softness and detangling! I will rebuy for this reason.</li>
            <li> Light hold, smells good, moisturizers, and detangles... Perfect for natural curls.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again,</li>
            <li> I like this leave in; just that my hair wanted more moisture! So I had to move on.  I would suggest you give it a try.  Should be excellent for those with normal hair.  My hair is just extremely dry.  The smell is exotic, not fruity.  This is a good product, just not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised I love this product since I&#x27;ve used the hair/body shampoo (trial size), plus the reviews helped.  I love the ingredients in this product, especially the baobab oil, I have sensitive skin and eczema.  This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it gives my extremely dry curly hair great slip and moisture with no build up.  Will purchase again, plus the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioners I have used in a while. It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair soft without leaving residue</li>
