            <li>Naturint accurately portrays the color you can expect out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>this hair color is a light sandy beige.</li>
            <li>It gives beautiful blond color, covers all gray and stays for long time.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for offering this at such a great price.</li>

            <li>This product will lighten your hair as shown...of course, all hair textures, etc., are different, but in my case, it comes very light</li>
            <li>i am in my 30s and 75% or more white.</li>
            <li>but when I followed the instructions and completed the time specified or beyond the color my results were usually much darker than shown.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much money and look blond.</li>
            <li>I just love this product and bought if for such a low price here that I recommended it to all my family who use grocery store dyes.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to those wanting to get the results they expect when reading color chart.</li>
            <li>it smells like wet cardboard and a mild cat piss order (but that is my opinion)....</li>
            <li>I am a naturally &amp;#34;dishwater&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for every person who is looking for natural hair color.</li>
