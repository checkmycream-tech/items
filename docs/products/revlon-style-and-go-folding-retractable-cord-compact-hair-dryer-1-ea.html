            <li>The way the cord and handle fold up makes it perfect to store.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>

            <li>I, reccomend it to anyone that&#x27;s traveling GREAT DRYER! !</li>
            <li>The size was perfect for my gym bag and the color was an added bonus.</li>
            <li>Regarding the posts saying it&#x27;s a good travel dryer - it&#x27;s not!  </li>
            <li>Great Travel hair dryer.</li>
            <li>but it works great.</li>
            <li>Good hair dryer, its been a year and the chord still retracts.</li>
            <li>Received in good condition, was as described.</li>
            <li>Good product sofar.</li>
            <li>Rationally, I tell myself that&#x27;s probably a good thing:</li>
            <li>This is very light and compact, both of which qualities I value greatly.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>I chose this kind of dryer beecause</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the cord was about 2 feet longer.</li>
            <li>Cannot expect much more for the price.  </li>
            <li>Files everything it said it does and more.</li>
            <li>Love the attachment.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>and I gladly put this in the recommend column.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the foldable option, really does a great job  </li>
            <li>Cord recoils easily and folds for storage.  </li>
            <li>Compact and easy to store.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient, great for rainy days when my hair would never dry on its own.</li>
            <li>If it was a little longer, this would be the perfect traveling dryer!</li>
            <li>seemed cheap &amp; flimsy -</li>
            <li>Light weight and works well.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>excessive heat isn&#x27;t good for anyone&#x27;s hair and the maxed-out settings I habitually used on my old full size dryer probably wasn&#x27;t very good for my hair either.  </li>
            <li>Loved the bright blue but sent it back.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping</li>
            <li>So far the dryer appears to be well constructed, has good balance when held, and I particularly like the retractable cord.</li>
            <li>The retractable cord mechanism works better than others that I&#x27;ve tried, allowing for the consistently easy retraction of the entire cord length.  </li>
            <li>great little hair dryer nonetheless</li>
            <li>The lightness of it makes it easy to use and it folds up into a small, tidy, easy to store package.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the description clearly says &amp;#34;Concentrator attachment for precise drying and styling&amp;#34;, it was not in the box.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what she need it to do.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s worth it to spend a few dollars more to get something much better.</li>
            <li>a side note this blow dryer is plenty strong enough to blow out the leafs and</li>
            <li>Dries hair fast, efficient and really&lt;br /&gt;like</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>such that get in the ski light of my trailer.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a weird quirk about it where it switches over to cool shot on its own every two minutes or so without me even pressing the cool shot button.</li>
            <li>This will work for that, but I was also upgrading from an old dryer and thought this one would help my hair from frizzing because of the ceramic and tourmaline coatings and higher wattage.</li>
            <li>Why pay more and get less?</li>
            <li>I had an older version that lasted</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>and it worked just as well as my normal blowdryer.</li>
            <li>Small, compact, light weight!</li>
            <li>Not much difference than the cool shot button.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps, having only a high and a low setting as opposed to individual controls for heat and speed, the manufacturer elected to set the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting at a more conservative, middle of the road level so as to not risk frying the hair of people with more delicate hair?  </li>
            <li>I attempted to take it apart and repair, but &amp;#34;bad idea jeans&amp;#34; - it completely came apart.  </li>
            <li>That lasts around 15 seconds each time it does it, which negates any benefit I would have had in having a higher wattage dryer to dry my hair faster.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something smaller, since I wanted it mainly as a travel dryer.</li>
            <li>My mistake on this one--I needed super light and while this was small and foldable, it was too heavy for my luggage.  </li>
            <li>I am a senior male with medium-to-short straight hair and I use this product daily.  </li>
            <li>Good, standard hair dryer for the price, but the retractable cord failed after 5 months.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too loud and too big -</li>
            <li>It was powerful when it worked though, and dried well.</li>
            <li>What makes this a four star review instead of a five star review is that, despite having the same wattage and features of larger hair dryers, it definitely dries hair more slowly.  </li>
            <li>Small but powerful.</li>

            <li> I had to tap it on the counter to get it to turn on half the time.</li>
            <li> It blows air just a little warmer than room temp.  </li>
            <li> I needed a small hair dryer for the gym.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy with the heat setting for on low.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s not good.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good hair dryer, its been a year and the chord still retracts.</li>
            <li> Great Travel hair dryer. The cord retracts perfectly. It might be a little louder than my other hair dryer but it works great.</li>
            <li> The wife thinks it&#x27;s too noisy and doesn&#x27;t blow as well as her travel hair dryer. I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s not good. I&#x27;m not going to be buying her girly stuff from now on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too loud and too big - I assumed since it was travel dryer it would&lt;br /&gt;be smaller size and lighter weight.  Dries hair fast, efficient and really&lt;br /&gt;like the retractable cord</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I wanted.</li>
            <li> seemed cheap &amp; flimsy - I returned it.</li>
            <li> Not a great dryer, but not a bad one.  Cannot expect much more for the price.  I was unhappy with the heat setting for on low.  It blows air just a little warmer than room temp.  Not much difference than the cool shot button.  It also didn&#x27;t come with any attachments. I guess that is my fault, I missed that in the description.  Will not buy again.  Donated it to my local charity.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this dryer. Small but powerful. Files everything it said it does and more. Love the attachment. Thanks</li>
            <li> I chose this kind of dryer beecause it had the funtion of retracting cord. when I checked this funtion. I found it worked, but the cord could not be retracted entirely, it only could be retracted 80 percent. that was why I gave the prouduct three asterisk.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair as well as the Revlon one it replaced but my only complaint is that the cord is shorter than the old one. I like the folding handle because I take it with me when traveling. I don&#x27;t care for the hair dryers provided in hotel rooms.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.  Cord recoils easily and folds for storage.  Dryer is a bit noisy but does the job!</li>
            <li> loud, low blowing power sadly</li>
            <li> Good, standard hair dryer for the price, but the retractable cord failed after 5 months.  This, coupled with the folding handle, was the reason I purchased.  I attempted to take it apart and repair, but &amp;#34;bad idea jeans&amp;#34; - it completely came apart.  In the market for a replacement.  I had an older version that lasted 7+ years, ironically.</li>
            <li> I needed a small hair dryer for the gym. It does dry hair, however I bought this based on 3 features:&lt;br /&gt;*retractable cord&lt;br /&gt;*folding handle&lt;br /&gt;*concentrator attachment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retractable cord and folding handle work and seem reliably sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Although the description clearly says &amp;#34;Concentrator attachment for precise drying and styling&amp;#34;, it was not in the box. Also, the box pictured and the one I received differentiate only by the missing concentrator. However, the model number on the box matches the item title.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use in my fifth wheel camper.  The way the cord and handle fold up makes it perfect to store.&lt;br /&gt;As a side note this blow dryer is plenty strong enough to blow out the leafs and such that get in the ski light of my trailer.</li>
            <li> Received in good condition, was as described. I was hoping for something smaller, since I wanted it mainly as a travel dryer. But I&#x27;m still satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for my travel trailer and it is absolutely perfect!!! Small, compact, light weight! It definitely takes longer to dry my hair with this dryer but it&#x27;s worth it! I would agree with other reviews about the cord being too short. If it was a little longer, this would be the perfect traveling dryer!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because I need a dryer I can use internationally. This will work for that, but I was also upgrading from an old dryer and thought this one would help my hair from frizzing because of the ceramic and tourmaline coatings and higher wattage. I have seen no difference between this dryer and my ancient one. Also, it has a weird quirk about it where it switches over to cool shot on its own every two minutes or so without me even pressing the cool shot button. That lasts around 15 seconds each time it does it, which negates any benefit I would have had in having a higher wattage dryer to dry my hair faster.</li>
            <li> I am a senior male with medium-to-short straight hair and I use this product daily.  So far the dryer appears to be well constructed, has good balance when held, and I particularly like the retractable cord. (although if does fight a bit over the last 10-11 inches when retracting it. . .).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great little hair dryer nonetheless and I gladly put this in the recommend column.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!  Absolutely no problems with the cord.  Highly recommend it.  Fold up feature is a plus.  Why pay more and get less?</li>
            <li> Compact and easy to store. Contrary to other people, I have not had any problems with the cord retraction. I love this product.</li>
            <li> My mistake on this one--I needed super light and while this was small and foldable, it was too heavy for my luggage.  Loved the bright blue but sent it back.</li>
            <li> Just what was needed.  Quick shipping</li>
            <li> I love the foldable option, really does a great job  I, reccomend it to anyone that&#x27;s traveling GREAT DRYER! !</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife at Christmas to replace another brand that finally wore out.  She loves it!  Does exactly what she need it to do.  Good product sofar.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed. It is very convenient, great for rainy days when my hair would never dry on its own. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I ended up having to return this because it didn&#x27;t work with my Deva Curl attachment but I can say I turned it on and it worked just as well as my normal blowdryer. The size was perfect for my gym bag and the color was an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Does not retract properly.</li>
            <li> Retractable cord stopped working all the way within a week, and the hair dryer itself only worked sporadically. I had to tap it on the counter to get it to turn on half the time. It was powerful when it worked though, and dried well. Regarding the posts saying it&#x27;s a good travel dryer - it&#x27;s not!  It&#x27;s not marketed as a travel size, and it&#x27;s well over double the size of any travel dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. Overall, it&#x27;s worth it to spend a few dollars more to get something much better.</li>
            <li> Light weight and works well.  It would be nice if the cord was about 2 feet longer.</li>
            <li> This is very light and compact, both of which qualities I value greatly.  The lightness of it makes it easy to use and it folds up into a small, tidy, easy to store package.  The retractable cord mechanism works better than others that I&#x27;ve tried, allowing for the consistently easy retraction of the entire cord length.  What makes this a four star review instead of a five star review is that, despite having the same wattage and features of larger hair dryers, it definitely dries hair more slowly.  Perhaps, having only a high and a low setting as opposed to individual controls for heat and speed, the manufacturer elected to set the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting at a more conservative, middle of the road level so as to not risk frying the hair of people with more delicate hair?  Rationally, I tell myself that&#x27;s probably a good thing: excessive heat isn&#x27;t good for anyone&#x27;s hair and the maxed-out settings I habitually used on my old full size dryer probably wasn&#x27;t very good for my hair either.  Still, when you&#x27;re running late and in a hurry, you may sometimes begrudge the extra minute or two it takes for this model to completely dry your hair.</li>
