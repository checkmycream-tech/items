            <li> It even had a little tag like keychain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very weak and the scent doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> You could not go wrong for summer with the undertones of floral scents.</li>
            <li> Sorry can&#x27;t find it at Coach website.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping and fantastic product</li>
            <li> Great price for a frangrance I have loved and used for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Love my new perfume. I think it may be being discontinued, which may explain the lower price and why I couldn&#x27;t find it at any department store or the Coach store.  Seems like the real deal to me.</li>
            <li> This perfume is I like taste, everyone loved brand and flavor is not the same, but this is the least I love, is worth buying</li>
            <li> I love this parfum  and it&#x27;s become my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent. Lightly floral with hints of lilac and lilies. Ultra feminine. Unfortunately for me, Coach seems to be phasing it out in favor of the more youthful bolder scents which are too spicey or overwhelming for me. I noticed they still have the &amp;#34;toilet water&amp;#34; around, but don&#x27;t be fooled. It&#x27;s very weak and the scent doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Smells great.! I love this.!</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fragrance beautiful as always!!!! Sexy, sophisticated, alluring...coach should never stop making this signature smell..its only thing that keeps me buying from coach..unless I receive a coupon..lol</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  She was the one that picked it out and even found it on Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST EAU De PARFUM THAT COACH CAME OUT WITH AND IT STILL MY FAVORITE.THIS IS THE MY MOST FAVORITE OF ALL! FOREVER AND ALWAYS THE SMELL IS THE BEST!</li>
            <li> Awesome as usual. My favorite!</li>
            <li> Like many perfumes, it doesn&#x27;t smell good until it soaks into the skin.  It took about 30 minutes for me.  This is the real thing; just be sure to look up the definition of Eau de parfum before you say otherwise.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, just as expected</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom for her birthday. When she opened the present she flipped out!!! She was so happy!! She immediately pulled the perfume out and put it on. It smells great, just like the more expensive one AND it lasts. She wears it every day. :D I will be ordering this again</li>
            <li> This is a wonderl spirted light fragrance that really smells classy. You could not go wrong for summer with the undertones of floral scents. It has a beautiful bottle. The only caution you may need to reapply as it does not hang around.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent. Classy and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and exactly what I wanted!!!!!  Price was a little cheaper here. Would buy this again from seller! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume! Purchased fragrance on a cruise, but was only Eau de toilette, and not very long-lasting. This Amazon seller had the perfume for a better price, and I could not be happier!</li>
            <li> I love the scent. I ordered the eau de parfum so that the scent is more concentrated and would last longer on my skin. However, I received the eau de toilette. I couldn&#x27;t return it since it was considered a hazardous material but I did get a refund.</li>
            <li> Perfume was exactly as if I had bought it at the department store. In box and brand new, authentic, smells wonderful. It arrived on time and was easy as pie.</li>
            <li> Great product!  You can always count on Coach for quality goods and this is just another example of that.  Not one of those overpowering perfumes. Will be buying more in the future for sure!  Would make a great gift and not too pricey.</li>
            <li> My wife says the scent is not as Strong as when this product was purchased at Carson pirie Scott she decided to finished but will not purchase here again</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister and it smells amazing. Brand new in box and very pretty. It even had a little tag like keychain.</li>
            <li> I shopped around (gift for my sister and money is tight) and this was a great price.  She loved it!</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh fragrance...not overpowering.  This has become one of my favorite colognes.  Will definitely buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light fragrance good for everyday wear. I am not a big perfum wearer, but this (and the Coach Legacy) is my fav!! A definite must!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume !  One of my very favorite !  There&#x27;s not a lot of perfume I like !  I like a mild , sweet smell !!  This coach perfume is all of that and more !!!</li>
            <li> I got my package today i was very sattisfied! I could not find the parfum anywhere all i could find is eau de toillet which is not as good. Eau de parfum is much stronger and worth purchasing and paying a little more. If you love this fragrance i would highly suggest purchasing from here and it is not a knock off this is real Coach perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing and for a reasonable price. I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase. I love this perfume. :)</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and smells great. Very satisfied!!I would definitely purchase again...Also comes new and wrapped in packaging so you know its the real thing.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on this perfume . I&#x27;m 29 years old and it&#x27;s my &amp;#34;go-to.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Sorry can&#x27;t find it at Coach website.</li>
