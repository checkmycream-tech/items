            <li>I got a great magenta color.</li>
            <li>Great kit, although I do think they should include two pairs of gloves for people who dye their hair over two days.</li>
            <li>Both worked great on me.</li>
            <li>I was 100% happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the color itself is great.</li>
            <li>The color is great but it doesn&#x27;t stay in the hair or wash out.  </li>
            <li>He gets his money regardless and without regard to if his customers are happy.</li>
            <li>Turned out great.</li>
            <li>I get lots of people saying they love the color!!     </li>

            <li>great color that lasts fairly well</li>
            <li>It has been 2 weeks and my color is still strong, and bright!!</li>
            <li>This hair dye was very easy to use!</li>
            <li>When I washed it off, it came out a bright magenta.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does dye your hair really bright.</li>
            <li>For newbie like me just getting on the bright hair dye scene and don&#x27;t have peeps watching out for us</li>
            <li>I have been using bright hair colors for about 18 years.</li>
            <li>My hair came out this really bright hot-pink color.</li>
            <li>I swear it has a  mind of its own lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll also ruin a perfectly good manicure, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have a good grip on the process.  </li>
            <li>I loved the look and the application was easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I skipped this test and lucked out, but it would be a good idea to do it.  </li>
            <li>Good news is it did not fry my hair.</li>
            <li>enjoy perfectly plum hair!!</li>
            <li>my friend also loved it</li>
            <li>Also the bleach works really good.</li>
            <li>GOOD LUCK</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see why this would get any good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use any bleach because my hair is light and the color was perfect!</li>
            <li>I loved my hair and the color.</li>
            <li>I loved this dye, I have been dying my hair with semi&#x27;s for over 7 years, and I&#x27;m VERY pleased.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!!!</li>
            <li>Well, I can honestly say it turned a bright fuchsia/pink color instead.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t use the bleach (more for me)!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this dye!</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with the color!  </li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time, people love it!</li>
            <li>I love Splat!</li>
            <li>Nothing is better than Spat!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t bleach my hair and love it!</li>
            <li>The color and easy application make this a great product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in almost 2 months and my hair is still super bright!</li>
            <li>The dye however is amazing.</li>
            <li>Splat is just an amazing hair dye company, and the colors have lasted me for months at a time, without a need to redye.</li>
            <li>oh, the dye smells kind of like fruit.</li>
            <li>I probably should have known that I couldn&#x27;t get streaks without foils, but that&#x27;s my own failing.</li>
            <li>So I kind of have both sides of the spectrum for this review.</li>
            <li>However, we liked the difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dyeing my own hair for years</li>
            <li>the kind you use for scrubbing yourself..was good for getting stains off skin real quick.</li>
            <li>And the shade was still nice</li>
            <li>The bleach didn&#x27;t work for beans,  but the hair dye was very intense and brilliant.  </li>
            <li>Splat hair dye is just the most amazing thing on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done them all, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Old Cotten T-shirt is the best!</li>
            <li>this stuff does NOT fade very quickly at all!</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone wanting an easy do it yourself highlight!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so vibrant and beautiful.</li>
            <li>All the splat colors were vibrant and beautiful and one of the MP colors didn&#x27;t even turn out.</li>
            <li>time I know to bleach it before I get the kit... &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>get again &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I process my hair a LOT and have been dying it one color or another for the better part of twenty years.</li>
            <li>the quality of the bleach was okay.</li>
            <li>it could have been better, but you get</li>
            <li>i love the quality of this dye.</li>
            <li>It works better than Manic Panic or Punky Color.</li>
            <li>So I will probably try a couple alternatives to see if I can get comparable color with more longevity.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s more of a permanent stain than anything.</li>
            <li>This did not happen to me, nor does it happen to most people.  </li>
            <li>Glad Plastic Wrap&lt;br</li>
            <li>Follow bleach directions and make sure to use gloves.  </li>
            <li>Put the dye into your hair, making sure to get everything.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Hope this helped some people out! :)</li>
            <li>I like how it looks post-fade better than SPLAT&#x27;s purple.</li>
            <li>This stuff is wayyyyy better then even the amplified version of Manic Panic.</li>
            <li>so we reapplied the dye and waited 40 more minutes...</li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love your bleach, but that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m ever going to get.</li>
            <li>so i did have to go out and buy more bleach..</li>
            <li>i love the stuff and use it all the time, for my self and others...</li>
            <li>This color will show through even if you dye over it, so be sure you want that</li>
            <li>Before using splat we asked a beautician that we know well, and she said it would be okay because my daughter&#x27;s hair was extremely healthy.</li>
            <li>It did take a bit to get it to stop running off in the shower, but I find that this is way better than Manic Panic.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my favorite product to use out of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>, I had darker ends which is okay</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments and was told I should keep it permanent.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to put Vaseline around your face, ears, neck line, etc., however, if you do get it on your skin you can scrub it off with a buff puff in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I love dying my hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look) and it faded the color quite a bit... still cute</li>
            <li>Despite this, I love how my hair looks :)</li>
            <li>If you want to be able to brush or comb through your hair afterwards, don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FAVORITE OR ALL TIME HAIR COLOR.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product for the money!</li>
            <li>My sheets are ruined, and as I write this I am sitting in the bath tub which is now filled woth rose tinged water.</li>
            <li>If you leave it in for the minimum time, it will look more blond.</li>
            <li>Also, it would be better to buy color protecting shampoo/conditioner, as it will stay in longer.</li>
            <li>If I cared more I&#x27;d pay more.</li>
            <li>I wish the bleach was a lower level, and the kit had more color...</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars but would gladly give 5 stars if they sold the colors without the bleach kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You need patience, SOME sort of experience or a friend with experience, a steady hand and about 4-6 hours to do a great job.</li>
            <li>Splat bleach was actually very good, it turned my hair a nice light blonde, so there are no complaints about that.</li>
            <li>so good for the price and really easy to use for first time hair-dyers :)</li>
            <li>this product is SO easy to use, even for a first-time dyer :)  </li>
            <li>I can see this being good if you just want highlights or streaks, but for the love of all things do not try to dye your whole head.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is user friendly and looks great!</li>
            <li>For me that works it ends up looking like i have a very cool fade done on my hair.</li>
            <li>I was VERY happy with the result I got from bleaching then coloring my hair the pink fetish color.</li>
            <li>Shipped on time, everything perfect as I expected it.</li>
            <li>But that extreme color is perfect for your hair.</li>
            <li>A good company would have mailed me a new one!</li>
            <li>They tear easily and this color WILL STAIN EVERYTHING it comes in contact with.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow directions.</li>
            <li>Your hair will easily get damaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now the surprise, I am 70 years young!,and going strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Instead, the insanely strong bleach over-processed my hair.</li>
            <li>Strong stuff, burned too.    </li>
            <li>Instead, the insanely strong bleach over-processed my hair.</li>
            <li>My sister tried hers first and tried to get a nice purple color.</li>
            <li>It took just fine, but it was a pain to get into my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and easy in a pinch.</li>
            <li>I guess it would be fine if you just want a streak or two</li>
            <li>It was strong, and the fumes didn&#x27;t feel great on my eyes, but overall, that part of the kit wasn&#x27;t lacking in the slightest.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m VERY satisfied!</li>
            <li>The best for true, bright and long lasting color.</li>
            <li>She has naturally light brown hair</li>
            <li>A hair dryer would work great, but I do not have a hair dryer, so I just put my head in front of a heated air vent for several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My hair is light brown</li>
            <li>I did not use the bleach because I was scared of too much color to be honest.  </li>
            <li>hair is light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually got convinced with the great comments about it.</li>
            <li>Thankfully the company saw fit to send me a refund.</li>
            <li>finally i took the dye out of my hair and it was a great color for the 6 days it lasted after taking three showers with no shampoo</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had much better success</li>
            <li>and then the rest was a light putrid purple.</li>
            <li>Like I said, result was good, but how fast it washed out is barely worth it.</li>
            <li>Nice bright pink color.</li>
            <li>I would think it should last more than 5 days!!</li>
            <li>The pink in my hair is bold and gorgeous, more magenta than I&#x27;d like but that&#x27;s because the bleach, still love the color.</li>
            <li>the colors are vibrant and amazing.</li>
            <li>The 3 small packets in this kit would be ideal for highlights but more would be needed to dye your full head.  </li>
            <li>Overall this product is pretty good!</li>
            <li>It took me 2 months from original contact to call them in regards to the issue.</li>
            <li>I used this product first and was IN LOVE with it.</li>
            <li>It came out a beautiful pink.</li>
            <li>It took me 2 months from original contact to call them in regards to the issue.</li>
            <li>It was a lot of fun!  </li>
            <li>Looked super super awesome for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li>we loved the original super vibrant color, but the best part of this pink is how it fades into a beautiful almost natural looking pink.  </li>
            <li>and btw I washed my tub the day before and thought omg its going to stain what I just took time to clean the day before it rinsed out</li>
            <li>/&gt;Helpful tips&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: DO NOT HAVE CLEAN HAIR.</li>
            <li>If you want a halfway clean bathroom after you&#x27;re done, don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li>It had good color and did not dry my hair out like a lot of hair dyes.</li>
            <li>have to say we will be using special effects to fix my friends hair and to redo mine when needed, I don&#x27;t trust the results of this one.</li>
            <li>To get the color really bright we left the color in for twice the time recommended.</li>
            <li>My daughter saved her money and bought the luscious raspberry for a bright red look.  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, for some reason, had the sudden urge of wanting to dye my hair in a bright funky color.</li>
            <li>The instructions give a recommended 24 hour skin test to perform before doing the full hair dye.  </li>
            <li>Try a different bleach but the dye is definitely good quality.</li>
            <li>I washed them out, using cool water, shampoo, etc.</li>
            <li>pink, a more than likely often used color was wonderful.</li>
            <li>Others comments are true it will color your tub.  </li>
            <li>I really wish there was more product in the kit.</li>
            <li>Frequent washing in warm water will make the color fade faster</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s true for all of the Splat colours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool, but looks nothing like the box.</li>
            <li>Not bad,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty easy to dye.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>Seriously, it looks AWESOME.</li>
            <li>but this had to be the thinnest, lightest purple dye I&#x27;ve used besides quick washes.</li>
            <li>I could barely look at it, it was silky and soft and just beautiful.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I have never used a product like this before and was not looking for anything too bold.  </li>
            <li>Best pink hair dye I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>The longer you leave the color in, the more vibrant it will be.</li>
            <li>While this product does leave great, fun color in your hair, it&#x27;s much harder to work with, stains things that aren&#x27;t your hair quicker,</li>
            <li>While I had the color in I thought it was going to be gorgeous, but once it washed out only part of my roots were the right color</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother to bleach my hair, so I now have a nice, rich deep purple underlayer.</li>
            <li>One had stayed in nicely, the other two washed out in one wash with color safe shampoo</li>
            <li>All Very pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try leaving it on for several hours next time, but if you want an immediately more effective (and better smelling) dye try the N Rage dye.</li>
            <li>For something under $15 in total that is lasting longer and did a better result than the professional dyes, I am quite impressed with this</li>
            <li>How do I get the best results &amp; long lasting.</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep washing hair to a minimum or it will wash out pretty fast.</li>
            <li>:  long lasting, easy to use, lots of dye per package, vibrant, smells great!    </li>
            <li>If you have more hair or darker hair, you will certainly want to get more than one kit, and likely a stronger, stand-alone hair bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives my darker color a slightly pink tint in sunlight, but the highlighted areas are a BRIGHT fuchsia</li>
            <li>It came out much more saturated and bright on my natural hair color than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that people got funky colors, like bright pink, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>So it was either bright purple or pink.</li>
            <li>I used Pink Fetish, I love it and my friends love it,</li>
            <li>I do know that most shampoo contains sulfates and this will strip the color (even natural color)</li>
            <li>Given this amount of hair and this already light hair color, the provided hair bleach and hair dye were more than enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Use a fresh pair of gloves for this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Essentially, my hair will not hold any kind of color – permanent or temporary.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, but it&#x27;s a warning that should be taken into consideration.    </li>
            <li>My hair turned a nice blonde and then the color wouldn&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, find somewhere else to get your stuff because the quality isn&#x27;t worth the cash.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am honestly amazed at the drastic differences in results we both had with the same product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I color the underside of my hair and have the top highlighted professionally.</li>
            <li>The best / longest lasting pink color ever...</li>
            <li>Essentially, my hair will not hold any kind of color – permanent or temporary.</li>
            <li>I bought this wanting something fun</li>
            <li>It looked great at first but 2 days later and the color is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>Found this same product on other websites, but amazon had the best deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, vibrant color but would urge buyers to think twice about what they&#x27;re doing with their hair after they dye it pink.</li>
            <li>right out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Any</li>
            <li>and I wiped it off right away</li>
            <li>it gets everywhere and WILL stain if you don&#x27;t wipe it up right away.</li>
            <li>After my purchase, I got home and got to work right away.</li>
            <li>If you get it on surfaces it comes right off with soapy water, unless it has been sitting for a bit</li>
            <li>We followed the directions exactly and her color came up bright pink like the halloween wigs you find at the store.  </li>
            <li>sulfate free shampoo (Loreal Shampure is decent and CHEAP).&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>only good thing about this product is when I called Splat (Christine – (951) 738-8595), they sent over two free bottles of the same hair color.</li>

            <li>and I only use a certain kind of bleach, because I know it won&#x27;t wreck my hair (clairol 30).     </li>
            <li>I got stain remover for the skin to get the more noticeable hot pink spots from my scalp and still this was not an easy process as I had to do A LOT of scrubbing until my skin was sore to get the dye off my skin.</li>
            <li>I used Splat&#x27;s Pink Fetish, which worked wonderfully to turn my hair into radioactive pink.  </li>
            <li>Dyeing you hair isn&#x27;t a process you should rush, as half a**ing this will cause you hair to fry or to not look good.</li>
            <li>It fades horribly super fast.</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions it is pretty simple and you will be left with a great color.</li>
            <li>It is still very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Essentially, I received four free packs of hair color because of the one that originally did damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>Essentially, I received four free packs of hair color because of the one that originally did damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>Color is pretty, doesnt stay vibrant very long washes out kind of quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bleach part of the kit worked just fine, but it could&#x27;ve come with better, less flimsy gloves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally come to my senses and realized that $9.99 could be put to much better use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would consider using it again, because the color was so pretty</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly for this dye</li>
            <li>have only 16mm-length hair, and I used most of the bleach and 2/3 of the hair dye.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I wanted a very thorough bleach and a very thorough, bright pink.  </li>
            <li>For this reason, try to avoid putting it on your scalp, and make sure to put petroleum jelly all around your hair and especially your ears, just as you should when you use the hairdye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The results were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>almost all of the color time washed out on the first wash.  </li>
            <li>AND it muddled into my natural light brown hair.</li>
            <li>this product worked really well!</li>
            <li>I really massage this in to freshly bleached hair like I was shampooing it then put a plastic cap on it for a couple hours.</li>
            <li>both waited 48 hours for first wash.....</li>
            <li>the pink kind helps take it off.  </li>
            <li>The first time was with the purple dye and now this.</li>
            <li>The first product I bought (almost 2 years ago) was the Lusty Lavender.</li>
            <li>For the first five or six washes, you&#x27;ll see a LOT of color in the sink.</li>
            <li>I combed through it to make sure it was even but for some reason my front started turning quicker than the back</li>
            <li>The color really pops!</li>
            <li>When I asked to speak to higher up, he said I am the co-owner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done it many time different colors.</li>
            <li>I used both containers of bleach left it in for 40 minutes and my hair came out orange on top and the bottom was a lighter brown.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got the pink color because I liked the color on the box.</li>
            <li>Be aware of two things though:</li>
            <li>I evenly distributed the product after bleaching just as it said taking time to make sure it was even and properly coated throughout.</li>
            <li>(we&#x27;ve both used Splat before and have never had problems), but this time I used the packaged bleach first</li>
            <li>first off, the bleach is making my hair fall out.</li>
            <li>So I picked out my bit o-hair, and pulled it through my cap (which I had to do with a bobby pin), and 15 minutes later I had a lovely, magenta streak.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s  only if it&#x27;s stays in for more then two days .</li>
            <li>So please be aware of the dangers of this product.</li>
            <li>The bleach isn&#x27;t good and it&#x27;s so messy and stains everything</li>
            <li>Well 2 1/2 weeks later it fades back to my original bleached color!!!  </li>
            <li>If anyone has used Manic Panic&#x27;s hot hot pink,the dye itself resembles that, but comes out a more true hot pink (hot hot pink by manic panic looks more fuscia).</li>
            <li>The result is a gorgeous burgundy red color with dark and light variations that look like highlights.</li>
            <li>The bleach got all the blueish greenish color out and left my hair bright blonde after an hour of sitting.</li>
            <li>So without pre-bleaching, I left the color on for one hour and after washing was left with a bright berry purple color.  </li>
            <li>was just light brown with light pink strips.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you rinse the color out completely, and keep rinsing even when the water does run clear.</li>
            <li>All of the color is really great though, The red starts out very vibrant and fades into a sort of pink and</li>
            <li>A hair dressor recommended this Splat color and its amazing on even the dark colored hair my daughter has.</li>
            <li>I ended up with pink red hair but her I love it &#x3D;].</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting intense color since I wasn&#x27;t using bleach first.  </li>
            <li>Then, cover your hair in the mix and let it sit for an hour or more, depending on how long you want it in.</li>
            <li>It is MUCH darker than the color because I didn&#x27;t bleach it first even though it was in the directions.</li>
            <li>Just put this in my hair and I am more than pleased with my results, though, I in general give less of a F</li>
            <li>Okay, so I bought the Luscious Raspberries, totally excited to get the deep red shown on the box.</li>
            <li>I had the hair bleach in my hair for about a half hour, which thoroughly bleached my hair to a very light golden color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will warn you that if you have very blonde hair the color will not come out easily over time.</li>
            <li>We will only be using this color for the tips of her hair as it is easy to trim off if needed.</li>
            <li>To close my review, I would recommend Splat to ANYONE looking for bright, long lasting hair dye.</li>
            <li>It will be easy to actually concentrate on the strands of hair</li>
            <li>product to anyone that wants bright, funky, long lasting color.</li>
            <li>Use the gloves and get a tinting brush to kind of minimize mess.</li>
            <li>The name is pretty realistic.</li>
            <li>I left the color in for an hour, and after rinsing for 30 minutes, it was almost clear (it will never run fully clear) and I LOVE the color!</li>
            <li>I would a little bit of bleach handy to wipe up the color from surfaces, as it will drip.</li>
            <li>I have used every color but green with amazing results.</li>
            <li>the purple might have had a chance of turning a light purple, but I thought it might redarken (like my initial purple did).</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still VERY</li>
            <li>that was very bleached already.</li>
            <li>that I absolutely adore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I followed their requirements for refund which I didn&#x27;t really want</li>
            <li>The pink looked fantastic when dyed on bleached hair!</li>
            <li>I washed it once with color safe shampoo and still, it&#x27;s barely pink.</li>
            <li>Leaves splotchy pieces of color on your scalp in a very unflattering way.</li>
            <li>Just plan on waiting 24 hours before performing the real hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>It was obvious after about 30 minutes that my hair was extremely light.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t bleach- skip straight to color  3.</li>
            <li>so I grabbed this at Walmart as a very temporary solution.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li>But being that I have light blonde hair</li>
            <li>It makes my whole head burn.</li>
            <li>The bleach however isn&#x27;t really mean&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Because the color is intense, it will dye whatever it comes in contact with in process.</li>
            <li>Although, I would highly recommend this Splat!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: do not put so much products in your hair because the dye will faid really easily&lt;br /&gt;Step 5</li>
            <li>So since pink is my favorite color I saw this Splat Hair Dye in the hair color aisle and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I thought if it&#x27;s burning my skin this much</li>
            <li>I just used latex gloves and a whole lotta patience.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re careful you can do this without staining your forehead :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>at the beginning i used purple to cover my whole head</li>
            <li>it will fade fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say thanks</li>
            <li>sure it fades, eventually, but I have pink in my hair from years ago.</li>
            <li>I put my hair up in a bun to shower and make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t get wet when I just wash my body x3.</li>
            <li>Stained my scalp for 4 days very noticeable also irritated my skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everybody, including a professional hair stylist and a French jewelry diva, has been telling me they love my hair.  </li>
            <li>Everybody, including a professional hair stylist and a French jewelry diva, has been telling me they love my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was a horrendous mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color after the first application was more pink and cornflower blue, which wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for, so I went back and thoroughly dyed all of my hair but an inch or two at the top.</li>
            <li>I had to bleach it twice, and this was the second dye we  tried and was by far better.</li>
            <li>it was thick, the bleach was good.</li>
            <li>Now on trying to wash the due out the water didn&#x27;t run clean even with cool water.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s a very nice, if slightly messy (three months later</li>
            <li>After that I washed my hair out til the water became a bit clean (not fully clear but let the water run a light pink)</li>
            <li>The bleach in this kit is only enough to cover VERY short hair (maybe 2 inches long at best), so you really need to buy a separate bleach kit.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, though, the kits worked much better than I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First it was brighter pink than color on box, now after 3 weeks it looks lighter but still good pink.</li>
            <li>I was able to use small bottles of 20 Cream Developer from Sally’s (much healthier than the clear stuff originally in the packs) and sell all four boxes of color.</li>
            <li>I was able to use small bottles of 20 Cream Developer from Sally’s (much healthier than the clear stuff originally in the packs) and sell all four boxes of color.</li>
            <li>It stayed bright for a very long time and worked well on even my unbleached, natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I got alcohol to clean it and my floor is still blue.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply and stays very vibrant pink for about two to three months.</li>
            <li>This product is more vibrant and lasts longer than other dyes, and it is not damaging unless you use the bleach.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the results of the bleach -- it pulled my hair to a lovely golden blonde that I might go back to after my color&#x27;s faded out.</li>
            <li>but I have no thanks to give, only more money to a better company to fix this companies short comings.</li>
            <li>You really need to ensure you use enough of the coloring since your hair WILL soak it up quickly, so you need NOT to be skimpy.</li>
            <li>I tried Manic Panic purple haze to do a cover up without bleach, my hair was still bright blue and faded to the same gross color.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get it it fades within the first day and don&#x27;t expect to go swimming anytime soon because it&#x27;s gonna bleed all over the pool and ur shower water wont be clear for about four weeks or so</li>
            <li>another normal color that very night after scrubbing all the purple off her body with lava soap.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and I bleached out the underneath section of my hair and chunks on top.</li>
            <li>is the first time I have ever had any coloration or bleaching of my hair done, and I did this completely by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bleached first, and followed the directions completely.</li>
            <li>I just used the pink fetish today, and it is a BRIGHT, neon pink.</li>
            <li>When I finally had time to scrub it it took me nearly 3 hours to clean it using comet, brillo pads and finally a bleach solution to get it clean again.</li>
            <li>Rinsed all the bleach ought and got an interesting shade of orange (almost left it that color actually).</li>
            <li>The lady above didn’t even ask to see photos of the damaged boxes as proof she simply sent two more boxes.</li>
            <li>decent bleach and color.</li>
            <li>I wanted to have my hair purple, but not too vibrant.</li>
            <li>The lady above didn’t even ask to see photos of the damaged boxes as proof she simply sent two more boxes.</li>
            <li>My hair is colored natural light blonde</li>
            <li>Did this in my older daughter&#x27;s hair in a peekaboo style.</li>
            <li>I like the vibrant color, but it wasn&#x27;t what I had in mind at that moment.</li>
            <li>Your hair will not only be dyed, but it will be deep conditioned. :)</li>
            <li>Blue envy is more of a cookie monster blue.</li>
            <li>so I need to buy a more expensive bleach product because it hurts my eyes and scalp to even use the bleach without it touching.</li>
            <li>Love the product and will definitely keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li>was VERY surprised at how gentle this dye was on my hair.</li>
            <li>What did dye pink faded pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend you use sturdy rubber gloves and not the food service gloves that come in the package.</li>
            <li>DESPITE using VASELINE all around my edges, highly noticeable and made me look like a kid that got into some dye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The pink is so much more of a hot hot pink</li>
            <li>I tried Splat without any sort of expectation and I was completely amazed!!</li>
            <li>I finished the second application, I wound up with a very rich, dark, even, and dimensional color that&#x27;s a mix of purple, blue, and indigo, lighter in some places, darker in others, which I think looks much more &#x27;natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The dye will wash off of the skin within a week (I used a little alcohol to help strip it), but it&#x27;s better to just use petroleum jelly.    </li>
            <li>This product, if used with bleach, leaves a very vivid and intense hair color that has lasted for over five months for me so far.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;Tdoday when I was wondering how best to let the world know that I was a bad a</li>
            <li>The pink is so bright and so hot pink that it has almost a blue tinge to it.</li>
            <li>Unless you have freshly bleached hair that is stripped prior to application, you aren&#x27;t going to get your hair the color on the box.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if the color is as long lasting as it says cause its only been three days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>what I like to call an orangutan orange, I never turned to a golden blonde like she said the purple she had me apply after the bleach process</li>
            <li>The pink on top and blue in the middle leaving my natural light brown on bottom.</li>
            <li>It does not provide full coverage of your hair no matter how long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra $10 or so dollars!</li>
            <li>I did not need the bleach because my hair is naturally a very light blonde, so all I used was the pink dye.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using &amp;#34;Color Opps&amp;#34; following directions to the T, I am still left with bright red hair and now streaks of CLOWN orange and yellow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 7-8 months since I originally dyed highlights and underneath my hair with the splat pink</li>
            <li>Plus, I live in the tropics, and we all know that the sun does damage and can be a factor to color fading... and still nothing.  </li>
            <li>I am okay with how my hair turned out, only because I can rock the pink.</li>
            <li>Plus the color started fading on its own the over the next few days.</li>
            <li>Although the splat hair dye worked for a few days after taking a shower my hair turned bright pink</li>
            <li>Way more red than pink.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be super happy, but alas now I just look like I&#x27;m missing patches of hair because of the bleach from step one.</li>
            <li>But the next two washed were at the gym, and I had to have the hot water, just had to.  </li>
            <li>Top it off after trying to get rid of the remaining streaks in the last bleach session by a pro, my hair is falling out and my hair is still pink!</li>
            <li>process:   1. wash lightly sunkissed, but still dark brown hair with shampoo, no conditioner  2.</li>
            <li>for a first time all over bleach but rather touch ups on roots later.</li>
            <li>The colour is usually way more vivid than on the box.</li>
            <li>you must wash your hair every day use cool water and minimal</li>
            <li>it is messy so get ready for some clean up.</li>
            <li>I naturally have a light brown hair but still bleach my hair to a lighter blonde, I feel that this helps the color last a bit longer than just putting it on natural hair.</li>
            <li>blue looks fine for the most part kind of patchy but my ugly pink covers it.</li>
            <li>I have naturally black hair and the instructions said that the bleach will turn my hair the accurate color in 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li>It was messy, but came out of everything except my skin easily.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve spent all that time finding a color worthy of the salon stuff my friend used on me.</li>
            <li>the color stays bright and pretty much true to the box for at least 6 months but it does bleed sometimes which sucks even after months of daily washings.</li>
            <li>it turned pink and faded a tremendous amount.</li>
            <li>And, secondly, if you hair is even slightly longer than your shoulders, you need to buy more than one kit.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use but the only problem is the bleach i could only use it once, and i was stuck with extra dye</li>
            <li>Splat is the only color that we have found that is very vibrant and stays in for a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market with various success (usually not up to what I was actually trying to accomplish).</li>
            <li>I used both things of bleach completely, becuase there wasn&#x27;t much in there, but just enough to cover my hair.</li>
            <li>By the 3rd wash, the color was about 50% faded, to a light pink.  </li>
            <li>Let the water run clear like the directions say.</li>
            <li>The tops of the clear processing liquid exploded in shipping, and the boxes were damaged.</li>
            <li>States rince until water runs clear.</li>
            <li>The tops of the clear processing liquid exploded in shipping, and the boxes were damaged.</li>
            <li>Then when he rinsed it out as instructed, it ran clear, but it was still dripping and getting everywhere.</li>
            <li>It will continue to bleed when you shower even after the water has ran clear.  </li>
            <li>When dying your hair with this product, don&#x27;t worry about rinsing until the water is clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been bleaching, dying, shaving and dreading my hair for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li>Color fix doesn&#x27;t work on direct dye btw.</li>
            <li>Think about it ladies and gentlemen, and take some action.</li>
            <li>It took 6 shampoos to get the bleach out of my hair completely before I could put on the color.</li>
            <li>if you use unnatural colors in your hair is epic.</li>
            <li>and I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>She said she would rather have two natural colors (peek a boo style), so I took her to get her hair professionally done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok &amp;#34;bleep&amp;#34; happens, it did not come out anywhere near what I was hoping for that</li>
            <li>Used this product for my sons in order to give them wild looking hair for wrestling.  </li>
            <li>the professional there set me up with 30 developer with bleach to mix up in a bowl then picked out a purple color for me</li>
            <li>And yes, I would get them done professionally as for my ex sister-in-law and one of my closes friend were both hair dressers.</li>
            <li>She has naturally medium/dark brown hair, so I did have to use the bleaching kit that was included.</li>
            <li>I really did was put the bleach in a container and mixed it with the liquid from the bottle.</li>
            <li>(can use old towel you don&#x27;t need)</li>
            <li>Think about it ladies and gentlemen, and take some action.</li>
            <li>I went to a professional stylist to get my tips dyed rainbow colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old wears her hair with pick tips.</li>
            <li>so i used splat dye again purple and this time left it in for 4 days straight with no showers.</li>
            <li>After waiting 30mins as it said I rinsed to find parts of my hair were still completely bleached, had I wanted a leopard style dye job</li>
            <li>Or, cover everything in newspapers or old towels.</li>
            <li>I have naturally reddish-brown hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally medium brown hair.</li>
            <li>It completely out.</li>
            <li>I am now completely bald.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair pink for fun</li>
            <li>I finally rinsed my pink helmet in cool water for about 20 minutes, in the shower and was shocked, amazed, astounded and thrilled at the color!!</li>
            <li>Splat is my fav if ur going for super long lasting!!</li>
            <li>I have tried a few of the splat colors, and i really love how vibrant the color is, I do like to use other bleaching kits, My head was very sensitive to the bleach that came with</li>
            <li>Dye should be able to be wiped off after 2 seconds, I mean come on.</li>
            <li>When I apply it though I dry my hair out a lot first by washing it with dish soap</li>
            <li>Also, sounds weird but smells kind of good at first, almost like artificial cherry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Lusty Lavender, Blue Envy and Pink Fetish (current) and these are all very true in color.</li>
            <li>hair is naturally a fairly light ash blonde, and it was highlighted a long time ago and never grew out, so I really only bleached it so the color would take well.</li>
            <li>I put the color after shampooing the bleach and drying my hair, I came out with a dark pink and read the most helpful hints on here</li>
            <li>currently have white hair with blue and pink on the top.</li>
            <li>Then, after I rinsed my hair (use shampoo but no conditioner), I mixed a drop of dye with some cheap generic (WHITE) conditioner and mixed it.</li>
            <li>, remember, blue black cheap dye was what I was removing.</li>
            <li>I washed it till the water ran light pink and blew dry my hair so it wouldn&#x27;t bleed color.</li>
            <li>I got a small spot of dye on my forehead and it gave me a huge chemical burn.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a cheap semi-permanent dye use ordinary easter egg dye with vinger.</li>
            <li>I first got pink highlights about three years ago</li>
            <li>I would wear rubber gloves to wash your hair the first couple times if you don&#x27;t want your fingers pink.</li>
            <li>Now I have to scrub my hair to try and get it to look somehow normal before trying to redye it with a different brand.</li>
            <li>, I had been wanting to do my hair hot pink again for a while, so this color was a give in.    </li>
            <li>I believe if you&#x27;re going to buy from this seller, buy colors that people use often, which is pretty much pink and purple.</li>
            <li>and we used a bleach first than a pink color which faded in about 6 weeks</li>
            <li>My hair turned a pretty platinum HOWEVER, after using the SPLAT Pink Fetish Dye...</li>
            <li>Mind you the &amp;#34;SPLATS&amp;#34; of hot pink on my skin are &amp;#34;SPLATS&amp;#34; anymore, but where the &amp;#34;SPLATS&amp;#34; were</li>
            <li>the color the pink came out in my hair after leaving it in with foils for a little over half an hour is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>First off, I would recommend leaving the bleach in for at LEAST a half hour, and if your hair is even the slightest bit brown, leave in for about 40 minutes or more.</li>
            <li>My hands were stained black, and the only things that made a significant dent in the color were nail polish remover and Veet hair remover.</li>
            <li>Will not be purchasing this product again and will definitely be looking for a new one.</li>
            <li>After back and forth emails, he stuck to that he would only send me a new box of bleach, would do nothing about the dye and was rather rude with respect to satisfying my request for a refund.</li>
            <li>She wants to try blue next!</li>
            <li>The pink is still vibrant and the blue is very dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>I would much rather have some left over than not enough.</li>
            <li>The bleach is really weak and did not work well as most reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li>For my first dye I bought two boxes of L&#x27;Oreal Super Blonde for all over, covered my hair with two plastic bags and a towel to heat the roots and left it on for the maximum time needed to produce a pale yellow to platinum (repeat bleach to desired color).</li>
            <li>Overall, if you follow all the directions and use the tips I listed above, you will get a long-lasting, vibrant color.</li>
            <li>I have used this exact product numerous times before and I was just as satisfied with this one not to mention it was half the price I usually pay!</li>
            <li>If you are hoping for the same shade of the box that doesn&#x27;t always happen, if you have very dark hair the bleach may not get light enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my hair bright red for the past few months using Manic Panic pillarbox red</li>
            <li>You literally have to reapply the dye and complete the entire dying process over again after every wash.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Hand-held mirror, in addition to the fixed bathroom mirror</li>
            <li>Short on cash, and with no legit beauty places near me, I stumbled  into the nearest WalMart (no, I didn&#x27;t buy this product off Amazon</li>
            <li>I was caught with white hair (as my old color had faded out)and had no idea when I could make it to Sally&#x27;s to get my color</li>
            <li>I have had it in my hair for 4 months now and it has barely faded at all which</li>
            <li>soon go for this, because when i cut my hair and bleached it out to white again it took two professional bleaches (i went to salon to get it done..</li>
            <li>But the bleach is not much as you do not get as much.</li>
            <li>Used bleach to lighten her dark hair first.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t careful and got a big splotch of it on my scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair grows super slow, but my roots will start showing before my water runs clear in the shower.</li>
            <li>I decided this for three reasons: first, I wanted to rebel against the rebellious hair color; second, I wanted it now and not to have to wait an additional however long; and third, there were a bunch of extra steps on the directions.</li>
            <li>Guess I will be going as a CLOWN thanks to SPLAT Pink Fetish!</li>
            <li>The only reason why I continue to use this product is because it&#x27;s the only hot pink dye that is both affordable and convenient</li>
            <li>that if you leave the dye in for 30 minutes, your hair will remain vibrant pink for 4 months.</li>
            <li>I had people i didn&#x27;t know complimenting me on my vibrant color, an telling me that my hair was so pink it looked unreal.</li>
            <li>My husband voted for pink, so I started browsing around to find a decent one.</li>
            <li>freshly colored (we did not use bleach, left the color on for a few hours  in a bonnet.)</li>
            <li>and it still wasn&#x27;t as bleached as other bleaches have done, as well as a few spots barely stripped, and I have light brown hair.</li>
            <li>DARK HOT PINK, yes HOT PINK spots all along my edges</li>
            <li>Not only did the bleach take the blue black right out of my hair, it didn&#x27;t fry my hair either.</li>
            <li>So then I bought Manic Panic Hot Hot Pink and Raven, to do a pink and black layer on my underside.</li>
            <li>The bleach on the other hand, was a whole different story.</li>
            <li>we looked every where for another pink color to get that vibrant color back with no luck.</li>
            <li>I left the dye on all day, 6 hours at least, did housework, took care of my pets, went to the store, got some funny looks (I live in the country with cowboys</li>
            <li>(Just be careful because depending on the bleaching it might come out dark violet or plum; don&#x27;t commit my error and consistently bleach before!).</li>
            <li>other than that it&#x27;s high praises from this chick.</li>
            <li>If part of your hair is still white or natural color, protect it the first few washes - coat all the hair except the colored portions by rubbing in conditioner while the hair is dry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look pink but red, and it damaged my hair a lot, but I guess it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>but the intense color lasts months and will bleed in the shower for a while, it will slow down toward the end of the first month and to make the color last even longer i recommend washing your hair in cold water and not every day and use a good color protecting shampoo (i use aveda color conserve)    in a nut shell....</li>
            <li>Her hair came out a light pink (like the breast cancer awareness pink), mine had come out dark.</li>
            <li>For starters, it was also very runny and made a mess.</li>
            <li>Not long lasting at all, but if your looking for temporary color, give it a try!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am male, my hair started out exactly 16mm long, and my hair is naturally dark blonde.  </li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t process your hair i tend to keep it on a little longer than the instructions said (just the color not the bleach) and it left me with a very vibrant color that lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li>I will stick with buying Raw in the bottle from hot topic and Spencer at the mall.</li>
            <li>Then I left the dye for about an hour hour in a half depending on how much you want it to last.</li>
            <li>The fumes are strong in this one, my friend.&lt;br /&gt;So other than that, the only downside is that if you are clumsy, line everything with trash  bags to avoid staining your bathroom.</li>
            <li>After removing the tin foil and washing my hair in cold water (which ran clear after 5 minutes at the most) I towel dryed my hair (the towel wasn&#x27;t stained) and lo and behold.</li>
            <li>It started to fade into a really ugly greenish-gray color, so I really had to stay on top of doing touch ups every week.</li>

            <li> I swear it has a  mind of its own lol.</li>

            <li> GOOD LUCK</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see why this would get any good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any bleach because my hair is light and the color was perfect!</li>
            <li> I loved my hair and the color.</li>

            <li> Well, I can honestly say it turned a bright fuchsia/pink color instead.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t use the bleach (more for me)!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dye!</li>
            <li> I was really pleased with the color!  </li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time, people love it!</li>
            <li> I love Splat!</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than Spat!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t bleach my hair and love it!</li>
            <li> The color and easy application make this a great product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in almost 2 months and my hair is still super bright!</li>
            <li> The dye however is amazing.</li>
            <li> Splat is just an amazing hair dye company, and the colors have lasted me for months at a time, without a need to redye.</li>
            <li> oh, the dye smells kind of like fruit.</li>
            <li> I probably should have known that I couldn&#x27;t get streaks without foils, but that&#x27;s my own failing.</li>
            <li> So I kind of have both sides of the spectrum for this review.</li>
            <li> However, we liked the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my own hair for years</li>
            <li> the kind you use for scrubbing yourself..was good for getting stains off skin real quick.</li>
            <li> And the shade was still nice</li>
            <li> The bleach didn&#x27;t work for beans,  but the hair dye was very intense and brilliant.  </li>
            <li> Splat hair dye is just the most amazing thing on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done them all, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Old Cotten T-shirt is the best!</li>
            <li> this stuff does NOT fade very quickly at all!</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone wanting an easy do it yourself highlight!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so vibrant and beautiful.</li>
            <li> All the splat colors were vibrant and beautiful and one of the MP colors didn&#x27;t even turn out.</li>
            <li> time I know to bleach it before I get the kit... &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> get again &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I process my hair a LOT and have been dying it one color or another for the better part of twenty years.</li>
            <li> the quality of the bleach was okay.</li>
            <li> it could have been better, but you get</li>
            <li> i love the quality of this dye.</li>
            <li> It works better than Manic Panic or Punky Color.</li>
            <li> So I will probably try a couple alternatives to see if I can get comparable color with more longevity.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s more of a permanent stain than anything.</li>
            <li> This did not happen to me, nor does it happen to most people.  </li>
            <li> Glad Plastic Wrap&lt;br</li>
            <li> Follow bleach directions and make sure to use gloves.  </li>
            <li> Put the dye into your hair, making sure to get everything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> Hope this helped some people out! :)</li>
            <li> I like how it looks post-fade better than SPLAT&#x27;s purple.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wayyyyy better then even the amplified version of Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> so we reapplied the dye and waited 40 more minutes...</li>
            <li> love it...</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love your bleach, but that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m ever going to get.</li>
            <li> so i did have to go out and buy more bleach..</li>
            <li> i love the stuff and use it all the time, for my self and others...</li>
            <li> This color will show through even if you dye over it, so be sure you want that</li>
            <li> Before using splat we asked a beautician that we know well, and she said it would be okay because my daughter&#x27;s hair was extremely healthy.</li>
            <li> It did take a bit to get it to stop running off in the shower, but I find that this is way better than Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my favorite product to use out of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> , I had darker ends which is okay</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I got so many compliments and was told I should keep it permanent.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to put Vaseline around your face, ears, neck line, etc., however, if you do get it on your skin you can scrub it off with a buff puff in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I love dying my hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look) and it faded the color quite a bit... still cute</li>
            <li> Despite this, I love how my hair looks :)</li>
            <li> If you want to be able to brush or comb through your hair afterwards, don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE OR ALL TIME HAIR COLOR.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product for the money!</li>
            <li> My sheets are ruined, and as I write this I am sitting in the bath tub which is now filled woth rose tinged water.</li>
            <li> If you leave it in for the minimum time, it will look more blond.</li>
            <li> Also, it would be better to buy color protecting shampoo/conditioner, as it will stay in longer.</li>
            <li> If I cared more I&#x27;d pay more.</li>
            <li> I wish the bleach was a lower level, and the kit had more color...</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars but would gladly give 5 stars if they sold the colors without the bleach kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You need patience, SOME sort of experience or a friend with experience, a steady hand and about 4-6 hours to do a great job.</li>
            <li> Splat bleach was actually very good, it turned my hair a nice light blonde, so there are no complaints about that.</li>
            <li> so good for the price and really easy to use for first time hair-dyers :)</li>
            <li> this product is SO easy to use, even for a first-time dyer :)  </li>
            <li> I can see this being good if you just want highlights or streaks, but for the love of all things do not try to dye your whole head.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is user friendly and looks great!</li>
            <li> For me that works it ends up looking like i have a very cool fade done on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was VERY happy with the result I got from bleaching then coloring my hair the pink fetish color.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time, everything perfect as I expected it.</li>
            <li> But that extreme color is perfect for your hair.</li>
            <li> A good company would have mailed me a new one!</li>
            <li> They tear easily and this color WILL STAIN EVERYTHING it comes in contact with.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to follow directions.</li>
            <li> Your hair will easily get damaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the surprise, I am 70 years young!,and going strong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Instead, the insanely strong bleach over-processed my hair.</li>
            <li> Strong stuff, burned too.    </li>
            <li> Instead, the insanely strong bleach over-processed my hair.</li>
            <li> My sister tried hers first and tried to get a nice purple color.</li>
            <li> It took just fine, but it was a pain to get into my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and easy in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I guess it would be fine if you just want a streak or two</li>
            <li> It was strong, and the fumes didn&#x27;t feel great on my eyes, but overall, that part of the kit wasn&#x27;t lacking in the slightest.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m VERY satisfied!</li>
            <li> The best for true, bright and long lasting color.</li>
            <li> She has naturally light brown hair</li>
            <li> A hair dryer would work great, but I do not have a hair dryer, so I just put my head in front of a heated air vent for several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My hair is light brown</li>
            <li> I did not use the bleach because I was scared of too much color to be honest.  </li>
            <li> hair is light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually got convinced with the great comments about it.</li>
            <li> Thankfully the company saw fit to send me a refund.</li>
            <li> finally i took the dye out of my hair and it was a great color for the 6 days it lasted after taking three showers with no shampoo</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had much better success</li>
            <li> and then the rest was a light putrid purple.</li>
            <li> Like I said, result was good, but how fast it washed out is barely worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice bright pink color.</li>
            <li> I would think it should last more than 5 days!!</li>
            <li> The pink in my hair is bold and gorgeous, more magenta than I&#x27;d like but that&#x27;s because the bleach, still love the color.</li>
            <li> the colors are vibrant and amazing.</li>
            <li> The 3 small packets in this kit would be ideal for highlights but more would be needed to dye your full head.  </li>
            <li> Overall this product is pretty good!</li>
            <li> It took me 2 months from original contact to call them in regards to the issue.</li>
            <li> I used this product first and was IN LOVE with it.</li>
            <li> It came out a beautiful pink.</li>
            <li> It took me 2 months from original contact to call them in regards to the issue.</li>
            <li> It was a lot of fun!  </li>
            <li> Looked super super awesome for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> we loved the original super vibrant color, but the best part of this pink is how it fades into a beautiful almost natural looking pink.  </li>
            <li> and btw I washed my tub the day before and thought omg its going to stain what I just took time to clean the day before it rinsed out</li>
            <li> /&gt;Helpful tips&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: DO NOT HAVE CLEAN HAIR.</li>
            <li> If you want a halfway clean bathroom after you&#x27;re done, don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> It had good color and did not dry my hair out like a lot of hair dyes.</li>
            <li> have to say we will be using special effects to fix my friends hair and to redo mine when needed, I don&#x27;t trust the results of this one.</li>
            <li> To get the color really bright we left the color in for twice the time recommended.</li>
            <li> My daughter saved her money and bought the luscious raspberry for a bright red look.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, for some reason, had the sudden urge of wanting to dye my hair in a bright funky color.</li>
            <li> The instructions give a recommended 24 hour skin test to perform before doing the full hair dye.  </li>
            <li> Try a different bleach but the dye is definitely good quality.</li>
            <li> I washed them out, using cool water, shampoo, etc.</li>
            <li> pink, a more than likely often used color was wonderful.</li>
            <li> Others comments are true it will color your tub.  </li>
            <li> I really wish there was more product in the kit.</li>
            <li> Frequent washing in warm water will make the color fade faster</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s true for all of the Splat colours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool, but looks nothing like the box.</li>
            <li> Not bad,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty easy to dye.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> Seriously, it looks AWESOME.</li>
            <li> but this had to be the thinnest, lightest purple dye I&#x27;ve used besides quick washes.</li>
            <li> I could barely look at it, it was silky and soft and just beautiful.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s much more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before and was not looking for anything too bold.  </li>
            <li> Best pink hair dye I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> The longer you leave the color in, the more vibrant it will be.</li>
            <li> While this product does leave great, fun color in your hair, it&#x27;s much harder to work with, stains things that aren&#x27;t your hair quicker,</li>
            <li> While I had the color in I thought it was going to be gorgeous, but once it washed out only part of my roots were the right color</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to bleach my hair, so I now have a nice, rich deep purple underlayer.</li>
            <li> One had stayed in nicely, the other two washed out in one wash with color safe shampoo</li>
            <li> All Very pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try leaving it on for several hours next time, but if you want an immediately more effective (and better smelling) dye try the N Rage dye.</li>
            <li> For something under $15 in total that is lasting longer and did a better result than the professional dyes, I am quite impressed with this</li>
            <li> How do I get the best results &amp; long lasting.</li>
            <li> Be sure to keep washing hair to a minimum or it will wash out pretty fast.</li>
            <li> :  long lasting, easy to use, lots of dye per package, vibrant, smells great!    </li>
            <li> If you have more hair or darker hair, you will certainly want to get more than one kit, and likely a stronger, stand-alone hair bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives my darker color a slightly pink tint in sunlight, but the highlighted areas are a BRIGHT fuchsia</li>
            <li> It came out much more saturated and bright on my natural hair color than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that people got funky colors, like bright pink, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> So it was either bright purple or pink.</li>
            <li> I used Pink Fetish, I love it and my friends love it,</li>
            <li> I do know that most shampoo contains sulfates and this will strip the color (even natural color)</li>
            <li> Given this amount of hair and this already light hair color, the provided hair bleach and hair dye were more than enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Use a fresh pair of gloves for this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Essentially, my hair will not hold any kind of color – permanent or temporary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it, but it&#x27;s a warning that should be taken into consideration.    </li>
            <li> My hair turned a nice blonde and then the color wouldn&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, find somewhere else to get your stuff because the quality isn&#x27;t worth the cash.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am honestly amazed at the drastic differences in results we both had with the same product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I color the underside of my hair and have the top highlighted professionally.</li>
            <li> The best / longest lasting pink color ever...</li>
            <li> Essentially, my hair will not hold any kind of color – permanent or temporary.</li>
            <li> I bought this wanting something fun</li>
            <li> It looked great at first but 2 days later and the color is almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> Found this same product on other websites, but amazon had the best deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, vibrant color but would urge buyers to think twice about what they&#x27;re doing with their hair after they dye it pink.</li>
            <li> right out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Any</li>
            <li> and I wiped it off right away</li>
            <li> it gets everywhere and WILL stain if you don&#x27;t wipe it up right away.</li>
            <li> After my purchase, I got home and got to work right away.</li>
            <li> If you get it on surfaces it comes right off with soapy water, unless it has been sitting for a bit</li>
            <li> We followed the directions exactly and her color came up bright pink like the halloween wigs you find at the store.  </li>
            <li> sulfate free shampoo (Loreal Shampure is decent and CHEAP).&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> only good thing about this product is when I called Splat (Christine – (951) 738-8595), they sent over two free bottles of the same hair color.</li>
            <li> only good thing about this product is when I called Splat (Christine – (951) 738-8595), they sent over two free bottles of the same hair color.</li>
            <li> and I only use a certain kind of bleach, because I know it won&#x27;t wreck my hair (clairol 30).     </li>
            <li> I got stain remover for the skin to get the more noticeable hot pink spots from my scalp and still this was not an easy process as I had to do A LOT of scrubbing until my skin was sore to get the dye off my skin.</li>
            <li> I used Splat&#x27;s Pink Fetish, which worked wonderfully to turn my hair into radioactive pink.  </li>
            <li> Dyeing you hair isn&#x27;t a process you should rush, as half a**ing this will cause you hair to fry or to not look good.</li>
            <li> It fades horribly super fast.</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions it is pretty simple and you will be left with a great color.</li>
            <li> It is still very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Essentially, I received four free packs of hair color because of the one that originally did damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> Essentially, I received four free packs of hair color because of the one that originally did damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> Color is pretty, doesnt stay vibrant very long washes out kind of quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bleach part of the kit worked just fine, but it could&#x27;ve come with better, less flimsy gloves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally come to my senses and realized that $9.99 could be put to much better use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would consider using it again, because the color was so pretty</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly for this dye</li>
            <li> have only 16mm-length hair, and I used most of the bleach and 2/3 of the hair dye.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I wanted a very thorough bleach and a very thorough, bright pink.  </li>
            <li> For this reason, try to avoid putting it on your scalp, and make sure to put petroleum jelly all around your hair and especially your ears, just as you should when you use the hairdye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The results were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> almost all of the color time washed out on the first wash.  </li>
            <li> AND it muddled into my natural light brown hair.</li>
            <li> this product worked really well!</li>
            <li> I really massage this in to freshly bleached hair like I was shampooing it then put a plastic cap on it for a couple hours.</li>
            <li> both waited 48 hours for first wash.....</li>
            <li> the pink kind helps take it off.  </li>
            <li> The first time was with the purple dye and now this.</li>
            <li> The first product I bought (almost 2 years ago) was the Lusty Lavender.</li>
            <li> For the first five or six washes, you&#x27;ll see a LOT of color in the sink.</li>
            <li> I combed through it to make sure it was even but for some reason my front started turning quicker than the back</li>
            <li> The color really pops!</li>
            <li> When I asked to speak to higher up, he said I am the co-owner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done it many time different colors.</li>
            <li> I used both containers of bleach left it in for 40 minutes and my hair came out orange on top and the bottom was a lighter brown.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got the pink color because I liked the color on the box.</li>
            <li> Be aware of two things though:</li>
            <li> I evenly distributed the product after bleaching just as it said taking time to make sure it was even and properly coated throughout.</li>
            <li> (we&#x27;ve both used Splat before and have never had problems), but this time I used the packaged bleach first</li>
            <li> first off, the bleach is making my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> So I picked out my bit o-hair, and pulled it through my cap (which I had to do with a bobby pin), and 15 minutes later I had a lovely, magenta streak.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s  only if it&#x27;s stays in for more then two days .</li>
            <li> So please be aware of the dangers of this product.</li>
            <li> The bleach isn&#x27;t good and it&#x27;s so messy and stains everything</li>
            <li> Well 2 1/2 weeks later it fades back to my original bleached color!!!  </li>
            <li> If anyone has used Manic Panic&#x27;s hot hot pink,the dye itself resembles that, but comes out a more true hot pink (hot hot pink by manic panic looks more fuscia).</li>
            <li> The result is a gorgeous burgundy red color with dark and light variations that look like highlights.</li>
            <li> The bleach got all the blueish greenish color out and left my hair bright blonde after an hour of sitting.</li>
            <li> So without pre-bleaching, I left the color on for one hour and after washing was left with a bright berry purple color.  </li>
            <li> was just light brown with light pink strips.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you rinse the color out completely, and keep rinsing even when the water does run clear.</li>
            <li> All of the color is really great though, The red starts out very vibrant and fades into a sort of pink and</li>
            <li> A hair dressor recommended this Splat color and its amazing on even the dark colored hair my daughter has.</li>
            <li> I ended up with pink red hair but her I love it &#x3D;].</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting intense color since I wasn&#x27;t using bleach first.  </li>
            <li> Then, cover your hair in the mix and let it sit for an hour or more, depending on how long you want it in.</li>
            <li> It is MUCH darker than the color because I didn&#x27;t bleach it first even though it was in the directions.</li>
            <li> Just put this in my hair and I am more than pleased with my results, though, I in general give less of a F</li>
            <li> Okay, so I bought the Luscious Raspberries, totally excited to get the deep red shown on the box.</li>
            <li> I had the hair bleach in my hair for about a half hour, which thoroughly bleached my hair to a very light golden color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will warn you that if you have very blonde hair the color will not come out easily over time.</li>
            <li> We will only be using this color for the tips of her hair as it is easy to trim off if needed.</li>
            <li> To close my review, I would recommend Splat to ANYONE looking for bright, long lasting hair dye.</li>
            <li> It will be easy to actually concentrate on the strands of hair</li>
            <li> product to anyone that wants bright, funky, long lasting color.</li>
            <li> Use the gloves and get a tinting brush to kind of minimize mess.</li>
            <li> The name is pretty realistic.</li>
            <li> I left the color in for an hour, and after rinsing for 30 minutes, it was almost clear (it will never run fully clear) and I LOVE the color!</li>
            <li> I would a little bit of bleach handy to wipe up the color from surfaces, as it will drip.</li>
            <li> I have used every color but green with amazing results.</li>
            <li> the purple might have had a chance of turning a light purple, but I thought it might redarken (like my initial purple did).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still VERY</li>
            <li> that was very bleached already.</li>
            <li> that I absolutely adore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I followed their requirements for refund which I didn&#x27;t really want</li>
            <li> The pink looked fantastic when dyed on bleached hair!</li>
            <li> I washed it once with color safe shampoo and still, it&#x27;s barely pink.</li>
            <li> Leaves splotchy pieces of color on your scalp in a very unflattering way.</li>
            <li> Just plan on waiting 24 hours before performing the real hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> It was obvious after about 30 minutes that my hair was extremely light.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t bleach- skip straight to color  3.</li>
            <li> so I grabbed this at Walmart as a very temporary solution.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li> But being that I have light blonde hair</li>
            <li> It makes my whole head burn.</li>
            <li> The bleach however isn&#x27;t really mean&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Because the color is intense, it will dye whatever it comes in contact with in process.</li>
            <li> Although, I would highly recommend this Splat!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Step 4: do not put so much products in your hair because the dye will faid really easily&lt;br /&gt;Step 5</li>
            <li> So since pink is my favorite color I saw this Splat Hair Dye in the hair color aisle and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I thought if it&#x27;s burning my skin this much</li>
            <li> I just used latex gloves and a whole lotta patience.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re careful you can do this without staining your forehead :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> at the beginning i used purple to cover my whole head</li>
            <li> it will fade fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say thanks</li>
            <li> sure it fades, eventually, but I have pink in my hair from years ago.</li>
            <li> I put my hair up in a bun to shower and make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t get wet when I just wash my body x3.</li>
            <li> Stained my scalp for 4 days very noticeable also irritated my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everybody, including a professional hair stylist and a French jewelry diva, has been telling me they love my hair.  </li>

            <li> It was a horrendous mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color after the first application was more pink and cornflower blue, which wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for, so I went back and thoroughly dyed all of my hair but an inch or two at the top.</li>
            <li> I had to bleach it twice, and this was the second dye we  tried and was by far better.</li>
            <li> it was thick, the bleach was good.</li>
            <li> Now on trying to wash the due out the water didn&#x27;t run clean even with cool water.</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s a very nice, if slightly messy (three months later</li>
            <li> After that I washed my hair out til the water became a bit clean (not fully clear but let the water run a light pink)</li>
            <li> The bleach in this kit is only enough to cover VERY short hair (maybe 2 inches long at best), so you really need to buy a separate bleach kit.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, though, the kits worked much better than I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First it was brighter pink than color on box, now after 3 weeks it looks lighter but still good pink.</li>
            <li> I was able to use small bottles of 20 Cream Developer from Sally’s (much healthier than the clear stuff originally in the packs) and sell all four boxes of color.</li>
            <li> I was able to use small bottles of 20 Cream Developer from Sally’s (much healthier than the clear stuff originally in the packs) and sell all four boxes of color.</li>
            <li> It stayed bright for a very long time and worked well on even my unbleached, natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I got alcohol to clean it and my floor is still blue.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply and stays very vibrant pink for about two to three months.</li>
            <li> This product is more vibrant and lasts longer than other dyes, and it is not damaging unless you use the bleach.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the results of the bleach -- it pulled my hair to a lovely golden blonde that I might go back to after my color&#x27;s faded out.</li>
            <li> but I have no thanks to give, only more money to a better company to fix this companies short comings.</li>
            <li> You really need to ensure you use enough of the coloring since your hair WILL soak it up quickly, so you need NOT to be skimpy.</li>
            <li> I tried Manic Panic purple haze to do a cover up without bleach, my hair was still bright blue and faded to the same gross color.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it it fades within the first day and don&#x27;t expect to go swimming anytime soon because it&#x27;s gonna bleed all over the pool and ur shower water wont be clear for about four weeks or so</li>
            <li> another normal color that very night after scrubbing all the purple off her body with lava soap.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and I bleached out the underneath section of my hair and chunks on top.</li>
            <li> is the first time I have ever had any coloration or bleaching of my hair done, and I did this completely by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bleached first, and followed the directions completely.</li>
            <li> I just used the pink fetish today, and it is a BRIGHT, neon pink.</li>
            <li> When I finally had time to scrub it it took me nearly 3 hours to clean it using comet, brillo pads and finally a bleach solution to get it clean again.</li>
            <li> Rinsed all the bleach ought and got an interesting shade of orange (almost left it that color actually).</li>
            <li> The lady above didn’t even ask to see photos of the damaged boxes as proof she simply sent two more boxes.</li>
            <li> decent bleach and color.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have my hair purple, but not too vibrant.</li>
            <li> The lady above didn’t even ask to see photos of the damaged boxes as proof she simply sent two more boxes.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored natural light blonde</li>
            <li> Did this in my older daughter&#x27;s hair in a peekaboo style.</li>
            <li> I like the vibrant color, but it wasn&#x27;t what I had in mind at that moment.</li>
            <li> Your hair will not only be dyed, but it will be deep conditioned. :)</li>
            <li> Blue envy is more of a cookie monster blue.</li>
            <li> so I need to buy a more expensive bleach product because it hurts my eyes and scalp to even use the bleach without it touching.</li>
            <li> Love the product and will definitely keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li> was VERY surprised at how gentle this dye was on my hair.</li>
            <li> What did dye pink faded pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend you use sturdy rubber gloves and not the food service gloves that come in the package.</li>
            <li> DESPITE using VASELINE all around my edges, highly noticeable and made me look like a kid that got into some dye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The pink is so much more of a hot hot pink</li>
            <li> I tried Splat without any sort of expectation and I was completely amazed!!</li>
            <li> I finished the second application, I wound up with a very rich, dark, even, and dimensional color that&#x27;s a mix of purple, blue, and indigo, lighter in some places, darker in others, which I think looks much more &#x27;natural&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The dye will wash off of the skin within a week (I used a little alcohol to help strip it), but it&#x27;s better to just use petroleum jelly.    </li>
            <li> This product, if used with bleach, leaves a very vivid and intense hair color that has lasted for over five months for me so far.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tdoday when I was wondering how best to let the world know that I was a bad a</li>
            <li> The pink is so bright and so hot pink that it has almost a blue tinge to it.</li>
            <li> Unless you have freshly bleached hair that is stripped prior to application, you aren&#x27;t going to get your hair the color on the box.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if the color is as long lasting as it says cause its only been three days, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> what I like to call an orangutan orange, I never turned to a golden blonde like she said the purple she had me apply after the bleach process</li>
            <li> The pink on top and blue in the middle leaving my natural light brown on bottom.</li>
            <li> It does not provide full coverage of your hair no matter how long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra $10 or so dollars!</li>
            <li> I did not need the bleach because my hair is naturally a very light blonde, so all I used was the pink dye.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using &amp;#34;Color Opps&amp;#34; following directions to the T, I am still left with bright red hair and now streaks of CLOWN orange and yellow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 7-8 months since I originally dyed highlights and underneath my hair with the splat pink</li>
            <li> Plus, I live in the tropics, and we all know that the sun does damage and can be a factor to color fading... and still nothing.  </li>
            <li> I am okay with how my hair turned out, only because I can rock the pink.</li>
            <li> Plus the color started fading on its own the over the next few days.</li>
            <li> Although the splat hair dye worked for a few days after taking a shower my hair turned bright pink</li>
            <li> Way more red than pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be super happy, but alas now I just look like I&#x27;m missing patches of hair because of the bleach from step one.</li>
            <li> But the next two washed were at the gym, and I had to have the hot water, just had to.  </li>
            <li> Top it off after trying to get rid of the remaining streaks in the last bleach session by a pro, my hair is falling out and my hair is still pink!</li>
            <li> process:   1. wash lightly sunkissed, but still dark brown hair with shampoo, no conditioner  2.</li>
            <li> for a first time all over bleach but rather touch ups on roots later.</li>
            <li> The colour is usually way more vivid than on the box.</li>
            <li> you must wash your hair every day use cool water and minimal</li>
            <li> it is messy so get ready for some clean up.</li>
            <li> I naturally have a light brown hair but still bleach my hair to a lighter blonde, I feel that this helps the color last a bit longer than just putting it on natural hair.</li>
            <li> blue looks fine for the most part kind of patchy but my ugly pink covers it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally black hair and the instructions said that the bleach will turn my hair the accurate color in 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> It was messy, but came out of everything except my skin easily.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve spent all that time finding a color worthy of the salon stuff my friend used on me.</li>
            <li> the color stays bright and pretty much true to the box for at least 6 months but it does bleed sometimes which sucks even after months of daily washings.</li>
            <li> it turned pink and faded a tremendous amount.</li>
            <li> And, secondly, if you hair is even slightly longer than your shoulders, you need to buy more than one kit.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use but the only problem is the bleach i could only use it once, and i was stuck with extra dye</li>
            <li> Splat is the only color that we have found that is very vibrant and stays in for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market with various success (usually not up to what I was actually trying to accomplish).</li>
            <li> I used both things of bleach completely, becuase there wasn&#x27;t much in there, but just enough to cover my hair.</li>
            <li> By the 3rd wash, the color was about 50% faded, to a light pink.  </li>
            <li> Let the water run clear like the directions say.</li>
            <li> The tops of the clear processing liquid exploded in shipping, and the boxes were damaged.</li>
            <li> States rince until water runs clear.</li>
            <li> The tops of the clear processing liquid exploded in shipping, and the boxes were damaged.</li>
            <li> Then when he rinsed it out as instructed, it ran clear, but it was still dripping and getting everywhere.</li>
            <li> It will continue to bleed when you shower even after the water has ran clear.  </li>
            <li> When dying your hair with this product, don&#x27;t worry about rinsing until the water is clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching, dying, shaving and dreading my hair for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li> Color fix doesn&#x27;t work on direct dye btw.</li>
            <li> Think about it ladies and gentlemen, and take some action.</li>
            <li> It took 6 shampoos to get the bleach out of my hair completely before I could put on the color.</li>
            <li> if you use unnatural colors in your hair is epic.</li>
            <li> and I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> She said she would rather have two natural colors (peek a boo style), so I took her to get her hair professionally done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok &amp;#34;bleep&amp;#34; happens, it did not come out anywhere near what I was hoping for that</li>
            <li> Used this product for my sons in order to give them wild looking hair for wrestling.  </li>
            <li> the professional there set me up with 30 developer with bleach to mix up in a bowl then picked out a purple color for me</li>
            <li> And yes, I would get them done professionally as for my ex sister-in-law and one of my closes friend were both hair dressers.</li>
            <li> She has naturally medium/dark brown hair, so I did have to use the bleaching kit that was included.</li>
            <li> I really did was put the bleach in a container and mixed it with the liquid from the bottle.</li>
            <li> (can use old towel you don&#x27;t need)</li>
            <li> Think about it ladies and gentlemen, and take some action.</li>
            <li> I went to a professional stylist to get my tips dyed rainbow colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old wears her hair with pick tips.</li>
            <li> so i used splat dye again purple and this time left it in for 4 days straight with no showers.</li>
            <li> After waiting 30mins as it said I rinsed to find parts of my hair were still completely bleached, had I wanted a leopard style dye job</li>
            <li> Or, cover everything in newspapers or old towels.</li>
            <li> I have naturally reddish-brown hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> It completely out.</li>
            <li> I am now completely bald.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair pink for fun</li>
            <li> I finally rinsed my pink helmet in cool water for about 20 minutes, in the shower and was shocked, amazed, astounded and thrilled at the color!!</li>
            <li> Splat is my fav if ur going for super long lasting!!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the splat colors, and i really love how vibrant the color is, I do like to use other bleaching kits, My head was very sensitive to the bleach that came with</li>
            <li> Dye should be able to be wiped off after 2 seconds, I mean come on.</li>
            <li> When I apply it though I dry my hair out a lot first by washing it with dish soap</li>
            <li> Also, sounds weird but smells kind of good at first, almost like artificial cherry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Lusty Lavender, Blue Envy and Pink Fetish (current) and these are all very true in color.</li>
            <li> hair is naturally a fairly light ash blonde, and it was highlighted a long time ago and never grew out, so I really only bleached it so the color would take well.</li>
            <li> I put the color after shampooing the bleach and drying my hair, I came out with a dark pink and read the most helpful hints on here</li>
            <li> currently have white hair with blue and pink on the top.</li>
            <li> Then, after I rinsed my hair (use shampoo but no conditioner), I mixed a drop of dye with some cheap generic (WHITE) conditioner and mixed it.</li>
            <li> , remember, blue black cheap dye was what I was removing.</li>
            <li> I washed it till the water ran light pink and blew dry my hair so it wouldn&#x27;t bleed color.</li>
            <li> I got a small spot of dye on my forehead and it gave me a huge chemical burn.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for a cheap semi-permanent dye use ordinary easter egg dye with vinger.</li>
            <li> I first got pink highlights about three years ago</li>
            <li> I would wear rubber gloves to wash your hair the first couple times if you don&#x27;t want your fingers pink.</li>
            <li> Now I have to scrub my hair to try and get it to look somehow normal before trying to redye it with a different brand.</li>
            <li> , I had been wanting to do my hair hot pink again for a while, so this color was a give in.    </li>
            <li> I believe if you&#x27;re going to buy from this seller, buy colors that people use often, which is pretty much pink and purple.</li>
            <li> and we used a bleach first than a pink color which faded in about 6 weeks</li>
            <li> My hair turned a pretty platinum HOWEVER, after using the SPLAT Pink Fetish Dye...</li>
            <li> Mind you the &amp;#34;SPLATS&amp;#34; of hot pink on my skin are &amp;#34;SPLATS&amp;#34; anymore, but where the &amp;#34;SPLATS&amp;#34; were</li>
            <li> the color the pink came out in my hair after leaving it in with foils for a little over half an hour is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> First off, I would recommend leaving the bleach in for at LEAST a half hour, and if your hair is even the slightest bit brown, leave in for about 40 minutes or more.</li>
            <li> My hands were stained black, and the only things that made a significant dent in the color were nail polish remover and Veet hair remover.</li>
            <li> Will not be purchasing this product again and will definitely be looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> After back and forth emails, he stuck to that he would only send me a new box of bleach, would do nothing about the dye and was rather rude with respect to satisfying my request for a refund.</li>
            <li> She wants to try blue next!</li>
            <li> The pink is still vibrant and the blue is very dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> I would much rather have some left over than not enough.</li>
            <li> The bleach is really weak and did not work well as most reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> For my first dye I bought two boxes of L&#x27;Oreal Super Blonde for all over, covered my hair with two plastic bags and a towel to heat the roots and left it on for the maximum time needed to produce a pale yellow to platinum (repeat bleach to desired color).</li>
            <li> Overall, if you follow all the directions and use the tips I listed above, you will get a long-lasting, vibrant color.</li>
            <li> I have used this exact product numerous times before and I was just as satisfied with this one not to mention it was half the price I usually pay!</li>
            <li> If you are hoping for the same shade of the box that doesn&#x27;t always happen, if you have very dark hair the bleach may not get light enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my hair bright red for the past few months using Manic Panic pillarbox red</li>
            <li> You literally have to reapply the dye and complete the entire dying process over again after every wash.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Hand-held mirror, in addition to the fixed bathroom mirror</li>
            <li> Short on cash, and with no legit beauty places near me, I stumbled  into the nearest WalMart (no, I didn&#x27;t buy this product off Amazon</li>
            <li> I was caught with white hair (as my old color had faded out)and had no idea when I could make it to Sally&#x27;s to get my color</li>
            <li> I have had it in my hair for 4 months now and it has barely faded at all which</li>
            <li> soon go for this, because when i cut my hair and bleached it out to white again it took two professional bleaches (i went to salon to get it done..</li>
            <li> But the bleach is not much as you do not get as much.</li>
            <li> Used bleach to lighten her dark hair first.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t careful and got a big splotch of it on my scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair grows super slow, but my roots will start showing before my water runs clear in the shower.</li>
            <li> I decided this for three reasons: first, I wanted to rebel against the rebellious hair color; second, I wanted it now and not to have to wait an additional however long; and third, there were a bunch of extra steps on the directions.</li>
            <li> Guess I will be going as a CLOWN thanks to SPLAT Pink Fetish!</li>
            <li> The only reason why I continue to use this product is because it&#x27;s the only hot pink dye that is both affordable and convenient</li>
            <li> that if you leave the dye in for 30 minutes, your hair will remain vibrant pink for 4 months.</li>
            <li> I had people i didn&#x27;t know complimenting me on my vibrant color, an telling me that my hair was so pink it looked unreal.</li>
            <li> My husband voted for pink, so I started browsing around to find a decent one.</li>
            <li> freshly colored (we did not use bleach, left the color on for a few hours  in a bonnet.)</li>
            <li> and it still wasn&#x27;t as bleached as other bleaches have done, as well as a few spots barely stripped, and I have light brown hair.</li>
            <li> DARK HOT PINK, yes HOT PINK spots all along my edges</li>
            <li> Not only did the bleach take the blue black right out of my hair, it didn&#x27;t fry my hair either.</li>
            <li> So then I bought Manic Panic Hot Hot Pink and Raven, to do a pink and black layer on my underside.</li>
            <li> The bleach on the other hand, was a whole different story.</li>
            <li> we looked every where for another pink color to get that vibrant color back with no luck.</li>
            <li> I left the dye on all day, 6 hours at least, did housework, took care of my pets, went to the store, got some funny looks (I live in the country with cowboys</li>
            <li> (Just be careful because depending on the bleaching it might come out dark violet or plum; don&#x27;t commit my error and consistently bleach before!).</li>
            <li> other than that it&#x27;s high praises from this chick.</li>
            <li> If part of your hair is still white or natural color, protect it the first few washes - coat all the hair except the colored portions by rubbing in conditioner while the hair is dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look pink but red, and it damaged my hair a lot, but I guess it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> but the intense color lasts months and will bleed in the shower for a while, it will slow down toward the end of the first month and to make the color last even longer i recommend washing your hair in cold water and not every day and use a good color protecting shampoo (i use aveda color conserve)    in a nut shell....</li>
            <li> Her hair came out a light pink (like the breast cancer awareness pink), mine had come out dark.</li>
            <li> For starters, it was also very runny and made a mess.</li>
            <li> Not long lasting at all, but if your looking for temporary color, give it a try!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am male, my hair started out exactly 16mm long, and my hair is naturally dark blonde.  </li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t process your hair i tend to keep it on a little longer than the instructions said (just the color not the bleach) and it left me with a very vibrant color that lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li> I will stick with buying Raw in the bottle from hot topic and Spencer at the mall.</li>
            <li> Then I left the dye for about an hour hour in a half depending on how much you want it to last.</li>
            <li> The fumes are strong in this one, my friend.&lt;br /&gt;So other than that, the only downside is that if you are clumsy, line everything with trash  bags to avoid staining your bathroom.</li>
            <li> After removing the tin foil and washing my hair in cold water (which ran clear after 5 minutes at the most) I towel dryed my hair (the towel wasn&#x27;t stained) and lo and behold.</li>
            <li> It started to fade into a really ugly greenish-gray color, so I really had to stay on top of doing touch ups every week.</li>
            <li> i use the pink my self, but the first time i put it in i was going from black hair to white to bleach it all out</li>
            <li> I bought 2 boxes becuase my hair is pretty long, and I usually need 2 or 3 boxes.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and was only planning on doing a few highlights, so I bleached it to a dark blonde/ light brown and left the dye on for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> She naturally has dark brown hair, so we used the bleach, and had to use it for a while (obviously).</li>
            <li> So, I ordeered this on a Wednesday and got it on a Saturday with standard shipping(: this dye stays in for a long time, but you need to know how to properly dye your hair in order for it to work(:</li>
            <li> Three days after dying I was forced to wrap a towel around my neck to not get the hot tub, and everyone else in it - red.</li>
            <li> I have a honey blonde hair color, which is pretty thick but manageable.</li>
            <li> the color never full fades out for me, even after bleaching to add the new color.</li>
            <li> My dark haired girl has no pink left (Sept to Dec) but my blonde girl still has obvious streaks.</li>
            <li> The water coming off my hair actually turned perfectly clear after several rinses, but this is probably because I have so little</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got medium brown hair that I have dyed to a dark chocolate brown (almost a black when it&#x27;s first done), then I chunk out what I want highlighted and bleach it.</li>
            <li> Now I am waiting to see if it will completely fade out or if I am going to have to dye my hair dark brown.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it lasts a bit too long.</li>
            <li> and it stayed in long enough and did not feel like hair spray.</li>
            <li> last a long time</li>
            <li> The stuff is pretty thick</li>
            <li> thoroughly before adding the color.&lt;br /&gt;Leave the color on WAY past the recommended time if you want it to be vibrant and last.</li>
            <li> After waiting long enough, take off shower cap and dry your hair as quickly as possible.  </li>
            <li> The color faded really fast, and very unevenly.</li>
            <li> The colour will last longer if you rinse your hair in lukewarm or cold water and if you keep your shower water warm or lukewarm, but not hot.</li>
            <li> The only problem is is you have to blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> However, it took 5 hours to bleach a small strip of my hair to dye hot pink.</li>
            <li> but warning if you only use on parts of your hair and you have blonde hair it will bleed in to it and make it a lighter pink...</li>
            <li> All the money I have spent to get SPLAT Pink Fetish OUT of my hair, I could have gone to a salon and had my hair professional</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually in the process of re-dying to a red from a pink</li>
            <li> On the floor, on the wall,on the toilet, on your sink, in the shower.</li>
            <li> The pink was really bright at first, but it soon fades to a disgusting orange color and you need to redye it A LOT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used natural color hair dyes for years now, and never had a mess issue.  </li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t use enough dye, and I didn&#x27;t leave them in for long enough, so they weren&#x27;t dark enough for my liking.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s STILL hot , bright shocking pink!</li>
            <li> Though I know it&#x27;s harming my hair, I resorted to combing the dye through onto my highlight and then straightening it with a flat iron to dry.   </li>
            <li> The color was fun, and not too hard to apply -- took about 90 minutes including bleach time on dark hair.</li>
            <li> None of the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hairdyes like Feria or Loreal are this bold and dramatic.</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your hair in cold water to ensure vibrancy of the color.</li>
            <li> However, Splat hair dye is not powerful enough to stain anything in the shower when you are washing your hair at the end, or anytime in the future.  </li>
            <li> However, Splat hair dye is not powerful enough to stain anything in the shower when you are washing your hair at the end, or anytime in the future.  </li>
            <li> My hair was not only so pink</li>
            <li> used the purple, red and pink kits and have had fab results with all of them.</li>
            <li> I then go over my entire head with the Splat Pink Fetish.</li>
            <li> but not much and not enough to stain at that point</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Splat for a long time.</li>
            <li> Only maybe for partial color.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and required two boxes.</li>
            <li> I know many people out there are very skeptical when it comes to drug store \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; dyes, as was I since I&#x27;ve been screwed over by punky looking dyes from drugstores in the past, but this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It starts out *really* pink and fades after a month or so to a vibrant but less in-your-face pink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the orange and green.</li>
            <li> but you need to take care of it if you want it to stay in for a long time</li>
            <li> I have used purple, blue, and pink.</li>
            <li> already so didn&#x27;t use the bleach but will use it for roots later, before I re-do pink.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;t recommend this to anyone wanting to keep their hair the color for a long time.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on Amazon of a lot of different brands for pink, and I landed on this one.</li>
            <li> I started putting the pink in and even with just 1/3 of my hair there wasn&#x27;t really enough color for it.</li>
            <li> so I did not bleach my hair before using and months later, my hair was still pink.</li>
            <li> Also, if your hair is long, use ALL of the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, don&#x27;t buy or use Splat unless you plan on having the color for a long long time.</li>
            <li> it was purple, then pink, then orange, then just blonde.</li>
            <li> you in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not bleach my hair first, my base color is a fairly light reddish-blonde.  </li>
            <li> Well I will tell you my way on having the pink fetish last long in your hair.</li>
            <li> I previously had my hair purple but due to inconsistent bleaching some purple washed off much quicker than other parts.</li>
            <li> Lost half the remaining color the 2nd wash 3 days later.     </li>
            <li> but I died the bottum half of my hair (and the carton does say you can use it as an all over application) and by the time I was done the bathroom was blue, I was blue</li>
            <li> I have used a few different colors over the last 2 years; lavender, blue envy, Crimson obsession and pink fetish.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, I left it on for 40 minutes And have rinsed for over an hour in cold water.</li>
            <li> The bleach, it was extremely runny and very messy which got all over the place and within 5 minutes, during the application, she had to wash it out because of the intense burning of her skin and scalp.</li>
            <li> the color is not consistent and is different variations of</li>
            <li> Neither the bleach or the dye in one kit was enough for my hair, only slightly past my shoulders, so I needed to purchase two to get the entire effect.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been through a LOT, but this dye doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair or even dry it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Dry hair thoroughly&lt;</li>
            <li> Rinse hair in shower with cold water until the water is only lightly tinted.  </li>
            <li> Immediately dry hair afterward.  </li>
            <li> If you want something that is only going to last a few weeks then go with the Manic panic.</li>
            <li> down side was that it didn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a single drop on me.</li>
            <li> Usually you can tell when your hair needs dyed again because the water will run completely clear when you shower and wash your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was DARK NEON CLOWN RED!</li>
            <li> From the tip of my hair down was blonde and i had to re-dye.</li>
            <li> then it was orange and further down my hair</li>
            <li> Do the odd places, like the outer edge of your hair and the back of your head</li>
            <li> Once it was red, she stepped out and slightly dripped on the bathroom rug.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and the bleach lightened it to a medium blonde in about an hour</li>
            <li> Then my only choice was to go dark brunette, and you can still see the pink.  </li>
            <li> Thus, she was left with half bleached hair.</li>
            <li> The aqua last less than a week</li>
            <li> and i was left with small scabs on the back of my head</li>
            <li> I tried every colors from black to orange, from blue to pink, and so on.</li>
            <li> Still pink, but not vibrant.</li>
            <li> I than applied black dye to the other side of my head and left both dyes on for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have nearly waist length, medium thick hair and as long as you keep the bleach moist, a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> My hair always had a hard time keeping the colors blue, red, pink and purple on.</li>
            <li> Manic Panic let me down, Special Effects was useless.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the local drugstore after deciding to color bits of my hair BRIGHT SHOCKING pink.</li>
            <li> Many people tell me that usually pink hair attempts are ugly and faded, but my hair is truly radioactive pink!in concentrated form.  </li>
            <li> It is DARK RED and DARK</li>
            <li> I have only ONE complaint - that there is only one pair of gloves in the kit.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get it on your skin, or it will burn.   </li>
            <li> Like I said before, I had no real expectations...</li>
            <li> I do, however, heavy condition it once or twice a month with a deep conditioner which probably helps with that.</li>
            <li> I decided to go for a pink color, and stumbled across Splat at my walmart.</li>
            <li> runs whenever it gets wet, not a lot of bleach</li>
            <li> I used the \\&quot;Pink Fetish\\&quot; kit.  </li>
            <li> My daughter wanted the tips of her blond hair dyed pink.</li>
            <li> and I still have some pink in parts of my hair.</li>
            <li> Splat Pink hair dye kit&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not use a hair cap for this, but I did wash my hands with water and then sprinkle the water onto my hair to keep the bleaching agent wet.  </li>
            <li> it rains, your hair will drip pink.  </li>
            <li> pink n</li>
            <li> Two days after, I&#x27;m still rinsing out purple, but I expected that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I bought the Pink Fetish.</li>
            <li> I separated my hair and applied the pink, leaving it on for 20 minutes, than blow drying it for 5.</li>
            <li> Box severely damaged (Wet and smashed) as well as instructions and bleach powder.</li>
            <li> Everything was wet like it was in water before being shipped.</li>
            <li> Never really happened.</li>
            <li> Now my problem is I can&#x27;t get rid of the remaining pink streaks in my hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s slightly pink in spots  5.</li>
            <li> only lasted a few weeks</li>
            <li> I bleached it and it STILL stayed, except it turned pink.</li>
            <li> bleach is rough.</li>
            <li> Really really rough.</li>
            <li> After a few months of having her red highlights, she decided to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> Now my girl has pink hair.</li>
            <li> PINK to the world.</li>
            <li> it was the pink color.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried color remover, bleach, lighter color, and darker color, and it&#x27;s still pink as all get out.</li>
            <li> applied the SPLAT bleach to the ends of my hair about 3&amp;#34; up as I wanted the ends of my hair to be a brighter pink than the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> , the purple turned my hair orangish pink, the bleach took an hour to develop, I bought Splat</li>
            <li> , I didnt like the pink</li>
            <li> and I always wanted to dye my hair pink.</li>
            <li> So I bought the pink fetish at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> : don&#x27;t brush your hair after your hair is wet and already dyed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s how I have the pink fetish dye</li>
            <li> I would wet my hair</li>
            <li> It will rub off on clothing if you sweat or your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I used Pink Fetish AND Lusty Lavender.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be a pink</li>
            <li> If you want pink hair forever, I recommend splat.</li>
            <li> , it turned my hair pink.</li>
            <li> Used this to get Pastel Pink (cotton candy colored)</li>
            <li> and it turned pink.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in a sealed box and the tube was completely empty.</li>
            <li> **, when I decided, f-ya, gonna dye my hair pink.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair once every 3 or 4 days to keep it pink for longer.</li>
            <li> I forgot to do that with pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate this a minus 5 if I could</li>
            <li> That worked well, but the pink dye was a flop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given up on having pink hair.</li>
            <li> How did it get in the shower with the curtain closed?</li>
            <li> It coats the outside hairs and leaves ones on the inside uncolored, therefore it is extremely hard because you have to touch every single hair with the color individually or you will have blotches and dark spots.</li>
            <li> I had to water it down and ended up having to buy another thing of bleach because i couldn&#x27;t get it watered down to create enough to use</li>
            <li> It is a bit dark, but I had to bleach out permanent black hair dye, so my hair wasn&#x27;t as blonde as it should be.</li>
            <li> Many people tell me that usually pink hair attempts are ugly and faded, but my hair is truly radioactive pink!</li>
            <li> She finally had to dye her hair black, and even with the black the splat eventually started to show through.</li>
            <li> if your going for a pink that yor not willing to maintain and you dont want to get out any time</li>
            <li> We dyed over it with the pink and black, the pink came out purple and the black came out a dark blue.</li>
            <li> enough people that were wronged by this company took this approach, we could bring down this horrible, faulty company for good.</li>
            <li> enough people that were wronged by this company took this approach, we could bring down this horrible, faulty company for good.</li>
            <li> The aqua for my blonde daughter and emerald green for my niece with dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown and long, all the way down to my bum.</li>
            <li> and i spilled half of it on the ground thanks to it being so thin.</li>
            <li> My blue actually faded to a silver and purple, rather than a dull green.</li>
            <li> and my hair is damaged, not too bad but considering my hair is past my shoulders and wassss healthy and now has minor breakage all the way up...</li>
            <li> its not smelly like other dyes.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the die is not even close to a regular hair dye kit, it is like jelly and you are not able to squirt a bunch on and just rub it in.</li>
            <li> reviewers complain of getting boils and other skin problems from the hair dye.  </li>
            <li> The formula is just as extreme as the box warns.</li>
            <li> all the other ones like Manic Panic and Directions DO.</li>
            <li> I have rinsed in cold to cool water every time and the color still is running out every time I rinse or wash my hair.</li>
            <li> The dye for both was extremely watery.</li>
            <li> and I wash it every other day...</li>
            <li> I prefer Punky Color but keep this around to mix with my other color when I feel like highlights.</li>
            <li> Other bleach kits do not do this</li>
            <li> That way, when you wash, you won&#x27;t get the color residue on the other</li>
            <li> /&gt;First: In no way is &amp;#34;Pink Fetish&amp;#34; PINK!</li>
            <li> Put a couple little streaks in her little sister&#x27;s blonde hair too...</li>
            <li> My purple came out pink!</li>
            <li> I used the lucious rasberry, so every time i take a shower, pink comes out!</li>
            <li> Holy pink!  </li>
            <li> the purple starts dark and fades into a sort of lavender, the pink fades to a pastel bubblegum color.</li>
            <li> Wet hair leaks and stains everything!</li>
            <li> I would see some of the pink hair dye going down the drain.</li>
            <li> I do suggest that you be very careful as the product will stain your clothing, counters, floors, and body/face when in the bottle format.</li>
            <li> I must admit, when I first purchased this product, I was very doubtful about it, but my mind was quickly changed.</li>
            <li> We put the color in three months ago and the tips of her hair are still a little pink.</li>
            <li> I have very very very dark hair, and I&#x27;ve tried the pink &amp; purple.</li>
            <li> The gloves provided in the kit are enormous, and you will need at least two sets of gloves.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> You need to leave the bleach in way longer than the directions say if you have dark hair.    </li>
            <li> I bleached and dyed my dark hair.</li>
            <li> EXCEPT for the hair I did not bleach which turned DARK PURPLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a dark brown, so I&#x27;ve let the bleach in for a while.</li>
            <li> I did apply it twice because some areas were not as dark or even as I wanted.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth</li>
            <li> Even with bleaching my hair beforehand, it ended up coming out a shade of dark magenta.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair (which took an hour, between the length and the porousness created by the bleach) and then did the pink dye.</li>
            <li> It can be messy, so be careful...</li>
            <li> I planned on dying half my hari half black, and half Pink fetish.</li>
            <li> Put down plastic wrap in the sink and on the counter&lt;br</li>
            <li> The down side is, however, the bleach hurts like heck.</li>
            <li> I suggest trash bags taped down everywhere</li>
            <li> by washed out, i mean hair went back to color before bleaching.  </li>
            <li> The bleach smells like cherries (unlike the chemical smelling ones from other kits!).</li>
            <li> I have dark black hair, I always wanted purple hair, I tried another kit from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store</li>
            <li> I had dyed mine dark brown previously</li>
            <li> While the results were worth it, I was VERY disappointed in how fast it faded.</li>
            <li> But when I used the product this last time something must have been mixed wrong in production of this product, because ALL of my hair fell out; washed down the drain.</li>
            <li> Leave in the bleach for one hour, or less if it is working well.  </li>
            <li> After they dyed her hair black, they cut off SIX INCHES of her hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally black hair</li>
            <li> I waited an hour because my hair is black.</li>
            <li> and I was left with bleached tips and some random blue strands.</li>
            <li> the dye was dropping on to the sink and counter and making a mess.</li>
            <li> I did the first wash on day 3 and did use cold water.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for 14 years now, usually every other months or so.</li>
            <li> At the local Walgreens where I shop, I had a sudden impulse to dye my bangs a crazy color.</li>
            <li> The bleach in this kit is REALLY harsh.</li>
            <li> then I let my hair soak in it for a few hours, about 5 or 6.</li>
            <li> but all products like this can be messy.</li>
            <li> It did not adhere and bleed out within a few days, now I have pinky purple hair patches everywhere</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the bleach for a few reasons; my hair had already been prelightened a couple months ago</li>
            <li> And for the people who complain that it&#x27;s messy, you need to prepare for it.</li>
            <li> 3: do not wash your hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I air dried my hair and waited 2 days to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> A few things to note.</li>
            <li> It fades unevenly, then cannot be bleached out or covered up.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t waste any.</li>
            <li> I got tired of that and decided I wanted to do a different color.</li>
            <li> and the green wasn&#x27;t green.</li>
            <li> So retreated the green.</li>
            <li> Its a crock.&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your time or $ on this produce</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all dried up on my forehead and the side of my face it</li>
            <li> foolishly wasted money on three attempts.</li>
            <li> Although It is messy and will stain your forehead, ears, neck.</li>
            <li> Wash hair with a bar of plain soap in shower</li>
            <li> There are a few drawbacks though: it really is very messy.  </li>
            <li> For people who complained about their towels getting stained, get black towels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m latin, I have black thick hair.</li>
            <li> this product gets to hot the color will not take, and if it gets to cold the bleach will get hard and come out too thick to use correctly, so</li>
            <li> but when I opened it the splat oxide was uncapped and the solution was all over the entire box of product making it useless.</li>
            <li> and my hair would&#x27;ve been way past fixing.</li>
            <li> and it was past my shoulders...</li>
            <li> I usually have assistance from a friend but have done it myself in the past, this is when I stained my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Nair to remove small stain spots AWAY from my hairline (I use it kinda like soap, DO NOT leave it on your skin unless you want to lose hair).</li>
            <li> Usually I reapply color every 4-5 weeks, re-bleaching the roots every 3 months or so.</li>
            <li> In the past I used Manic Panic and it faded -</li>
            <li> , you definitely did something wrong along the process.</li>
            <li> I usually use two or three boxes depending on my hair length.</li>
            <li> But this stuff is serious about the mess warnings.  </li>
            <li> the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the 1st few washings after the dyeing teh color bleeds like crazy.</li>
            <li> What a mess!!</li>
            <li> After bleaching her hair, and adding the red dye, her hair turned an ugly dark color.</li>
            <li> This product contains metallic ingredients which make it impossible to remove from your hair, ask a salon professional.  </li>
            <li> Manic Panic is so dull.</li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely hard to work with and it took at least 2 hours of dying before I was finished</li>
            <li> it save ur self the hassle and get it professionally done and not to mention how badly it damages your hair</li>
            <li> At least that’s some vindication for what occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I see nothing wrong with this stuff, except it smells kinda funky, but that&#x27;s expected...</li>
            <li> Alot of the negative comments I&#x27;ve read were errors in set up and application instead of a problem with the product.</li>
            <li> At least that’s some vindication for what occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do go at least three days after putting it in with out washing it.</li>
            <li> It was too thick.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a 10 dollar hair product, which I just bought on sale, so</li>
            <li> It took forever to wash clean too, worst hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It bleeds badly, even when left on overnight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really bad especially if you have curly hair like me</li>
            <li> My sister hated it so much she dyed her hair</li>
            <li> NOT good.</li>
            <li> Not good for all over dye.</li>
            <li> a wash later and ugly faded splotches.....</li>
            <li> When in the shower I use cold water for my hair and wash it every other day.</li>
            <li> So now my hair looks pretty terrible.</li>
            <li> If you have shoulder length or longer hair...buy at least two!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very hard to get off.</li>
            <li> story is rather boring, but I will share it for all those who are either SUPER bored or indecisive.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> It stays pink and does not fade to that ugly salmon color.</li>
            <li> I chose to not use the bleach included to keep my hair from being fried, but I fear it may have turned out worse</li>
            <li> i hate the color and it bleeds everywhere weeks later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every color, and they never cease to produce a shocking, vibrant color.</li>
            <li> Looks sloppy.</li>
            <li> Very subtle.  </li>
            <li> Before using this, I used Manic Panic after midnight blue, and was very disappointed with my results.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with the product i recieved from the orange and green.</li>
            <li> I did the bleach process wrong as I should have used two products instead of one..</li>
            <li> Needless to say you can imagine where I told them they could put their 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> This dye is simply god awful.</li>
            <li> Well your wrong.</li>
            <li> I then colored chunks of hair in random order using all 6 dyes.</li>
            <li> Please be warned that using this product is an expensive, long-term commitment.  </li>
            <li> And still nothing, sadly.</li>
            <li> very frustrating.</li>
            <li> However, this product washes out of my hair with every shampooing, leaving my pink highlight a nasty, neon orange color.</li>
            <li> The pink came out a horrible fright wig pinkish purple neon color.  </li>
            <li> if u shower once it&#x27;s already a Nasty faded pink like please don&#x27;t get this product</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> The boxes do NOT have a plastic cap, which was disappointing, but I used a bag.</li>
            <li> Do not be afraid to put on the bleach.  </li>
            <li> Anyway the bleach drove her crazy, burning, itching...</li>
            <li> both washed in cold water to maintain the colors integrity</li>
            <li> If you feel it&#x27;s dirty just rinse your hair with water&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: have your hair straighten.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe just this time I will ignore what others have said and just try it since I couldn&#x27;t find another crazy hair dye anywhere else.</li>
            <li> It was even soaking through the gloves and burning my fingers like crazy.</li>
            <li> (I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it just faded, but it faded unevenly and looked awful.)</li>
            <li> SHE WAS WRONG!</li>
            <li> and I find the hair dressers VERY expensive here.</li>
            <li> To go longer than a dayw ithout a shower try using baby powder on your hair to make the grease not look so bad</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve heard bad stuff about this</li>
            <li> And it stands everything else bad.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t stain my skin to bad</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair for years and have never had a product leak from my hair so badly.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this company I don&#x27;t even know where to start.</li>
            <li> Then it fades DRAMATICALLY :(</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED WHEN MY ROOTS GROW IN.</li>
            <li> Disappointing!</li>
            <li> but I was hoping for bubblegum. :(</li>
            <li> How do you get this crap out of your hair once you&#x27;ve dyed it?  </li>
            <li> is not what made me HATE</li>
            <li> I hate this hair die.</li>
            <li> Not too bad on the hair but very bad on the skin.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I called the company and was disappointed with their customer service!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t do the nasty stuff that that chemical dyes do).</li>
            <li> The product itself is horrible.</li>

            <li> I hate this stuff!</li>
            <li> Also, since I have yet to see if it fades into something awful, I will leave it at four until proven</li>
            <li> this is a horrible product and please don&#x27;t risk damaging your hair for this product that will bleed out in a matter of days.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using SPLAT! for about a year. I used Pink Fetish, I love it and my friends love it, even people I don&#x27;t know!! Now the surprise, I am 70 years young!,and going strong.</li>
            <li> I used this color on my hair and didn&#x27;t get too great of results.  What did dye pink faded pretty quick.  Unless you have freshly bleached hair that is stripped prior to application, you aren&#x27;t going to get your hair the color on the box.</li>
            <li> The bleach in this kit is only enough to cover VERY short hair (maybe 2 inches long at best), so you really need to buy a separate bleach kit.  The color itself is great,though.</li>
            <li> I previously had my hair purple but due to inconsistent bleaching some purple washed off much quicker than other parts. Seeing the good reviews on this product, I decided to give Splat! Lusty Lavender a go. The bleach in this kit is REALLY harsh. Be careful not to get it on your skin, or it will burn.   I noticed when I opened both of the bottles (getting two kits) the purple might have had a chance of turning a light purple, but I thought it might redarken (like my initial purple did). I left it on for an hour. When I washed it off, it came out a bright magenta. I did not wash this one off with a shampoo, and either way the dye was lighter than it should have been.   The N-Rage plum color [[ASIN:B003JN2NXW N Rage Purple Plum]] washes out quicker if you did not bleach correctly, but it does last and it is stronger (Just be careful because depending on the bleaching it might come out dark violet or plum; don&#x27;t commit my error and consistently bleach before!). I thought I made a mistake but this had to be the thinnest, lightest purple dye I&#x27;ve used besides quick washes. I&#x27;ll try leaving it on for several hours next time, but if you want an immediately more effective (and better smelling) dye try the N Rage dye. If anyone has tried the purple Amore dye, please let me know!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching, dying, shaving and dreading my hair for nearly 30 years. I&#x27;ve tried every product on the market with various success (usually not up to what I was actually trying to accomplish). I tried Splat without any sort of expectation and I was completely amazed!! Not only did the bleach take the blue black right out of my hair, it didn&#x27;t fry my hair either. I have nearly waist length, medium thick hair and as long as you keep the bleach moist, a little goes a LONG way. I had zero skin irritation except for where I didn&#x27;t wipe it off immediately and the bleach process took about 2 hours, remember, blue black cheap dye was what I was removing. Rinsed all the bleach ought and got an interesting shade of orange (almost left it that color actually). Dried my hair (which took an hour, between the length and the porousness created by the bleach) and then did the pink dye. Like I said before, I had no real expectations...Manic Panic let me down, Special Effects was useless. I left the dye on all day, 6 hours at least, did housework, took care of my pets, went to the store, got some funny looks (I live in the country with cowboys so you can imagine...) No skin reactions (I think Splat is a vegetable based dye like MP so it doesn&#x27;t do the nasty stuff that that chemical dyes do). I finally rinsed my pink helmet in cool water for about 20 minutes, in the shower and was shocked, amazed, astounded and thrilled at the color!! My hair was not only so pink I could barely look at it, it was silky and soft and just beautiful. FIY~ I only use shampoo and conditioner that is not tested on animals and contains no animal by products, this may or may not make a difference. I do know that most shampoo contains sulfates and this will strip the color (even natural color) right out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Any way, I love the color!!! And it&#x27;s been almost two months, some color washes out with every shampoo but it&#x27;s still VERY vibrant!&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;Keep the bleachoff your skin, it will irritate.&lt;br /&gt;Keep the bleach moist, it stops working when it dries out. A plant mister works great!&lt;br /&gt;Dry thoroughly before adding the color.&lt;br /&gt;Leave the color on WAY past the recommended time if you want it to be vibrant and last. It&#x27;s vegetable dye, it won&#x27;t fry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse with the coolest water you can stand.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t shampoo after rinsing, just condition.&lt;br /&gt;If you must wash your hair every day use cool water and minimal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Use sulfate free shampoo (Loreal Shampure is decent and CHEAP).&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!!&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah and I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist so I&#x27;m not talking out of my a**!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the purple, red and pink kits and have had fab results with all of them. I used the purple on my sisters virgin hair (all freakin 3 feet of it) and it came out beautiful. She has naturally light brown hair so I didn&#x27;t use the bleach (more for me)!</li>
            <li> Very good product. I did the bleach process wrong as I should have used two products instead of one.. I have very thick hair. I swear it has a  mind of its own lol. I ended up with pink red hair but her I love it &#x3D;]. To go longer than a dayw ithout a shower try using baby powder on your hair to make the grease not look so bad xD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I know to bleach it before I get the kit... &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will get again &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> My sister and I both bought 2 different colors of this product and we both ended up unsatisfied. My sister tried hers first and tried to get a nice purple color. My sister hated it so much she dyed her hair another normal color that very night after scrubbing all the purple off her body with lava soap. I mayself thought that instead of using my hair i would use a wig I had that was very bleached already. Well as i started dying the hair the dye was dropping on to the sink and counter and making a mess. I moved the wig to the tub but in the process began to turn the tub blue. By the time I gave up on the wig the blue dye was allover the tub. When I finally had time to scrub it it took me nearly 3 hours to clean it using comet, brillo pads and finally a bleach solution to get it clean again. I will never use this product again even if my life depended on it.</li>
            <li> I first got pink highlights about three years ago and I&#x27;ve spent all that time finding a color worthy of the salon stuff my friend used on me. I&#x27;ve tried Jazzing, Color Rays among others. This is the BEST stuff I&#x27;ve used so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got medium brown hair that I have dyed to a dark chocolate brown (almost a black when it&#x27;s first done), then I chunk out what I want highlighted and bleach it. It lightens my hair to a coppery orange. I then go over my entire head with the Splat Pink Fetish. It gives my darker color a slightly pink tint in sunlight, but the highlighted areas are a BRIGHT fuchsia that I absolutely adore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend you use sturdy rubber gloves and not the food service gloves that come in the package. They tear easily and this color WILL STAIN EVERYTHING it comes in contact with. The first time I used it, I wasn&#x27;t careful and got a big splotch of it on my scalp. My boss thought I was bleeding when she saw it. Color remover should take care of problems like that, so I&#x27;d pick some of that up, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I say it stains everything, I&#x27;m not kidding. I would wear rubber gloves to wash your hair the first couple times if you don&#x27;t want your fingers pink. It&#x27;ll also ruin a perfectly good manicure, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY surprised at how gentle this dye was on my hair. I process my hair a LOT and have been dying it one color or another for the better part of twenty years. It&#x27;s been through a LOT, but this dye doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair or even dry it out. I do, however, heavy condition it once or twice a month with a deep conditioner which probably helps with that.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dye! I have been dyeing my hair for about a year now, and I just got into unnatural colors. Before using this, I used Manic Panic after midnight blue, and was very disappointed with my results. The color faded really fast, and very unevenly. I decided to go for a pink color, and stumbled across Splat at my walmart. I bought 2 boxes becuase my hair is pretty long, and I usually need 2 or 3 boxes. I used both things of bleach completely, becuase there wasn&#x27;t much in there, but just enough to cover my hair. The bleach got all the blueish greenish color out and left my hair bright blonde after an hour of sitting. I dyed my hair the next day, and only needed about 3/4 of one package to cover all my hair!! I left it in for an hour. The boxes do NOT have a plastic cap, which was disappointing, but I used a bag. I left the color in for an hour, and after rinsing for 30 minutes, it was almost clear (it will never run fully clear) and I LOVE the color! It has been 2 weeks and my color is still strong, and bright!! I get lots of people saying they love the color!!     total pros:  long lasting, easy to use, lots of dye per package, vibrant, smells great!    total cons:   runs whenever it gets wet, not a lot of bleach</li>
            <li> I use a different color of this product about every 6 months on my bangs. the color never full fades out for me, even after bleaching to add the new color. For me that works it ends up looking like i have a very cool fade done on my hair. When I apply it though I dry my hair out a lot first by washing it with dish soap then I let my hair soak in it for a few hours, about 5 or 6. I use a baggie to do that and just rubber band it with my hair sitting in the dye. the color stays bright and pretty much true to the box for at least 6 months but it does bleed sometimes which sucks even after months of daily washings. but not much and not enough to stain at that point</li>
            <li> I bought this at the local drugstore after deciding to color bits of my hair BRIGHT SHOCKING pink. of course i read reviews on the product BEFORE buying it.  the quality of the bleach was okay. it could have been better, but you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;anyway, the color the pink came out in my hair after leaving it in with foils for a little over half an hour is AMAZING!  it&#x27;s been nearly 2 months since i highlighted it pink and it&#x27;s STILL hot , bright shocking pink! i love the quality of this dye. the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the 1st few washings after the dyeing teh color bleeds like crazy. other than that it&#x27;s high praises from this chick. oh, the dye smells kind of like fruit. its not smelly like other dyes.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I continue to use this product is because it&#x27;s the only hot pink dye that is both affordable and convenient (you could purchase it at Walgreen&#x27;s). Other than that, it&#x27;s terrible. I have naturally black hair and the instructions said that the bleach will turn my hair the accurate color in 1-2 hours. However, it took 5 hours to bleach a small strip of my hair to dye hot pink. 5 hours! And it still didn&#x27;t bleach all the way. The product itself is horrible. Instructions state that if you leave the dye in for 30 minutes, your hair will remain vibrant pink for 4 months. However, this product washes out of my hair with every shampooing, leaving my pink highlight a nasty, neon orange color. You literally have to reapply the dye and complete the entire dying process over again after every wash. It&#x27;s so time consuming and such a hassle. Though I know it&#x27;s harming my hair, I resorted to combing the dye through onto my highlight and then straightening it with a flat iron to dry.   Will not be purchasing this product again and will definitely be looking for a new one. I&#x27;ve finally come to my senses and realized that $9.99 could be put to much better use.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this company I don&#x27;t even know where to start. I got my package on time but when I opened it the splat oxide was uncapped and the solution was all over the entire box of product making it useless.It was also all over the packing box as well. It also dripped on my carpet and I now have melted spots on my carpet. I followed their requirements for refund which I didn&#x27;t really want I just wanted a replacement and they offered me a 2 dollar credit! toward what I have no idea. Needless to say you can imagine where I told them they could put their 2 dollars. My advise, if you are purchasing a liquid product, do not purchase it from this vender!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Splat for a long time. It works better than Manic Panic or Punky Color. It can be messy, so be careful...but all products like this can be messy. This product is more vibrant and lasts longer than other dyes, and it is not damaging unless you use the bleach. I have dark brown hair and I bleached out the underneath section of my hair and chunks on top. Then I added Splat (the raspberry color) to all of my hair. The result is a gorgeous burgundy red color with dark and light variations that look like highlights. People always compliment it and ask where I got it done. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone. None of the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hairdyes like Feria or Loreal are this bold and dramatic.</li>
            <li> This color looks great...for about a week. Then it fades DRAMATICALLY :( Not long lasting at all, but if your looking for temporary color, give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for the last 25 years.  At home and at salons.  I have a good grip on the process.  I used the \\&quot;Pink Fetish\\&quot; kit.  I did not bleach my hair first, my base color is a fairly light reddish-blonde.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting intense color since I wasn&#x27;t using bleach first.  I applied per directions.  I did chunky hightlights, wrapping each section in plastic.  Allowed to soak in about 45 minutes.  I was really pleased with the color!  It came out much more saturated and bright on my natural hair color than I had expected.  I loved the look and the application was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side was that it didn&#x27;t last long at all.  I did the first wash on day 3 and did use cold water.  But the next two washed were at the gym, and I had to have the hot water, just had to.  By the 3rd wash, the color was about 50% faded, to a light pink.  Very subtle.  Today I&#x27;m at 5 washes and about 10 days out and it&#x27;s barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would consider using it again, because the color was so pretty and it was easy to use.  But that&#x27;s a lot of maintenance.  So I will probably try a couple alternatives to see if I can get comparable color with more longevity.</li>
            <li> The bleach didn&#x27;t work for beans,  but the hair dye was very intense and brilliant.  I thought it would be muddy like the manic panic colors but it&#x27;s much more vibrant.  I&#x27;ve had it in my hair for about a month now and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> This product color is very bright and turned out great. My daughter wanted the tips of her blond hair dyed pink. To get the color really bright we left the color in for twice the time recommended. My daughter was very happy. She wants to try blue next! I will warn you that if you have very blonde hair the color will not come out easily over time. We put the color in three months ago and the tips of her hair are still a little pink. We will only be using this color for the tips of her hair as it is easy to trim off if needed.</li>
            <li> The pink looked fantastic when dyed on bleached hair! It stayed bright for a very long time and worked well on even my unbleached, natural blonde hair. The only thing is that it lasts a bit too long. It&#x27;s been 7-8 months since I originally dyed highlights and underneath my hair with the splat pink and I still have some pink in parts of my hair. Even after being treated to get color out, some still persists in my hair. It&#x27;s a great, vibrant color but would urge buyers to think twice about what they&#x27;re doing with their hair after they dye it pink.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly for this dye and it did not turn out how I wanted it. I have dark brown hair and was only planning on doing a few highlights, so I bleached it to a dark blonde/ light brown and left the dye on for about 20 minutes. It looked great at first but 2 days later and the color is almost completely gone! I washed it once with color safe shampoo and still, it&#x27;s barely pink. I&#x27;d use something else.</li>
            <li> great color that lasts fairly well</li>
            <li> NOT good. Yes, it does dye your hair really bright. But it&#x27;s more of a permanent stain than anything. Leaves splotchy pieces of color on your scalp in a very unflattering way. Not good for all over dye. Only maybe for partial color. Color fell on my toe and I wiped it off right away and it didn&#x27;t come off. Dye should be able to be wiped off after 2 seconds, I mean come on. Now I have to scrub my hair to try and get it to look somehow normal before trying to redye it with a different brand. I do not recommend!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I bought the Luscious Raspberries, totally excited to get the deep red shown on the box. Well, I can honestly say it turned a bright fuchsia/pink color instead. I have long hair, and required two boxes. This stuff is extremely hard to work with and it took at least 2 hours of dying before I was finished (this didn&#x27;t include the hour of dying my hair blonde the night before). I chose to not use the bleach included to keep my hair from being fried, but I fear it may have turned out worse and my hair would&#x27;ve been way past fixing. The consistency of the die is not even close to a regular hair dye kit, it is like jelly and you are not able to squirt a bunch on and just rub it in. My boyfriend had to keep squirting a glob into his hand and smudging it into my hair that way. Then once the color is on, it will not spread. It coats the outside hairs and leaves ones on the inside uncolored, therefore it is extremely hard because you have to touch every single hair with the color individually or you will have blotches and dark spots. Also, I would recommend not getting into the shower to rinse because it stains the entire tub - walls, shower curtain, EVERYTHING. Looks like mass murder in the shower. It also stains anything that it touches. I am okay with how my hair turned out, only because I can rock the pink. If you are going to be pissed that your hair doesn&#x27;t match the box, especially after all the hassle and money, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I used Splat&#x27;s Pink Fetish, which worked wonderfully to turn my hair into radioactive pink.  Granted, this product will work differently for different people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am male, my hair started out exactly 16mm long, and my hair is naturally dark blonde.  Given this amount of hair and this already light hair color, the provided hair bleach and hair dye were more than enough for me.  I had the hair bleach in my hair for about a half hour, which thoroughly bleached my hair to a very light golden color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have ever had any coloration or bleaching of my hair done, and I did this completely by myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers complain of getting boils and other skin problems from the hair dye.  This did not happen to me, nor does it happen to most people.  However, there is a warning about this on the bottle.  Some people&#x27;s skin is allergic to the hair dye.  The instructions give a recommended 24 hour skin test to perform before doing the full hair dye.  I skipped this test and lucked out, but it would be a good idea to do it.  Just plan on waiting 24 hours before performing the real hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the list of items I used:&lt;br /&gt;- Latex gloves.  The gloves provided in the kit are enormous, and you will need at least two sets of gloves.&lt;br /&gt;- Splat Pink hair dye kit&lt;br /&gt;- Glad Plastic Wrap&lt;br /&gt;- Petroleum jelly&lt;br /&gt;- Paper Towels&lt;br /&gt;- Plastic hair cap / shower cap&lt;br /&gt;- Hand-held mirror, in addition to the fixed bathroom mirror&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the procedure I followed:&lt;br /&gt;- Wash hair with a bar of plain soap in shower&lt;br /&gt;- Dry hair thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;- Apply petroleum jelly on forehead, ears, and all around the hair line&lt;br /&gt;- Bleach hair using Splat&#x27;s provided bleach.  Follow bleach directions and make sure to use gloves.  Do not be afraid to put on the bleach.  You want to cover the entirety of your hair as quickly as possible.  Do the odd places, like the outer edge of your hair and the back of your head first.&lt;br /&gt;- Leave in the bleach for one hour, or less if it is working well.  It was obvious after about 30 minutes that my hair was extremely light.  I did not use a hair cap for this, but I did wash my hands with water and then sprinkle the water onto my hair to keep the bleaching agent wet.  It stops working when it dries out.&lt;br /&gt;- Wash hair with soap and water in shower&lt;br /&gt;- Put down plastic wrap in the sink and on the counter&lt;br /&gt;- Petroleum jelly on ears, neck, forehead, and all around hairline&lt;br /&gt;- Put the dye into your hair, making sure to get everything.  Use a fresh pair of gloves for this.&lt;br /&gt;- Put shower cap on and wait for 2-4 hours (I personally waited 1.5 hours)&lt;br /&gt;- After waiting long enough, take off shower cap and dry your hair as quickly as possible.  A hair dryer would work great, but I do not have a hair dryer, so I just put my head in front of a heated air vent for several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Rinse hair in shower with cold water until the water is only lightly tinted.  The water coming off my hair actually turned perfectly clear after several rinses, but this is probably because I have so little hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Immediately dry hair afterward.  The towel will be stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only 16mm-length hair, and I used most of the bleach and 2/3 of the hair dye.  Granted, I wanted a very thorough bleach and a very thorough, bright pink.  If you have more hair or darker hair, you will certainly want to get more than one kit, and likely a stronger, stand-alone hair bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did all of this naked to prevent getting the bleach or dye on any clothes.  I got specks of bleach and dye on my shoulders, which was no problem.  I just wiped them off with paper towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair bleach is corrosive.  It will burn any skin that it comes into contact with.  For this reason, try to avoid putting it on your scalp, and make sure to put petroleum jelly all around your hair and especially your ears, just as you should when you use the hairdye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it rains, your hair will drip pink.  I think this is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Splat hair dye will stain anything in concentrated form.  This is why I put plastic wrap all over the bathroom sink and counter.  However, Splat hair dye is not powerful enough to stain anything in the shower when you are washing your hair at the end, or anytime in the future.  It will always stain your towel, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody, including a professional hair stylist and a French jewelry diva, has been telling me they love my hair.  Many people tell me that usually pink hair attempts are ugly and faded, but my hair is truly radioactive pink!in concentrated form.

            <li> My daughter saved her money and bought the luscious raspberry for a bright red look.  We followed the directions exactly and her color came up bright pink like the halloween wigs you find at the store.  She was heartbroken.  Can&#x27;t find a number to call them at and get advice.</li>
            <li> If you are hoping for the same shade of the box that doesn&#x27;t always happen, if you have very dark hair the bleach may not get light enough. I got a great magenta color. I do suggest that you be very careful as the product will stain your clothing, counters, floors, and body/face when in the bottle format. After if sets into your hair it will not do so anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product gets to hot the color will not take, and if it gets to cold the bleach will get hard and come out too thick to use correctly, so keeping it room temp is key between uses.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before and was not looking for anything too bold.  My hair is light brown and I used the Berry color from the Multicolor kit to put a streak on each side of my face.  I did not use the bleach because I was scared of too much color to be honest.  The 3 small packets in this kit would be ideal for highlights but more would be needed to dye your full head.  So without pre-bleaching, I left the color on for one hour and after washing was left with a bright berry purple color.  The results were exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> i used the lavender one and it looks nothing like the picture! i hate the color and it bleeds everywhere weeks later. very frustrating. the color is not consistent and is different variations of pink n it looks rly awful.&lt;br /&gt;do not get this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased two kits, the Lusty Lavender and the Blue Envy, intending to dye blue and purple streaks into my hair. I probably should have known that I couldn&#x27;t get streaks without foils, but that&#x27;s my own failing. Other than that, though, the kits worked much better than I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally a fairly light ash blonde, and it was highlighted a long time ago and never grew out, so I really only bleached it so the color would take well. I was surprised at the results of the bleach -- it pulled my hair to a lovely golden blonde that I might go back to after my color&#x27;s faded out. It was strong, and the fumes didn&#x27;t feel great on my eyes, but overall, that part of the kit wasn&#x27;t lacking in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day, I attempted to put in the purple and blue streaks. However, I didn&#x27;t use enough dye, and I didn&#x27;t leave them in for long enough, so they weren&#x27;t dark enough for my liking. In addition, since I was doing it in stages, and I&#x27;d done two applications of bleach, I didn&#x27;t have any gloves left to do the dyeing. DO NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE. My hands were stained black, and the only things that made a significant dent in the color were nail polish remover and Veet hair remover. Wait until you have gloves. It was a horrendous mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color after the first application was more pink and cornflower blue, which wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for, so I went back and thoroughly dyed all of my hair but an inch or two at the top. I let it sit for about two hours, and then went to rinse it out -- a process which took nothing short of eternity. Two days after, I&#x27;m still rinsing out purple, but I expected that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I finished the second application, I wound up with a very rich, dark, even, and dimensional color that&#x27;s a mix of purple, blue, and indigo, lighter in some places, darker in others, which I think looks much more &#x27;natural&#x27;. Great kit, although I do think they should include two pairs of gloves for people who dye their hair over two days.</li>
            <li> followed instructions.  left in prescribed amount time.  almost all of the color time washed out on the first wash.  by washed out, i mean hair went back to color before bleaching.  NEVER going to use this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought the Pink Fetish. The bleach it comes with is horrible. I let it sit probably longer than i should have and it still wasn&#x27;t as bleached as other bleaches have done, as well as a few spots barely stripped, and I have light brown hair. Good news is it did not fry my hair. The dye however is amazing. The formula is just as extreme as the box warns. it gets everywhere and WILL stain if you don&#x27;t wipe it up right away. But that extreme color is perfect for your hair. The pink in my hair is bold and gorgeous, more magenta than I&#x27;d like but that&#x27;s because the bleach, still love the color. Also, sounds weird but smells kind of good at first, almost like artificial cherry.  When in the shower I use cold water for my hair and wash it every other day. Let the water run clear like the directions say. I&#x27;ve also heard you can add dye to conditioner to refresh the color but have yet to try that.  Overall this product is pretty good! Try a different bleach but the dye is definitely good quality.</li>
            <li> I have very very very dark hair, and I&#x27;ve tried the pink &amp; purple. Both worked great on me. You need to leave the bleach in way longer than the directions say if you have dark hair.    [...] &lt; my results.</li>
            <li> Okay. So maybeeee everyone but me know that Splat isn&#x27;t permanent. But nowhere in the directions or on the box does it explicitly say whether it is perm or semi/demi or temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bleached streaks out of my hair and applied the Lusty Lavender...I left the dye on for 2 hours. It did not adhere and bleed out within a few days, now I have pinky purple hair patches everywhere I applied it AND it muddled into my natural light brown hair. So now my hair looks pretty terrible. Color fix doesn&#x27;t work on direct dye btw. I had some of it bleached out. Now I am waiting to see if it will completely fade out or if I am going to have to dye my hair dark brown. I just wanted purple streaks! and now I&#x27;ve had to apply bleach 2x (once to lighten, another to get some of the color off!) and my hair is damaged, not too bad but considering my hair is past my shoulders and wassss healthy and now has minor breakage all the way up...I&#x27;m pissed! For newbie like me just getting on the bright hair dye scene and don&#x27;t have peeps watching out for us PUT TEMPORARY ON THE BOX &amp; ON THE DIRECTIONS...all the other ones like Manic Panic and Directions DO. If I had realized I was getting temp dye I wouldn&#x27;t have used it!!!!</li>
            <li> Splat is AWFUL! I tried to die my hair Lusty Lavender in January of this year. Instead, the insanely strong bleach over-processed my hair. Essentially, my hair will not hold any kind of color – permanent or temporary. As a result, I&#x27;ve had to dye my hair 10 times in the last 6 months every time with permanent hair color. After 5-6 washes, I have to re-dye my hair again because the color fades. This product is horrible and damaging to your hair. DO NOT USE IT EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about this product is when I called Splat (Christine – (951) 738-8595), they sent over two free bottles of the same hair color. The tops of the clear processing liquid exploded in shipping, and the boxes were damaged. It took me 2 months from original contact to call them in regards to the issue. The lady above didn’t even ask to see photos of the damaged boxes as proof she simply sent two more boxes. Essentially, I received four free packs of hair color because of the one that originally did damage to my hair. I was able to use small bottles of 20 Cream Developer from Sally’s (much healthier than the clear stuff originally in the packs) and sell all four boxes of color. At least that’s some vindication for what occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If enough people that were wronged by this company took this approach, we could bring down this horrible, faulty company for good. Think about it ladies and gentlemen, and take some action. Maybe if they lose enough profits they will do something about their low quality products.</li>
            <li> I must admit, when I first purchased this product, I was very doubtful about it, but my mind was quickly changed. I&#x27;ve had my hair bright red for the past few months using Manic Panic pillarbox red (I bleached it before doing it red), but once it started to fade I needed to redo it. Short on cash, and with no legit beauty places near me, I stumbled  into the nearest WalMart (no, I didn&#x27;t buy this product off Amazon but I figured this might help some people out, regardless), I had been wanting to do my hair hot pink again for a while, so this color was a give in.    The kit comes with dye, gloves and bleach. I didn&#x27;t use the bleach for a few reasons; my hair had already been prelightened a couple months ago and I only use a certain kind of bleach, because I know it won&#x27;t wreck my hair (clairol 30).     After my purchase, I got home and got to work right away. I planned on dying half my hari half black, and half Pink fetish. I separated my hair and applied the pink, leaving it on for 20 minutes, than blow drying it for 5. I than applied black dye to the other side of my head and left both dyes on for 25 minutes. I washed them out, using cool water, shampoo, etc. I was AMAZED by the results. Seriously, it looks AWESOME. It&#x27;s so vibrant and beautiful. If anyone has used Manic Panic&#x27;s hot hot pink,the dye itself resembles that, but comes out a more true hot pink (hot hot pink by manic panic looks more fuscia). I loved this dye, I have been dying my hair with semi&#x27;s for over 7 years, and I&#x27;m VERY pleased. I know many people out there are very skeptical when it comes to drug store \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; dyes, as was I since I&#x27;ve been screwed over by punky looking dyes from drugstores in the past, but this is the real deal. Take it from me, I&#x27;ve used every dye in the book and I see nothing wrong with this stuff, except it smells kinda funky, but that&#x27;s expected...I guess. Hope this helped some people out! :)</li>
            <li> Splat hair dye is just the most amazing thing on the market. I&#x27;ve used almost every color, and they never cease to produce a shocking, vibrant color. The bleach smells like cherries (unlike the chemical smelling ones from other kits!). I just used the pink fetish today, and it is a BRIGHT, neon pink. It is a bit dark, but I had to bleach out permanent black hair dye, so my hair wasn&#x27;t as blonde as it should be. And for the people who complain that it&#x27;s messy, you need to prepare for it. All hair dyes are a liquidy disaster, unless you have a lot of towels, petroleum jelly, and patience. I didn&#x27;t get a single drop on me. Splat is just an amazing hair dye company, and the colors have lasted me for months at a time, without a need to redye. My blue actually faded to a silver and purple, rather than a dull green. To close my review, I would recommend Splat to ANYONE looking for bright, long lasting hair dye.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It starts out *really* pink and fades after a month or so to a vibrant but less in-your-face pink. I like how it looks post-fade better than SPLAT&#x27;s purple.</li>
            <li> This product, if used with bleach, leaves a very vivid and intense hair color that has lasted for over five months for me so far.      There are a few drawbacks though: it really is very messy.  I&#x27;ve used natural color hair dyes for years now, and never had a mess issue.  But this stuff is serious about the mess warnings.  The dye will wash off of the skin within a week (I used a little alcohol to help strip it), but it&#x27;s better to just use petroleum jelly.    And, secondly, if you hair is even slightly longer than your shoulders, you need to buy more than one kit.  Neither the bleach or the dye in one kit was enough for my hair, only slightly past my shoulders, so I needed to purchase two to get the entire effect.  It&#x27;s worth it, but it&#x27;s a warning that should be taken into consideration.    That said, it&#x27;s a very nice, if slightly messy (three months later and the color still runs in the shower) hair dye.</li>
            <li> Box severely damaged (Wet and smashed) as well as instructions and bleach powder. Everything was wet like it was in water before being shipped. Also no seal on either bottles.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this stuff because it came in an all in one kit and the color was what I was looking for.    It took 6 shampoos to get the bleach out of my hair completely before I could put on the color. Strong stuff, burned too.    I followed the instructions for timing &amp; 1st wash after the application of the color. States rince until water runs clear. Never really happened. Plus the color started fading on its own the over the next few days. Lost half the remaining color the 2nd wash 3 days later.     Now my problem is I can&#x27;t get rid of the remaining pink streaks in my hair. I&#x27;ve washed it tons of times and rebleached it as directed on their website. Top it off after trying to get rid of the remaining streaks in the last bleach session by a pro, my hair is falling out and my hair is still pink!</li>
            <li> Wicked awesome color. I did highlights in my daughters hair. I had to bleach it twice, and this was the second dye we  tried and was by far better. Easy to use. Easy to follow directions. Don&#x27;t know if the color is as long lasting as it says cause its only been three days, but so far so good. Found this same product on other websites, but amazon had the best deal.</li>
            <li> this product is SO easy to use, even for a first-time dyer :)  process:   1. wash lightly sunkissed, but still dark brown hair with shampoo, no conditioner  2. don&#x27;t bleach- skip straight to color  3. rub it in, wrap in foil, and blast with heat every 15 minutes or so, repeat for 2 hrs  4. rinse in the shower. didn&#x27;t stain my tub, but I didn&#x27;t rinse the plastic curtain off and it&#x27;s slightly pink in spots  5. enjoy perfectly plum hair!!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!! Splat is my fav if ur going for super long lasting!!</li>
            <li> this product worked really well! I dyed my hair pink for fun and it stayed in long enough and did not feel like hair spray. It had good color and did not dry my hair out like a lot of hair dyes. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bleached and dyed my dark hair. My hair turned a nice blonde and then the color wouldn&#x27;t stick. I left it on for the recommended time for 1-6 months. What a joke. I have rinsed in cold to cool water every time and the color still is running out every time I rinse or wash my hair. I would think it should last more than 5 days!! Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 splat products from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;orange.&lt;br /&gt;pink.&lt;br /&gt;green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the pink, a more than likely often used color was wonderful. it was thick, the bleach was good. I was 100% happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the orange and green. The dye for both was extremely watery. I had to put the dye ON my glove and rub it into my glove to put it in my hair. It took just fine, but it was a pain to get into my hair and i spilled half of it on the ground thanks to it being so thin. The bleach on the other hand, was a whole different story. It was too thick. I had to water it down and ended up having to buy another thing of bleach because i couldn&#x27;t get it watered down to create enough to use (what SHOULD HAVE been in there) obviously some of the liquid leaked out on the way to my mailbox. I am very unhappy with the product i recieved from the orange and green. I believe if you&#x27;re going to buy from this seller, buy colors that people use often, which is pretty much pink and purple. Otherwise, find somewhere else to get your stuff because the quality isn&#x27;t worth the cash.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of Manic Panic for years but it is not always so attainable. They only sell over the net and at specialty shops. I was caught with white hair (as my old color had faded out)and had no idea when I could make it to Sally&#x27;s to get my color so I grabbed this at Walmart as a very temporary solution. This stuff is wayyyyy better then even the amplified version of Manic Panic. The color is truer. It stays pink and does not fade to that ugly salmon color. I have had it in my hair for 4 months now and it has barely faded at all which if you use unnatural colors in your hair is epic. I really massage this in to freshly bleached hair like I was shampooing it then put a plastic cap on it for a couple hours.The bleach is really weak and did not work well as most reviewers have mentioned. Not a big deal for me considering the price. It is still very reasonable. I will buy this again and again. The best for true, bright and long lasting color. I have used every color but green with amazing results. If you want something that is only going to last a few weeks then go with the Manic panic.</li>
            <li> So I kind of have both sides of the spectrum for this review. I used this product first and was IN LOVE with it. It came out a beautiful pink. I did not need the bleach because my hair is naturally a very light blonde, so all I used was the pink dye.&lt;br /&gt;So my friend also loved it so I went ahead and did her hair with it. She naturally has dark brown hair, so we used the bleach, and had to use it for a while (obviously). Anyway the bleach drove her crazy, burning, itching... but I didn&#x27;t think much of it. So then we applied the dye, left it on for 40 minutes....and washed out. Her hair came out a light pink (like the breast cancer awareness pink), mine had come out dark. However, we liked the difference. However, the next day, and no she didn&#x27;t wash her hair at all, it had faded out in the weirdest splotches I&#x27;ve ever seen. We thought maybe I hadn&#x27;t used enough so we reapplied the dye and waited 40 more minutes...washed out and it was perfect!&lt;br /&gt;However a wash later and ugly faded splotches.....&lt;br /&gt;I am honestly amazed at the drastic differences in results we both had with the same product!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had my dye in for three weeks and I wash it every other day...My color hasn&#x27;t faded a bit. But being that I have light blonde hair it&#x27;s pretty easy to dye.&lt;br /&gt;We both washed in cold water to maintain the colors integrity&lt;br /&gt;We both used color shampoo&lt;br /&gt;We both waited 48 hours for first wash.....&lt;br /&gt;I have to say we will be using special effects to fix my friends hair and to redo mine when needed, I don&#x27;t trust the results of this one.</li>
            <li> love it...it is messy so get ready for some clean up.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It does stain your skin, however I found Dawn Dishwashing liquid the pink kind helps take it off.  Also on my sink I got it all over and I just sprayed bleach cleaner on it and left it.  It took it off.&lt;br /&gt;Mine only lasted a few weeks but I washed my hair daily.&lt;br /&gt;I am in the process of dying it again.</li>
            <li> This is the second time this has happened. The first time was with the purple dye and now this. I love your bleach, but that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m ever going to get. This dye is simply god awful.</li>
            <li> ive been using the splat colors for years, not only in my hair but also in friends&#x27; hair... i use the pink my self, but the first time i put it in i was going from black hair to white to bleach it all out and it was past my shoulders... so i did have to go out and buy more bleach.. but the color does last longer than the 6 weeks it even says... if your going for a pink that yor not willing to maintain and you dont want to get out any time soon go for this, because when i cut my hair and bleached it out to white again it took two professional bleaches (i went to salon to get it done.. although i missed color so about a month later i put it back in parts... but warning if you only use on parts of your hair and you have blonde hair it will bleed in to it and make it a lighter pink... but the intense color lasts months and will bleed in the shower for a while, it will slow down toward the end of the first month and to make the color last even longer i recommend washing your hair in cold water and not every day and use a good color protecting shampoo (i use aveda color conserve)    in a nut shell.... i love the stuff and use it all the time, for my self and others... but you need to take care of it if you want it to stay in for a long time</li>
            <li> decent bleach and color. Color is pretty, doesnt stay vibrant very long washes out kind of quick. I prefer Punky Color but keep this around to mix with my other color when I feel like highlights.</li>
            <li> The first product I bought (almost 2 years ago) was the Lusty Lavender. I absolutely loved it! I color the underside of my hair and have the top highlighted professionally. I naturally have a light brown hair but still bleach my hair to a lighter blonde, I feel that this helps the color last a bit longer than just putting it on natural hair. I have used a few different colors over the last 2 years; lavender, blue envy, Crimson obsession and pink fetish. Some colors in my experience last longer than others, but it might just be how I treated my hair in the process. THIS WILL STAIN YOUR SKIN. I usually have assistance from a friend but have done it myself in the past, this is when I stained my skin. I have used Nair to remove small stain spots AWAY from my hairline (I use it kinda like soap, DO NOT leave it on your skin unless you want to lose hair). Usually I reapply color every 4-5 weeks, re-bleaching the roots every 3 months or so. Overall this product is user friendly and looks great! I get compliments all the time, people love it!</li>
            <li> It faded out after two washes and what was left of it managed to stain the collar of my shirt. I&#x27;ve been dyeing my own hair for years and I will NEVER use this brand again. Terrible.</li>
            <li> I have been using bright hair colors for about 18 years. In the past I used Manic Panic and it faded - this stuff does NOT fade very quickly at all! I dyed my hair purple in October 2011 and it was still there nine months later! I bleached it and it STILL stayed, except it turned pink. This color will show through even if you dye over it, so be sure you want that color!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently have white hair with blue and pink on the top. The pink is still vibrant and the blue is very dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two words of caution:&lt;br /&gt;The bleach is rough. Really really rough. Not too bad on the hair but very bad on the skin. It makes my whole head burn. Other bleach kits do not do this and I do not have sensitive skin. It does not, however, seem to do damage to the skin. No redness or anything. It just hurts till you wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing is that you will think this is all washing out. For the first five or six washes, you&#x27;ll see a LOT of color in the sink. If part of your hair is still white or natural color, protect it the first few washes - coat all the hair except the colored portions by rubbing in conditioner while the hair is dry. That way, when you wash, you won&#x27;t get the color residue on the other hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product four stars simply because of the bleach - the color itself is great. I have used purple, blue, and pink.</li>
            <li> My daughter used splat on her hair and it ruined it! Before using splat we asked a beautician that we know well, and she said it would be okay because my daughter&#x27;s hair was extremely healthy. SHE WAS WRONG! After bleaching her hair, and adding the red dye, her hair turned an ugly dark color. It took her an hour of being in the shower to get her hair to turn red. Once it was red, she stepped out and slightly dripped on the bathroom rug. The stain is STILL there. We tried everything to get it out, but NOTHING worked. After a few months of having her red highlights, she decided to get rid of them. She said she would rather have two natural colors (peek a boo style), so I took her to get her hair professionally done. The beauticians could NOT get the red dye out. Bleach, color remover, brown dye, nothing took it out. She finally had to dye her hair black, and even with the black the splat eventually started to show through. After they dyed her hair black, they cut off SIX INCHES of her hair.  Splat will ruin your hair, and stain everything it touches, period.</li>
            <li> My baby girl has this color in her hair ( shes 17) and it does it job well....beautiful output. Now my girl has pink hair. PINK to the world.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have my hair purple, but not too vibrant. I&#x27;ve read that people got funky colors, like bright pink, but I didn&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t bother to bleach my hair, so I now have a nice, rich deep purple underlayer. It was messy, but came out of everything except my skin easily. That needed several toothpaste scrubs, and I do recommend toothpaste. It&#x27;s cheap and easy in a pinch. It did take a bit to get it to stop running off in the shower, but I find that this is way better than Manic Panic.</li>
            <li> I have used this exact product numerous times before and I was just as satisfied with this one not to mention it was half the price I usually pay!</li>
            <li> Aqua Rush doesn&#x27;t look very good. It&#x27;s teal, not Aqua. It bleeds badly, even when left on overnight. Looks sloppy. I won&#x27;t try it again.</li>
            <li> The best / longest lasting pink color ever... so good for the price and really easy to use for first time hair-dyers :)</li>
            <li> I recently let my daughter get her hair Dip Dyed and we used a bleach first than a pink color which faded in about 6 weeks we looked every where for another pink color to get that vibrant color back with no luck. A hair dressor recommended this Splat color and its amazing on even the dark colored hair my daughter has.</li>
            <li> Best pink hair dye I&#x27;ve used so far. First it was brighter pink than color on box, now after 3 weeks it looks lighter but still good pink. I had bleached blonde hair already so didn&#x27;t use the bleach but will use it for roots later, before I re-do pink.</li>
            <li> I was VERY happy with the result I got from bleaching then coloring my hair the pink fetish color. I was amazed! I had people i didn&#x27;t know complimenting me on my vibrant color, an telling me that my hair was so pink it looked unreal. The down side is, however, the bleach hurts like heck. I wanted to scratch my head with a fork, it felt like my head was on fire! While the results were worth it, I was VERY disappointed in how fast it faded. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I washed it a week later, and I swear it turned 20% softer. Still pink, but not vibrant. THEN i washed it again one week later, and I had blonde spots all over. The third time I washed it, i was done. From the tip of my hair down was blonde and i had to re-dye. Like I said, result was good, but how fast it washed out is barely worth it. I would&#x27;t recommend this to anyone wanting to keep their hair the color for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for about 14 years. I have never had any issues. I got a small spot of dye on my forehead and it gave me a huge chemical burn. I have never been in such pain within seconds of putting this dye on. I will never use this product again. And it wasn&#x27;t the bleach that did this it was the pink color.</li>
            <li> How do you get this crap out of your hair once you&#x27;ve dyed it?  We&#x27;ve tried color remover, bleach, lighter color, and darker color, and it&#x27;s still pink as all get out.</li>
            <li> All the money I have spent to get SPLAT Pink Fetish OUT of my hair, I could have gone to a salon and had my hair professional done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First: In no way is &amp;#34;Pink Fetish&amp;#34; PINK! It is DARK RED and DARK PURPLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to the T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the SPLAT bleach to the ends of my hair about 3&amp;#34; up as I wanted the ends of my hair to be a brighter pink than the rest of my hair. My hair turned a pretty platinum HOWEVER, after using the SPLAT Pink Fetish Dye...OMG. My hair was DARK NEON CLOWN RED! EXCEPT for the hair I did not bleach which turned DARK PURPLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok &amp;#34;bleep&amp;#34; happens, it did not come out anywhere near what I was hoping for that is not what made me HATE SPLAT!&lt;br /&gt;No, I LOATH SPLAT because it stained my SCALP! DARK HOT PINK, yes HOT PINK spots all along my edges DESPITE using VASELINE all around my edges, highly noticeable and made me look like a kid that got into some dye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to rush to Sally Beauty for HELP! I got stain remover for the skin to get the more noticeable hot pink spots from my scalp and still this was not an easy process as I had to do A LOT of scrubbing until my skin was sore to get the dye off my skin. Mind you the &amp;#34;SPLATS&amp;#34; of hot pink on my skin are &amp;#34;SPLATS&amp;#34; anymore, but where the &amp;#34;SPLATS&amp;#34; were it is still stained a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using &amp;#34;Color Opps&amp;#34; following directions to the T, I am still left with bright red hair and now streaks of CLOWN orange and yellow. I am disgusted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good *@&amp;#^$ thing Halloween is just 3 weeks away. Guess I will be going as a CLOWN thanks to SPLAT Pink Fetish!</li>
            <li> I love Splat! I&#x27;ve used Splat for 5yrs now and it&#x27;s my favorite product to use out of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried. Alot of the negative comments I&#x27;ve read were errors in set up and application instead of a problem with the product. I&#x27;ve used Lusty Lavender, Blue Envy and Pink Fetish (current) and these are all very true in color. The bleach however isn&#x27;t really mean&#x27;t for a first time all over bleach but rather touch ups on roots later. My hair is dark brown and long, all the way down to my bum. For my first dye I bought two boxes of L&#x27;Oreal Super Blonde for all over, covered my hair with two plastic bags and a towel to heat the roots and left it on for the maximum time needed to produce a pale yellow to platinum (repeat bleach to desired color). I conditioned my hair well and waited 3 days before dying my hair. I bought 2 boxes of Splat, put conditioner on all parts of my hair I didn&#x27;t want colored and starting at the tips of my hair and working to the roots. I covered my hair and didn&#x27;t skimp on the color even when I had some left. I covered my hair again with two plastic bags and a towel and waited about an hour before washing it out in the tub. I washed it till the water ran light pink and blew dry my hair so it wouldn&#x27;t bleed color. My hair doesn&#x27;t leak or rub off on my clothing. Dyeing you hair isn&#x27;t a process you should rush, as half a**ing this will cause you hair to fry or to not look good. Because the color is intense, it will dye whatever it comes in contact with in process. The color and easy application make this a great product.</li>
            <li> Used this product for my sons in order to give them wild looking hair for wrestling.  This product is not for athletes.  It bleeds when you sweat.  We have washed it 12 times and it is still bleeding.  Others comments are true it will color your tub.  The color is great but it doesn&#x27;t stay in the hair or wash out.  It has also stained there heads so shaving won&#x27;t solve the problem.  I have never seen a hair product act this way.</li>
            <li> I have dark black hair, I always wanted purple hair, I tried another kit from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store the professional there set me up with 30 developer with bleach to mix up in a bowl then picked out a purple color for me, it was a terrible experience the bleach made my hair what I like to call an orangutan orange, I never turned to a golden blonde like she said the purple she had me apply after the bleach process, the purple turned my hair orangish pink, the bleach took an hour to develop, I bought Splat the bleach is excellent I combed through it to make sure it was even but for some reason my front started turning quicker than the back, I had darker ends which is okay I put the color after shampooing the bleach and drying my hair, I came out with a dark pink and read the most helpful hints on here, I didnt like the pink so I went and add the color lavander again and I will keep it on for several hours and follow what you did with leaving it on longer, using a shower cap or for me a grocery bag and check it later to see what I come out with.. Thx to all you for your suggestions and tips and btw I washed my tub the day before and thought omg its going to stain what I just took time to clean the day before it rinsed out didnt leave any stain on my fixtures or tub... oh if you get it on your hand or skin try some liquid dish soap and baking powder it will get the stain off your skin or alcohol works well too..</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for 14 years now, usually every other months or so. I tried every colors from black to orange, from blue to pink, and so on. My hair always had a hard time keeping the colors blue, red, pink and purple on. It would fade out in just a couple of wash. And yes, I would get them done professionally as for my ex sister-in-law and one of my closes friend were both hair dressers. I now moved away from home (From Canada to the US) and I find the hair dressers VERY expensive here. So I decided to just dye my hair myself, which I have been for quite a while now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, for some reason, had the sudden urge of wanting to dye my hair in a bright funky color. So it was either bright purple or pink. My husband voted for pink, so I started browsing around to find a decent one. I read the reviews on Amazon of a lot of different brands for pink, and I landed on this one. I actually got convinced with the great comments about it. So I went to my local Walgreen and purchased one there (since I couldn&#x27;t wait!) and did it the same night. Even though I knew how to do it, I followed the instructions. My hair is naturally a dark brown, so I&#x27;ve let the bleach in for a while. And of course applied the dye as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now been just over 2 weeks, and the color haven&#x27;t fade. Plus, I live in the tropics, and we all know that the sun does damage and can be a factor to color fading... and still nothing.  For something under $15 in total that is lasting longer and did a better result than the professional dyes, I am quite impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who said that it didn&#x27;t work, you definitely did something wrong along the process. Although, I would highly recommend this Splat! product to anyone that wants bright, funky, long lasting color. I&#x27;ve done them all, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I purchased this locally and used it last night on my daughter. The color really pops! She has naturally medium/dark brown hair, so I did have to use the bleaching kit that was included. I really wish there was more product in the kit. Her hair isn&#x27;t all that long, barely shoulder length. So, if you have short hair or thinner hair, one box should do you. If you have shoulder length or longer hair...buy at least two!</li>
            <li> Easy to use but the only problem is the bleach i could only use it once, and i was stuck with extra dye</li>
            <li> For all those who say splat does not work. Well your wrong. I have naturally black hair and I always wanted to dye my hair pink. So I bought the pink fetish at Walgreens. I read some reviews so I decided to try it myself &amp; I loved it! How do I get the best results &amp; long lasting. Well I will tell you my way on having the pink fetish last long in your hair. Also the bleach works really good. If it didn&#x27;t work for you the you didn&#x27;t leave in the bleach for long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplies:&lt;br /&gt;Container (to put in the bleach and also the dye)&lt;br /&gt;Dye brush (to get in the roots)&lt;br /&gt;Gloves (so hands won&#x27;t turn pink)&lt;br /&gt;A lot of hair clips (so just the part you want will be dye)&lt;br /&gt;Good conditioner (to keep your hair moist)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tips&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: DO NOT HAVE CLEAN HAIR. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for a week. The longer you have your hair not washed the longer the hair dye will last. If you feel it&#x27;s dirty just rinse your hair with water&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: have your hair straighten. It will be easy to actually concentrate on the strands of hair you will like to dye&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: do not wash your hair everyday. It&#x27;s really bad especially if you have curly hair like me&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: do not put so much products in your hair because the dye will faid really easily&lt;br /&gt;Step 5: don&#x27;t brush your hair after your hair is wet and already dyed. Your hair will easily get damaged&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I dyed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;All I really did was put the bleach in a container and mixed it with the liquid from the bottle. I waited and then applied the bleach on my hair. I waited an hour because my hair is black. After that I washed my hair with shampoo. Then I mixed the bottle of dye and put it in the container (different container) I used the dye brush to get into my roots. Then I left the dye for about an hour hour in a half depending on how much you want it to last. After that I washed my hair out til the water became a bit clean (not fully clear but let the water run a light pink) After that I dryed my hair with a paper towel. Old Cotten T-shirt is the best! (can use old towel you don&#x27;t need) I air dried my hair and waited 2 days to straighten my hair (always straighten my hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s how I have the pink fetish dye last a long time</li>
            <li> At the local Walgreens where I shop, I had a sudden impulse to dye my bangs a crazy color. So since pink is my favorite color I saw this Splat Hair Dye in the hair color aisle and decided to give it a try. Though I&#x27;ve heard bad stuff about this (I always read reviews on things before I buy them) I thought maybe just this time I will ignore what others have said and just try it since I couldn&#x27;t find another crazy hair dye anywhere else. I wasn&#x27;t even thinking here at Amazon, but anyways when I opened the box everything was there. But the bleach is not much as you do not get as much. Plus the bleach burns your hair like hell! It was even soaking through the gloves and burning my fingers like crazy. I thought if it&#x27;s burning my skin this much I wonder what it must he doing to my hair? When it was time to wash out I noticed that everytime after that I would wet my hair I would see some of the pink hair dye going down the drain.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t quote get the job done</li>
            <li> Splat is AWFUL! I tried to die my hair Lusty Lavender in January of this year. Instead, the insanely strong bleach over-processed my hair. Essentially, my hair will not hold any kind of color – permanent or temporary. As a result, I&#x27;ve had to dye my hair 10 times in the last 6 months every time with permanent hair color. After 5-6 washes, I have to re-dye my hair again because the color fades. This product is horrible and damaging to your hair. DO NOT USE IT EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about this product is when I called Splat (Christine – (951) 738-8595), they sent over two free bottles of the same hair color. The tops of the clear processing liquid exploded in shipping, and the boxes were damaged. It took me 2 months from original contact to call them in regards to the issue. The lady above didn’t even ask to see photos of the damaged boxes as proof she simply sent two more boxes. Essentially, I received four free packs of hair color because of the one that originally did damage to my hair. I was able to use small bottles of 20 Cream Developer from Sally’s (much healthier than the clear stuff originally in the packs) and sell all four boxes of color. At least that’s some vindication for what occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If enough people that were wronged by this company took this approach, we could bring down this horrible, faulty company for good. Think about it ladies and gentlemen, and take some action. Maybe if they lose enough profits they will do something about their low quality products.</li>
            <li> Bleaching is aextremely</li>
            <li> Ok. So let me start by saying that until last month I had virgin hair. I went to a professional stylist to get my tips dyed rainbow colors. He used 3 different brands. One had stayed in nicely, the other two washed out in one wash with color safe shampoo and I was left with bleached tips and some random blue strands. So I decided to do it myself. I read all the reviews for both splat and Manic Panic and the tips from people who had used them before purchasing 4 colors of Splat and 2 colors of Manic Panic. I used splat beach however because there were several tips that my stylist had left untouched. I have black hair and the bleach lightened it to a medium blonde in about an hour (I wrapped the tips in tin foil to keep it off my skin) plus it didn&#x27;t fry my hair! I then colored chunks of hair in random order using all 6 dyes. I wrapped the tips in tin foil again, put a plastic bag over my head and waited 3 hours. After removing the tin foil and washing my hair in cold water (which ran clear after 5 minutes at the most) I towel dryed my hair (the towel wasn&#x27;t stained) and lo and behold. All the splat colors were vibrant and beautiful and one of the MP colors didn&#x27;t even turn out. Those chunks are still bleach blonde. I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Now then. A few things to note. Even with 6 color packets on my counter I didn&#x27;t make a mess. Nothing got stained. Nothing dripped. I just used latex gloves and a whole lotta patience. The stuff is pretty thick so if you&#x27;re careful you can do this without staining your forehead :)</li>
            <li> Please be warned that using this product is an expensive, long-term commitment.  It fades unevenly, then cannot be bleached out or covered up.  This product contains metallic ingredients which make it impossible to remove from your hair, ask a salon professional.  I have blonde hair, and had to go through multiple attempts to remove the color at 2 salons (I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it just faded, but it faded unevenly and looked awful.) Then my only choice was to go dark brunette, and you can still see the pink.  I would NEVER recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> So, I ordeered this on a Wednesday and got it on a Saturday with standard shipping(: this dye stays in for a long time, but you need to know how to properly dye your hair in order for it to work(:</li>
            <li> I purchased the bleach kit for my daughter and the dye kit for my son. The bleach, it was extremely runny and very messy which got all over the place and within 5 minutes, during the application, she had to wash it out because of the intense burning of her skin and scalp. Thus, she was left with half bleached hair. My son already had his hair bleached and began the application of the purple dye. For starters, it was also very runny and made a mess. Then when he rinsed it out as instructed, it ran clear, but it was still dripping and getting everywhere. After several rinsings, he went to bed with a towl on his bedding just to keep it from destroying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, that is not the worst part. I reached out to the website &#x27;contact us&#x27; customer service email. The responder was Phillip Agrey. After back and forth emails, he stuck to that he would only send me a new box of bleach, would do nothing about the dye and was rather rude with respect to satisfying my request for a refund. Simply put, he said &#x27;WE DO NOT ISSUE REFUNDS&#x27;. When I asked to speak to higher up, he said I am the co-owner. And still nothing, sadly. He just sits up in his ritzy mansion, collecting money on an inferior product, without a concern about if the product worked or not. He gets his money regardless and without regard to if his customers are happy.</li>
            <li> I decided to dye my hair for a Halloween event.  I got so many compliments and was told I should keep it permanent.  My hair is colored natural light blonde so I did not bleach it.  I did apply it twice because some areas were not as dark or even as I wanted. It was a lot of fun!  Be sure to put Vaseline around your face, ears, neck line, etc., however, if you do get it on your skin you can scrub it off with a buff puff in the shower.  It will continue to bleed when you shower even after the water has ran clear.  It will rub off on clothing if you sweat or your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I love dying my hair I&#x27;ve done it many time different colors. I bought this wanting something fun and I&#x27;m dissatisfied. I bought berry blast and envy blue to dye 2/3 of my hair. The pink on top and blue in the middle leaving my natural light brown on bottom. I used both containers of bleach left it in for 40 minutes and my hair came out orange on top and the bottom was a lighter brown.&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed my hair and put Vaseline on my hair line and ears after dying my ears were still blue that&#x27;s very hard to get off. I started putting the pink in and even with just 1/3 of my hair there wasn&#x27;t really enough color for it. While I had the color in I thought it was going to be gorgeous, but once it washed out only part of my roots were the right color then it was orange and further down my hair was just light brown with light pink strips. I don&#x27;t even want to leave the house with how it looks.&lt;br /&gt;The blue looks fine for the most part kind of patchy but my ugly pink covers it. And it stands everything else bad. As soon as it hit my floor I got alcohol to clean it and my floor is still blue. Now on trying to wash the due out the water didn&#x27;t run clean even with cool water. My entire tub is stained alcohol didn&#x27;t work. My hands are still blue the next day just from washing my hair out, my entire back was blue along with my leg bends and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy Splat again I will stick with buying Raw in the bottle from hot topic and Spencer at the mall. The color doesn&#x27;t stain my skin to bad it washed off and my hair actually stays the color I put in.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from Walgreens, since I didn&#x27;t want to wait for shipping. I have only ONE complaint - that there is only one pair of gloves in the kit. It didn&#x27;t make me take a star away, since I do have boxes of gloves at home anyhow (I don&#x27;t touch meat when I&#x27;m cooking without using gloves) - but I also did research on this coloring system before I bought it and used it. I checked youtube videos and I looked through reviews for people that have used this item. I actually weighed and measured out 1/2 of the bleach powder and liquid before mixing in a bowl - so I didn&#x27;t waste any. I colored just my bangs and some of the hair a bit further back on my crown. I bleached first, and followed the directions completely. I did find the bleach a bit runny, but it didn&#x27;t matter since I just used foils to go under my sections as I painted the bleach on (And later, I did the same for the dye) I used Pink Fetish AND Lusty Lavender. You really need to ensure you use enough of the coloring since your hair WILL soak it up quickly, so you need NOT to be skimpy. I painted it on and rubbed it in with my gloves hands before wrapping with the foil. I finally cleaned up any drips etc and covered with a plastic cap.... I rinsed and used shampoo (yeah, I didn&#x27;t look) and it faded the color quite a bit... still cute but I wanted NEON. I waited until the next day, did it again and Voila! PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;You need patience, SOME sort of experience or a friend with experience, a steady hand and about 4-6 hours to do a great job. Get extra gloves, clothes you don&#x27;t care about (and a couple trashed towels), vaseline or conditioner to go around your hairline, foil and a plastic cap - and a rat tail comb for sectioning. GOOD LUCK</li>
            <li> Did this in my older daughter&#x27;s hair in a peekaboo style. Used bleach to lighten her dark hair first. Turned out great. Put a couple little streaks in her little sister&#x27;s blonde hair too... My dark haired girl has no pink left (Sept to Dec) but my blonde girl still has obvious streaks. The color was fun, and not too hard to apply -- took about 90 minutes including bleach time on dark hair. Wish it would wash out of my preschooler&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> I used this trying to honor Breast Cancer Awareness Month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions word  by word. I sectioned my hair and had help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It does not provide full coverage of your hair no matter how long it sits.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is a low quality color. It is supposed to be a pink it is a neon purple.&lt;br /&gt;3. It will stain your skin even if you protect it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TRASH. Thankfully the company saw fit to send me a refund.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time, everything perfect as I expected it. I recommend ordering from MyBeautyWarehouse.</li>
            <li> If you want pink hair forever, I recommend splat. My hair was a reddish blonde so I did not bleach my hair before using and months later, my hair was still pink. I am in the process of using citamin c, bleach, etc to get my hair back to blonde. So again, for me, this did just what I wanted it to, it turned my hair pink. I just didn&#x27;t realize it wouldn&#x27;t want to come out, ever.</li>
            <li> I got the pink color because I liked the color on the box. Unlike when using manic panic, your hair won&#x27;t necessarily come out the same color you think its going to be. I said Uh Oh when i saw the dye bottle.. the dye was darker already than the color shown on the box. I already have blonde hair so I skipped the bleach put it on and waited. When i rinsed and out and dryed my hair it was definitely magenta. I like the vibrant color, but it wasn&#x27;t what I had in mind at that moment. Also, heed the warnings on the box. It WILL dye your hair, your skin, and your bathroom the color you are using. For people who complained about their towels getting stained, get black towels.  Use the gloves and get a tinting brush to kind of minimize mess. Also found a bath brush..the kind you use for scrubbing yourself..was good for getting stains off skin real quick.</li>
            <li> Used this to get Pastel Pink (cotton candy colored) hair.&lt;br /&gt;Works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering how I got it, instructions below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, bleach your hair to WHITE. Using toner helps. Then, after I rinsed my hair (use shampoo but no conditioner), I mixed a drop of dye with some cheap generic (WHITE) conditioner and mixed it. It needs to be a bit brighter than cotton candy. Then, cover your hair in the mix and let it sit for an hour or more, depending on how long you want it in. Apply heat every 20 minutes with a blowdryer. Then rinse. Your hair will not only be dyed, but it will be deep conditioned. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m latin, I have black thick hair. It doesn&#x27;t look pink but red, and it damaged my hair a lot, but I guess it&#x27;s normal. Despite this, I love how my hair looks :)</li>
            <li> I am going to insert two pictures here. one is my blonde daughter freshly colored (we did not use bleach, left the color on for a few hours  in a bonnet.) The next is after almost three months later. we loved the original super vibrant color, but the best part of this pink is how it fades into a beautiful almost natural looking pink.  everyone loves this kids hair and we get smiles and complements everywhere we go.</li>
            <li> Splat bleach was actually very good, it turned my hair a nice light blonde, so there are no complaints about that. The pink was really bright at first, but it soon fades to a disgusting orange color and you need to redye it A LOT! I don&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice bright pink color. My 13 year old wears her hair with pick tips. Splat is the only color that we have found that is very vibrant and stays in for a while. This product is easy to apply and stays very vibrant pink for about two to three months. Be aware of two things though: 1. Use the gloves while applying this. If not, your fingers will stain pick. 2. Make sure you wash your hair in cold water to ensure vibrancy of the color. Frequent washing in warm water will make the color fade faster</li>
            <li> Although the splat hair dye worked for a few days after taking a shower my hair turned bright pink and i used the purple dye. at the beginning i used purple to cover my whole head and  i washed it out 1  and 1/2 hours later and it turned pink. so i used splat dye again purple and this time left it in for 4 days straight with no showers. finally i took the dye out of my hair and it was a great color for the 6 days it lasted after taking three showers with no shampoo it turned pink and faded a tremendous amount. this dye does not work. it will fade fast. if you are looking for a cheap semi-permanent dye use ordinary easter egg dye with vinger.</li>
            <li> If you want to be able to brush or comb through your hair afterwards, don&#x27;t use this. If you want a halfway clean bathroom after you&#x27;re done, don&#x27;t use this. I guess it would be fine if you just want a streak or two but I died the bottum half of my hair (and the carton does say you can use it as an all over application) and by the time I was done the bathroom was blue, I was blue but my hair weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY FAVORITE OR ALL TIME HAIR COLOR. I WEAR IT WELL !!!  i&#x27;M DISAPPOINTED WHEN MY ROOTS GROW IN.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried kook-aid and then Manic Panic. Nothing is better than Spat! the colors are vibrant and amazing. The only problem is is you have to blow dry your hair. It will stain everything! If it gets on your hands use toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair and love it!</li>
            <li> I evenly distributed the product after bleaching just as it said taking time to make sure it was even and properly coated throughout. After waiting 30mins as it said I rinsed to find parts of my hair were still completely bleached, had I wanted a leopard style dye job I&#x27;d be super happy, but alas now I just look like I&#x27;m missing patches of hair because of the bleach from step one. I&#x27;d say thanks but I have no thanks to give, only more money to a better company to fix this companies short comings.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!!!! Though I must say that once I bleached my hair and then put it in, it never left. sure it fades, eventually, but I have pink in my hair from years ago. I do go at least three days after putting it in with out washing it. This is such a great product for the money! I usually use two or three boxes depending on my hair length. I would much rather have some left over than not enough.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair for years and have never had a product leak from my hair so badly. Three days after dying I was forced to wrap a towel around my neck to not get the hot tub, and everyone else in it - red. It looked as if I was bleeding from the head. My sheets are ruined, and as I write this I am sitting in the bath tub which is now filled woth rose tinged water. What a mess!!! I have fine hair, I left it on for 40 minutes And have rinsed for over an hour in cold water.</li>
            <li> First off, I would recommend leaving the bleach in for at LEAST a half hour, and if your hair is even the slightest bit brown, leave in for about 40 minutes or more. I had dyed mine dark brown previously so I left it in for an hour. The longer you leave the color in, the more vibrant it will be. If you leave it in for the minimum time, it will look more blond. Also, if your hair is long, use ALL of the bottle. I would a little bit of bleach handy to wipe up the color from surfaces, as it will drip. Or, cover everything in newspapers or old towels. Make sure that you rinse the color out completely, and keep rinsing even when the water does run clear. I have gotten stains on pillows and blankets from not washing it out enough. Also, it would be better to buy color protecting shampoo/conditioner, as it will stay in longer. Overall, if you follow all the directions and use the tips I listed above, you will get a long-lasting, vibrant color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair hundreds of times. Decided to try splat purple hair dye and it came out splotchy, something I&#x27;ve never had happen. It also instantly dyes anything it touches especially skin. It took forever to wash clean too, worst hair dye I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in a sealed box and the tube was completely empty. I called the company and was disappointed with their customer service! A good company would have mailed me a new one! They said go back to the store. Disappointing!</li>
            <li> While this product does leave great, fun color in your hair, it&#x27;s much harder to work with, stains things that aren&#x27;t your hair quicker, stains your hair slower, and fades faster.  It also took me a week of showers to get the color to stop bleeding from my hair in the shower and onto the pillows/sheets. It will get the job done but I&#x27;ve had much better success elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bleach part of the kit worked just fine, but it could&#x27;ve come with better, less flimsy gloves.</li>
            <li> I bought Splat Blue Envy about 6 months ago. I had my friend put it on that night (we&#x27;ve both used Splat before and have never had problems), but this time I used the packaged bleach first (I had never bleached before dyeing). I have naturally reddish-brown hair and I dyed the underside of my hair. Looked super super awesome for about a week and a half. It started to fade into a really ugly greenish-gray color, so I really had to stay on top of doing touch ups every week. I got tired of that and decided I wanted to do a different color. I tried Manic Panic purple haze to do a cover up without bleach, my hair was still bright blue and faded to the same gross color. So then I bought Manic Panic Hot Hot Pink and Raven, to do a pink and black layer on my underside. We rebleached my hair... And my hair was still blue! We dyed over it with the pink and black, the pink came out purple and the black came out a dark blue. It&#x27;s been 5 months since I last used Splat and I STILL cannot get it to leave my hair. I&#x27;ve tried multiple home remedies, Color Oops, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, don&#x27;t buy or use Splat unless you plan on having the color for a long long time. I assume this will go for all the Splat colors as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see why this would get any good reviews.  The pink came out a horrible fright wig pinkish purple neon color.  It was horrid.  It also dyed a patch on the back of my neck which I couldn&#x27;t get off for 3 weeks. It dyed my roots the awful neon purple color and then the rest was a light putrid purple. It made my hair feel gross and it kept bleeding out even if the slightest amount of moisture hit it. I can see this being good if you just want highlights or streaks, but for the love of all things do not try to dye your whole head.</li>
            <li> I used a lot of dye and it didn&#x27;t make a difference. My purple came out pink! And the shade was still nice so I thought, I can deal with this. Well 2 1/2 weeks later it fades back to my original bleached color!!!  And I left it in for 35 minutes which said it should last 6 months. LIES!</li>
            <li> I have naturally medium brown hair. first off, the bleach is making my hair fall out. Second, it faded after the second wash! i&#x27;ve only had my hair this color for 2 weeks, and the blonde is already showing! I used the lucious rasberry, so every time i take a shower, pink comes out! I hate this stuff! DO NOT USE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Turned out very nice. Box was damaged when arrived though</li>
            <li> This product was one of the best for bleaching hair! I will use it again and will recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Bought two different colors. The aqua for my blonde daughter and emerald green for my niece with dark brown hair.  Followed directs to a T and both girls. The aqua last less than a week and the green wasn&#x27;t green. So retreated the green. In 2weeks. It completely out. Its a crock.&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your time or $ on this produce</li>
            <li> Just put this in my hair and I am more than pleased with my results, though, I in general give less of a F**** than others might when it comes to hair things, hence the four-star review. I mean, it&#x27;s a 10 dollar hair product, which I just bought on sale, so you do the math. If I cared more I&#x27;d pay more. Also, since I have yet to see if it fades into something awful, I will leave it at four until proven better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My story is rather boring, but I will share it for all those who are either SUPER bored or indecisive. I have a honey blonde hair color, which is pretty thick but manageable. Basically, if you are a hair stylist, my hair is dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tdoday when I was wondering how best to let the world know that I was a bad a**, when I decided, f-ya, gonna dye my hair pink. Wanting to do it at 10:30 pm, and not wanting to spend a bajillion dollars, I got this (not from Amazon but from a 24 hour pharmacy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews about dying clothes and skin, I was uber cautious, and only dyed one streak. I left it on for 15 minutes or so, washed it out, put conditioner, and voila, insta-rebellious color awesomeness. It is MUCH darker than the color because I didn&#x27;t bleach it first even though it was in the directions. I decided this for three reasons: first, I wanted to rebel against the rebellious hair color; second, I wanted it now and not to have to wait an additional however long; and third, there were a bunch of extra steps on the directions. So I picked out my bit o-hair, and pulled it through my cap (which I had to do with a bobby pin), and 15 minutes later I had a lovely, magenta streak.</li>
            <li> Holy pink!  This kit rocks.  I didn&#x27;t have time to go to beauty supply store and this had everything I needed.  I wish the bleach was a lower level, and the kit had more color...but overall I&#x27;m VERY satisfied!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it it fades within the first day and don&#x27;t expect to go swimming anytime soon because it&#x27;s gonna bleed all over the pool and ur shower water wont be clear for about four weeks or so but that&#x27;s  only if it&#x27;s stays in for more then two days . The bleach isn&#x27;t good and it&#x27;s so messy and stains everything and it&#x27;s every color does this especially the red with that if u shower once it&#x27;s already a Nasty faded pink like please don&#x27;t get this product it&#x27;s not worth it save ur self the hassle and get it professionally done and not to mention how badly it damages your hair trust me your hair will forever be frizzy I can&#x27;t stress this enough this is a horrible product and please don&#x27;t risk damaging your hair for this product that will bleed out in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> This hair dye was very easy to use! I had never died my hair before but this came out great! I didn&#x27;t use any bleach because my hair is light and the color was perfect! Would recommend to anyone wanting an easy do it yourself highlight!</li>
            <li> Splat is the only product I would trust. Period. The pink is so bright and so hot pink that it has almost a blue tinge to it. I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in almost 2 months and my hair is still super bright! When dying your hair with this product, don&#x27;t worry about rinsing until the water is clear. Splat does bleed a LOT when you shower. Usually you can tell when your hair needs dyed again because the water will run completely clear when you shower and wash your hair. The colour will last longer if you rinse your hair in lukewarm or cold water and if you keep your shower water warm or lukewarm, but not hot. My hair grows super slow, but my roots will start showing before my water runs clear in the shower. I wash my hair once every 3 or 4 days to keep it pink for longer. I put my hair up in a bun to shower and make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t get wet when I just wash my body x3. The pink is so much more of a hot hot pink and it&#x27;s way brighter than in the picture on the box and that&#x27;s true for all of the Splat colours. The colour is usually way more vivid than on the box. Blue envy is more of a cookie monster blue. I wouldn&#x27;t get Manic Panic over Splat any day! Manic Panic is so dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually in the process of re-dying to a red from a pink and I totally adore this stuff. The only issue is that I have sensitive skin so I need to buy a more expensive bleach product because it hurts my eyes and scalp to even use the bleach without it touching. The fumes are strong in this one, my friend.&lt;br /&gt;So other than that, the only downside is that if you are clumsy, line everything with trash  bags to avoid staining your bathroom. I forgot to do that with pink and it looked like a unicorn bled out on my bathroom counter. x_x</li>
            <li> Stained my scalp for 4 days very noticeable also irritated my skin it&#x27;s all dried up on my forehead and the side of my face it and it&#x27;s now starting to peel off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate this a minus 5 if I could&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I foolishly wasted money on three attempts. It fades horribly super fast. I even went three weeks without washing my hair to see if that helped the Colour hold. And the answer is NO!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jereome Russell&#x27; Punky colours are the way to go</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the splat colors, and i really love how vibrant the color is, I do like to use other bleaching kits, My head was very sensitive to the bleach that came with and i was left with small scabs on the back of my head (eww). All of the color is really great though, The red starts out very vibrant and fades into a sort of pink and the purple starts dark and fades into a sort of lavender, the pink fades to a pastel bubblegum color. All Very pretty. Since it doesn&#x27;t process your hair i tend to keep it on a little longer than the instructions said (just the color not the bleach) and it left me with a very vibrant color that lasts quite some time. If you follow the instructions it is pretty simple and you will be left with a great color. Although It is messy and will stain your forehead, ears, neck. The simple solution for that is to cover those areas with petroleum. If you get it on surfaces it comes right off with soapy water, unless it has been sitting for a bit then i just took a regular bathroom cleaner (greenworks worked perfectly to get the stains up). I gave 4 stars but would gladly give 5 stars if they sold the colors without the bleach kit. Love the product and will definitely keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li> I like that you get the bleach kit and the color dye in one box. That is awesome. A bleach kit is a bleach kit. That worked well, but the pink dye was a flop. It lasted two weeks before if faded out of my hair after I bleached it. Just doesn&#x27;t work well. I&#x27;ve given up on having pink hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this TWICE and both times it faded in a WEEK it was purple, then pink, then orange, then just blonde. I hate this hair die.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a year to help with my career. I was in the show I&#x27;ll haunt you when I&#x27;m dead\\&quot; and my hair got tons of attention. I loved my hair and the color. But when I used the product this last time something must have been mixed wrong in production of this product, because ALL of my hair fell out; washed down the drain. I am now completely bald. So please be aware of the dangers of this product. Don&#x27;t end up like me.</li>
            <li> Even with bleaching my hair beforehand, it ended up coming out a shade of dark magenta. Way more red than pink. Not bad, but I was hoping for bubblegum. :(</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying only one box last time. It&#x27;s worth the extra $10 or so dollars! It is going to &amp;#34;cost&amp;#34; you in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the box says it stains, this stuff STAINS EVERYTHING! The name is pretty realistic. It SPLATS everywhere and stains. On the floor, on the wall,on the toilet, on your sink, in the shower. How did it get in the shower with the curtain closed? I don&#x27;t know either but that $h!+ happens! I suggest trash bags taped down everywhere and you might reduce &amp;#34;casualties&amp;#34; to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the color- My hair came out this really bright hot-pink color. It&#x27;s cool, but looks nothing like the box. Be sure to keep washing hair to a minimum or it will wash out pretty fast.Color-safe shampoo/conditioner doesn&#x27;t help.Wet hair leaks and stains everything!</li>
