            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t exactly have a pleasant fragrance, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for the fragrance.  It only has a smell when you put it in your hair.  It cuts down on the flakes and that&#x27;s what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product for my kind of hair.  I use it along with a medicated ointment and after one wash I saw results. I use to have to wash my hair every 3 days and now  I can go a week without washing it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product weeks ago at the advice of my dermatologist. I have sebborhic dermatitis (spelling?) and I get dry patches on my eyebrow and the side of my nose. During the winter, I also get it on my scalp. I knew that this shampoo did not smell pretty, but I figured if it got the job done I could handle it. Definitely not. My hair smelled awful all day long (it was as bad as a strong perfume,  but if you were close enough you could smell it) and did not go away until I showered the next day. I continued to use it on my face though, as per the dermatologist&#x27;s advice. It hasn&#x27;t worked! I&#x27;m not sure why, because he swears by it and uses it for his dermatitis daily, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I was previously using selsun blue, and I will definitely go back to that. After one use, my dry skin is gone.</li>
            <li> Nearly 40 years ago, I used to run on the beach every lunch hour, after changing in the community locker room.  There was a dermatologist who did the same thing.  One day I made an appointment to see him for various reasons, including a dandruff problem and an itchy scalp.  He told me that he kept a bottle of this shampoo in his locker and used it himself every day in his shower after a run.  He advised me to do the same.  I responded, \\&quot;You mean I should use this stuff for the rest of my life?\\&quot;  He just looked at me and said, \\&quot;Use it a couple of times week, if you don&#x27;t want to use it every day.\\&quot;  Well, after several decades of daily use, I can testify that it not only works but I&#x27;ve had barbers ask me what kind of shampoo I use to keep my hair in such great shape.  All in all, I guess I&#x27;ll use it for the rest of my life, gratefully.</li>
            <li> I have been using T-Gel for years - since before it was owned by Neutrogena.  It is the only thing that works on my scalp.  I tend to alternate it with another shampoo.  I used to use it with the T-Gel conditioner, but now I get the Neutrogena Triple Moisture conditioner.    This price is much better than I can find anywhere else.  Usually the 8.5 oz bottles are close to $15 each in the grocery store or drug store.</li>
            <li> I use it about 2-3 a week. And the days that I don&#x27;t I just shower without using any type of shampoo. I don&#x27;t have any dandruff or an itchy scalp anymore. To which I do highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> MY 3RD BOTTLE---GOOD STUFF</li>
            <li> Smells so bad I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It smells a bit like your hair took medicine, but it works better than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> A little stinky but it works</li>
            <li> Best dandruff shampoo Ive tryed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different dry skin / dandruff shampoos and TGel is the only one that has been effective and combating my itchy dry skin on my head and flaking.  I use it 3 times a week and do not shampoo or conditioner at all on the off days.</li>
            <li> THis shampoo is the only one which helps me.I have bought four bottles already and plan to buy again.</li>
            <li> We use this product once a week for many years.  It&#x27;s good even when others are worried about the tar extract.&lt;br /&gt;It clears off other shampoo residues, leaves the scalp clean and removes itches.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My teenagers both like this shampoo. They got their first bottles in a gift pack of items to combat acne. It works for that, also greasy hair and itchy scalp. I shopped for this, with no luck, in my local drug store. The clerk there warned me to use it intermittently because it might take too much oil from my hair if I used it all the time. For my teens, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Really helps with itchy scalp. I even get compliments on the way my hair smells after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used T/Gel for years. Once a week I use it instead of my regular shampoo and it keeps the flakies away. If I quit using it, they come back within a couple months.</li>
            <li> The product sells itself its the price that counts here &amp; much cheaper than the shops, do your own research prior to buying this as it has been cheaper in Walmart at times.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than Walgreens</li>
            <li> A good shampoo.  The fragrance is alright with me.  There is no discernible perfume smell.  Also, as another review wrote the price is surprisingly cheaper through Amazon.</li>
