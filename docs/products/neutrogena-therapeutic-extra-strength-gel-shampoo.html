            <li>and I experienced no dryness.</li>
            <li>but this product works great for mine when I do get it.</li>
            <li>Great product...</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t give you a really great shampoo experience</li>
            <li>btw, i haven&#x27;t found a good product from Neutrogena, i&#x27;ve tried their face wash, sun block..</li>
            <li>Whenever I have asked hair stylists for a good anti-dandruff shampoo they would always suggest T-gel.</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s the good stuff.</li>
            <li>Is Excellent product, for many year used for my family, all product from Neutrogena are EXCELLENT, thanks you for made happy life</li>
            <li>It a good product in terms of quality.</li>
            <li>but my ends felt smooth, silky and smelled delicious!</li>
            <li>It has been almost a week and my scalp feels amazing.</li>
            <li>This worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>wonder why it&#x27;s still a popular brand in US.</li>
            <li>I wonder what kind of chemicals they use in this product.</li>
            <li>and it honestly reminds me of moth balls, which I cannot stand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First: I use a Apple Cider Vinegar mix with warm water for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a good conditioner with this product.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo for the intense itching and irritation</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good to mix products, but I kinda do it most of the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As other&#x27;s have said, it is a very good product and Amazon&#x27;s price is excellent.</li>
            <li>, I looked through Amazon because is the greatest shampoo I have ever used, highly recommended</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I wasn&#x27;t paying for them, because they sure didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>The item is good cheap and</li>
            <li>strong!</li>
            <li>Generally about the best non-prescription anti-dandruff shampoo around.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard it works great for dandruff, but it really helps with the redness caused by my rosacea!</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I love Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve both been using their face cleanes for years and love them.</li>
            <li>And... a couple of weeks ago I just noticed - I wasn&#x27;t scratching or massaging my head any more.</li>
            <li>nothing works better than t gel for itchy scalp or beard.</li>
            <li>The T Sal works better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>the cheaper stuff worked better and atleast I wasn&#x27;t going f#%!ing bald</li>
            <li>I would love to order more and all my dandruff were gone.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t sale it more in my country</li>
            <li>and it has worked much better for me.</li>
            <li>I think it works better than some of the prescription cortisone creams I was using.</li>
            <li>Simply the Best</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo was just ok.</li>
            <li>It works for him, but he can&#x27;t use it more than 3 times a week, because it makes his scalp tingle.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena&#x27;s T/Gel &amp; T/Sal Products.</li>
            <li>Healthy hairs...</li>
            <li>either be wealthy or have insurance</li>
            <li>That famous smell is somewhere between tar and a chemistry lab though, which is a downside.</li>
            <li>Second best is DHS Zinc Shampoo</li>
            <li>but I am sure</li>
            <li>\\&quot;feel\\&quot; a bit better (not 100%, but FEEL).  </li>
            <li>hope this is helpful :)</li>
            <li>Then again I always liked the smell of gasoline, turpentine, freshly paved roads, etc.  </li>
            <li>It!s true!</li>
            <li>It smells really, really strongly of tar [unbearably so].</li>
            <li>I sprayed it thoroughly with perfume, but it&#x27;s this strong, acrid smell that everyone in my family noticed on my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a strong odor but not to the point of being over-powering.  </li>
            <li>The box claims that this is &#x27;effective from the first use&#x27;.</li>
            <li>And the type I got a few months ago worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>but i use this primarily on my face to treat acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable holding my toddlers face to close to mine from the toxic nature of it.</li>
            <li>I was kind of worried about my hair drying out, but I couldn&#x27;t deal with my scalp situation for much longer</li>
            <li>You use this great product to cleanse your hair of all the impurities and gook leftover in your hair from your regular shampoo, conditioner, and the world.</li>
            <li>The thing I don&#x27;t like of course is it didnt leave my hair smooth or glossy or nice-smelling (if that is even a word)</li>
            <li>and this is not sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Not so sure if it really prevents dandruff in my case, but I feel OK with it.</li>
            <li>The instructions warn you that this product will make you more sensitive to the sun, and you will sunburn more easily.  </li>
            <li>It felt immediately better after the first use</li>
            <li>I read about using Neutrogena T-Gel original shampoo in a doctor&#x27;s advice column in the newspaper and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>Good, leaves hair and scalp dry and very clean.</li>
            <li>no flaky scalp, just clean, manageable hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good, doesn&#x27;t form enough bubbles</li>
            <li>The problem is, all the shampoos I used [even once per week]were like dish soap on my hair, and made it super frizzy and flaky.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell because it reminds me of Toys R Us, but possibly Toys R Us uses Murphy Oil to clean their store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Earlier in the year my husband started using this to help with his dandruff and he really liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>and I mentioned that my husband has been using T-gel with success</li>
            <li>Discussing the problem with our good family doctor back in October or November (7-8 months ago) did not help much.</li>
            <li>My teenage found this on his own and swears by it.  </li>
            <li>AND IT WAS SO WORTH</li>
            <li>works as advertised and is worth using despite the tar smell people note in their reviews.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth the results.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever get dandruff</li>
            <li>It is worth the money that you pay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple but effective: lather, let sit, rinse.</li>
            <li>She told me to make him stop using it right away.</li>
            <li>what I expected, well packaged, shipped quick, will surely purchase this item again if it is still cheap</li>
            <li>As you can expect, this grew old very quickly.</li>
            <li>Decent shampoo though, hair feels clean.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does the trick for treating mild cases of psoriasis.</li>
            <li>Its a shame because I really love nuetrogena products and this is the only time that I have had an issue with something they make.</li>
            <li>Maybe I will experiment with that in a couple of months but, at this time, I am content and happy to have it at least under control with one weekly T/Gel use.</li>
            <li>The first thing that bothered me about the product was the SMELL.</li>
            <li>I am gonna try Selsun Blue and see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not too concerned about using it pretty liberally.</li>
            <li>While I was washing my hair, I felt the shampoo tingling against my irritated scalp during the first wash.</li>
            <li>I tried the Head &amp; Shoulders first (on the face &amp; neck) since we already had some and it helped, but I switched to this</li>
            <li>The selson blue works so much better.</li>
            <li>you have dandruff, you need to treat it with 2% sulfur treatments (you can buy the sulfur gel on here) and also VO5 hot oil treatments once a month.  </li>
            <li>(I think it&#x27;s because of hot weather), I picked this up with the conditioner and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using the original T/Gel since the early 90s.</li>
            <li>It took away all the flakiness and conditioner residue, and left my hair shiny and smooth with a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I have pretty much no flakes</li>
            <li>The smell was an issue for me at first too, But this product really works.</li>
            <li>She said that most of these kinds of shampoos do not actually fix the problem of dandruff but instead puts a coating on the scalp preventing the flakes from falling off which clogs the pores and makes the hair fall out faster than normal.</li>
            <li>If anything, I found that I was loosing more hair rather than getting my scalp back to a normal point.</li>
            <li>I need the large size.</li>
            <li>The itch was largely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seems to help a little, but honestly, I just can&#x27;t stand the smell.  </li>
            <li>It works and doesn&#x27;t smell so good but a little bit just a few shampoos and scalp is better.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Also used on whole body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; shoulder for my dandruff problem and it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>I really like it for some reason.  </li>
            <li>the downside 4 oz goes really fast.  </li>
            <li>It will make your scalp much feeling cleaner and shiny.</li>
            <li>It has really cleared up my rosacea without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>It really works, I&#x27;ve been doing this since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help me.</li>
            <li>I much prefer Redken Dandruff Control.</li>
            <li>but it really helps.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather have the smell than the flakes, crusty build-up and redness everywhere on my head.</li>
            <li>Very industrial.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make the story short, a couple of months ago I stumbled upon a bottle of T/Gel left over from the time I used it (effectively) to address a dandruff problem and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>and it is possible that it is a unique case to my husband.</li>
            <li>The only caveat - you might want to use a conditioner with T-Gel, because it can leave your hair so clean that it&#x27;s bereft of body.  </li>
            <li>This stuff gives you a deep clean.</li>
            <li>And the scent is totally tolerable, and I was surprised how well it soaped up and was easy to lather.</li>
            <li>A woman is likely to object to the fragrance (of the coal tar which makes it work) more than a male, but the use of a conditioner on your hair after the shampoo totally gets rid of the original fragrance.    </li>
            <li>It just left my hair dry, which is normal for this kind of shampoo, but</li>
            <li>was never bothered by the Selsun Blue Shampoo smell or even the Blue bottle of Head and Shoulders and they are pretty strong</li>
            <li>but I just figured it is all part of getting older.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I have noticed that my hair is falling out much more than usual.</li>
            <li>I bought this product mainly for my mom, who has psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>[It even cleared up my face]So when I went back to the store yesterday for more, and saw the same shampoo with a \\&quot;new scent\\&quot;</li>
            <li>For me coal tar, or something else in the bottle, certainly SEEMS to help keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>We noticed a major difference within the first week.</li>
            <li>However, it is still something worth considering when thinking about using this product or something similar.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try, and is relatively inexpensive so no need to worry about wasting money if you don&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li>I always make sure I use this a few times per week.</li>
            <li>Since discovering this wonder, I feel like I&#x27;ve hit the jackpot; I used to use it everyday but it has made my scalp so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Before I use it, I had this mild itches for a long time.</li>
            <li>On the first or second day, after a trial/change of shampoo, I would feel my hair or scalp</li>
            <li>I went from having pretty much no scalp irritation to having an extremely itchy and flaky scalp.</li>
            <li>I contributed it to the large amounts of hairspray that I used back then.</li>
            <li>My wife found T-Gel at the pharmacy and my scalp was clear and the dandruff gone within a week.  </li>
            <li>My scalp was still itchy one month later but maybe not as much.</li>
            <li>I recommended all my friends and near one too</li>
            <li>After gently scrubbing my scalp (note that I said my scalp, not my hair-I will explain this later)</li>
            <li>Based off of how much I used, I imagine that the bottle will last me 2-3 months (with 1 wash/week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then apply a mixture of Sarna Sensitive and Cortizone-10.</li>
            <li>I have found that switching off between this stuff and the T-Sal works wonders for my young son.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the only stuff that clears up the dry skin under my moustache and beard.</li>
            <li>The smell is better than tar products and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but I am better now after going back to the usual OTC dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m throwing mine out, and heading off on the quest for new shampoo, unless Neutrogena goes back to the old formula.</li>
            <li>If your scalp is itchy, T/Gel is worth a try for as long as you are willing to keep using it for a few months.</li>
            <li>Its cheap and actually works, unlike multiple other shampoos I have used for my hair.</li>
            <li>It makes the scalp very itchy and dry.</li>
            <li>(I was in the end happy how small it was, so I could use it up fast and stop smelling weird)</li>
            <li>So, moral of this tale: Do NOT waste seven dollars on this.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old shampoo from Brazil, Pielus.</li>
            <li>Back then I developed a spot of what appears to be Psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well such a small amount lathered, and it started to tingle and left my hair pretty soft.</li>
            <li>Yes, it smells a little funny</li>
            <li>The drying made my thin hair break easily.</li>
            <li>I know the smell can be a little much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I am sure</li>
            <li> \\&quot;feel\\&quot; a bit better (not 100%, but FEEL).  </li>
            <li> hope this is helpful :)</li>
            <li> Then again I always liked the smell of gasoline, turpentine, freshly paved roads, etc.  </li>
            <li> It!s true!</li>
            <li> It smells really, really strongly of tar [unbearably so].</li>
            <li> I sprayed it thoroughly with perfume, but it&#x27;s this strong, acrid smell that everyone in my family noticed on my hair.</li>
            <li> It has a strong odor but not to the point of being over-powering.  </li>
            <li> The box claims that this is &#x27;effective from the first use&#x27;.</li>
            <li> And the type I got a few months ago worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> but i use this primarily on my face to treat acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable holding my toddlers face to close to mine from the toxic nature of it.</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried about my hair drying out, but I couldn&#x27;t deal with my scalp situation for much longer</li>
            <li> You use this great product to cleanse your hair of all the impurities and gook leftover in your hair from your regular shampoo, conditioner, and the world.</li>
            <li> The thing I don&#x27;t like of course is it didnt leave my hair smooth or glossy or nice-smelling (if that is even a word)</li>
            <li> and this is not sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Not so sure if it really prevents dandruff in my case, but I feel OK with it.</li>
            <li> The instructions warn you that this product will make you more sensitive to the sun, and you will sunburn more easily.  </li>
            <li> It felt immediately better after the first use</li>
            <li> I read about using Neutrogena T-Gel original shampoo in a doctor&#x27;s advice column in the newspaper and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Worth a try!</li>
            <li> Good, leaves hair and scalp dry and very clean.</li>
            <li> no flaky scalp, just clean, manageable hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good, doesn&#x27;t form enough bubbles</li>
            <li> The problem is, all the shampoos I used [even once per week]were like dish soap on my hair, and made it super frizzy and flaky.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell because it reminds me of Toys R Us, but possibly Toys R Us uses Murphy Oil to clean their store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Earlier in the year my husband started using this to help with his dandruff and he really liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> and I mentioned that my husband has been using T-gel with success</li>
            <li> Discussing the problem with our good family doctor back in October or November (7-8 months ago) did not help much.</li>
            <li> My teenage found this on his own and swears by it.  </li>
            <li> AND IT WAS SO WORTH</li>
            <li> works as advertised and is worth using despite the tar smell people note in their reviews.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely worth the results.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever get dandruff</li>
            <li> It is worth the money that you pay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple but effective: lather, let sit, rinse.</li>
            <li> She told me to make him stop using it right away.</li>
            <li> what I expected, well packaged, shipped quick, will surely purchase this item again if it is still cheap</li>
            <li> As you can expect, this grew old very quickly.</li>
            <li> Decent shampoo though, hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does the trick for treating mild cases of psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Its a shame because I really love nuetrogena products and this is the only time that I have had an issue with something they make.</li>
            <li> Maybe I will experiment with that in a couple of months but, at this time, I am content and happy to have it at least under control with one weekly T/Gel use.</li>
            <li> The first thing that bothered me about the product was the SMELL.</li>
            <li> I am gonna try Selsun Blue and see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not too concerned about using it pretty liberally.</li>
            <li> While I was washing my hair, I felt the shampoo tingling against my irritated scalp during the first wash.</li>
            <li> I tried the Head &amp; Shoulders first (on the face &amp; neck) since we already had some and it helped, but I switched to this</li>
            <li> The selson blue works so much better.</li>
            <li> you have dandruff, you need to treat it with 2% sulfur treatments (you can buy the sulfur gel on here) and also VO5 hot oil treatments once a month.  </li>
            <li> (I think it&#x27;s because of hot weather), I picked this up with the conditioner and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using the original T/Gel since the early 90s.</li>
            <li> It took away all the flakiness and conditioner residue, and left my hair shiny and smooth with a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much no flakes</li>
            <li> The smell was an issue for me at first too, But this product really works.</li>
            <li> She said that most of these kinds of shampoos do not actually fix the problem of dandruff but instead puts a coating on the scalp preventing the flakes from falling off which clogs the pores and makes the hair fall out faster than normal.</li>
            <li> If anything, I found that I was loosing more hair rather than getting my scalp back to a normal point.</li>
            <li> I need the large size.</li>
            <li> The itch was largely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It seems to help a little, but honestly, I just can&#x27;t stand the smell.  </li>
            <li> It works and doesn&#x27;t smell so good but a little bit just a few shampoos and scalp is better.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Also used on whole body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; shoulder for my dandruff problem and it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I really like it for some reason.  </li>
            <li> the downside 4 oz goes really fast.  </li>
            <li> It will make your scalp much feeling cleaner and shiny.</li>
            <li> It has really cleared up my rosacea without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> It really works, I&#x27;ve been doing this since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help me.</li>
            <li> I much prefer Redken Dandruff Control.</li>
            <li> but it really helps.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather have the smell than the flakes, crusty build-up and redness everywhere on my head.</li>
            <li> Very industrial.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make the story short, a couple of months ago I stumbled upon a bottle of T/Gel left over from the time I used it (effectively) to address a dandruff problem and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> and it is possible that it is a unique case to my husband.</li>
            <li> The only caveat - you might want to use a conditioner with T-Gel, because it can leave your hair so clean that it&#x27;s bereft of body.  </li>
            <li> This stuff gives you a deep clean.</li>
            <li> And the scent is totally tolerable, and I was surprised how well it soaped up and was easy to lather.</li>
            <li> A woman is likely to object to the fragrance (of the coal tar which makes it work) more than a male, but the use of a conditioner on your hair after the shampoo totally gets rid of the original fragrance.    </li>
            <li> It just left my hair dry, which is normal for this kind of shampoo, but</li>
            <li> was never bothered by the Selsun Blue Shampoo smell or even the Blue bottle of Head and Shoulders and they are pretty strong</li>
            <li> but I just figured it is all part of getting older.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I have noticed that my hair is falling out much more than usual.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly for my mom, who has psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> [It even cleared up my face]So when I went back to the store yesterday for more, and saw the same shampoo with a \\&quot;new scent\\&quot;</li>
            <li> For me coal tar, or something else in the bottle, certainly SEEMS to help keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> We noticed a major difference within the first week.</li>
            <li> However, it is still something worth considering when thinking about using this product or something similar.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth a try, and is relatively inexpensive so no need to worry about wasting money if you don&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li> I always make sure I use this a few times per week.</li>
            <li> Since discovering this wonder, I feel like I&#x27;ve hit the jackpot; I used to use it everyday but it has made my scalp so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Before I use it, I had this mild itches for a long time.</li>
            <li> On the first or second day, after a trial/change of shampoo, I would feel my hair or scalp</li>
            <li> I went from having pretty much no scalp irritation to having an extremely itchy and flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> I contributed it to the large amounts of hairspray that I used back then.</li>
            <li> My wife found T-Gel at the pharmacy and my scalp was clear and the dandruff gone within a week.  </li>
            <li> My scalp was still itchy one month later but maybe not as much.</li>
            <li> I recommended all my friends and near one too</li>
            <li> After gently scrubbing my scalp (note that I said my scalp, not my hair-I will explain this later)</li>
            <li> Based off of how much I used, I imagine that the bottle will last me 2-3 months (with 1 wash/week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then apply a mixture of Sarna Sensitive and Cortizone-10.</li>
            <li> I have found that switching off between this stuff and the T-Sal works wonders for my young son.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the only stuff that clears up the dry skin under my moustache and beard.</li>
            <li> The smell is better than tar products and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I am better now after going back to the usual OTC dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throwing mine out, and heading off on the quest for new shampoo, unless Neutrogena goes back to the old formula.</li>
            <li> If your scalp is itchy, T/Gel is worth a try for as long as you are willing to keep using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Its cheap and actually works, unlike multiple other shampoos I have used for my hair.</li>
            <li> It makes the scalp very itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> (I was in the end happy how small it was, so I could use it up fast and stop smelling weird)</li>
            <li> So, moral of this tale: Do NOT waste seven dollars on this.</li>
            <li> I went back to my old shampoo from Brazil, Pielus.</li>
            <li> Back then I developed a spot of what appears to be Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well such a small amount lathered, and it started to tingle and left my hair pretty soft.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells a little funny</li>
            <li> The drying made my thin hair break easily.</li>
            <li> I know the smell can be a little much</li>
            <li> but the results don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I felt no different after using it and it made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo after the sudden onset of an itchy, dry, flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also noticed his balding spot getting bigger at an alarming rate</li>
            <li> I am usually not sensitive with the smells.  </li>
            <li> I hate the smell, but as it was not purchased to smell good.</li>
            <li> for the first round of shampooing, I applied a second round of shampoo to my scalp and left it on for a few minutes before rinsing and applying a moisturizing shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all (being a not very particular man--</li>
            <li> Neutrogena has patented something they call NEUTAR which is a more refined version of coal tar that doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the traditional ingredient.</li>
            <li> NEUTAR.has patented something they call NEUTAR which is a more refined version of coal tar that doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the traditional ingredient.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t help with the dry scalp at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so dry</li>
            <li> It works but it leaves my hair terribly dry and causes breakage so one problem gets solved</li>
            <li> you are worried about your hair being dry after using this here</li>
            <li> After I wash and dry my face &amp; neck</li>
            <li> I have switched back to the fruity scents a few times, but have always had to come back to T/Gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the T-Gel for 3 weeks, it makes the scalp very very dry.</li>
            <li> previous doctor prescribed me T-gel after misdiagnosing me with Eczema (I really had tinea versicolor, a common fungal infection).</li>
            <li> I felt like my hair smelled really bad and scalp got a bit more inflamed</li>
            <li> This must be a secret at his high school!</li>
            <li> and my scalp had never really given me any problems.</li>
            <li> pinned up (after being carefully arranged and inspected for visible flakes at home).</li>
            <li> I was experiencing hair loss due to a very dry scalp and so decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> ANYWAY, my scalp had gotten to the point where I was afraid to touch my hair in public, lest some flakes loosen themselves and I spent my first month of school wearing my hair</li>
            <li> I was recently diagnosed with Guttate Psoriasis, and only have a few small patches on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend at least trying it for a few weeks if you suffer from rosacea.</li>
            <li> But , I was expecting little bigger bottle , it is less than what I thought .</li>
            <li> Other dandruff shampoos were ineffective and I had almost given up, but</li>
            <li> I use this every other day now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I left it in for between 30 to 40 minutes like I usually</li>
            <li> Shampooing  once a day or every other day, whatever your routine is.</li>
            <li> There are other knock-off brands but they don&#x27;t compare to the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> the way, I didn&#x27;t experience extreme dandruff (the type that flakes all over clothes).  </li>
            <li> I just noticed for the past days, my scalp had patches of red and it was sort of scaly</li>
            <li> active ingredient that addresses itching and flaking is &#x27;coal tar&#x27; which is smelly.</li>
            <li> Every time I finish shampooing, the hair is not even dry, I could already see the scalp skin dried up and started to peel off.</li>
            <li> Other dandruff shampoos do not have those problems and probably cost less considering</li>
            <li> Because fungus hates (sour) vinegar.</li>
            <li> Plus I CAN WEAR MY HAIR DOWN</li>
            <li> and I try never to waste stuff, so I may try what one other reviewer suggested and mix this with another shampoo, to help hide the smell.  </li>
            <li> BUT my scalp was so uncomfortable that I ended up washing my hair shortly after the shampoo arrived in the middle of the week.</li>
            <li> There are several generic versions which are less expensive.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s odd,</li>
            <li> My dandruff still came off, redness faded a little</li>
            <li> He had nothing to prescribe but suggested that I massage my scalp with cortisone cream - messy because I have a fully head of hair</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary:If you are tired of dealing with scalp issues, I definitely recommend that you give this a try.</li>
            <li> A waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis, with a few spots on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I use this shampoo as a face wash a few times a week.</li>
            <li> She says she just leaves it in her scalp for a few minutes before washing it off and applies it to her arm (before a shower) and leaves it there for 15+ minutes before showering it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The redness kind of faded but still remained :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> There is not even half the amount of hair falling out now that there was!</li>
            <li> What I mean by tried, is that I would try and use it for months at a time and got absolutely no positive results from this product.</li>
            <li> It may be beneficial for fighting dandruff but it definitely made my roots very weak.</li>
            <li> It did help with the flacking, not perfectly but well enough.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was too small.  </li>
            <li> UNTIL THIS PAST SUMMER THAT IS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure what triggered the issue, but my mom does have seborrheic dermatitis</li>
            <li> Now, to further emphasize how uncomfortable my scalp was, I need you to understand something.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve seen maybe two small ones?</li>
            <li> I used my usual Motions Herbal Fortifying Conditioner</li>
            <li> this bottle is small</li>
            <li> If you are out of options beyond the usual scalp treatment shampoos, give it a try, it might work for you.  </li>
            <li> I used neutrogena in my scalp, organix Moroccan oil and Marc Anthony frizz (the product I usually use) in the ends, and it worked for me.</li>
            <li> The smell is ghastly, but it usually can be covered up by a nicer smelling conditioner.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I can say about it is that it stinks, smells very medicinal.</li>
            <li> Coal tar has long been shown to be powerless against dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I also had a hard time getting the suds out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell.</li>
            <li> : Use Neutrogena therapeutic shampoo at least 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how serious it was.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was getting fumigated in the shower, and had to get out and open the windows, it was that bad.</li>
            <li> This product is not good.</li>
            <li> Ive tried cutting down my use of this product so that I wouldnt cause irritation to my scalp</li>
            <li> In my case the itchiness went away VERY slowly</li>
            <li> I never really had bad dandruff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for months, my scalp is getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> Even worse, it made my scalp itchy, [though I must say, the hair is still shiny].    </li>
            <li> predicting that the itchiness will get worse in the winter.</li>
            <li> If you hate the smell, you may not like this, although the smell which remains is much less chemically than when you are lathering.  </li>
            <li> I had a horrible case of scaly scalp and dandruff last winter.</li>
            <li> , just weird.  </li>
            <li> and I think they were just random remnants that got lost in my hair) and my scalp is itchy no longer.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is over-the-top smelly and after three days, I could not stand that burning rubber stench on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Along with the smell, the shampoo makes my hair feel nasty, not greasy or dry</li>
            <li> I forgot to mention that it stinks...</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t work, you can see a dermatologist and get cicloprox shampoo (very expensive -</li>
            <li> always bad experience.</li>
            <li> The smell is so bad</li>
            <li> When trying to style my hair after using this, I have really bad results.  </li>
            <li> If you can stand the smell and the bad hair style, go for it.  </li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t just bad, it was like lite fumes on my head...</li>
            <li> If this (or in a really bad case the extra-strength version of this) does not get rid of your dandruff, I suspect that you should consult a physician about your scalp problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a chemically (coal tar) treated shampoo for folks with BAD dandruff, which my husband has.</li>
            <li> The smell fades after your hair dries and isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I used to have a horrible scalp and after a few uses my dandruff disappeared!!!!</li>
            <li> He always asks if i&#x27;m giving him the \\&quot;smelly shampoo\\&quot; though :(</li>
            <li> I am doubtful that it will work, but may give it a try.</li>

            <li> Its really good! And the scent is totally tolerable, and I was surprised how well it soaped up and was easy to lather. One bummer for me was that although it is healing my scalp, I got itchy skin on some parts of my body (I guess from washing the soap off). Otherwise good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for months, my scalp is getting worse and worse. It&#x27;s even dryer and it seems to be some sort of rash. I hate it! btw, i haven&#x27;t found a good product from Neutrogena, i&#x27;ve tried their face wash, sun block.. always bad experience. wonder why it&#x27;s still a popular brand in US.</li>
            <li> I use the \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; haircare method, where I shampoo once a week and use conditioner 3x a week, cause my hair needs lots of moisture. The problem is, all the shampoos I used [even once per week]were like dish soap on my hair, and made it super frizzy and flaky. If I didn&#x27;t use any shampoo, after a while the conditioner would build up in my hair. So I went on a quest for the perfect shampoo and found this.     And the type I got a few months ago worked perfectly. It took away all the flakiness and conditioner residue, and left my hair shiny and smooth with a fresh scent. [It even cleared up my face]So when I went back to the store yesterday for more, and saw the same shampoo with a \\&quot;new scent\\&quot;, I bought it.    BIG problem. It smells really, really strongly of tar [unbearably so]. I felt like I was getting fumigated in the shower, and had to get out and open the windows, it was that bad. And now my hair smells horribly. I sprayed it thoroughly with perfume, but it&#x27;s this strong, acrid smell that everyone in my family noticed on my hair. Even worse, it made my scalp itchy, [though I must say, the hair is still shiny].    So, moral of this tale: Do NOT waste seven dollars on this. I&#x27;m throwing mine out, and heading off on the quest for new shampoo, unless Neutrogena goes back to the old formula.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible case of scaly scalp and dandruff last winter. Other dandruff shampoos were ineffective and I had almost given up, but then I remembered a hairdresser several years ago suggesting coal tar-based shampoo.  My wife found T-Gel at the pharmacy and my scalp was clear and the dandruff gone within a week.  The only caveat - you might want to use a conditioner with T-Gel, because it can leave your hair so clean that it&#x27;s bereft of body.  Once the problem goes away, you may want to use it once a week or so. I keep a bottle in my shower at all times.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I love Neutrogena products. We&#x27;ve both been using their face cleanes for years and love them. Earlier in the year my husband started using this to help with his dandruff and he really liked it a lot. It did help with the flacking, not perfectly but well enough. However, I started noticing an increased amount of his hair in the shower and on the floor in the bathroom then ever before. I also noticed his balding spot getting bigger at an alarming rate but I just figured it is all part of getting older. One day I found myself in a conversation with a coworker about dandruff shampoo (I know...random!) and I mentioned that my husband has been using T-gel with success but I never mentioned anything about the hair falling out. She told me to make him stop using it right away. She said that most of these kinds of shampoos do not actually fix the problem of dandruff but instead puts a coating on the scalp preventing the flakes from falling off which clogs the pores and makes the hair fall out faster than normal. As soon as I got home that night I told my husband this and he changed back to using a regular shampoo. We noticed a major difference within the first week. There is not even half the amount of hair falling out now that there was! Please note that I have not done any research to verify this and it is possible that it is a unique case to my husband. However, it is still something worth considering when thinking about using this product or something similar.</li>
            <li> This product burns my scalp and doesnt get rid of my dandruff.  Ive tried cutting down my use of this product so that I wouldnt cause irritation to my scalp but Im deciding to give up on it because I dont need to be in pain when I wash my hair for no results anyway.  I have contacted the company because I am that unsatisified with this product. Its a shame because I really love nuetrogena products and this is the only time that I have had an issue with something they make.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was too small.  I need the large size.</li>
            <li> If your scalp is itchy, T/Gel is worth a try for as long as you are willing to keep using it for a few months. It worked for me but there were no &#x27;instant&#x27; improvements. In my case the itchiness went away VERY slowly but, 3 months later, it&#x27;s 99% gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the exact problem my scalp had but it was itchy like... you know what. It began about one year ago and I couldn&#x27;t stop myself from scratching which, of course, ensured that my scalp stayed itchy and irritated. Discussing the problem with our good family doctor back in October or November (7-8 months ago) did not help much. He had nothing to prescribe but suggested that I massage my scalp with cortisone cream - messy because I have a fully head of hair and I am not planning to shave it - and predicting that the itchiness will get worse in the winter. (Thank you doc!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make the story short, a couple of months ago I stumbled upon a bottle of T/Gel left over from the time I used it (effectively) to address a dandruff problem and decided to give it a try. The box claims that this is &#x27;effective from the first use&#x27;. It&#x27;s not. My scalp was still itchy one month later but maybe not as much. And... a couple of weeks ago I just noticed - I wasn&#x27;t scratching or massaging my head any more. The itch was largely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that the T/Gel cured me and it&#x27;s quite possible that the itchiness would come back if I stopped using it. Maybe I will experiment with that in a couple of months but, at this time, I am content and happy to have it at least under control with one weekly T/Gel use. Yes, it smells a little funny but if you use it before going to bed the smell should be gone by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product deserves my 5 stars because it worked for me. It&#x27;s possible that it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but I can&#x27;t see how trying it would hurt.&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient that addresses itching and flaking is &#x27;coal tar&#x27; which is smelly. Neutrogena has patented something they call NEUTAR which is a more refined version of coal tar that doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the traditional ingredient. This version of T/Gel contains 2% NEUTAR.has patented something they call NEUTAR which is a more refined version of coal tar that doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as the traditional ingredient. This version of T/Gel contains 2% NEUTAR.</li>
            <li> The t-gel stops my itching but dosent get rid of my dandruff.  Also it smells like a mixture of horse poop and medicine.</li>
            <li> I have lived with dandruff and an itchy scalp for the majority of my life. Whenever I have asked hair stylists for a good anti-dandruff shampoo they would always suggest T-gel. I have tried to use it on multiple occasions and quite frankly every time I tried it, it did nothing for me. What I mean by tried, is that I would try and use it for months at a time and got absolutely no positive results from this product. If anything, I found that I was loosing more hair rather than getting my scalp back to a normal point.</li>
            <li> Was expired when I received it...</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 30 days ago. The first thing that bothered me about the product was the SMELL. It smelled like a shoe cream. I wonder what kind of chemicals they use in this product. I assume it wasn&#x27;t even tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They market it as \\&quot;therapeutic\\&quot;. But it doesn&#x27;t help with the dry scalp at all. It makes the scalp very itchy and dry. Severe dandruff is the end result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to buy a different product to cure the effect of the &#x27;therapeutic&#x27; Neutrogena shampoo.</li>
            <li> nothing works better than t gel for itchy scalp or beard.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I used to have a horrible scalp and after a few uses my dandruff disappeared!!!! Its cheap and actually works, unlike multiple other shampoos I have used for my hair. I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is not good. I felt no different after using it and it made my hair dry. I hate it!~</li>
            <li> It works and doesn&#x27;t smell so good but a little bit just a few shampoos and scalp is better.  Also used on whole body.</li>
            <li> The smell is so bad and it honestly reminds me of moth balls, which I cannot stand.  I was recently diagnosed with Guttate Psoriasis, and only have a few small patches on my scalp.  Decided to try this stuff, bought it at a local grocery store because I had a $2 off coupon.  It seems to help a little, but honestly, I just can&#x27;t stand the smell.  Along with the smell, the shampoo makes my hair feel nasty, not greasy or dry, just weird.  When trying to style my hair after using this, I have really bad results.  So if you have very short hair and don&#x27;t need any body in your style, this may not be a problem for you. If you can stand the smell and the bad hair style, go for it.  Would never buy this again and I try never to waste stuff, so I may try what one other reviewer suggested and mix this with another shampoo, to help hide the smell.  I am doubtful that it will work, but may give it a try.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo after the sudden onset of an itchy, dry, flaky scalp. It felt immediately better after the first use and I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all (being a not very particular man--but I can understand why some people would object). It is definitely worth a try, and is relatively inexpensive so no need to worry about wasting money if you don&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head &amp; shoulder for my dandruff problem and it didn&#x27;t do much for me. So after reading all the reviews on Amazon, I decided to give the T-Gel a try. I&#x27;ve been using the T-Gel for 3 weeks, it makes the scalp very very dry. Every time I finish shampooing, the hair is not even dry, I could already see the scalp skin dried up and started to peel off. It&#x27;s so dry I can peel off pieces of skin with hair holes still on them. My head is like a buffet for monkeys And whoever said this thing smells like shoe wax wasn&#x27;t kidding. I am gonna try Selsun Blue and see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> I have severe scalp dermatitis and wanted a cheaper shampoo since the presrcibed one costs $50.  It works but it leaves my hair terribly dry and causes breakage so one problem gets solved but then you have another one.  The T Sal works better.</li>
            <li> So I guess this qualifies as an \\&quot;off label\\&quot; use but i use this primarily on my face to treat acne breakouts.  In fact what I really like to do is squeeze out some of the T/Gel into a cup and then add a few drops of tea tree oil.  Then i apply the gel to my face and let it sit for about 10 minutes before getting in the shower.  That works well on my skin but everyone is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell I really like it for some reason.  Then again I always liked the smell of gasoline, turpentine, freshly paved roads, etc.  If those are unpleasing smells to you then this might not be your shampoo.  For me coal tar, or something else in the bottle, certainly SEEMS to help keep my skin clear.  I never really had bad dandruff so I can&#x27;t evaluate it on that basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside 4 oz goes really fast.  I can use an entire bottle in 2 weeks if I&#x27;m showering regularly (you are supposed to apply, rinse, apply, rinse).  Lastly, it is only .5% coal tar so I&#x27;m not too concerned about using it pretty liberally.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because after I got the shingles in my scalp, everything seems to irritate that one area. EXCEPT this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. Before I use it, I had this mild itches for a long time. You know what? if your head itch, you will lose hair...&lt;br /&gt;This works perfectly for me. I love it.</li>
            <li> I like it for what it is.</li>
            <li> My teenage found this on his own and swears by it.  This must be a secret at his high school!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena T-Gel gets me through the winters and without flaking. The smell is better than tar products and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My drain was clogged every day. The drying made my thin hair break easily. The smell wasn&#x27;t just bad, it was like lite fumes on my head...strong! I was embarrassed to be too close to people because they might smell it and be overwhelmed and I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable holding my toddlers face to close to mine from the toxic nature of it. I used it for a week and now it&#x27;s trash because the flakes turned into giant chunks of skin lining my hairline. The flaking went to my face and has resulted in embarrassing acne at age 29. Absolutely awful product, not for me...the cheaper stuff worked better and atleast I wasn&#x27;t going f#%!ing bald</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of expensive, but a little goes a long way. I was surprised at how well such a small amount lathered, and it started to tingle and left my hair pretty soft. The only bad thing I can say about it is that it stinks, smells very medicinal. I guess that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s the good stuff.</li>
            <li> Everybody differs on cases the cause of dandruff. I use this every other day now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First: I use a Apple Cider Vinegar mix with warm water for 5-10 minutes. Because fungus hates (sour) vinegar. It will make your scalp much feeling cleaner and shiny. The Vinegar will eliminate shampoo build-up (dandruff/scalp residue/shampoo residue). It is great also for balding head cause it has anti-DHT properties according to some write-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then: Use Neutrogena therapeutic shampoo at least 5 minutes. Use a conditioner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with the ingredients. I wish they get rid of parabens and or sulfates</li>
            <li> Excellent product for hair</li>
            <li> Great product. I would love to order more and all my dandruff were gone. I recommended all my friends and near one too</li>
            <li> Good, leaves hair and scalp dry and very clean. Not so sure if it really prevents dandruff in my case, but I feel OK with it. One downside it&#x27;s its smell, But you can deal with it.</li>
            <li> I use to buy this shampoo but they don&#x27;t sale it more in my country, I looked through Amazon because is the greatest shampoo I have ever used, highly recommended</li>
            <li> My Story: I have relaxed hair that is about midback length and my scalp had never really given me any problems. UNTIL THIS PAST SUMMER THAT IS. I went from having pretty much no scalp irritation to having an extremely itchy and flaky scalp. I&#x27;m still not sure what triggered the issue, but my mom does have seborrheic dermatitis so maybe it finally kicked in for me. ANYWAY, my scalp had gotten to the point where I was afraid to touch my hair in public, lest some flakes loosen themselves and I spent my first month of school wearing my hair pinned up (after being carefully arranged and inspected for visible flakes at home). As you can expect, this grew old very quickly. So I started searching for a solution and I stumbled upon the review page for this product. I was kind of worried about my hair drying out, but I couldn&#x27;t deal with my scalp situation for much longer so I went ahead and ordered. Now, to further emphasize how uncomfortable my scalp was, I need you to understand something. I only wash my hair once a week during the weekends because it takes a couple of hours to wash/condition/dry and I&#x27;m swamped with school/work during the week. BUT my scalp was so uncomfortable that I ended up washing my hair shortly after the shampoo arrived in the middle of the week. That&#x27;s how serious it was. AND IT WAS SO WORTH IT. While I was washing my hair, I felt the shampoo tingling against my irritated scalp during the first wash. After gently scrubbing my scalp (note that I said my scalp, not my hair-I will explain this later) for the first round of shampooing, I applied a second round of shampoo to my scalp and left it on for a few minutes before rinsing and applying a moisturizing shampoo &amp; conditioner. It has been almost a week and my scalp feels amazing. I have pretty much no flakes (I&#x27;ve seen maybe two small ones? and I think they were just random remnants that got lost in my hair) and my scalp is itchy no longer. Plus I CAN WEAR MY HAIR DOWN AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:If you are tired of dealing with scalp issues, I definitely recommend that you give this a try. Based off of how much I used, I imagine that the bottle will last me 2-3 months (with 1 wash/week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are worried about your hair being dry after using this here are some tips-&lt;br /&gt;1) Don&#x27;t apply this shampoo to the length of your hair. Inevitably, there will be some run off when you are rinsing, but during your actual application try to concentrate on putting the T-gel on your scalp. When I was done with my two rounds of the T-gel, I did one  wash with my regular moisturizing sulfate-free shampoo that I applied to the length of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Make sure you use a good conditioner with this product. I used my usual Motions Herbal Fortifying Conditioner and I left it in for between 30 to 40 minutes like I usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After these these steps, I went through my regular routine (leave-ins etc.) and I experienced no dryness. The smell of the t-gel is almost like a spicy herbal smell, but it was tamed by my conditioners.</li>
            <li> I saw some information on using this for Seborrheic Dermatitis. The same article also mentioned using Head &amp; Shoulders and Selsun Blue. I have Rosacea &amp; Seborrheic Dermatitis. I tried the Head &amp; Shoulders first (on the face &amp; neck) since we already had some and it helped, but I switched to this and it has worked much better for me. After I wash and dry my face &amp; neck I then apply a mixture of Sarna Sensitive and Cortizone-10. I used to get bad rashes and terrible itching but this routine seems to keep it at bay. I think it works better than some of the prescription cortisone creams I was using.</li>
            <li> Ditched because MG217 has 3% Coal Tar compared to Neutrogena&#x27;s 0.3%.</li>
            <li> Regardless of the coal tar smell, this product helps control my psoriasis. I would recommend this product to any psoriasis sufferer.</li>
            <li> Generally about the best non-prescription anti-dandruff shampoo around.  If you hate the smell, you may not like this, although the smell which remains is much less chemically than when you are lathering.  There are several generic versions which are less expensive.  The fragrance is slightly different in each.    A woman is likely to object to the fragrance (of the coal tar which makes it work) more than a male, but the use of a conditioner on your hair after the shampoo totally gets rid of the original fragrance.    If this (or in a really bad case the extra-strength version of this) does not get rid of your dandruff, I suspect that you should consult a physician about your scalp problem.</li>
            <li> works as advertised and is worth using despite the tar smell people note in their reviews. I noticed a change by the second time.</li>
            <li> I was instructed to use this 3-4 times a week. It has Not cleared up my dandruff. In despiration I switched to Selson blue deep cleasning shampoo with deep cleasning beads. The selson blue works so much better. I am sticking with the selson blue. My dandruff is not an issue now. This coal tar shampoo didn&#x27;t do anything for it. A waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this, and they sent me two, by accident I imagine.  I have psoriasis, with a few spots on my scalp.  Hoped this would help out, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference, I used both bottles, and let it soak in my hair for plenty of time when showering.  Didn&#x27;t see any results.  Decent shampoo though, hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo as a face wash a few times a week. It has really cleared up my rosacea without drying out my skin. I&#x27;ve heard it works great for dandruff, but it really helps with the redness caused by my rosacea! I read about using Neutrogena T-Gel original shampoo in a doctor&#x27;s advice column in the newspaper and decided to give it a try. I know the smell can be a little much but it&#x27;s definitely worth the results. I highly recommend at least trying it for a few weeks if you suffer from rosacea.</li>
            <li> Simply the Best IF...you follow the directions. You use this great product to cleanse your hair of all the impurities and gook leftover in your hair from your regular shampoo, conditioner, and the world. You use it for 14 days. Shampooing  once a day or every other day, whatever your routine is. It really works, I&#x27;ve been doing this since I was a teenager. I do this routine about every five to six months. This routine is essential for fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li> As other&#x27;s have said, it is a very good product and Amazon&#x27;s price is excellent.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that not all dandruff are the same. They have different origins and causes for being there. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s different dandruff shampoo. I rarely ever get dandruff but this product works great for mine when I do get it. I have a roommate that has Psoriasis and this works wonders on it. She has it in both her scalp and hair. She says she just leaves it in her scalp for a few minutes before washing it off and applies it to her arm (before a shower) and leaves it there for 15+ minutes before showering it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous doctor prescribed me T-gel after misdiagnosing me with Eczema (I really had tinea versicolor, a common fungal infection). T-gel obviously did nothing for it and the advice of applying oil-based lotion on my skin just inflamed it. I finally went to a dermatologist and he diagnosed me with tinea versicolor and he told me to use Nizoral which is also a Anti-Dandruff shampoo but works as a anti-fungal. This worked amazingly. I did have some re-occurrences but currently, I have no traces or visual signs of tinea versicolor anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, what I&#x27;m trying to say, is if this doesn&#x27;t work for your dandruff, try using a different shampoo with different ingredients. Not all dandruff is the same. Obviously, anti-dandruff shampoos have multiple purposes. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The item is good cheap and what I expected, well packaged, shipped quick, will surely purchase this item again if it is still cheap</li>
            <li> This shampoo was just ok. It took care of dandruff but I really did not enjoy the smell. I also had a hard time getting the suds out of my hair. Other dandruff shampoos do not have those problems and probably cost less considering this bottle is small (I was in the end happy how small it was, so I could use it up fast and stop smelling weird)</li>
            <li> I hate the smell, but as it was not purchased to smell good. It does well for scalp dryness and itching.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help me. It just left my hair dry, which is normal for this kind of shampoo, but still itching.&lt;br /&gt;So I went back to my old shampoo from Brazil, Pielus.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing hair loss due to a very dry scalp and so decided to give this a try. After the first use, I have noticed that my hair is falling out much more than usual. After just two uses, I feel that I might lose all my hair! It may be beneficial for fighting dandruff but it definitely made my roots very weak. I would not recommend anyone to use this product if they are experiencing hair loss.</li>
            <li> i think it works. Hard to tell. i think I&#x27;ve been washing my hair incorrectly. i recently bought shampoo brush to get rid of some flakes. http://www.amazon.com/Scalpmaster-Shampoo-Brush-Purple-Ounce/dp/B000NJG82W&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that, in combination with me leaving the shampoo in for about 5-10 minutes has helped a lot.  conditioner also helps.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without it! --- no flaky scalp, just clean, manageable hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does the trick for treating mild cases of psoriasis. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the horrid smell, which takes getting use to. I have found that switching off between this stuff and the T-Sal works wonders for my young son. He always asks if i&#x27;m giving him the \\&quot;smelly shampoo\\&quot; though :( It definitely works though, and I can&#x27;t complain about it, I would recommend it for psoriasis sufferers!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a chemically (coal tar) treated shampoo for folks with BAD dandruff, which my husband has. It works for him, but he can&#x27;t use it more than 3 times a week, because it makes his scalp tingle. Back in the day, I think you actually had to have a prescription to get this stuff!  It WILL turn gray/white/silver hair a wierd yellow, after a while. Paul Mitchell makes a product (for blondes) that you can use after your shampoo, to take the yellow out.  This seems to keep it in balance.  But don&#x27;t plan on a &#x27;Gee, your hair smells terriffic&amp;#34; experience, because it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell. I think I am washing in a chemical bath. I much prefer Redken Dandruff Control. I can&#x27;t even tell you if the T-Gel works or not.</li>
            <li> This stuff gives you a deep clean. My wife and I both use this twice a week, and it lasts us about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena&#x27;s T/Gel &amp; T/Sal Products. I have been using the original T/Gel since the early 90s. Back then I developed a spot of what appears to be Psoriasis. I contributed it to the large amounts of hairspray that I used back then. Even though I have since stopped using hairspray I still have the Psoriasis. Nothing over the counter will help but T/Gel. I have switched back to the fruity scents a few times, but have always had to come back to T/Gel. The smell was an issue for me at first too, But this product really works. The smell fades after your hair dries and isn&#x27;t so bad. I have come to like the smell as well.</li>
            <li> Is Excellent product, for many year used for my family, all product from Neutrogena are EXCELLENT, thanks you for made happy life</li>
            <li> After a couple of times of using this, my scalp psoriasis has disappeared. I will continue using occasionally just to help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - This is working! I havent had any problems since I started using it. I use it 1-2 times a week now. I forgot to mention that it stinks... It does consist of coal tar so you can expect to smell like tar. I will use this and then a fragrant shampoo after to try to lessen the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have color treated hair and it has not caused any problems with that.</li>
            <li> It a good product in terms of quality. It is worth the money that you pay. Healthy hairs... But , I was expecting little bigger bottle , it is less than what I thought .</li>
            <li> My favorable for 20 years</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s products are the biggest joke....they do not work for recalcitrant, stubborn dandruff cases.  Coal tar has long been shown to be powerless against dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;If you have dandruff, you need to treat it with 2% sulfur treatments (you can buy the sulfur gel on here) and also VO5 hot oil treatments once a month.  Then, use Selsun Blue.  If that doesn&#x27;t work, you can see a dermatologist and get cicloprox shampoo (very expensive - either be wealthy or have insurance cuz it&#x27;s $120 per bottle) and antibiotics.  I used Neutrogena&#x27;s products for quite awhile in my teens (for hair and for skin), while seeing a quack dermatologist.  I&#x27;m glad I wasn&#x27;t paying for them, because they sure didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo that works whenever I get dandruff,,,It works with one or two applications and that is what matters,,,does smell like railroad tie preservative though!!  Does not matter,,it works!!!</li>
            <li> Used it along with my regular shampoo and helps with the dandruff that I have. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> Es un buen shampoo especial para cierto tipo de piel delicada,,&lt;br /&gt;No huele fuerte,,&lt;br /&gt;Es excelente medicamente&lt;br /&gt;Pruebalo&lt;br /&gt;Llega rapidito</li>
            <li> Not a miracle product but it really helps.  It has a strong odor but not to the point of being over-powering.  I&#x27;d much rather have the smell than the flakes, crusty build-up and redness everywhere on my head.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the only stuff that clears up the dry skin under my moustache and beard. It&#x27;s simple but effective: lather, let sit, rinse. That famous smell is somewhere between tar and a chemistry lab though, which is a downside. 5 stars for effectiveness, but the smell takes one off.</li>
            <li> Great product... Works well and it&#x27;s odd, but I actually like the way it smells. Very industrial. Gets rid of all flakes and leaves my scalp feeling rejuvenated. I always make sure I use this a few times per week. There are other knock-off brands but they don&#x27;t compare to the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Ahhhhh my scalp can breathe again.  This is the best shampoo for the intense itching and irritation my scalp feels in summer.  I could feel the sign of relief and I haven&#x27;t scratched since using it.  Amazing product.  Second best is DHS Zinc Shampoo but the results don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> I am usually not sensitive with the smells.  I am talking about I was never bothered by the Selsun Blue Shampoo smell or even the Blue bottle of Head and Shoulders and they are pretty strong (that medicated smell lingering on your scalp).  BUTTTT...this shampoo is over-the-top smelly and after three days, I could not stand that burning rubber stench on my scalp.  I totally understand it&#x27;s made partly with tar but I am sure even if you aren&#x27;t phased by the smell yourself, others might go..\\&quot;Whoa\\&quot;.  On the first or second day, after a trial/change of shampoo, I would feel my hair or scalp \\&quot;feel\\&quot; a bit better (not 100%, but FEEL).  I felt like my hair smelled really bad and scalp got a bit more inflamed but that could just be me, individually.  If you are out of options beyond the usual scalp treatment shampoos, give it a try, it might work for you.  The smell was obviously the factor to say NUH UH for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I didn&#x27;t experience extreme dandruff (the type that flakes all over clothes).  I just noticed for the past days, my scalp had patches of red and it was sort of scaly and it had a tad of itchiness.  It could have been some weather changes or something but I am better now after going back to the usual OTC dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this product a 3.5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product at CVS pharmacy because my scalp was getting red (I think it&#x27;s because of hot weather), I picked this up with the conditioner and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st Use: It!s true! It doesn&#x27;t smell good, doesn&#x27;t form enough bubbles so it doesn&#x27;t give you a really great shampoo experience but It does what it is supposed to do- control symptomps of dandruff, etc. My dandruff started flaking off after use (eek) so the sacylic acid seem to work. The redness kind of faded but still remained :&#x27;( The thing I don&#x27;t like of course is it didnt leave my hair smooth or glossy or nice-smelling (if that is even a word) so I tried another approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd Use: I used neutrogena in my scalp, organix Moroccan oil and Marc Anthony frizz (the product I usually use) in the ends, and it worked for me. My dandruff still came off, redness faded a little but my ends felt smooth, silky and smelled delicious! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good to mix products, but I kinda do it most of the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for YEARS. I have tried everything from Head and Shoulders to Selsun Blue. I used to have severe dandruff where I needed medication from a dermatologist just for my scalp which made my hair oily. Since discovering this wonder, I feel like I&#x27;ve hit the jackpot; I used to use it everyday but it has made my scalp so much more manageable. Now, I only need to use it once or twice a week. The smell is ghastly, but it usually can be covered up by a nicer smelling conditioner. It does not do anything damaging to my hair and it reduces redness and swelling and itchiness and I no longer have any visible flakes in my scalp. My only problem is that now I have the keratin in my hair and this is not sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly for my mom, who has psoriasis.  She thought it was a medicated treatment.  However, it seems to be a remover.  It does work.  She doesn&#x27;t like the smell.  She says it smells like Murphy Oil.  I liked the smell because it reminds me of Toys R Us, but possibly Toys R Us uses Murphy Oil to clean their store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...I don&#x27;t recall seeing this warning in the product details (though sometimes I miss things).  The instructions warn you that this product will make you more sensitive to the sun, and you will sunburn more easily.  Therefore, if you are someone that spends a lot of time outside, you&#x27;ll need to take precautions if you use this product.</li>
