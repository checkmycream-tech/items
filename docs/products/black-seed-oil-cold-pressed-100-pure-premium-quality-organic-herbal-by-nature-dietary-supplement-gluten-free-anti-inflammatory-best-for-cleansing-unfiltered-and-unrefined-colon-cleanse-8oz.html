            <li>the more i slough off the callus</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;am on my way to better health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoying oil.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it just ordered more so did my brother</li>
            <li>This product does seem to work ok though.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>While i can&#x27;t pinpoint any direct, fast-onset effects i feel great and am getting relief from withdrawl.</li>
            <li>USPS damaged original package.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, for sure.</li>
            <li>Has a naturally strong nutty taste and is best to eat honey behind it.</li>
            <li>Has a mild scent.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy i did not give up on my organic black seed journey.</li>
            <li>This product is golden.  </li>
            <li>the more sensitive my feet would become.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how i knew this was AUTHENTIC ORGANIC BLACK SEED OIL with no fillers unlike Shea Terra&#x27;s that tasted like olive oil which i am sure</li>
            <li>Yes i was really  satisfied  thx for following up with  me</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and new as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality oil.  </li>
            <li>but I kept taking my Black seed oil and i within couple of days i felt better.  </li>
            <li>However, no podiatrist could find the reason other than it is callus and this is more frequent in darker pigmented individuals</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to black seed oil being a bit strong but this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I took a chance on Organic Herbal and when i opened the bottle i immediately notice a huge difference because the color was almost black and not the dark brown like most BS oils</li>
            <li>The after taste isn&#x27;t harsh compared to others I&#x27;ve tried but this is clearly a strong taste.</li>
            <li>The color is Dark and Rich.</li>
            <li>Regardless of HOW this particular brand of Black Seed Oil is supposed to work as far as the reduction of inflammation, the fact that it tastes like turpentine pretty much turned me off.  </li>
            <li>This was FAR from it.  </li>
            <li>The callus is not developing at rapid rate, slowly but surely.  </li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t dislike the taste of the seeds, they are strongly flavored, this oil almost isn&#x27;t as strong tasting as the raw seed, it has only a slight after-bite.</li>
            <li>My first experience ordering Black Seed Oil from Amazon was a challenging experience, However i think i got it right this time meaning &amp;#34; DO NOT ORDER SHEA TERRA organic black  seed oil because there is nothing organic or even a hint of black seed in their product.</li>
            <li>It looks like i am the first to review, so you can see the company did not post any fake reviews like most companies here on Amazon</li>
            <li>I was actually shocked by how strong and potent this oil is.  </li>
            <li>and then i tried it with pure alkaline water and the taste was extremely pungent</li>
            <li>and Yes this is a real review you can check out my others on several other products i order off amazon.</li>
            <li>It started years ago, first with a little white spot on the side of my feet and over the years it just became chronic.</li>

            <li> Being familiar with the taste of the raw seed I was expecting this oil to be pungent and hard to get down, but it isn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s only this particular brand, or if it&#x27;s ALL Black Seed Oil, since I&#x27;ve tried a couple other brands and reacted to them as well.  </li>
            <li> When my feet gets wet</li>
            <li> I doubt I will ever buy another black seed oil unless I find a place that I can buy it pressed fresh, which is quite unlikely.</li>
            <li> The other day I did not feel well</li>
            <li> its so not worth it.</li>
            <li> If you need a black seed oil the will truly work, this one is it.</li>
            <li> I have used other black seed oils from local stores and they were a faint shadow of this oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks, I feel a difference with my congestion.</li>
            <li> For me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Hard to get down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> arrived one week late.</li>
            <li> But the majority of them are at least palatable.  </li>
            <li> I did not reorder, at least not yet.</li>
            <li> , when i soak my feet in apple cider vinegar and slough off the callus, and I get in water i can tell that my feet is not developing  thick callus over it.</li>
            <li> Worse that I thought</li>
            <li> The inability to provide tracking information made me skeptical, but in the end, package arrived.</li>
            <li> So definitely not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> However, i started taking black seed oil, and it  is regulating my body, so it can perform the way God created it to perform, and to God be the glory!!!!!</li>
            <li> it does taste bad</li>
            <li> In fact, I got so sick from it</li>
            <li> disgusting ... literally made me throw up!</li>

            <li> Hard to get down. Worse that I thought</li>
            <li> I hope it is working to prevent cancer, but I know it helps the bowels move like nothing else.</li>
            <li> taste is different still going to try it</li>
            <li> My first experience ordering Black Seed Oil from Amazon was a challenging experience, However i think i got it right this time meaning &amp;#34; DO NOT ORDER SHEA TERRA organic black  seed oil because there is nothing organic or even a hint of black seed in their product. So i decided not to give up because that&#x27;s the kind spirit i have. I took a chance on Organic Herbal and when i opened the bottle i immediately notice a huge difference because the color was almost black and not the dark brown like most BS oils and then i tried it with pure alkaline water and the taste was extremely pungent that&#x27;s how i knew this was AUTHENTIC ORGANIC BLACK SEED OIL with no fillers unlike Shea Terra&#x27;s that tasted like olive oil which i am sure was a filler they put in. I am extremely happy i did not give up on my organic black seed journey. I am truly grateful for this company, i hope they continue with the goodness and not sell out and cut cost and corners for a buck........its so not worth it. It looks like i am the first to review, so you can see the company did not post any fake reviews like most companies here on Amazon and Yes this is a real review you can check out my others on several other products i order off amazon.</li>
            <li> This product too me. Is better than Amazing Herbs. The color is darker and stronger. Kill a cough in seconds.</li>
            <li> Good quality oil, but may be a bit over priced. There is no certified organic label as advertised and package arrived one week late. The inability to provide tracking information made me skeptical, but in the end, package arrived. I considered returning both bottles but decided to keep them after reading reviews. I&#x27;ve tried almost all brands on the market and this brand is surely quite good. It is way ahead in price, but possibly, not definitely, ahead in quality.</li>
            <li> This product is golden.  For years i have had an issue with my feet that builds up callus extra and the more i slough off the callus the more sensitive my feet would become.  When my feet gets wet it gets  white.  Also, when i work or walk for an extended period of time my feet will itch and extra callus will build up. It started years ago, first with a little white spot on the side of my feet and over the years it just became chronic. I always felt it has something to do my my sweat and something in my body is imbalance and this is the cause.  However, no podiatrist could find the reason other than it is callus and this is more frequent in darker pigmented individuals they said.  However, i started taking black seed oil, and it  is regulating my body, so it can perform the way God created it to perform, and to God be the glory!!!!!, when i soak my feet in apple cider vinegar and slough off the callus, and I get in water i can tell that my feet is not developing  thick callus over it. The callus is not developing at rapid rate, slowly but surely.  The other day I did not feel well but I kept taking my Black seed oil and i within couple of days i felt better.  This product I feel regulate the body to act as how God created it to be. Years of medication for acne, and foods that I  ate had my imbalance  but I&#x27;am on my way to better health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A, Williams</li>
            <li> Yes i was really  satisfied  thx for following up with  me</li>
            <li> USPS damaged original package. Contacted and package resent. Enjoying oil.</li>
            <li> disgusting ... literally made me throw up!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Anti-inflammatory so I&#x27;m hoping it helps with some arm pain from tendonitis. it does taste bad but I&#x27;m used to that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks, I feel a difference with my congestion. You definitely have to get passed the taste, mind over matter!</li>
            <li> AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this oil and It was just what I wanted. There are a lot of imitators out here. This is truly NOT one of them. The color is Dark and Rich. This oil is truly the BEST!!!! If you need a black seed oil the will truly work, this one is it.</li>
            <li> Love it. The after taste isn&#x27;t harsh compared to others I&#x27;ve tried but this is clearly a strong taste.</li>
            <li> Love it. While i can&#x27;t pinpoint any direct, fast-onset effects i feel great and am getting relief from withdrawl. I&#x27;ve only been talking it a well.</li>
            <li> Very high quality oil.  I have used other black seed oils from local stores and they were a faint shadow of this oil.  I was actually shocked by how strong and potent this oil is.  I&#x27;m used to black seed oil being a bit strong but this is the real deal.  I doubt I will ever buy another black seed oil unless I find a place that I can buy it pressed fresh, which is quite unlikely.</li>
            <li> Love it just ordered more so did my brother</li>
            <li> This product took almost 2 weeks to receive - that sucked, esp since they estimated the delivery would be about 5-7 days. So. Being familiar with the taste of the raw seed I was expecting this oil to be pungent and hard to get down, but it isn&#x27;t really. Although I don&#x27;t dislike the taste of the seeds, they are strongly flavored, this oil almost isn&#x27;t as strong tasting as the raw seed, it has only a slight after-bite. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a good thing, I wonder whether the oil has been diluted. This product does seem to work ok though. My take away is that next time I&#x27;ll try another product.</li>
            <li> It tastes like nigella sativa, I like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent very great I will recommended for evry one this item. Thank you</li>
            <li> Regardless of HOW this particular brand of Black Seed Oil is supposed to work as far as the reduction of inflammation, the fact that it tastes like turpentine pretty much turned me off.  I&#x27;m no stranger to acrid smelling and tasting health remediwes that are supposed to be good for you.  But the majority of them are at least palatable.  This was FAR from it.  In fact, I got so sick from it I had to just stop taking it.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s only this particular brand, or if it&#x27;s ALL Black Seed Oil, since I&#x27;ve tried a couple other brands and reacted to them as well.  So definitely not impressed with this product. For me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Has a naturally strong nutty taste and is best to eat honey behind it.</li>
            <li> Potent...I love this product!</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and new as advertised.  Has a mild scent.  I&#x27;ve been taking 1 teaspoon 2x a day, and I think my energy has improved.  I&#x27;ve been taking it for about a week, and I do notice a difference.  Will continue to take this.  I also use on my skin.</li>
            <li> Second time around buying from this seller. And it&#x27;s great! Quick delivery and awesome product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. This is the real deal, for sure. It met all of my expectations. My only frustration was, when I went to reorder it two weeks later, the price changed from $19 to $29. There was no indication that it was on sell at the $19 price. I did not reorder, at least not yet.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product will purchase again. I use it for both Medicinal as well as cooking!!  Will  purchase this one again!</li>
