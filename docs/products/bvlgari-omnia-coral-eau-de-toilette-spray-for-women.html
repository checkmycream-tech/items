            <li>I fell in love with.</li>
            <li>I wondered if the product was diluted or the scent evaporated because the top has no cover, just can&#x27;t help thinking all these things.</li>

            <li>but figured I would get the better deal on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love most of the Bvlgari scents.</li>

            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent.</li>

            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>, I love it &amp; everyone that hugs me</li>
            <li>Perfect for daily wear and fork work.</li>
            <li>Most perfumes will aggravate my nose in the morning, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>one of the better choices out there for women perfume</li>
            <li>Omnia coral is definitely my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Bulgari for many years now.  </li>
            <li>Totally love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>All I wanted and more.</li>
            <li>A real win-win, a happy story times two.</li>
            <li>Will surely be part of my collections.</li>
            <li>Coral also happens to be my favorite color, but that is neither here nor there.</li>
            <li>I love this EDT.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited and also extremely pleased with this seller&#x27;s prompt delivery of my item!  </li>
            <li>When she puts in on and sees me an hour later it is the perfect strength.</li>
            <li>and she never sprays herself more than once or twice in a day.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I get sooo many compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect scent!  </li>
            <li>I love the Fragrance I ordered 2 for my wife</li>
            <li>Comes in the original box and smells absolutely amazing on me</li>
            <li>Crisp, light scent that is great for spring and summer.</li>
            <li>She loves it, which normally would be the end of a happy story, but maybe even as importantly, I love it when she wears it.  </li>
            <li>great deal on this classic perfume</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh smell!!!</li>
            <li>My gf loved it and the smell sticks to her very well!</li>
            <li>Has a nice sweet scent.</li>
            <li>But put that aside, this perfume smells wonderful and lasts surprisingly long for an EDT.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite from Bvlgari - if you&#x27;re thinking about buying this do it you won&#x27;t regret!!</li>
            <li>This is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Most of my cologne lineup is Bvlgari, and I enjoy the craft in their scents.</li>
            <li>Best money I&#x27;ve spent in a while.</li>
            <li>For me, Omnia Coral smells light, fresh, bright and clean.  </li>
            <li>Not too sweet though!</li>
            <li>think there is a STRONG cherry smell in this.</li>
            <li>Not too strong or perfumy.</li>
            <li>Not to strong and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>but im the type if its to strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, but I don&#x27;t smell it all day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really love the way it smells right away when I put it on, but once it has mellowed, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>The first pouf from the bottle smells nice, then it begins to change from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde.  </li>
            <li>Omnia coral is light and clean, i love the crystalline too..</li>
            <li>And to me it&#x27;s pretty unique because the top note is more clean and sexy whereas the end note is more sweet.</li>
            <li>This was really nice perfume, smells good and stays for long time.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s huge for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the omnia line.</li>
            <li>The name, Coral, is very fitting as there is a very beachy feel to the scent, yet still sweet.</li>
            <li>this one is fantastic.</li>
            <li>You can not find any of these fragrances  in any retail stores for as cheap as you can get then from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Well, the hours I had with my girlfriend extended smoothly as I indulged in her scent.</li>
            <li>Truly a fantastic perfume, and</li>
            <li>the bottle smelled great it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Do not ever buy this at the lure of cheaper price that what is available at Macys or Nordstrom.</li>
            <li>Send real one or will report to the FBI for fraud!!!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice fragrance - second bottle for my wife...</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this purfume - its strong at first but fades pretty quickly, so spray it on and enjoy!</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I excitedly sprayed some on myself and to my dismay the scent was not concentrated at all.</li>
            <li>the box original wrapping seemed replaced with the another wrapping .</li>
            <li>, I bought the 2.2 ounce for $38 when the original at the store is $120.</li>
            <li>I started with the musky amber omnia scent, the original and have also tried crystalline.  </li>
            <li>Hello, i want to know, perfume is original?</li>
            <li>light, sweet, airy, a tad citrusy.</li>
            <li>Smells so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled with this purchase, I may buy again for fear of having to pay more for it in the future.</li>
            <li>could I give her on that special day.</li>
            <li>It is a fresh clean light smell, that you can wear every day.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much I brought two.</li>
            <li>TELL ME HOW MUCH THEY LOVE THIS SMELL</li>
            <li>i spayed it in the air i loved it and bought it,the next day i put it on to work recived compliments but couldnt stand it after 3 hours</li>
            <li>Reminds me of springtime, light rain, fresh tulips.</li>
            <li>Why wife really likes the fragrance of this perfume and what better and easier gift</li>
            <li>Its sweet, but not too sweet.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is ideal for gifts or for everyday use</li>
            <li>Bulgari Omnia Coral is my new favorite scent, cool, clean and just a hint of hibiscus and pomegranate-</li>
            <li>It smelled so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Warm spice with major floral notes.</li>
            <li>Smells good but scent doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>Light, fresh and crisp</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve very sensitive and most perfumes cause me to have headaches</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd time buying it :))!</li>
            <li>love any perfume actually by bvlgari, but this perfume it smells very sexy and soft got a lot of complements.</li>
            <li>It has a mix do fresh, floral, and citrus.</li>
            <li>It smells musky, not floral, fruity, or fresh, or even woodsy.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>fragrance, feminine and fresh...</li>
            <li>It really has that signature, unique fragrance that the omnia series has.  </li>
            <li>My first purchase thru another vendor, back in August 2012, was nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>The scent fades so quickly that I fin myself reaching for something else in the morning, something that I know will last more than an hour on my skin.</li>
            <li>But this perfume is VERY worth it, and on Amazon it is cheaper than 90% of high quality, BRAND NAME perfumes out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and crisp like a mandarin orange.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend is in her mid 20s and rarely wears perfume but enjoyed a unisex scent I let her try once, also by Bvlgari.</li>
            <li>it was no where near as strong smelling as the bottle i purchased on the retail store.</li>
            <li>This seemed like a little heavier at the beginning, but then i loved it.</li>
            <li>While the original may still be my favorite (although now discontinued), this new coral scent is a close second.  </li>
            <li>I love perfumes and wear them daily!  </li>
            <li>It keeps you interested.</li>
            <li>That helps when you are already interested in the woman wearing it.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite fragrance to wear above all the others I have in my collection.</li>
            <li>I got this perfume only based on the reviews, without trying, and i love it now.</li>
            <li>I first smelled this perfume on a co worker that walked by.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume and especially the price!</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ve been married for 42 years.  </li>
            <li>I actually went into my stash of perfumes and got rid of many of them, will ship to my sister and her 4 daughters.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear it hours and hours later.  </li>
            <li>It has long lasting and great smell as the store samples.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this vender and order from them again.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s a first where perfumes are concerned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given my wife a countless number of perfumes, but this one, by far, is my favorite!</li>
            <li>After purchasing this perfume I have thrown out every other body spray, mist, perfume I own.</li>
            <li>I have not had a problem with the scent fading too quickly, but my nose is pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li>This was a last minute order for a Christmas present and it got here sooner than I expected which was awesome!  </li>
            <li>I will never buy any more of my perfume in a department store  as long as I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s not loud and my sinuses thank me..</li>
            <li>I am giving only 4 stars as I personally think the bottle looks a tad cheap, I think Bvlgari could have done a bit better in this area.</li>
            <li>I am certain it was opened and add water to it.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh, clean and subtle flowers.  </li>
            <li>After pricing around different retailers, I got it at Amazon for an amazing low price!</li>
            <li>She loves the scent, wears it very often.</li>
            <li>No on has really complimented me wearing it, but I like it.</li>
            <li>and she really put on this every time she&#x27;s out</li>
            <li>very mellow and  lingers all day.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>If anyone loves dolce&amp;cabanna light blue, this is a sweeter version of it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>But so much  cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The smell is really relaxing.</li>
            <li>I wished I had saved my money and bought another bottle of Light Blue by Dolce and Gabanna...</li>
            <li>Also, it is economic.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>really like and recommend</li>
            <li>very good&lt;br /&gt;thanks. bye</li>
            <li>I live in Chicago, which means hot, humid summers.</li>
            <li>Just as lovely as its other Bvlgari cousins but not my favourite.</li>
            <li>I absolutely live this perfume!</li>
            <li>I would say a safe buy for your woman even if she typically does not wear perfume or is not used to it.</li>
            <li>My advice remains the same for all perfumes; make sure to try a sample at the store if possible.</li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon gave me my money back.</li>
            <li>The fruits quickly fade and within an hour I&#x27;m left with nothing but</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>This review sounds absolutely ridiculous, I know, but it&#x27;s just a very refreshing spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with how much I like this perfume.</li>
            <li>I usually like fresh light smells, like flower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth it to just dish out the money for the product that actually does not fade before you leave the house.</li>
            <li>i think it has a very classy scent and particularly goes with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>It is perfect, and I&#x27;ll keep buying this until I get sick of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean fresh scent that lasts all day with a small spray.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to fragrance.</li>
            <li>i needed to used five times as much...very diluted or very old.</li>
            <li>so it would last much longer than it does.</li>
            <li>The real deal, only way cheaper.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the container has no cover or lid</li>
            <li>package is delivered to my home completely and it smells goods.</li>
            <li>This bottle of perfumes was old.  </li>
            <li>Smelled old.  </li>
            <li>I wish they also had the powder and other items along this same line available for purchasing form amazon..</li>
            <li>my recommendation to not to buy perfume that is more expensive in the real market</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessarily &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34; I think it&#x27;s a very classy perfume that I can wear anywhere.</li>
            <li>The packaging was the same as you would expect in store, with clear, neat wrapping over the box and everything.</li>
            <li>A soft scent everyone will want to know what your wearing and where they can get it for such an awsome price!!</li>
            <li>is nice for casual dating and just social gatherings.</li>
            <li>It can be a little on the heavy side, so make sure you don&#x27;t overspray.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something feminine yet not overpowering or too subtle, but just enough to give a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet, subtle, and invigorating.</li>

            <li> one of the better choices out there for women perfume</li>
            <li> Omnia coral is definitely my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Bulgari for many years now.  </li>
            <li> Totally love this perfume.  </li>
            <li> All I wanted and more.</li>
            <li> A real win-win, a happy story times two.</li>
            <li> Will surely be part of my collections.</li>
            <li> Coral also happens to be my favorite color, but that is neither here nor there.</li>
            <li> I love this EDT.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited and also extremely pleased with this seller&#x27;s prompt delivery of my item!  </li>

            <li> I get sooo many compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect scent!  </li>
            <li> I love the Fragrance I ordered 2 for my wife</li>
            <li> Comes in the original box and smells absolutely amazing on me</li>
            <li> Crisp, light scent that is great for spring and summer.</li>
            <li> She loves it, which normally would be the end of a happy story, but maybe even as importantly, I love it when she wears it.  </li>
            <li> great deal on this classic perfume</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh smell!!!</li>
            <li> My gf loved it and the smell sticks to her very well!</li>
            <li> Has a nice sweet scent.</li>
            <li> But put that aside, this perfume smells wonderful and lasts surprisingly long for an EDT.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite from Bvlgari - if you&#x27;re thinking about buying this do it you won&#x27;t regret!!</li>
            <li> This is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Most of my cologne lineup is Bvlgari, and I enjoy the craft in their scents.</li>
            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve spent in a while.</li>
            <li> For me, Omnia Coral smells light, fresh, bright and clean.  </li>
            <li> Not too sweet though!</li>
            <li> think there is a STRONG cherry smell in this.</li>
            <li> Not too strong or perfumy.</li>
            <li> Not to strong and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> but im the type if its to strong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong, but I don&#x27;t smell it all day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really love the way it smells right away when I put it on, but once it has mellowed, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> The first pouf from the bottle smells nice, then it begins to change from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde.  </li>
            <li> Omnia coral is light and clean, i love the crystalline too..</li>
            <li> And to me it&#x27;s pretty unique because the top note is more clean and sexy whereas the end note is more sweet.</li>
            <li> This was really nice perfume, smells good and stays for long time.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s huge for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the omnia line.</li>
            <li> The name, Coral, is very fitting as there is a very beachy feel to the scent, yet still sweet.</li>
            <li> this one is fantastic.</li>
            <li> You can not find any of these fragrances  in any retail stores for as cheap as you can get then from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Well, the hours I had with my girlfriend extended smoothly as I indulged in her scent.</li>
            <li> Truly a fantastic perfume, and</li>
            <li> the bottle smelled great it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Do not ever buy this at the lure of cheaper price that what is available at Macys or Nordstrom.</li>
            <li> Send real one or will report to the FBI for fraud!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice fragrance - second bottle for my wife...</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this purfume - its strong at first but fades pretty quickly, so spray it on and enjoy!</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I excitedly sprayed some on myself and to my dismay the scent was not concentrated at all.</li>
            <li> the box original wrapping seemed replaced with the another wrapping .</li>
            <li> , I bought the 2.2 ounce for $38 when the original at the store is $120.</li>
            <li> I started with the musky amber omnia scent, the original and have also tried crystalline.  </li>
            <li> Hello, i want to know, perfume is original?</li>
            <li> light, sweet, airy, a tad citrusy.</li>
            <li> Smells so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with this purchase, I may buy again for fear of having to pay more for it in the future.</li>
            <li> could I give her on that special day.</li>
            <li> It is a fresh clean light smell, that you can wear every day.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much I brought two.</li>
            <li> TELL ME HOW MUCH THEY LOVE THIS SMELL</li>
            <li> i spayed it in the air i loved it and bought it,the next day i put it on to work recived compliments but couldnt stand it after 3 hours</li>
            <li> Reminds me of springtime, light rain, fresh tulips.</li>
            <li> Why wife really likes the fragrance of this perfume and what better and easier gift</li>
            <li> Its sweet, but not too sweet.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is ideal for gifts or for everyday use</li>
            <li> Bulgari Omnia Coral is my new favorite scent, cool, clean and just a hint of hibiscus and pomegranate-</li>
            <li> It smelled so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Warm spice with major floral notes.</li>
            <li> Smells good but scent doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> Light, fresh and crisp</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve very sensitive and most perfumes cause me to have headaches</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd time buying it :))!</li>
            <li> love any perfume actually by bvlgari, but this perfume it smells very sexy and soft got a lot of complements.</li>
            <li> It has a mix do fresh, floral, and citrus.</li>
            <li> It smells musky, not floral, fruity, or fresh, or even woodsy.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> fragrance, feminine and fresh...</li>
            <li> It really has that signature, unique fragrance that the omnia series has.  </li>
            <li> My first purchase thru another vendor, back in August 2012, was nice and fresh.  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> The scent fades so quickly that I fin myself reaching for something else in the morning, something that I know will last more than an hour on my skin.</li>
            <li> But this perfume is VERY worth it, and on Amazon it is cheaper than 90% of high quality, BRAND NAME perfumes out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and crisp like a mandarin orange.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is in her mid 20s and rarely wears perfume but enjoyed a unisex scent I let her try once, also by Bvlgari.</li>
            <li> it was no where near as strong smelling as the bottle i purchased on the retail store.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a little heavier at the beginning, but then i loved it.</li>
            <li> While the original may still be my favorite (although now discontinued), this new coral scent is a close second.  </li>
            <li> I love perfumes and wear them daily!  </li>
            <li> It keeps you interested.</li>
            <li> That helps when you are already interested in the woman wearing it.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite fragrance to wear above all the others I have in my collection.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume only based on the reviews, without trying, and i love it now.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume on a co worker that walked by.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and especially the price!</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve been married for 42 years.  </li>
            <li> I actually went into my stash of perfumes and got rid of many of them, will ship to my sister and her 4 daughters.  </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear it hours and hours later.  </li>
            <li> It has long lasting and great smell as the store samples.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this vender and order from them again.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a first where perfumes are concerned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given my wife a countless number of perfumes, but this one, by far, is my favorite!</li>
            <li> After purchasing this perfume I have thrown out every other body spray, mist, perfume I own.</li>
            <li> I have not had a problem with the scent fading too quickly, but my nose is pretty sensitive.</li>
            <li> This was a last minute order for a Christmas present and it got here sooner than I expected which was awesome!  </li>
            <li> I will never buy any more of my perfume in a department store  as long as I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s not loud and my sinuses thank me..</li>
            <li> I am giving only 4 stars as I personally think the bottle looks a tad cheap, I think Bvlgari could have done a bit better in this area.</li>
            <li> I am certain it was opened and add water to it.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh, clean and subtle flowers.  </li>
            <li> After pricing around different retailers, I got it at Amazon for an amazing low price!</li>
            <li> She loves the scent, wears it very often.</li>
            <li> No on has really complimented me wearing it, but I like it.</li>
            <li> and she really put on this every time she&#x27;s out</li>
            <li> very mellow and  lingers all day.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If anyone loves dolce&amp;cabanna light blue, this is a sweeter version of it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> But so much  cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The smell is really relaxing.</li>
            <li> I wished I had saved my money and bought another bottle of Light Blue by Dolce and Gabanna...</li>
            <li> Also, it is economic.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> really like and recommend</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;thanks. bye</li>
            <li> I live in Chicago, which means hot, humid summers.</li>
            <li> Just as lovely as its other Bvlgari cousins but not my favourite.</li>
            <li> I absolutely live this perfume!</li>
            <li> I would say a safe buy for your woman even if she typically does not wear perfume or is not used to it.</li>
            <li> My advice remains the same for all perfumes; make sure to try a sample at the store if possible.</li>
            <li> Luckily Amazon gave me my money back.</li>
            <li> The fruits quickly fade and within an hour I&#x27;m left with nothing but</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> This review sounds absolutely ridiculous, I know, but it&#x27;s just a very refreshing spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with how much I like this perfume.</li>
            <li> I usually like fresh light smells, like flower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth it to just dish out the money for the product that actually does not fade before you leave the house.</li>
            <li> i think it has a very classy scent and particularly goes with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> It is perfect, and I&#x27;ll keep buying this until I get sick of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean fresh scent that lasts all day with a small spray.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to fragrance.</li>
            <li> i needed to used five times as much...very diluted or very old.</li>
            <li> so it would last much longer than it does.</li>
            <li> The real deal, only way cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the container has no cover or lid</li>
            <li> package is delivered to my home completely and it smells goods.</li>
            <li> This bottle of perfumes was old.  </li>
            <li> Smelled old.  </li>
            <li> I wish they also had the powder and other items along this same line available for purchasing form amazon..</li>
            <li> my recommendation to not to buy perfume that is more expensive in the real market</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34; I think it&#x27;s a very classy perfume that I can wear anywhere.</li>
            <li> The packaging was the same as you would expect in store, with clear, neat wrapping over the box and everything.</li>
            <li> A soft scent everyone will want to know what your wearing and where they can get it for such an awsome price!!</li>
            <li> is nice for casual dating and just social gatherings.</li>
            <li> It can be a little on the heavy side, so make sure you don&#x27;t overspray.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something feminine yet not overpowering or too subtle, but just enough to give a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet, subtle, and invigorating.</li>
            <li> I am generally a big Bvlgari fan but this scent just falls flat to me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got the real thing.  </li>
            <li> It is a long lasting one as well.</li>
            <li> but this fragrance does not last long.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I want it to, but ten again nothing lasts on me.</li>
            <li> It lasts a ridiculously long time, I can spray it in the morning and still smell it by evening.  </li>
            <li> In terms of how long it lasts, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d have to reapply it every 3-4 hours or so.</li>
            <li> The strange thing is that when I smell my clothes the scent is there, so</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but it last all day long.</li>
            <li> I seen a few reviews where they said the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> As others have said, it smells the same but seems to fade within a half hour.</li>
            <li> Some earlier reviews stated that the perfume seemed watered down among other things, but with mine this was not the case.</li>
            <li> It is pretty and clean, but to me boring and generic.</li>
            <li> I appreciate how quickly the product was expedited with its delivery; however, the quality of the product was a little stale.</li>
            <li> not a fan of any of the other Bvlgari scents but</li>
            <li> Not only that, within a few minutes the scent was gone!</li>
            <li> and I have any regrets buying Omnia!</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s way cheaper than buying it at ULTA or other stores that sell perfumes.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to buying other scents.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any other perfume.</li>
            <li> it seems like it was  watered down.</li>
            <li> My husband follows me around like a little puppy</li>
            <li> I wear it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I like to wear it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this quite a few times.</li>
            <li> This is a fruity-fresh scent that reminds me of pomegranate scented soap with a bit of green leaves.</li>
            <li> the green, soapy notes.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this purchase , it is not original</li>
            <li> Not much more compliments I can give it.</li>
            <li> The one I received seems to be a fake and doesn&#x27;t smell the same either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> It has an odd odor, I suspect I received an outdated bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> One of the only perfumes I&#x27;ve ever used until the last drop, before it goes bad!  </li>
            <li> is a false perfume o eau de toilette, yo put the perfume and it during at 5minutes , no more, don&#x27;t buy please.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m already over it after less than a month.</li>
            <li> Difficult to describe the smell, but somehow \\&quot;Coral\\&quot; fits this perfume&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> This one smells stale.  </li>
            <li> Smells like insect repellent and lasts less than an hour.  </li>
            <li> That sucks !!!</li>
            <li> Fake perfume!  </li>
            <li> and I still haven&#x27;t gotten sick of it.  </li>
            <li> i admit i was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THIS IS A FAKE BULGARI!!</li>
            <li> but my husband hated it.</li>
            <li> Very bad for Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am very very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ran after a woman that was wearing this cologne and asked her what she was wearing. I ordered it immediately and received my order in a couple of days. I love this cologne. I wish they would make a parfum so it would last much longer than it does. I have to spray a lot of this on each time I wear it. It is a delightful sweet smelling perfume that is unlike any I have come across before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bvlgari, PLEASE MAKE A EAU DE PARFUM!!!  We love this scent and I want more, more, more of it. A powder would be nice as well. I like to layer the scents that I love and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time wearing this fragrance. I&#x27;ve had two bottles now and that&#x27;s huge for me. I have not purchased a fragrance more than once in years.</li>
            <li> This was a last minute order for a Christmas present and it got here sooner than I expected which was awesome!  It was just the size I wanted the wife loves it!</li>
            <li> shipped in a timely manner and the wife loved it.......</li>

            <li> favorite perfume great prices</li>
            <li> not a fan of any of the other Bvlgari scents but this one is fantastic. It has a mix do fresh, floral, and citrus. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> lasts all day, just need to apply twice to keep the scent all day</li>
            <li> I love perfumes and wear them daily!  This is my new favorite.  In addition, it is probably one of the easiest to dispense!  Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> The real deal, only way cheaper.</li>
            <li> UGHHHH! SMELLS SOOO GOOD. I WAS AT WORK. AND I WOULD PASS MY COWORKER AND SAY WHAT IS THAT SMELL....??&lt;br /&gt; HAD TO BUY IT.. LOVE IT SMELLS SOOOOO DAM GOOD. ITS ADDICTING :-)</li>

            <li> PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THIS IS A FAKE BULGARI!!# I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!! PLEASE DONT EVEN TRY...</li>
            <li> GEt so many compliments when I wear this scent.</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful!! Clean fresh scent that lasts all day with a small spray.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrances. I have has so many compliments on it when I wear it. I love it so much I brought two. You can not find any of these fragrances  in any retail stores for as cheap as you can get then from Amazon.com. I will never buy any more of my perfume in a department store  as long as I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Been wearing it for two year now and I love it!! A little pricey, but it last all day long.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh, clean and subtle flowers.  Has becomeone of my favorite fragrances along side Lightblue.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD THE RECOMMENDED PRODUCT THE PRODUCT AND THE SELLER</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the omnia line. This is light and refreshing. It does not disappoint. I wear it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She loves the scent, wears it very often. I live in Chicago, which means hot, humid summers. I seen a few reviews where they said the scent doesn&#x27;t last long. Well, the hours I had with my girlfriend extended smoothly as I indulged in her scent. It keeps you interested. That helps when you are already interested in the woman wearing it. Not much more compliments I can give it. I&#x27;m very happy with the results, I love the original bottle its in as well as the amount it holds. Spoil your girl just once before winter/holidays arrive.</li>
            <li> I had such big expectations from Bulgari Omnia Coral based on the trial insert I got from a magazine. The trial/sample smelled so fresh and lingered for at least 10 days. I decided I must have it. Upon receiving my order, I immediately opened the package. I was surprised that the container has no cover or lid so the spray device is exposed. Nevertheless, I excitedly sprayed some on myself and to my dismay the scent was not concentrated at all. It is not anything like the trial/sample I fell in love with. Not only that, within a few minutes the scent was gone! I wondered if the product was diluted or the scent evaporated because the top has no cover, just can&#x27;t help thinking all these things. I am very very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, the wife loves loves this, and the price for the size is great bargin.</li>
            <li> Love the scent but disappears after an hour.</li>
            <li> Just love it! I&#x27;m the kind of person that likes to change the fragrance once in a while... and I have any regrets buying Omnia! Got lots of complements!</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this purchase , it is not original it seems like it was  watered down. the box original wrapping seemed replaced with the another wrapping . I am certain it was opened and add water to it. my recommendation to not to buy perfume that is more expensive in the real market , I bought the 2.2 ounce for $38 when the original at the store is $120. don&#x27;t be fooled with cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I will order again soon on this perfume. The best !!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing perfume. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments when I wear this perfume. I&#x27;m a huge Bvlgari fan!! I only wear this brand of perfume, I&#x27;ve very sensitive and most perfumes cause me to have headaches but this line does not. This is my new favorite from Bvlgari - if you&#x27;re thinking about buying this do it you won&#x27;t regret!!</li>
            <li> LOVED IT&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;very pleasant fragrance..... I have received many compliments.  I will certaiinly re order again.......I will also try some of the others from this same collection</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for about three months and I still haven&#x27;t gotten sick of it.  I feel it&#x27;s the perfect compliment to every outfit I have on, this is a good scent for the workplace or out at night.  I often get compliments for smelling good.  Difficult to describe the smell, but somehow \\&quot;Coral\\&quot; fits this perfume&#x27;s name.  One of the only perfumes I&#x27;ve ever used until the last drop, before it goes bad!  Good for Fall.</li>
            <li> Get lots of compliments when I wear this</li>
            <li> I bought this scent for my girlfriend, taking a risk in not having tried the scent beforehand and instead going based off reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suffice to say it did not disappoint. Most of my cologne lineup is Bvlgari, and I enjoy the craft in their scents. I was looking for something feminine yet not overpowering or too subtle, but just enough to give a fantastic scent. My girlfriend is in her mid 20s and rarely wears perfume but enjoyed a unisex scent I let her try once, also by Bvlgari. Once she tried this on she was immediately in love; she wears it to work, and any given day without need for occasion (I&#x27;ve even noticed her spraying a bit on before we go to the gym). Truly a fantastic perfume, and I would say a safe buy for your woman even if she typically does not wear perfume or is not used to it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances . have used it before and have been looking for it for quite some time. But could not find it ! This is real deal and am so happy will be buying another</li>
            <li> Awesome. Have been using it for years is my signature.</li>
            <li> Just as lovely as its other Bvlgari cousins but not my favourite. I still get compliments on it though. My advice remains the same for all perfumes; make sure to try a sample at the store if possible.</li>
            <li> This product is FAKE!!! The package has been resealed. Send real one or will report to the FBI for fraud!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this fragrance.  It is my favorite fragrance to wear above all the others I have in my collection.</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived in a timely manner and smells absolutely amazing! I get compliments all the time. Plus, it&#x27;s way cheaper than buying it at ULTA or other stores that sell perfumes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume, it smells amazing. I get compliments all the time on how wonderful I smell. Just bought another bottle and will continue to purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried so many perfumes, but this has been the best one ever! I usually like fresh light smells, like flower. This seemed like a little heavier at the beginning, but then i loved it. It is a long lasting one as well. I am getting compliments everywhere, even from people that i don&#x27;t know. I got this perfume only based on the reviews, without trying, and i love it now.</li>
            <li> Some lady walk in my job with this on i needed to know what she has on! It smell refreshing a must have!!!</li>
            <li> gives me energy. I like to wear it everyday.  No on has really complimented me wearing it, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I will buy again once I&#x27;m out of it. Love it! Great way to spend money on something</li>
            <li> I sampled this perfume in store and it was heavenly. I alway check amazon to see if I can get a better deal, and this exceeded my expectations. Some earlier reviews stated that the perfume seemed watered down among other things, but with mine this was not the case. I bought the 2.2 oz bottle, and it was perfect. The packaging was the same as you would expect in store, with clear, neat wrapping over the box and everything. I am so thrilled with this purchase, I may buy again for fear of having to pay more for it in the future. This is definitely one of my best purchases to date!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrence. I wish they also had the powder and other items along this same line available for purchasing form amazon..</li>
            <li> I absolutely live this perfume! It&#x27;s sultry with a bit of spice, definitely feminine. I get compliments on it and people asking me what it is on a regular basis. Best money I&#x27;ve spent in a while.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! Every time I wear it, I get compliments. This is my new go-to fragrance.</li>
            <li> If you want a good perfume think about Bvlgari Omnia Coral. It&#x27;s really good and the price is nice comparing with others.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for a while.  I always receive compliments on how nice I smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  Looking forward to buying other scents.</li>
            <li> I needed this item for a Christmas gift.  After pricing around different retailers, I got it at Amazon for an amazing low price!</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume on a co worker that walked by. It smelled so clean and fresh. I finally bought it and was very happy with it . Wished the smell longer but still a great scent</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this perfume!! Smells amazing. Something I will definitely be ordering again when I run out. Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> This was really nice perfume, smells good and stays for long time. I bought this for my girlfriend and she really put on this every time she&#x27;s out</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and especially the price!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell the same as the product I tested in the store.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle because I smelled it at Macys and loved it but figured I would get the better deal on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth it to just dish out the money for the product that actually does not fade before you leave the house. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the bottle smelled great it just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I love this floral fragrance, especially rose. but this fragrance does not last long. that&#x27;s why i give four stars.</li>
            <li> Smells so clean and fresh! I love most of the Bvlgari scents. Just wish they would make more in the perfume instead of the ODT. I think the perfume scent stays with you longer.</li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s not loud and my sinuses thank me.. very mellow and  lingers all day. A soft scent everyone will want to know what your wearing and where they can get it for such an awsome price!!</li>
            <li> Love it.  It can be a little on the heavy side, so make sure you don&#x27;t overspray.  It lasts a ridiculously long time, I can spray it in the morning and still smell it by evening.  My clothing permanantly smells like this, even after washing several times.  I&#x27;d call that good staying power :)</li>
            <li> I CHOOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE , I JUST LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS PERFUME !!&lt;br /&gt;PEOPLE TELL ME HOW MUCH THEY LOVE THIS SMELL</li>
            <li> Do not ever buy this at the lure of cheaper price that what is available at Macys or Nordstrom. To the best of my observation and conclusion, the product may not be original.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It smells great. I just wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. It is a fresh clean light smell, that you can wear every day.  Not overpowering whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this perfume! Lovely scent. Not too overbearing... just right. highly recommend! A must have!</li>
            <li> Great product! My wife was very happy</li>
            <li> Nice stuff, but most of all... nice price.</li>
            <li> i admit i was disappointed. it was no where near as strong smelling as the bottle i purchased on the retail store. i needed to used five times as much...very diluted or very old. would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this perfume I have thrown out every other body spray, mist, perfume I own. The smell is THAT good. I don&#x27;t need any other perfume. It is perfect, and I&#x27;ll keep buying this until I get sick of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to describe this perfume in two words it&#x27;d be: luxurious cherries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think there is a STRONG cherry smell in this. It&#x27;s not necessarily &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34; I think it&#x27;s a very classy perfume that I can wear anywhere. Hence the &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;cherries.&amp;#34; This&#x27;ll be a perfect gift for a girlfriend, wife, friend, anyone. It&#x27;s not a scent that&#x27;ll give you a headache either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get complimented on this perfume wherever I go. In terms of how long it lasts, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d have to reapply it every 3-4 hours or so. But this perfume is VERY worth it, and on Amazon it is cheaper than 90% of high quality, BRAND NAME perfumes out there. I &amp;#60;3 Bvlgari</li>
            <li> great deal on this classic perfume</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery very happy</li>
            <li> Great product! My gf loved it and the smell sticks to her very well! Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Gets compliment on it all the time! Of course perfume smells different with everyone but I really love how this smells. It&#x27;s sweet, subtle, and invigorating. And to me it&#x27;s pretty unique because the top note is more clean and sexy whereas the end note is more sweet. It is a definite summer scent for me. The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I want it to, but ten again nothing lasts on me. If anyone loves dolce&amp;cabanna light blue, this is a sweeter version of it in my opinion. Hope this helps! :)</li>
            <li> package is delivered to my home completely and it smells goods.</li>
            <li> Fake perfume!  Smells like insect repellent and lasts less than an hour.  Luckily Amazon gave me my money back.</li>
            <li> I  receive compliments ALL the time whether im wearing crystaline or the coral spray. i bouught the crystaline (white) and coral (red) bottles in a gift sets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MUSH HAVE.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this purfume - its strong at first but fades pretty quickly, so spray it on and enjoy! I get compliments wherever I go!</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance! Ordered this quite a few times. Comes in the original box and smells absolutely amazing on me</li>
            <li> I love this! Get compliments all the time on the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Perfume itself is great .&lt;br /&gt;Negative: I sent it as a gift to my sister and wrote her a note in &amp;#34;gift option&amp;#34; but she hasn&#x27;t received any note with the perfume ! That sucks !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent value.  I love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s fresh and crisp like a mandarin orange.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is WONDERFUL!!!!!, I love it &amp; everyone that hugs me loves it as well.  This is a winner for me!!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone always asks what I am wearing when I wear this perfume. Perfect for daily wear and fork work. Not too strong or perfumy. Crisp, light scent that is great for spring and summer. I have not had a problem with the scent fading too quickly, but my nose is pretty sensitive. Another great reason I like this perfume. Most perfumes will aggravate my nose in the morning, but this one doesn&#x27;t. Go ahead and give it a try!</li>
            <li> i like it&lt;br /&gt;my GF loves is&lt;br /&gt;still one of the better choices out there for women perfume</li>
            <li> Omnia coral is definitely my favorite scent. Not to strong and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great buy. My mom loved it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got the real thing.  The one I received seems to be a fake and doesn&#x27;t smell the same either.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect gift!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the smell of this but my husband hated it. I had to give it away.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just what I needed</li>
            <li> Good price and lovely scent.  Wish it would last longer.</li>
            <li> this smells so good! It&#x27;s the perfect blend of floral and fruits! Not too sweet though! Has been added to my list of favorites!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Bulgari for many years now.  I started with the musky amber omnia scent, the original and have also tried crystalline.  While the original may still be my favorite (although now discontinued), this new coral scent is a close second.  I don&#x27;t really love the way it smells right away when I put it on, but once it has mellowed, I absolutely love it.  It really has that signature, unique fragrance that the omnia series has.  I wear it almost every day.</li>
            <li> Totally love this perfume.  My husband follows me around like a little puppy and we&#x27;ve been married for 42 years.  If that isn&#x27;t a good recommendation what is?  I actually went into my stash of perfumes and got rid of many of them, will ship to my sister and her 4 daughters.  My daughter wears another brand of the Bvlgari, but at this time I can&#x27;t remember which one it is.  It&#x27;s been her signature scent for years.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume ever! I get so many compliments when I wear it hours and hours later.  Has a nice sweet scent. Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice fragrance - second bottle for my wife... her request!!! is nice for casual dating and just social gatherings.</li>
            <li> Bulgari any day! This is my 3rd bottle of Omnia Coral. I will buy it over and over again cos i think it has a very classy scent and particularly goes with my body chemistry. Pls buy this fragrance, its absolutely beautiful. And lasts all day too. Thank u Bulgari! Keep doin ur thing, i&#x27;m a fan always.</li>
            <li> All I wanted and more.</li>
            <li> I looooove it!!!! This is my 3rd time buying it :))! I highly recommend it! Smells wonderful. Not too strong! Just perfect!!! I get a lot of compliments and I will keep buying it...........(-:</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful price</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. The same as in the stores. But so much  cheaper here on Amazon. Than at the department store</li>
            <li> Hello, i want to know, perfume is original? Thanks</li>
            <li> Smells good but scent doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> Authentic product and great shipping packaging!</li>
            <li> I got this and it came on time. It has long lasting and great smell as the store samples. The smell is really relaxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on perfume (Eau De Toilette - that&#x27;s different?), but I bought this for my wife on a friend&#x27;s recommendation.  She loves it, which normally would be the end of a happy story, but maybe even as importantly, I love it when she wears it.  A real win-win, a happy story times two.</li>
            <li> This is a fruity-fresh scent that reminds me of pomegranate scented soap with a bit of green leaves. It is pretty and clean, but to me boring and generic. The fruits quickly fade and within an hour I&#x27;m left with nothing but the green, soapy notes. I am generally a big Bvlgari fan but this scent just falls flat to me.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! Get lots of compliments when I wear it!!! Clean, fresh smell!!! You can wear it to work or out at night!!! It just works!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best ever, so in love with it, the smell if fantastic. Will surely be part of my collections.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with how much I like this perfume. It reminds me of the smell of the air in the hotel in Hawaii my husband and I stayed at on our honey moon... light, sweet, airy, a tad citrusy. The name, Coral, is very fitting as there is a very beachy feel to the scent, yet still sweet. Coral also happens to be my favorite color, but that is neither here nor there. I am giving only 4 stars as I personally think the bottle looks a tad cheap, I think Bvlgari could have done a bit better in this area. But put that aside, this perfume smells wonderful and lasts surprisingly long for an EDT. I can&#x27;t believe I spend $80 on this at Macy&#x27;s when I could have bought it off Amazon for 1/2 the price!</li>
            <li> Completely wonderful.  I appreciate the excellent product, price and speedy delivery.  Bulgari Omnia Coral is my new favorite scent, cool, clean and just a hint of hibiscus and pomegranate- I love it!  At Bulgari, it&#x27;s $80.  Not here on Amazon!    [...]</li>
            <li> Great product, great seller !!!</li>
            <li> The major reviews on this scent sounded awesome, so I tried it.  The first pouf from the bottle smells nice, then it begins to change from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde.  It smells musky, not floral, fruity, or fresh, or even woodsy.  I wished I had saved my money and bought another bottle of Light Blue by Dolce and Gabanna...it never disappoints me!  This one goes to the Yard Sale tub!</li>
            <li> I like this scent since is sweet, great and all good qualities. Also, it is economic. This is the second time I buy it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product. It has an odd odor, I suspect I received an outdated bottle of perfume. It smells like insect spray. I can only gather that this product&#x27;s shelf life was out of date.</li>
            <li> I love it! Shipping was fast. Great service. Omnia coral is light and clean, i love the crystalline too.. I have the amethyst as well. They all have something similar...</li>
            <li> If the Fiancé is happy then everyone is happy that is the rule and she was ecstatic when it arrived to Two Thumbs Up!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful but im the type if its to strong i get a head ache. i spayed it in the air i loved it and bought it,the next day i put it on to work recived compliments but couldnt stand it after 3 hours my head was throbbing. so sad because i love how it smells. Basically great fragrance just not for me.</li>
            <li> This is a nice scent. It&#x27;s not too strong, but I don&#x27;t smell it all day. The strange thing is that when I smell my clothes the scent is there, so maybe it&#x27;s just me!</li>
            <li> I love this EDT.  For me, Omnia Coral smells light, fresh, bright and clean.  Reminds me of springtime, light rain, fresh tulips. This review sounds absolutely ridiculous, I know, but it&#x27;s just a very refreshing spray. I definitely recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> Why wife really likes the fragrance of this perfume and what better and easier gift could I give her on that special day.</li>
            <li> I literally ordered this item like two datys ago  and it came today! I am so excited and also extremely pleased with this seller&#x27;s prompt delivery of my item!  It smells great, was in it&#x27;s original unopened packaging and I am so thrilled!!!  My fav fragrance!  Will def buy again from this seller. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very nice deal and great perfume. My wife loves it!</li>
            <li> My friend loved this perfume! Purchased it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, I didn&#x27;t like it but my best friend loved it.  Good buy, I don&#x27;t like floral scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given my wife a countless number of perfumes, but this one, by far, is my favorite!</li>
            <li> My first purchase thru another vendor, back in August 2012, was nice and fresh.  This one smells stale.  I appreciate how quickly the product was expedited with its delivery; however, the quality of the product was a little stale.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent!!! Warm spice with major floral notes. Delighted with this perfume.  I get so many compliments when I wear it!!!</li>
            <li> is a false perfume o eau de toilette, yo put the perfume and it during at 5minutes , no more, don&#x27;t buy please.Very bad for Amazon.</li>
            <li> love any perfume actually by bvlgari, but this perfume it smells very sexy and soft got a lot of complements.</li>
            <li> gift for sister birthday she ask for it, the price was great and she loved it great item ........... . .. .</li>
            <li> I got this for her a couple weeks ago and was worried that it would be a knock of or diluted but it smells just like if we were to get it from Macys. She puts it on before work and i wont see her until 9 hours later and if im close i can still smell it which is a good thing. When she puts in on and sees me an hour later it is the perfect strength. and she never sprays herself more than once or twice in a day. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> smells great and just like all of the blgari perfume</li>
            <li> I am not someone who knows a lot about perfume but I knew I liked the smell of this so I thought I&#x27;d get it for the summer. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m already over it after less than a month. The scent fades so quickly that I fin myself reaching for something else in the morning, something that I know will last more than an hour on my skin.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing!  Lasts all day! And shipping took 2 days! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Its sweet, but not too sweet. I get sooo many compliments every time I wear it. There is nothing like Omnia Coral!</li>
            <li> As others have said, it smells the same but seems to fade within a half hour. I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells wonderful, a bit sweeter than my favorite which is Bvlgari Omnia Crystalline. I received my order on time, it was in pristine condition. I would most definitely recommend this vender and order from them again.</li>
            <li> best woman perfume out there right now</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. This bottle of perfumes was old.  Smelled old.  I have worn this scent for years so I know what it is supposed to smell like.  I will never purchase it again here. Sticking with Macy&#x27;s from now on.  You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Excellent: cost, quality and delivery of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Product shipping date OK&lt;br /&gt;Packing boxes appropriate for mailing, and nature protection&lt;br /&gt;Excellent fragrance, feminine and fresh...&lt;br /&gt;recommended 100% The fragrance is ideal for gifts or for everyday use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect scent!  I can wear this everywhere, and I do. My fiance loves it, and trust me, that&#x27;s a first where perfumes are concerned. The fragrance isn&#x27;t obnoxious, it doesn&#x27;t scream for attention, but seems to get it anyway. You will feel feminine and beautiful whenever you wear this. I love, love, love this perfume!</li>
            <li> good product and service&lt;br /&gt;I really like and recommend&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem&lt;br /&gt;good rating&lt;br /&gt;very very good&lt;br /&gt;thanks. bye</li>
            <li> Ummmm very nice fragance</li>
            <li> Bvlgari Omnia Coral Eau De Toilette Spray for Women great I love the Fragrance I ordered 2 for my wife</li>
