            <li>Kind of pricy,</li>

            <li>Excellent to sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>Although this is not vegan it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>I am super impressed and can&#x27;t believe I had this gem in my possession for so long without knowing how great of a product this is.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>

            <li>I love this face and eye cream.</li>
            <li>friggin love this product.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re needing deep hydration, this is the best cream I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>I am going to stick to this mosturizer forever :)</li>
            <li>I gifted to my mom for her wrinkles, yet to see results.</li>
            <li>Great that it has all natural ingredients which will moisturize and benefit your skin.</li>
            <li>The unscented smells great; light and natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve passed it on to my gay makeup artist friends who slather their faces with it like I do.</li>
            <li>I like that it has olive oil as a primary ingredient.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is fine otherwise as I really couldn&#x27;t wear it to find out if it worked.</li>
            <li>Thought to give it a try (as its safe anyways) and it really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older, I&#x27;m drier and  I used to be a top model and know products like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li>Only downside is I need more!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>So I was happy to find this Extra Sensitive version.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to switch over to more natural and vegan products.  </li>
            <li>; version as its more natural.</li>
            <li>so it must me doing something right.</li>
            <li>and this makes my face so shiny and greasy feeling most of the day, along with making me break out with acne on my chin and jaw almost constantly, that I just can&#x27;t continue to use it....</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Now I just have to wait and see if it keeps my skin soft and smooth like my grape seed oil does.</li>
            <li>I ran out of first container, and I will re-order it, again.</li>
            <li>I feel very encouraged by the very positive reviews on this product and its low toxicity score on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Cosmetics Database - however I may be one of the rare few who happen to not have the good fortune to enjoy this product like everyone else, because the honey content triggers allergic reaction in me</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good natural facial mosturizer for a while and found this one highly rated in the EWG skin database.</li>
            <li>I have never tried bee pollen before so it should be interesting to see the long term results.</li>
            <li>I can apply this cream in the morning and go all day long, unless I take a second shower and my skin feels good.  </li>
            <li>so it is purely for the purpose of moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li>First of all I&#x27;m older, over 70</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t even have very oily skin</li>
            <li>This is very oily on my skin, not creamy.</li>
            <li>I then add drops of Eminence Herbal Recovery Oil, Mogador Argan Oil, Tamanu Oil and stir it really well.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy, so I am careful not to get it in my hair while it soaks in, but I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a facial cream that really moisturized my face, but wasn&#x27;t full of harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>so it is extra special.</li>
            <li>The first 12 hours of using this cream, I was perfectly ok, but 12 hours later my face started develop light tingling / itch, pink spots; dryness and wrinkling then occurred for the subsequent 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>My fine lines have almost completely disappeared and I&#x27;ve only been using it twice a day for 5 days now.</li>
            <li>Will decently restock here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like Honey Girl Organic creme because it is all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>Make sure to evenly distribute the product and work it into your skin, dotting a few drops under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice thick consistency and &amp;#34;soaks&amp;#34; in well.</li>
            <li>This is a very rich cream with a fluffy texture.  </li>
            <li>Be careful because this product may be too rich for the skin under your eye.</li>
            <li>I live in California</li>
            <li>As a person with intense chemical sensitivities, I have a hard time finding healthy and beauty aid products that I can tolerate.  </li>
            <li>The oils thin out the product just enough that it easily glides onto my skin and this combination has worked well for me for many years now.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smell and picky about consistency of face creams.</li>
            <li>I find that by using less product and working it into the skin, it does not leave my face oily and my foundation goes on velvety smooth.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I sampled the regular version of this which was very STINKY.</li>
            <li>: I really wanted to like this product, and I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it DEFINITELY DOES hydrate.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even bother my sensitive eyelids.</li>
            <li>but I think this one does so far.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cream that will give the same results without so much oil involved.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels moisturized &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, so I apply a little more than needed and massage</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and cannot wear commercial face lotions or creams because I break out from the chemicals that are in these products.</li>
            <li>According to the Environmental Working Group, this particular cream received an overall score of 0, which indicates it has extremely low ingredient concerns.</li>
            <li>With my menopause challenged skin, I desperately needed some type of chemical free moisturizer and was fortunate enough to be introduced to the Honey Girl product line.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrances, but this had what I can only describe as a &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>At night I apply the Honey Girl Organics Extra Sensitive night cream.  </li>
            <li>do not have sensitive skin, but bought this instead of the &amp;#34;Non Extra Sensitive&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I found this cream- for Extra Sensitive Skin in a local Marshalls store and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I now use several of their products, including this Extra Sensitive Face and Eye Creme.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this eye cream above any other major brand.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin (very dry, with excema from allergies).</li>

            <li> I now use several of their products, including this Extra Sensitive Face and Eye Creme.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this eye cream above any other major brand.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin (very dry, with excema from allergies).</li>
            <li> This product is very thick so the first thing I do whenever I open a new jar is to thoroughly stir it, then scoop around 1/3 of the jar and into another jar.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and oddly enough there is only one conventional lotion that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li> It is very soothing and moisturizing, so just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Its thick but very creamy and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and when &#x27;the coast was clear&#x27; 2 weeks later I tried it again, alas the same reaction recurred.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for those with extremely dry skin!</li>
            <li> and my skin is very dry.  </li>
            <li> I had some of this cream under my sink which I had purchased earlier as a moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t work out for my skin (a little too shiny).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and sinks into the skin</li>
            <li> I have been trying numerous eye creams, (Dr Perricone, Nuxe, Bioelements, La Roche Posay, Rexaline) with very little results.</li>
            <li> The trick is to use very little product on oily areas, such as apples of the cheek, chin or forehead.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my hypersensitive skin and improves the quality of all of my other products.  </li>
            <li> I tend to shy away from creams that are oily, and this is an oily cream and will separate in the jar, however, I have noticed a real difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> so we have a dry climate and lots of sun shine, this combo sucks the moisture out of your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit on a thick side when applying it, so I apply it immediately after shower when my skin is not so dry.  </li>
            <li> However, if you do, apply it with little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased very expensive creams for dry skin and had to apply them several times a day.  </li>
            <li> Too bad I paid so much to learn that lesson.</li>
            <li> Just use a small amount and it does wonders.  </li>
            <li> ---It just isn&#x27;t compatible with my skin in particular &#x3D;/.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an organic face cream that fits all my criteria</li>
            <li> Even though its slightly thick, it doesnt make my face look oily.</li>
            <li> It nourishes, it&#x27;s heavy and it hydrates like crazy.</li>

            <li> Makes my skin so soft and silky. I love this. Only downside is I need more!</li>
            <li> Excellent to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I found this cream- for Extra Sensitive Skin in a local Marshalls store and decided to try it. I love it!!  After application my skin feels velvety, and it looks hydrated. Both I and my daughter use it. It&#x27;s a little bit on a thick side when applying it, so I apply it immediately after shower when my skin is not so dry.  Highly recommended!!! Will decently restock here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I only use this- ever!</li>
            <li> The unscented smells great; light and natural. It has a nice thick consistency and &amp;#34;soaks&amp;#34; in well. I sampled the regular version of this which was very STINKY. I am sensitive to fragrances, but this had what I can only describe as a &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34; scent. I liked it otherwise, but could not use it. So I was happy to find this Extra Sensitive version. My skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I found this product when I was on vacation; The Big Island.  First of all I&#x27;m older, over 70+ and my skin is very dry.  I can apply this cream in the morning and go all day long, unless I take a second shower and my skin feels good.  At night I apply the Honey Girl Organics Extra Sensitive night cream.  In the past I&#x27;ve purchased very expensive creams for dry skin and had to apply them several times a day.  I live in California so we have a dry climate and lots of sun shine, this combo sucks the moisture out of your skin.  Honey Girl has worked for me.</li>
            <li> (Female writing on my husband&#x27;s account): I really wanted to like this product, and I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because it DEFINITELY DOES hydrate. However, I don&#x27;t even have very oily skin and this makes my face so shiny and greasy feeling most of the day, along with making me break out with acne on my chin and jaw almost constantly, that I just can&#x27;t continue to use it....I won&#x27;t downgrade it too much though because I think it&#x27;s a great product with good ingredients---It just isn&#x27;t compatible with my skin in particular &#x3D;/. I&#x27;d recommend it for those with extremely dry skin! I&#x27;ll just use the rest of the jar on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin (very dry, with excema from allergies). This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found by far. Doesn&#x27;t even bother my sensitive eyelids. Organic ingredients. Couldn&#x27;t be a better product</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cannot wear commercial face lotions or creams because I break out from the chemicals that are in these products. This face cream is awesome. It is made from natural/organic products without essential oils so it is purely for the purpose of moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li> I like that it has olive oil as a primary ingredient. I used to mix olive oil with a moisturizer. Now I use this instead. Great that it has all natural ingredients which will moisturize and benefit your skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> Was/am looking for something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; &amp; good for aging skin. This is just too greasy for my liking.</li>
            <li> I feel very encouraged by the very positive reviews on this product and its low toxicity score on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Cosmetics Database - however I may be one of the rare few who happen to not have the good fortune to enjoy this product like everyone else, because the honey content triggers allergic reaction in me (I am prone to allergies from pollen). The first 12 hours of using this cream, I was perfectly ok, but 12 hours later my face started develop light tingling / itch, pink spots; dryness and wrinkling then occurred for the subsequent 2-3 days. I stopped using it and when &#x27;the coast was clear&#x27; 2 weeks later I tried it again, alas the same reaction recurred. My doctor&#x27;s view is that I have allergic reaction to the ingredients. So - again I believe this is a nice product and it can work for everyone else, but this sharing hopes to help those with allergies to pollen.</li>
            <li> Be careful because this product may be too rich for the skin under your eye. It gave me milia under my eye. But on the rest of my face it is a wonderful product. It does a great job with moisturizing and plumping. People always think I am 21 and I am 28 so it must me doing something right. ;)</li>
            <li> This is very oily on my skin, not creamy. Wish I had known that because oily moisturizers make my skin break out. Too bad I paid so much to learn that lesson. I am sure it is fine otherwise as I really couldn&#x27;t wear it to find out if it worked.</li>
            <li> I just got it and I love it. Its thick but very creamy and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me. I am very sensitive to smell and picky about consistency of face creams. Best of all its doesnt bother my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s hard to find an organic face cream that fits all my criteria but I think this one does so far. Now I just have to wait and see if it keeps my skin soft and smooth like my grape seed oil does. I was looking for a cream that will give the same results without so much oil involved. I have never tried bee pollen before so it should be interesting to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> I have been trying numerous eye creams, (Dr Perricone, Nuxe, Bioelements, La Roche Posay, Rexaline) with very little results. I had some of this cream under my sink which I had purchased earlier as a moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t work out for my skin (a little too shiny). But, I am so happy I didn&#x27;t throw this away! I didn&#x27;t notice that it was an eye cream too. Omgoodness, this is the best eye cream I have ever used! My fine lines have almost completely disappeared and I&#x27;ve only been using it twice a day for 5 days now. I am super impressed and can&#x27;t believe I had this gem in my possession for so long without knowing how great of a product this is. Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich cream with a fluffy texture.  I tend to shy away from creams that are oily, and this is an oily cream and will separate in the jar, however, I have noticed a real difference in the texture of my skin.  The trick is to use very little product on oily areas, such as apples of the cheek, chin or forehead.  Make sure to evenly distribute the product and work it into your skin, dotting a few drops under the eyes.  I find that by using less product and working it into the skin, it does not leave my face oily and my foundation goes on velvety smooth.  If there is any excess, I simply blot it with a tissue.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my hypersensitive skin and improves the quality of all of my other products.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like Honey Girl Organic creme because it is all natural and organic. It is very soothing and moisturizing, so just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As a person with intense chemical sensitivities, I have a hard time finding healthy and beauty aid products that I can tolerate.  With my menopause challenged skin, I desperately needed some type of chemical free moisturizer and was fortunate enough to be introduced to the Honey Girl product line.  I now use several of their products, including this Extra Sensitive Face and Eye Creme.  This product is very thick so the first thing I do whenever I open a new jar is to thoroughly stir it, then scoop around 1/3 of the jar and into another jar.  I then add drops of Eminence Herbal Recovery Oil, Mogador Argan Oil, Tamanu Oil and stir it really well. The oils thin out the product just enough that it easily glides onto my skin and this combination has worked well for me for many years now. I can&#x27;t recommend Honey Girl highly enough...if you like this product, then check out their Facial Scrub and also their Facial Cleanser Makeup Remover.</li>
            <li> I ran out of first container, and I will re-order it, again. I did not try the xtra-sensitive, though, and I think I will try it, now. I highly recommend this eye cream above any other major brand. It lasts about 18-months depending on amount applied.</li>
            <li> I love this face and eye cream. I was looking for a facial cream that really moisturized my face, but wasn&#x27;t full of harmful chemicals. According to the Environmental Working Group, this particular cream received an overall score of 0, which indicates it has extremely low ingredient concerns. It is a bit greasy, so I am careful not to get it in my hair while it soaks in, but I love the way it makes my skin look and feel. Kind of pricy, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to switch over to more natural and vegan products.  Although this is not vegan it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found so far.  My skin is very sensitive and oddly enough there is only one conventional lotion that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out.  I&#x27;ve been trying to remove that from my routine and this is so so good.  It&#x27;s moisturizing and sinks into the skin it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film.  Just use a small amount and it does wonders.  I even use this on my lips.  I am truly enamored with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older, I&#x27;m drier and  I used to be a top model and know products like nobody&#x27;s business. I also have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I friggin love this product. I&#x27;ve passed it on to my gay makeup artist friends who slather their faces with it like I do. It nourishes, it&#x27;s heavy and it hydrates like crazy. This is great for in the house and at night. There isn&#x27;t a SPF... but if you&#x27;re needing deep hydration, this is the best cream I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> I love this mosturizer! I have been looking for a good natural facial mosturizer for a while and found this one highly rated in the EWG skin database. Thought to give it a try (as its safe anyways) and it really works. I have very dry skin, so I apply a little more than needed and massage well to let it absorb. Even though its slightly thick, it doesnt make my face look oily. However, if you do, apply it with little water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have sensitive skin, but bought this instead of the &amp;#34;Non Extra Sensitive&amp;#34; version as its more natural. I am going to stick to this mosturizer forever :) I gifted to my mom for her wrinkles, yet to see results.</li>
            <li> In love with this cream !! This is made for sensitive skin. My skin feels moisturized &amp; soft. Definitely will be buying again and again. It&#x27;s also made in Hawaii so it is extra special.</li>
