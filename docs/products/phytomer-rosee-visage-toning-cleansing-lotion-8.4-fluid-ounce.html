            <li> its a great toning lotion especially without alcohol</li>
            <li> Love the product. Love the price.</li>
            <li> Product took WAY TOO LONG to get here.  It comes from the UK.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell as good as others I&#x27;ve gotten before which makes me doubt it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this stuff for years.  So gentle and takes off all my makeup, including mascara</li>
            <li> Smell is.. Rose???&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like smell but, everything is good:)</li>
            <li> arrived earlier than promised. Same great product that I love, for less than I can find nearby.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  It is a perfect toner for sensitive skin.  It is not drying at all.  A true quality product that is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I recently went to a spa to have a facial and they used all phytomer products. Being a fair gal who tends to get facial redness I really liked this toner that they used one me. It does not dry out my skin like other toners I have used and it really draws out the impurities, gets my skin really clean, and tames my facial blotches. Not to mention the smell is great, not too strong and does not smell like chemicals. Plus there is no alcohol!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I have used product for several years now &amp; will continue.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and a great cleanser/toner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Phytomer for 10 years, and I love their product line. This batch did not have the same wonderful fragrance as the ones in the past, but as a toner it does a wonderful job</li>
            <li> Love the phytomer products have been using for almost 7 years.  The scent is heaven and does a nice refreshing cleaning/toning job especially on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have been searching for a toner that doesn&#x27;t cause redness.  I&#x27;ve used Rosee Visage for about a month.  It cleans without stripping my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t cause redness.  There&#x27;s a very light scent of roses.  Usually I&#x27;m sensitive to scented products, but this scent is so light that I am able to use it.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like it should. Sort of reminds me of roses that wilted and went bad, which is not like the product I purchased at my facially which smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Smells like roses.  It is light and fragrant.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for year now, and i suggest everyone try it! great for all skin types! thank you</li>
            <li> This was initially recommended to me by my anesthetician.  It is a fabulous product.  With eczema and dry skin, this cleansing lotion leaves my face feeling refreshed.  I bought this for Christmas presents for my family also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keri, RN</li>
            <li> I love it.  It really works well for me.</li>
            <li> I am a 38-year-old woman with sensitive skin and rosacea who has been using this product for years because it was recommended by my esthetician.  It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin and takes off any makeup left behind by my cleanser.  I can even use it to take off any remaining eye makeup.  Does not leave my skin tight or dry and has a very appealing light rosy smell.</li>
            <li> I received this item super fast they even package it really good as well.&lt;br /&gt;I highley recommend this product I can tell a difference in my face when I use it or not</li>
            <li> Better than Clinique. Doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel dried out and gets any residual dirt or make-up you might have missed. A little goes a long way so it lasts for months.</li>
            <li> It is nice to get a product you asked for on time and to receive it in the mail, saving you a trip from going to the salon!</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  I use this product twice a day and will never use another toner.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dried out.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily as a toner and to get any cleanser residue off of my face.  I think it works well.</li>
            <li> I love this product, does not have the harshness, alcohol in particular, of other facial cleansers, but it&lt;br /&gt;totally gets you face clean. Also, excellent eye make-up remover w/out ripping your eyeball out. Nice smelling too-soft rose scent.</li>
            <li> This product claims to clean as well as tones after washing face. It is very expensive at beauty and spa stores.  It&#x27;s much more reasonable here on Amazon.  I like the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LOVES THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> My favorite toner. Face feels refreshed and clean after each use.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin clean without any drying.  I have used Phytomer for three years and it has improved my skin~~leaves it clean and soft with no drying.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  Phytomer is some of the best face products out there!</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to love this line, but as a thirty something with occasionally acne who likes to put on a fair amount of make-up this line does not work to remove my make-up at all.  I end up going over my face with this toner several times and it still comes up not clean on the cotton ball, so I bummed out!!  It&#x27;s not cheap either.</li>
            <li> Keep me face clean and not too dry.  It has great refreshing rosy smell.  I feel softness on my facial skin.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Best toner I have ever found.  It is also a cleaner.  I use a cotton moistened with this toner and it will gently remove all of my makeup.  And, the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I learned about this product getting a facial at a spa near my home. I&#x27;ve been using the product for two months and people notice the youthful appearance of my skin I am in my early 40s and I look great!!</li>
