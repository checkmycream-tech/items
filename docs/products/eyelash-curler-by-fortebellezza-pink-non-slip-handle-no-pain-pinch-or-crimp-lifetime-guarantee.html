            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality, and am so glad I purchased.</li>
            <li>Overall, this would make an excellent curler and itâ€™s fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This is by far the BEST eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>This being said, I love it when I find an eyelash curler which doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids and is effective in curling my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also came with TWO eyelash cushions so no worries about finding a suitable replacement pad.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use!</li>
            <li>:) The ForteBellezza Eyelash curler didn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids which by far is the best feature since I wouldn&#x27;t use an eyelash curler which pinches.</li>
            <li>received this product free to test in exchange for my honest review, however all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>, yes there are many nice features of this curler but the color is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It has such an amazing grip that I have experienced zero slip-ups!</li>
            <li>I  love that the curlers have a latch/hook between the handles to keep them in place.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My $2 elf eyelash curler of 4 years worked better..</li>
            <li>It must be softer rubber than most.</li>
            <li>Really a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, my eyelashes look amazing after use.</li>
            <li>:) I also love how lightweight it is making it more easier to handle and use.</li>
            <li>It makes me look more awake and girly.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I do love the non-slip grip aspect of this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>I have owned many eyelashes curler&#x27;s throughout my lifetime, even the heated ones.</li>
            <li>pair.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute.</li>
            <li>So girly! :)</li>
            <li>They were more curled than ever.</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is such a great eyelash curler!</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
            <li>I was pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way it curls the lashes.</li>
            <li>(I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li>so when you&#x27;re curling they stay into place and another thing is that you need to get familiar how to curl and release because they stay into place for a nice curl</li>
            <li>Super cute color too!</li>
            <li>This one seems to be pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>:) So with these positive experience with the ForteBellezza Eyelash Curler, I would recommend this to anyone who needs an eyelash curler which is effective and doesn&#x27;t pinch. :)</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this eyelash curler to anyone who longs for longer more beautiful lashes, you won&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For that very reason, ForteBellezza eyelash curler has become my new best friend!</li>
            <li>So, cool!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the shape causes it to position itself better, or if the silicone grippy thing is significant, how it applies</li>
            <li>I used this curler about five times and although it curled easily I still found that it pinched and caused loss of lashes.</li>
            <li>This is well put together and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>When your done using it it has a latch, so that you can keep the handle together for easy storage.</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler was easy to hold and easy to curl my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>an avid blogger/product tester, I was sent a free Fortebelleza Eyelash Curler in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>These fit comfortably in my hands and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>the grips are small so best for little hands and the top of the curler is smooth, perfect for the eyeliner trick.</li>
            <li>This comes with 2 cushions and the grips are really comfortable.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>and I was really happy to see that they actually worked for me</li>
            <li>It was sturdy and felt comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>but the product itself is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product through the company for free, but this is 100%</li>
            <li>but I experienced pain and pinching (opposite of the hype) when I used this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li>This comes with 2 cushions and the grips are really comfortable.</li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>This is very sturdy, the clips at the bottom are perfect so the curler doesn&#x27;t snap open, my eyelashes stay curled for around 2 hours</li>
            <li>and this one is by far the most effective one.</li>
            <li>I am so excited that I found this they really are Amazing .....</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite eyelash curler!</li>
            <li>is the packaging super cute &amp; fun</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try them out.</li>
            <li>I am excited that I got this item to review.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be happy with this eyelash curler once you&#x27;ve tried it and see how long and curled your lashes get.</li>
            <li>I was able to review this product as an avid blogger.</li>
            <li>No cutting and no crimping!</li>
            <li>I am excited that I got this item to review.</li>
            <li>I found the rubber is actually better on ForteBellezza eyelasher color vs. the cheap one I had, but I have to say what really set this curler about is the closure latch.</li>
            <li>After having read all those great reviews, had high expectations, but didn&#x27;t live up to the reviews.</li>
            <li>On top of that, after about 10 minutes, I would need to curl again because the other curlers just didn&#x27;t curl my lashes good</li>
            <li>Surprisingly , this is much better than the  other product.</li>
            <li>I also like the lock at the handle since I can just lock the lash curler to save space specially when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li>, it feels like it was made special just for you because it fits your eyelashes so well.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes get turned right up when I use this product!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is a great pink color either.</li>
            <li>I love having long eyelashes with a nice curl.</li>
            <li>I love the cute packaging and cute pink non-slip handle.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go the entire day.</li>
            <li>but I loved that extra feature.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I knew to use it on clean lashes BEFORE applying mascara because I&#x27;d heard some horror stories.</li>
            <li>really does not hurt one bit when I curl them, which is also nice, because I have pinched my lid before, with one of my older pairs.</li>
            <li>yeah---you can also use a hair dryer on a really low setting to heat your curler and LET IT COOL a lot but still slightly warm.</li>
            <li>So simple and easy to use with stunning results.</li>
            <li>so was VERY surprised at how comfortable, sturdy, &amp; yes, pinch free, this product is.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little tool.  </li>
            <li>Loved the girly pink color but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I love the color of the ForteBellezza Eyelash Curler since I love almost anything pink.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even say enough nice things about it.</li>
            <li>eyelash curler works way better than my old dollar store curler, which might I add</li>
            <li>The groove in the rubber piece is so deep, that my lashes kind of get stuck in there, and I cannot curl my lashes close to the root, or it pinches my lid.  </li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li>Who would go through the pinching pain of an eyelash curler right?</li>
            <li>But some people say beauty is pain, right?</li>
            <li>My fingers fit easily into the grips but there was not much extra room for my thumb</li>
            <li>However, this eyelash curler I have found is not only easy to use, but comfortable to use as well.</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job, but I haven&#x27;t found anything particular special about it worth the price tag.  </li>
            <li>I have used them a few times and the more I use them the more I like them.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this eyelash curler, not only</li>
            <li>I have one eyelash curler that I purchased years ago from the dollar store (never used it), and what set these two apart is the closure latch (which I love) and the rubbers for curling the lashes (it even come with a extra).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice touch and the handles are pink.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is exactly about this curler</li>
            <li>My eyes look more open and brighter, and my eyelashes so much longer.</li>
            <li>I have constant issues with eyelash curlers either breaking, not working properly or easily losing them...</li>
            <li>/&gt;These not only do the job easily every time but</li>
            <li>However, it seemed easy enough</li>
            <li>To be entirely honest, I&#x27;ve never been the eyelash curler type because I&#x27;m super duper clumsy.</li>
            <li>The handles are very comfortable and they pop out at you with the pink color.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes had a nice little curl to them.</li>
            <li>So, I received the Forte Bellezza Eyelash Curlers  at a reasonable cost</li>
            <li>I love pink by the way.</li>
            <li>I would recommend  this product for anyone that wants a quality eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>They worked really well and are sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>These are very well made and do not hurt or pull my lashed.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Very disappointed...can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li>so 3$  wasn&#x27;t expecting much-</li>
            <li>You really just need to try it out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>It just makes it so much easier to store or to carry with you.  </li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t allow for my entire lash to fit into the curler.</li>
            <li>my eye very well.</li>
            <li>I think the prize is reasonable and I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with my lashes after using my Pink Eyelash Curler from ForteBellezza.</li>
            <li>Can I just say that the ergonomic handle is absolutely something I didn&#x27;t know</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier.  </li>
            <li>also really  like that the name is on the curler.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pair curled my lashes really well.</li>
            <li>I love that you can latch it closed when not using it.</li>
            <li>The pink handles are kinda cute too.</li>
            <li>Very well made and works just like a gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are made really well.</li>
            <li>It is pink and cute.</li>
            <li>Worked really well and is sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>Almost like old rubber, it got stuch to my lashes!!!</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use, and only takes about ten seconds to do.</li>
            <li>love the pink!</li>
            <li>It curls so much better than other curlers.  </li>
            <li>I had been unable to find one that I loved until now!</li>
            <li>Yes, I recommend these if you want pain free, gorgeous, and dramatic lashes!  </li>
            <li>Alas, ForteBellezza clearly stated that fact right on their handy packaging!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try this particular</li>
            <li>and I particularly like to try eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li>After just 2 months, I had to use the second rubber refill because the one it came with quickly wore out</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll return to my former eyelash curler that lasted about 10-12 months even though I was looking for a better solution to that one since the design of that one is entirely plastic</li>
            <li>the Revlon I buy at Walmart for only $2.99 works better and last longer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend checking it out.</li>
            <li>It also has an extra eyelash piece, just in case you ruin the first one from too much mascara getting on it.</li>
            <li>Just add a few coats of your favorite mascara AFTER curling your lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the curler for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;m not liking it any better.  </li>
            <li>I am always trying new things</li>
            <li>This is my new go to lash curler.</li>
            <li>Arrived well packed in new condition.</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a new Eyelash Curler</li>
            <li>the An eye lash curler is an essential in every woman&#x27;s makeup bag so why not let it be cute and pink</li>
            <li>It truly has a no-pinch design which is important because I had one in the past that actually pinched my eyelashes right off!</li>
            <li>I have small lashes but this curler does make them more noticeable and they stay curled for a while.</li>
            <li>I actually think it did a really quality job curling my lashes, and for my husband to notice says something!</li>
            <li>I thought they were all pretty generic until I found this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what, in the design, makes this so much superior to other eyelash curlers-  </li>
            <li>not worth the money is only good until the rubber gets damage and that happens pretty fast if you use it daily mine only lasted for 1 week not worth the money</li>
            <li>It curls fine but in the middle of curling my curler closed on me( the clasp hooked on)</li>
            <li>I like how quickly my lashes curl and how this doesn&#x27;t tug at them like other products do.</li>
            <li>Just when you think that it would be hard to build a better mousetrap...</li>
            <li>Aside from that, I feel it is pretty much on par with your average eye curler.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so simple to use and comfortable with the wide handles.</li>
            <li>It didnâ€™t pinch my lids and gave me a natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>But they far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I used this after a very expensive eye lash curler that constantly pinched me and was surprised how much better and more affordable this one is.</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised at first, to see that the cushion pad was not already on it when I received this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using it by pinching on the bare metal.</li>
            <li>The Forte Bellezza Pink Lash Curler gives your lashes a real curl.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old curler this morning.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to go back to my old curler.</li>
            <li>this eyelash curler comes with a latch that keeps the handles closed when youâ€™re not using them so they don&#x27;t take up much space and are easier to store.</li>
            <li>The pink adds that extra girly touch that some of us really like.</li>
            <li>, in the past I have struggled to find the right eyelash curler that doesn&#x27;t pull out my lashes, let me tell you that Forte Bellezza eyelash curler has a non slip handle</li>

            <li> This will come in handy when I travel.  </li>
            <li> It is really nice and does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality, and am so glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> Overall, this would make an excellent curler and itâ€™s fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This being said, I love it when I find an eyelash curler which doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids and is effective in curling my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also came with TWO eyelash cushions so no worries about finding a suitable replacement pad.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use!</li>
            <li> :) The ForteBellezza Eyelash curler didn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids which by far is the best feature since I wouldn&#x27;t use an eyelash curler which pinches.</li>
            <li> received this product free to test in exchange for my honest review, however all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> , yes there are many nice features of this curler but the color is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It has such an amazing grip that I have experienced zero slip-ups!</li>
            <li> I  love that the curlers have a latch/hook between the handles to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> My $2 elf eyelash curler of 4 years worked better..</li>
            <li> It must be softer rubber than most.</li>
            <li> Really a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, my eyelashes look amazing after use.</li>
            <li> :) I also love how lightweight it is making it more easier to handle and use.</li>
            <li> It makes me look more awake and girly.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I do love the non-slip grip aspect of this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> I have owned many eyelashes curler&#x27;s throughout my lifetime, even the heated ones.</li>
            <li> pair.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute.</li>
            <li> So girly! :)</li>
            <li> They were more curled than ever.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is such a great eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
            <li> I was pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way it curls the lashes.</li>
            <li> (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> so when you&#x27;re curling they stay into place and another thing is that you need to get familiar how to curl and release because they stay into place for a nice curl</li>
            <li> Super cute color too!</li>
            <li> This one seems to be pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> :) So with these positive experience with the ForteBellezza Eyelash Curler, I would recommend this to anyone who needs an eyelash curler which is effective and doesn&#x27;t pinch. :)</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this eyelash curler to anyone who longs for longer more beautiful lashes, you won&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For that very reason, ForteBellezza eyelash curler has become my new best friend!</li>
            <li> So, cool!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the shape causes it to position itself better, or if the silicone grippy thing is significant, how it applies</li>
            <li> I used this curler about five times and although it curled easily I still found that it pinched and caused loss of lashes.</li>
            <li> This is well put together and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> When your done using it it has a latch, so that you can keep the handle together for easy storage.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler was easy to hold and easy to curl my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> an avid blogger/product tester, I was sent a free Fortebelleza Eyelash Curler in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> These fit comfortably in my hands and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> the grips are small so best for little hands and the top of the curler is smooth, perfect for the eyeliner trick.</li>
            <li> This comes with 2 cushions and the grips are really comfortable.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> and I was really happy to see that they actually worked for me</li>
            <li> It was sturdy and felt comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> but the product itself is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product through the company for free, but this is 100%</li>
            <li> but I experienced pain and pinching (opposite of the hype) when I used this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> This comes with 2 cushions and the grips are really comfortable.</li>
            <li> Such a great product.</li>
            <li> This is very sturdy, the clips at the bottom are perfect so the curler doesn&#x27;t snap open, my eyelashes stay curled for around 2 hours</li>
            <li> and this one is by far the most effective one.</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I found this they really are Amazing .....</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> is the packaging super cute &amp; fun</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try them out.</li>
            <li> I am excited that I got this item to review.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be happy with this eyelash curler once you&#x27;ve tried it and see how long and curled your lashes get.</li>
            <li> I was able to review this product as an avid blogger.</li>
            <li> No cutting and no crimping!</li>
            <li> I am excited that I got this item to review.</li>
            <li> I found the rubber is actually better on ForteBellezza eyelasher color vs. the cheap one I had, but I have to say what really set this curler about is the closure latch.</li>
            <li> After having read all those great reviews, had high expectations, but didn&#x27;t live up to the reviews.</li>
            <li> On top of that, after about 10 minutes, I would need to curl again because the other curlers just didn&#x27;t curl my lashes good</li>
            <li> Surprisingly , this is much better than the  other product.</li>
            <li> I also like the lock at the handle since I can just lock the lash curler to save space specially when I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
            <li> , it feels like it was made special just for you because it fits your eyelashes so well.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes get turned right up when I use this product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is a great pink color either.</li>
            <li> I love having long eyelashes with a nice curl.</li>
            <li> I love the cute packaging and cute pink non-slip handle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go the entire day.</li>
            <li> but I loved that extra feature.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I knew to use it on clean lashes BEFORE applying mascara because I&#x27;d heard some horror stories.</li>
            <li> really does not hurt one bit when I curl them, which is also nice, because I have pinched my lid before, with one of my older pairs.</li>
            <li> yeah---you can also use a hair dryer on a really low setting to heat your curler and LET IT COOL a lot but still slightly warm.</li>
            <li> So simple and easy to use with stunning results.</li>
            <li> so was VERY surprised at how comfortable, sturdy, &amp; yes, pinch free, this product is.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little tool.  </li>
            <li> Loved the girly pink color but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I love the color of the ForteBellezza Eyelash Curler since I love almost anything pink.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even say enough nice things about it.</li>
            <li> eyelash curler works way better than my old dollar store curler, which might I add</li>
            <li> The groove in the rubber piece is so deep, that my lashes kind of get stuck in there, and I cannot curl my lashes close to the root, or it pinches my lid.  </li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Who would go through the pinching pain of an eyelash curler right?</li>
            <li> But some people say beauty is pain, right?</li>
            <li> My fingers fit easily into the grips but there was not much extra room for my thumb</li>
            <li> However, this eyelash curler I have found is not only easy to use, but comfortable to use as well.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, but I haven&#x27;t found anything particular special about it worth the price tag.  </li>
            <li> I have used them a few times and the more I use them the more I like them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eyelash curler, not only</li>
            <li> I have one eyelash curler that I purchased years ago from the dollar store (never used it), and what set these two apart is the closure latch (which I love) and the rubbers for curling the lashes (it even come with a extra).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice touch and the handles are pink.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is exactly about this curler</li>
            <li> My eyes look more open and brighter, and my eyelashes so much longer.</li>
            <li> I have constant issues with eyelash curlers either breaking, not working properly or easily losing them...</li>
            <li> /&gt;These not only do the job easily every time but</li>
            <li> However, it seemed easy enough</li>
            <li> To be entirely honest, I&#x27;ve never been the eyelash curler type because I&#x27;m super duper clumsy.</li>
            <li> The handles are very comfortable and they pop out at you with the pink color.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes had a nice little curl to them.</li>
            <li> So, I received the Forte Bellezza Eyelash Curlers  at a reasonable cost</li>
            <li> I love pink by the way.</li>
            <li> I would recommend  this product for anyone that wants a quality eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> They worked really well and are sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> These are very well made and do not hurt or pull my lashed.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> so 3$  wasn&#x27;t expecting much-</li>
            <li> You really just need to try it out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> It just makes it so much easier to store or to carry with you.  </li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t allow for my entire lash to fit into the curler.</li>
            <li> my eye very well.</li>
            <li> I think the prize is reasonable and I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with my lashes after using my Pink Eyelash Curler from ForteBellezza.</li>
            <li> Can I just say that the ergonomic handle is absolutely something I didn&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier.  </li>
            <li> also really  like that the name is on the curler.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pair curled my lashes really well.</li>
            <li> I love that you can latch it closed when not using it.</li>
            <li> The pink handles are kinda cute too.</li>
            <li> Very well made and works just like a gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are made really well.</li>
            <li> It is pink and cute.</li>
            <li> Worked really well and is sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> Almost like old rubber, it got stuch to my lashes!!!</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use, and only takes about ten seconds to do.</li>
            <li> love the pink!</li>
            <li> It curls so much better than other curlers.  </li>
            <li> I had been unable to find one that I loved until now!</li>
            <li> Yes, I recommend these if you want pain free, gorgeous, and dramatic lashes!  </li>
            <li> Alas, ForteBellezza clearly stated that fact right on their handy packaging!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try this particular</li>
            <li> and I particularly like to try eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> After just 2 months, I had to use the second rubber refill because the one it came with quickly wore out</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll return to my former eyelash curler that lasted about 10-12 months even though I was looking for a better solution to that one since the design of that one is entirely plastic</li>
            <li> the Revlon I buy at Walmart for only $2.99 works better and last longer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend checking it out.</li>
            <li> It also has an extra eyelash piece, just in case you ruin the first one from too much mascara getting on it.</li>
            <li> Just add a few coats of your favorite mascara AFTER curling your lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the curler for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;m not liking it any better.  </li>
            <li> I am always trying new things</li>
            <li> This is my new go to lash curler.</li>
            <li> Arrived well packed in new condition.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a new Eyelash Curler</li>
            <li> the An eye lash curler is an essential in every woman&#x27;s makeup bag so why not let it be cute and pink</li>
            <li> It truly has a no-pinch design which is important because I had one in the past that actually pinched my eyelashes right off!</li>
            <li> I have small lashes but this curler does make them more noticeable and they stay curled for a while.</li>
            <li> I actually think it did a really quality job curling my lashes, and for my husband to notice says something!</li>
            <li> I thought they were all pretty generic until I found this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what, in the design, makes this so much superior to other eyelash curlers-  </li>
            <li> not worth the money is only good until the rubber gets damage and that happens pretty fast if you use it daily mine only lasted for 1 week not worth the money</li>
            <li> It curls fine but in the middle of curling my curler closed on me( the clasp hooked on)</li>
            <li> I like how quickly my lashes curl and how this doesn&#x27;t tug at them like other products do.</li>
            <li> Just when you think that it would be hard to build a better mousetrap...</li>
            <li> Aside from that, I feel it is pretty much on par with your average eye curler.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so simple to use and comfortable with the wide handles.</li>
            <li> It didnâ€™t pinch my lids and gave me a natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> But they far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I used this after a very expensive eye lash curler that constantly pinched me and was surprised how much better and more affordable this one is.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised at first, to see that the cushion pad was not already on it when I received this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it by pinching on the bare metal.</li>
            <li> The Forte Bellezza Pink Lash Curler gives your lashes a real curl.</li>
            <li> I went back to my old curler this morning.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to go back to my old curler.</li>
            <li> this eyelash curler comes with a latch that keeps the handles closed when youâ€™re not using them so they don&#x27;t take up much space and are easier to store.</li>
            <li> The pink adds that extra girly touch that some of us really like.</li>
            <li> , in the past I have struggled to find the right eyelash curler that doesn&#x27;t pull out my lashes, let me tell you that Forte Bellezza eyelash curler has a non slip handle</li>
            <li> Just a little trick for those beauty queens out there - Heat them under hot water for a bit, pat them dry and then curl lashes.</li>
            <li> Plus they were soft and not plastic like other curlers.</li>
            <li> Having a latch was a brilliant idea and is what sold me on the product but was very disappointed when it broke off so soon.</li>
            <li> They have only done it one time so probably just loose eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the high reviews on Amazon but after a week or so of using it I began to notice that this products actually rips out a few pieces of my eye lashes every time I use it.</li>
            <li> It also never pinches my eyelids, which is what I was most afraid of.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long that one lasts and I&#x27;ll update my review at that time.</li>
            <li> Forte Bellezza&#x27;s eyelash curler is made sturdy so it will be in your makeup bag for a long long time.  </li>
            <li> This also comes with an extra pink cushion pad for when you need to replace the one youâ€™re using.</li>
            <li> The curl lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> you sent me an extra curling pad if the other ever wears out or something.  </li>
            <li> When I did this I was shocked at the huge curve difference!</li>
            <li> Then almost simultaneously the pink handle cracked and crumbled off one side.</li>
            <li> because they are pink I am yet to lose them (I can see them from a mile</li>
            <li> I really never understood the need for an eyelash curler until now, and that is all due to this review.</li>
            <li> I have short, stumpy lashes and in the past, even with using a lash curler, I still had to apply a ton of coats of mascara to make my lashes even remotely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t blessed with long OR curled lashes so I curl my lashes almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Actually, in my opinion, it&#x27;s no better than any of the others out there on the market.  </li>
            <li> but it DRAMATICALLY out-performs any other I have owned.  </li>
            <li> But ladies, this works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Does not work well at all, in fact can pinch the under-eye area if not used very carefully.</li>
            <li> The little locking lever allows you to keep it cleaner, as the curler pad is locked closed.  </li>
            <li> I have small, round Asian eyes</li>
            <li> I literally clamp down on my lashes one time for 3-5 seconds, then apply one coat of mascara</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even understand how my other one doesn&#x27;t stay even!?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they was just loose ones or what.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was hopeful that it would curl with less discomfort as the inexpensive brands</li>
            <li> Was excited to try this curler due to rave reviews, but I&#x27;m one of the unlucky few that is NOT happy with this product as I&#x27;m having a difficult time curling my lashes.</li>
            <li> so I was a little worried, that I might not do it correctly.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL THOUGH!!!</li>
            <li> It also has not kept my lashed curled for an extended time, and it has pinched my eyelid a few times.</li>
            <li> Both cushion pads were missing.</li>
            <li> I was missing?  </li>
            <li> , did NOT fit the curve of my eyelid so well.</li>
            <li> But they have pulled out a few of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> the metal part (that your eye touches) seems &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; or maybe it is the black rubber part that is thicker?!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable..</li>
            <li> It was just too tall for my small eyes.  </li>
            <li> Really hard to clamp</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;m a CLUMSY person and anything that can make things easier for me (ie.</li>
            <li> That is not a good feeling at all.</li>
            <li> Not great.  </li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> This curler has a locking thing so it doesn&#x27;t get bent or broken in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience painful curling as I did with other curlers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye lash curler that will give me a dramatic curl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with it - I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> needless to say</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get to the base of my lashes and it pinches my eyelid.</li>
            <li> This was also another disappointment.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it pulling out eyelashes or cutting or pinching my eyelids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so crazy about this eyelash curler.  </li>
            <li> I received it a couple of weeks ago but have been sick</li>
            <li> but this was a bad choice :(</li>
            <li> I was terrified and am nervous to use it again :(.</li>
            <li> I also hate when the curler slips and pokes me in the eye.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am always trying new things and I particularly like to try eyelash curlers. Don&#x27;t ask me why, I just do, lol. The design of the curlers makes me want to try it out. So, I received the Forte Bellezza Eyelash Curlers  at a reasonable cost and I was excited to try them out. The handles are very comfortable and they pop out at you with the pink color. I love pink by the way. I  love that the curlers have a latch/hook between the handles to keep them in place. The eyelash curlers did not pinch my eye and it curled it like it was suppose to.  I would recommend  this product for anyone that wants a quality eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> This comes with 2 cushions and the grips are really comfortable. I am excited that I got this item to review. the grips are small so best for little hands and the top of the curler is smooth, perfect for the eyeliner trick. They worked really well and are sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> Meh.  Not great.  It pulls a lot of my eyelashes out when I curl them</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was hopeful that it would curl with less discomfort as the inexpensive brands but it&#x27;s the same as the others. I used this curler about five times and although it curled easily I still found that it pinched and caused loss of lashes. I&#x27;d rather have my lashes than the curl so I won&#x27;t be using this unless its occasionally and I am in no hurry to use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye lash curler that will give me a dramatic curl and I found it!! I love it</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the mac curler and I should have done that, I decided to go with this one instead and regret it. It curls fine but in the middle of curling my curler closed on me( the clasp hooked on) I was terrified and am nervous to use it again :(. Also pulled out some lashes</li>
            <li> My eyelashes get turned right up when I use this product! I like how quickly my lashes curl and how this doesn&#x27;t tug at them like other products do. This is my new go to lash curler. I liked it so much I bought a second one for my daughter! The pink adds that extra girly touch that some of us really like. Great eyelash curler at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT !!!&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t used an eye lash curler for 30 years. These are very well made and do not hurt or pull my lashed. Just a little trick for those beauty queens out there - Heat them under hot water for a bit, pat them dry and then curl lashes. It&#x27;s like using a curling iron on your lashes! Immediately apply mascara  like you would hair spray to keep them curled. Lasts all day. BE CAREFUL THOUGH!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to the high reviews on Amazon but after a week or so of using it I began to notice that this products actually rips out a few pieces of my eye lashes every time I use it. It&#x27;s unbelievable.. My $2 elf eyelash curler of 4 years worked better..</li>
            <li> Really hard to clamp and the curl didn&#x27;t hold like a Revlon curler. Loved the girly pink color but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> After just 2 months, I had to use the second rubber refill because the one it came with quickly wore out and I only use a curler 3 or 4 times each week. It must be softer rubber than most. Then almost simultaneously the pink handle cracked and crumbled off one side. I&#x27;m still using it by pinching on the bare metal. Before this happened, I had purchased a second one for my daughter. We&#x27;ll see how long that one lasts and I&#x27;ll update my review at that time. I guess I&#x27;ll return to my former eyelash curler that lasted about 10-12 months even though I was looking for a better solution to that one since the design of that one is entirely plastic and it eventually cracks at the stress point. It works really well but it&#x27;s more expensive too.</li>
            <li> Works great EXCEPT the closure latch broke approx. a week after purchase. Having a latch was a brilliant idea and is what sold me on the product but was very disappointed when it broke off so soon. Contacted company regarding warranty and received no response. This was also another disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I found this they really are Amazing .....</li>
            <li> Does not work well at all, in fact can pinch the under-eye area if not used very carefully. After having read all those great reviews, had high expectations, but didn&#x27;t live up to the reviews.</li>
            <li> Really a fantastic product!  I love the cute packaging and cute pink non-slip handle. :)  I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;m a CLUMSY person and anything that can make things easier for me (ie. the non-slip handle!) is fantastic!  Keeps my eyelashes curled beautifully throughout the day.  No complaints!  I received this product in exchange for a review; however, opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I recently got to try Forte Bellezza eyelash curler and I was really happy to see that they actually worked for me, in the past I have struggled to find the right eyelash curler that doesn&#x27;t pull out my lashes, let me tell you that Forte Bellezza eyelash curler has a non slip handle so when you&#x27;re curling they stay into place and another thing is that you need to get familiar how to curl and release because they stay into place for a nice curl you&#x27;ll be happy with this eyelash curler once you&#x27;ve tried it and see how long and curled your lashes get.</li>
            <li> The ForteBellezza Eyelash Curler has a great design that makes curling my eyelashes so easy. In fact, I was able to curl them without even looking in the mirror! It truly has a no-pinch design which is important because I had one in the past that actually pinched my eyelashes right off! My fingers fit easily into the grips but there was not much extra room for my thumb so you may have a  bit of difficulty if your thumbs are on the larger size. It came with an extra cushion pad and it also comes with a lifetime, no-question asked money back guarantee! Most importantly, my eyelashes look amazing after use. They are perfectly curled and look like they are full of mascara even before I apply it! It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is a great pink color either. I was able to review this product as an avid blogger.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used! Good cushion pad, nicely fits my hand and moves very easily. It catches and curls my lashes perfectly. Also it doesn&#x27;t slip. I have small lashes but this curler does make them more noticeable and they stay curled for a while. It didnâ€™t pinch my lids and gave me a natural looking lashes. I didn&#x27;t experience painful curling as I did with other curlers. The latch is a nice to have feature for storage between uses. This one seems to be pretty good quality. Definitely worth the money.  Also they have wonderful customer service, highly recommend them! Very happy!</li>
            <li> Arrived well packed in new condition. Was excited to try this curler due to rave reviews, but I&#x27;m one of the unlucky few that is NOT happy with this product as I&#x27;m having a difficult time curling my lashes. It also has not kept my lashed curled for an extended time, and it has pinched my eyelid a few times. It may be that the shape of the curler doesn&#x27;t conform to my eye shape, or perhaps it&#x27;s defective?. Very disappointed...can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This is very sturdy, the clips at the bottom are perfect so the curler doesn&#x27;t snap open, my eyelashes stay curled for around 2 hours, then when I need to reapply it doesn&#x27;t smudge my mascara or pull on my lashes, great product!</li>
            <li> This curler did not pinch when I became close to the eye lid. It was sturdy and felt comfortable in my hand. I used it before applying makeup and then after. I also hate when the curler slips and pokes me in the eye. This curler was sturdy enough to where I could hold it and not poke myself. I also liked that the curler came with addition cushions. The cushions lasted a while and also stayed in place. Plus they were soft and not plastic like other curlers. Overall, this would make an excellent curler and itâ€™s fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t blessed with long OR curled lashes so I curl my lashes almost everyday. This being said, I love it when I find an eyelash curler which doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids and is effective in curling my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love the color of the ForteBellezza Eyelash Curler since I love almost anything pink. :) I also love how lightweight it is making it more easier to handle and use. I also like the lock at the handle since I can just lock the lash curler to save space specially when I&#x27;m traveling. I like the extra cushion pad. :) The ForteBellezza Eyelash curler didn&#x27;t pinch my eyelids which by far is the best feature since I wouldn&#x27;t use an eyelash curler which pinches. Who would go through the pinching pain of an eyelash curler right? I have small, round Asian eyes so this is a plus for me. :) So with these positive experience with the ForteBellezza Eyelash Curler, I would recommend this to anyone who needs an eyelash curler which is effective and doesn&#x27;t pinch. :)</li>
            <li> Got this for the price of shipping... so 3$  wasn&#x27;t expecting much- so was VERY surprised at how comfortable, sturdy, &amp; yes, pinch free, this product is.  the metal part (that your eye touches) seems &amp;#34;fuller&amp;#34; or maybe it is the black rubber part that is thicker?!  I&#x27;m not sure what, in the design, makes this so much superior to other eyelash curlers-  but I am a believer!!</li>
            <li> You know that &amp;#34;lifetime&amp;#34; warranty they mention? Once your curler doesn&#x27;t work they don&#x27;t respond!</li>
            <li> I received this product to test and I&#x27;ve never been happier with a product in my life!I have tested out a ton of eye lash curlers through the years and this one is by far the most effective one. I have short, stumpy lashes and in the past, even with using a lash curler, I still had to apply a ton of coats of mascara to make my lashes even remotely noticeable. On top of that, after about 10 minutes, I would need to curl again because the other curlers just didn&#x27;t curl my lashes good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other brands crimp your lashes which makes them break off and I even had one from another company that actually CUT my lashes. The Forte Bellezza Pink Lash Curler gives your lashes a real curl. No cutting and no crimping! I literally clamp down on my lashes one time for 3-5 seconds, then apply one coat of mascara and I&#x27;m good to go the entire day. No need to recurl through out the day. It makes me look more awake and girly. As a mom of two, I need all the help I can get when it comes to looking awake since I&#x27;m virtually a walking mombie. This product is fantastic! I can&#x27;t even say enough nice things about it. I could be here all day. You really just need to try it out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free to test in exchange for my honest review, however all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I do love the non-slip grip aspect of this eyelash curler.  That&#x27;s a big plus.  Aside from that, I feel it is pretty much on par with your average eye curler.  It does it&#x27;s job, but I haven&#x27;t found anything particular special about it worth the price tag.  Update:  This is pulling out my lashes!  And no, I am not using it after applying mascara.  I have never had this problem with any eyelash curler, even the cheapy ones.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> This is only the second time I have tried an eyelash curler and I have to say I am thrilled with the results. So simple and easy to use with stunning results. You can&#x27;t beat these results, and the price is amazing. This is a must have in your makeup kit!</li>
            <li> I have used A LOT of eye lash curlers in my time being a beauty addict so I was MORE than happy to test this one out for ForteBellezza!  I am so happy that I did.  I LOVE this eyelash curler, not only is the packaging super cute &amp; fun but the product itself is fantastic.  It works really well, it feels like it was made special just for you because it fits your eyelashes so well.  How did they do that?  So, cool!  If you are in the market for a new Eyelash Curler then this one is for you!</li>
            <li> the An eye lash curler is an essential in every woman&#x27;s makeup bag so why not let it be cute and pink, yes there are many nice features of this curler but the color is my favorite.  I used this after a very expensive eye lash curler that constantly pinched me and was surprised how much better and more affordable this one is.</li>
            <li> I really never understood the need for an eyelash curler until now, and that is all due to this review. I have one eyelash curler that I purchased years ago from the dollar store (never used it), and what set these two apart is the closure latch (which I love) and the rubbers for curling the lashes (it even come with a extra). I found the rubber is actually better on ForteBellezza eyelasher color vs. the cheap one I had, but I have to say what really set this curler about is the closure latch. It just makes it so much easier to store or to carry with you.  I don&#x27;t know how long this will last, but so far I really like it and have no issue using this for the past weeks.</li>
            <li> This curler does not pinch. I repeat NO PINCHING. Also unlike the curler I have been using it stays even. I don&#x27;t even understand how my other one doesn&#x27;t stay even!? But then I get pinched. This curler has a locking thing so it doesn&#x27;t get bent or broken in my makeup bag. Easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> This is a well made eyelash curler. It is easy to use!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.  It was just too tall for my small eyes.  It wouldn&#x27;t allow for my entire lash to fit into the curler.</li>
            <li> This is well put together and easy to hold. Works well and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> not worth the money is only good until the rubber gets damage and that happens pretty fast if you use it daily mine only lasted for 1 week not worth the money the Revlon I buy at Walmart for only $2.99 works better and last longer.</li>
            <li> I have constant issues with eyelash curlers either breaking, not working properly or easily losing them...&lt;br /&gt;These not only do the job easily every time but because they are pink I am yet to lose them (I can see them from a mile a way).&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again</li>
            <li> Great eyelash curler, it works great and makes an amazing curl on my eyelashes.  My 2 year old daughter loves that this is pink and will pretend to do her eyelashes as well.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it pulling out eyelashes or cutting or pinching my eyelids so all in all this is a great item.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this curler given all the wonderful reviews. I received it a couple of weeks ago but have been sick so I didn&#x27;t start using it until this week. I&#x27;m really disappointed with it - I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; my eye very well. It&#x27;s hard to get to the base of my lashes and it pinches my eyelid. Also, there is a groove in the rubber and today my eyelashes kept getting stuck in that groove. I went back to my old curler this morning.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash curler!</li>
            <li> If it contained all of its pieces I could have actually tested out the product. Both cushion pads were missing. It appears well made though.</li>
            <li> Quality surpasses the Revlon one I have (which didnt even survive a year of use!)&lt;br /&gt;I love the pink! and the built in locking mechanism is great!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to curl lashes and no pinching!</li>
            <li> What I love about this eyelash curler is it feels like it is made with quality! I have owned many eyelashes curler&#x27;s throughout my lifetime, even the heated ones. However, this eyelash curler I have found is not only easy to use, but comfortable to use as well. When your done using it it has a latch, so that you can keep the handle together for easy storage. It also has an extra eyelash piece, just in case you ruin the first one from too much mascara getting on it. I actually think it did a really quality job curling my lashes, and for my husband to notice says something! I think the prize is reasonable and I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive this product through the company for free, but this is 100% my honest opinion and it does not alter my state of mind.</li>
            <li> Rubber piece fell off before I could use it</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with my lashes after using my Pink Eyelash Curler from ForteBellezza.It&#x27;s so simple to use and comfortable with the wide handles. My eyes look more open and brighter, and my eyelashes so much longer. I&#x27;ve been complimented on my &#x27;gorgeous eyes&#x27; after using this curler, and the lashes stay curled all day! I definitely recommend this eyelash curler to anyone who longs for longer more beautiful lashes, you won&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received these for my review, however these opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Can I just say that the ergonomic handle is absolutely something I didn&#x27;t know I was missing?  Well I am saying it.  It&#x27;s so much easier.  The little locking lever allows you to keep it cleaner, as the curler pad is locked closed.  This made my eyelashes curl like nobody&#x27;s business.  I like that you sent me an extra curling pad if the other ever wears out or something.  Forte Bellezza&#x27;s eyelash curler is made sturdy so it will be in your makeup bag for a long long time.  Thank you for sending me this to review!</li>
            <li> Since I began curling my lashes regularly, I&#x27;ve been trying several different eyelash curler brands. I really wanted to try this particular pair.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute. I like the box.&lt;br /&gt;I also really  like that the name is on the curler. It&#x27;s a nice touch and the handles are pink. So girly! :)&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash curler works way better than my old dollar store curler, which might I add, did NOT fit the curve of my eyelid so well. This Fortebelleza curler fits my eye shape very well.&lt;br /&gt;It really does not hurt one bit when I curl them, which is also nice, because I have pinched my lid before, with one of my older pairs. That is not a good feeling at all. But some people say beauty is pain, right? NO, it doesn&#x27;t have to be!&lt;br /&gt;This pair curled my lashes really well. This product is great. Very happy with it. Yes, I recommend these if you want pain free, gorgeous, and dramatic lashes!  Just add a few coats of your favorite mascara AFTER curling your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah---you can also use a hair dryer on a really low setting to heat your curler and LET IT COOL a lot but still slightly warm. Then curl your lashes and add some mascara. When I did this I was shocked at the huge curve difference! They were more curled than ever. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an avid blogger/product tester, I was sent a free Fortebelleza Eyelash Curler in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool.  I love that you can latch it closed when not using it. This will come in handy when I travel.  The pink handles are kinda cute too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so crazy about this eyelash curler.  The groove in the rubber piece is so deep, that my lashes kind of get stuck in there, and I cannot curl my lashes close to the root, or it pinches my lid.  I&#x27;ve tried the curler for a few weeks now, and I&#x27;m not liking it any better.  I think I&#x27;m going to go back to my old curler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but I experienced pain and pinching (opposite of the hype) when I used this eyelash curler.  Actually, in my opinion, it&#x27;s no better than any of the others out there on the market.  Communication from the seller was good after purchase, and they should be commended for that.</li>
            <li> This is such a great eyelash curler! I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to work so well But they far exceeded my expectations. Very well made and works just like a gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to receive a sample of these eyelash curlers. I have used them a few times and the more I use them the more I like them. But they have pulled out a few of my eyelashes. I&#x27;m not sure if they was just loose ones or what. They have only done it one time so probably just loose eyelashes. They are made really well. They do not pinch my eyes which is an added plus. I would recommend these eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> I love having long eyelashes with a nice curl. This eyelash curler gives you just that. Plus it&#x27;s really cute. These fit comfortably in my hands and are easy to use. I loved how my eyelashes looked after using this. My eyelashes had a nice little curl to them. I was pleased. I was really impressed with the fact this eyelash curler comes with a latch that keeps the handles closed when youâ€™re not using them so they don&#x27;t take up much space and are easier to store. I have never seen that before but I loved that extra feature. This also comes with an extra pink cushion pad for when you need to replace the one youâ€™re using. I was a little surprised at first, to see that the cushion pad was not already on it when I received this. I had never actually put one on myself before so I was a little worried, that I might not do it correctly. However, it seemed easy enough and once I had it on, it stayed put. This eyelash curler was easy to hold and easy to curl my eyelashes. I was happy with it. I received a discount on this product through a promotion. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler.It is really nice and does the job. It curls so much better than other curlers.  The curve fits my eyes perfectly. I absolutely love the way it curls the lashes.The curl lasts all day long. Surprisingly , this is much better than the  other product. Great quality and great price too.</li>
            <li> This tool rocks! It has a simplicity to it&#x27;s use which makes it awesome.  I would recommend to any woman who needs a quality eyelash curler.  Super cute color too!</li>
            <li> This Eyelash Curler by ForteBellezza is Nice! It is pink and cute. It doesn&#x27;t pull your lashes and curls them great! Easy to hold in your hand. This comes with 2 cushions and the grips are really comfortable. I am excited that I got this item to review. Worked really well and is sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite eyelash curler! I had been unable to find one that I loved until now!</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t curl well and the rubber piece started to fray apart almost immediately.</li>
            <li> To be entirely honest, I&#x27;ve never been the eyelash curler type because I&#x27;m super duper clumsy. For that very reason, ForteBellezza eyelash curler has become my new best friend! A friend of mine recommended I get a curler so my lashes stop flipping around into my eyes all the time. I am really happy I purchased this one! It has such an amazing grip that I have experienced zero slip-ups! It also never pinches my eyelids, which is what I was most afraid of. Because of the amazing grip, I am able to achieve perfectly curled lashes EVERY TIME! It is super easy to use, and only takes about ten seconds to do. It also came with TWO eyelash cushions so no worries about finding a suitable replacement pad. Luckily, I knew to use it on clean lashes BEFORE applying mascara because I&#x27;d heard some horror stories. Alas, ForteBellezza clearly stated that fact right on their handy packaging! It shipped out to me very fast, and arrived in perfect condition. I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality, and am so glad I purchased. Such a great product. I highly recommend checking it out. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I got this eyelash curler with another one (2 different brands) I almost lost my lashes!!! it glues to your lashes, and it doesn&#x27;t matter if you are wearing mascara or not. Almost like old rubber, it got stuch to my lashes!!! Nice size, fits your eye perfectly and then pow! no lashes !!! needless to say, I don&#x27;t recommend it, maybe I am the unluky one but this was a bad choice :(</li>
            <li> Just when you think that it would be hard to build a better mousetrap...I don&#x27;t know what it is exactly about this curler but it DRAMATICALLY out-performs any other I have owned.  In one squeeze.  I don&#x27;t know if the shape causes it to position itself better, or if the silicone grippy thing is significant, how it applies pressure-- I have no idea.  But ladies, this works extremely well.  AND it has a lifetime guarantee.  However, it is still possible to pinch yourself with it...you just have to learn the placement that is best for you.  I thought they were all pretty generic until I found this one.  Very pleased.</li>
