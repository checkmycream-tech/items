            <li>And I don&#x27;t need a clock in my bathroom (though that might the wireless display&#x27;s best use).  </li>

            <li>This is an excellent unit with good cleaning results.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased!  </li>
            <li>I think this toothbrush is great.  </li>
            <li>Oral-B Smartseries 5000 is a great electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>But they both work great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product at a great value.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great</li>
            <li>It also has a great carrying case.</li>
            <li>But, I think in hindsight I would have bought the cheaper  version (i.e. the version without the bells and whistles) and been just as happy.  </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>It has some great features.</li>
            <li>If you have kids it would be great and encouraging for them.</li>
            <li>but this toothbrush is amazing!</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve said before:  If you are OK with time and money, this will be one of the best toothbrushes that you&#x27;ll ever buy.  </li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re in the market for a toothbrush, this has a lot of good features to make your teeth as happy as the smiley on the electronic display.</li>
            <li>Does an excellent job on my teeth and my gums feel so much better since I have been using this tooth</li>
            <li>The battery life is great, the timer feature is awesome and it&#x27;s extremely comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Until then, my teeth feel cleaner and this has been pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>The timer is a great help, much better than the one in my head!</li>
            <li>I laughed when I saw this, but now I am hooked and watch the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything looks good, is well designed, and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Probably the best toothbrush available.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing but good to say about it and now switch between the two brushes, this and the Sonic.  </li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>I had thought it would be good for my son learning to brush well</li>
            <li>It had a separate LCD panel that tells you if you did a good job brushing with a 1-4 star rating.  </li>
            <li>I found this toothbrush to be good</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this brush after asking for a good dental cleaning system.</li>
            <li>They both do a good job cleaning</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, this is still a good brush.</li>
            <li>I will update after reviewing all functionalities fairly soon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this toothbrush and heartily recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very nice travel case that will keep the brush safe as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Electric Toothbrush is about as effective as the one that I replaced it with in that it does a very good job making you mouth feel as clean as you can get without a trip to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I love this tooth brush!</li>
            <li>Love this thing!</li>
            <li>The Oral-B 5000 toothbrush is an excellent product for those interested in getting an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and love it!  </li>
            <li>This electric tooth brush is so easy to use and makes my teeth feel great</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very impressive product and I&#x27;m more than happy to recommend it for those in the market for a new electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You get a star with each quadrant, and a happy face shows up when you have all four stars filled in.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The 5000 comes with a case which is nice for travel.</li>
            <li>really nice features.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also nice this product comes with a handy travel case.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s handy since I don&#x27;t keep a clock in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>That was handy to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice travel</li>
            <li>It is just really fun to brush teeth now, and I want to do a really good job!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an improvement in power over the older model I had, and the build quality is superb.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an improvement in power over the older model I had, and the build quality is superb.  </li>
            <li>once it&#x27;s fully charged the battery LED light will turn off on its own!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with my new tooth brush.</li>
            <li>And I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the package, it is easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are good, and do a fine job explaining all the features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m very impressed that Oral-B has continued the tradition of quality and performance that I had grown used to over the years with their older power toothbrush, and I am also pleased that they&#x27;ve improved on the performance of the power cells.  </li>

            <li>if cheaper would be best because they have sensitive mode as well</li>
            <li>I have had electric tooth brushes off and on in my life since being a kid and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>and with this kind of brushes you have to get used to it because they are simply better</li>
            <li>and with this kind of brushes you have to get used to it because they are simply better</li>
            <li>I got this model to replace the Oral-B/Braun \\&quot;Triumph Professional Care\\&quot; (now discontinued) toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 years now and that I&#x27;ve been very happy with.  </li>
            <li>brushing unit itself has a good gripping surface that makes it easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>, it almost goes without saying that this toothbrush does a good job getting my teeth clean--</li>
            <li>The clock is actually useful and attractive, and easy to read.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve learned to deal with this by just making sure my lips are sealed when I brush.  </li>
            <li>I did not switch over many years before.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad they did.</li>
            <li>The timer helps me make sure I have done an efficient job brushinf my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a nice variety of replacement heads/brushes available for a variety of styles and needs.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can get a better one.</li>
            <li>Much better and does a better job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, let me say that this toothbrush is not ordinary---it is more of an investment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced that all the \\&quot;bells &amp; whistles\\&quot; are necessary, but given the sale price, and a $20 rebate program, the purchase was a great value!</li>
            <li>, the brush came with a piece that allows the stand to be inserted and holds 4 different heads - especially handy for families sharing the brush.</li>
            <li>, the brush came with a piece that allows the stand to be inserted and holds 4 different heads - especially handy for families sharing the brush.</li>
            <li>I tried all of them and found \\&quot;Daily Clean\\&quot; to be my best option.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to run it twice a day for more than two weeks before charging.  </li>
            <li>you have children who will use the toothbrush, the display may help them brush better and keep their interest.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice compact design that fits nicely and sightly on my bathroom countertop and is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>I do have healthy teeth and gums and I am a stickler when it comes about toothbrushing, but i am sure that my method with the toothbrush is not the optimal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m using the flossing toothbrush that came with it and love it.  </li>
            <li>and I always brush for more than the recommended 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>, this electric is much better.</li>
            <li>I must say the Sonicare toothbrush works much better for me.</li>
            <li>I now love brushing my teeth 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li>all this is one of my favorite buys.</li>
            <li>I have found that the longer I have this toothbrush, the more I like it.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about using the timer that automatically starts when you use the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Find it interesting truly.</li>
            <li>more thing...</li>
            <li>more thing...</li>
            <li>I have had an Oral B rechargeable for many years.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers are saying that this has to many.</li>
            <li>It comes with a nice travel case but the charger doesn&#x27;t fit in it</li>
            <li>I love my tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It is a good motivator to keep you brushing right, and made me feel like the displays on exercise bikes at the gym that take your pulse and let you know when you are in \\&quot;the zone.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you need the LCD display to easily distinguish between the various modes so although it has a travel case, it is not the best choice as a travel model.  </li>
            <li>I think the timer will be excellent for my 8 yr old (he is quickly eating dinner</li>
            <li>The bleeding doesn&#x27;t occur at all after the first week and my teeth feel great after each clean.</li>
            <li>Comparing this to the 1000, I like the slimmer more comfortable handle of the 1000 and more compact charger.</li>
            <li>One of the nice things about this one, is that it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>so he can try it out.)I feel as clean as I do after a visit to the dentist!</li>
            <li>I was brushing because one of the advantages of this model is that you can allocate 30 to 45 seconds for each mouth quadrant ( the 3000 model only had 30 seconds ) assuring you cover all the areas for a perfect clean mouth in 2 to 2:30 minutes...</li>
            <li>I have been using this one for about 3 weeks now, and I have decided that I greatly prefer it over my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you&#x27;ve got the money and think you need the machine to tell you what quadrant to brush or if you tend to brush with too much gusto, then this unit is good for you.</li>
            <li>The guide is not a necessity but kind of fun plus</li>
            <li>You will not be able to get the refund without the acutal packaging that the toothbrush originally came in.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t heard the spiel on electric toothbrushes and why they clean your teeth so much better, it&#x27;s worth researching, but the summary would be: more cleaning motion, more consistently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but once i read the Manuel it was easy to deal with....5 modes of brushing</li>
            <li>Everything is packed neatly and easy to set</li>
            <li>I love how clean my teeth feel with the electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It performs well - it is easy to hold, easy to use, and hassle-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After that it&#x27;s as easy as can be.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to get replaceable heads for them.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B 5000 is an excellent toothbrush, but the extra bells and whistles, while novel, aren&#x27;t really worth the premium.</li>
            <li>It easily holds a charge for a week of brushing, so that isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li>I would choose a command strip rather than the one they supply to make it easy to remove someday.</li>
            <li>The polishing mode has helped brighten my teeth more than special toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>But the Smartseries 5000 is still an effective cleaning tool for someone willing to invest a bit in their oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some brushes build up junk on them after weeks of use, but this brush is amazingly clean and bright after much use for one month.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Perfect check ups, less tartar buildup.</li>
            <li>If you are fine with that, then this toothbrush will serve you well.  </li>
            <li>However after getting used to it, this brush does a fine job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The charge station is very nice and easy to use unless you don&#x27;t have a constant electric source in the bath, like me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finding this information is a huge chore.  </li>
            <li>This would be great for kids as you can get extra heads and the kids</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the Oral-B Smartseries 5000.</li>
            <li>I have always had great experiences with purchasing from Amazon; this definitely was not one of them.  </li>
            <li>Great product overall</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic piece of machinery.  </li>
            <li>This electric (automatic) toothbrush was a fantastic addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As it charges, one light will stay on and continue up to 3.  </li>
            <li>great brush and can use multiple heads for whitening, flossing etc.</li>
            <li>I tried a cheap battery powered one, but when I saw that I would be replacing batteries every 3 weeks, it went into the bottom drawer.  </li>
            <li>Skip spending money on cheap battery powered ones too</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>lcd display can be attached to your mirror and believeme, it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>There are seven brush heads to choose from that fit this brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a good, clear system.  </li>
            <li>However, the more I used it, the more I really began to like</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a significant improvement on the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to see right out of the box and after the first charge that it has much more power, which is a welcome change.  </li>
            <li>Before this, I had the pulsonic, thinking that a sonic toothbrush would do a better job, but I really think this one does a much better job of scrubbing the teeth clean</li>
            <li>timer display is very useful, even if you don&#x27;t have kids.</li>
            <li>Anyway I am more than happy and love the small circular head.</li>
            <li>It might have been better if the unit were designed to allow you to choose the function first, then start the brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve successfully built one terrific toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am so far very pleased with my Oral-B Smartseries 5000 toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When I go into my dentist for my annual cleaning she always raves how clean my teeth are.  </li>
            <li>The kit also includes a carrying container for the brush, which keeps it clean in your suitcase or travel bag.  </li>
            <li>It performs well, is easy to use, and comes with a useful set of parts.</li>
            <li>so I know I can also disassemble to spot clean if need be.</li>
            <li>(At current prices, they&#x27;re a bit more than a nice manual toothbrush, but not by much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never had my teeth feel so clean, it is almost unreal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This model comes with the PRECISION CLEAN head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush stays clean after each use.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the cleaning action of the head on the Oral-B design for 6 years now, and since this one works just the same way, though with a bit more power, I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be as happy with this one as with the last.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be able to see what mode you are in on the clock aka smart</li>
            <li>All in all, I give it 5 stars because it works great, love the sensitive mode lacking on the 1000 and my gum line recession has actually improved.</li>
            <li>The Oral-B is slim and attractive looking and has an electronic display for battery power, time, and time spent brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cool to see the two items work in tandem</li>
            <li>If I feel like I need some supplemental cleaning after a full cycle, the toothbrush remains on and</li>
            <li>The stop is longer than the Sonicare, which for me makes it better, and readily noticeable.  </li>
            <li>hooray.. it&#x27;s something you has to do if you want to have the necessary tools to chew your food and look good when smiling</li>
            <li>Excellent product so far based on limited use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Third this brush comes with a light right on the handle to let me know it is charging.  </li>
            <li>It is always more fun to write a positive review about a product and this time is no exception.</li>
            <li>(but I was happy enough for many years and many new brush-heads and one complete replacement of the Sonicare) .</li>
            <li>There is also a handy little travel case for the brush, which is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is also a handy little travel case for the brush, which is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The separate LCD is good but the viewing angle isn&#x27;t great so to see the timer you have to either bend your head down (allowing toothpaste to drip out your mouth) or back up (away from the sink).</li>
            <li>I do use the timer as guidance to receive the right amount of time per quadrant for a full clean and luv that added bonus.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and my mouth so fresh after brushing.</li>
            <li>They have been great not only for the kids with braces, but for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>I started with the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; setting since I&#x27;m pregnant and that tends to increase the chances of bleeding gums.</li>
            <li>brush notifies you when it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants - it beeps and pauses before continuing on - another touch that would be great for kids both young and old.</li>

            <li>Tremendous - get as a gift to yourself.</li>
            <li>The next best thing to going to your dental hygienist daily.</li>
            <li>i recommend that you charge it full the first time and use it till the battery dies out redo the process don&#x27;t ever leave it on the charger after its fully charged it&#x27;ll just kill the battery!</li>
            <li>At $5 a pop, that&#x27;s a lot more than a normal toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To find out how long I would have to look at those BRIGHT flashing LEDs before the handle would be fully charged.</li>
            <li>Good for a long vacation, but</li>
            <li>toothbrush seems to be easy to clean and keep clean, and the instructions clearly show how to disassemble the brush to replace the rechargeable battery (if needed)</li>
            <li>I am sure all these modes are fine, but 98 percent of the time I use \\&quot;Daily Clean.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It is also nice that it comes with a carrying case in case you ever want to travel with it (though make sure it is fully charged before you leave because the charger does not fit in the case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for several years, and have always liked them.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush was pricey but with the rebate I felt it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Are all the bells and whistles worth it?</li>
            <li>The 5000 is better for me, however, because I prefer the sensitive mode.</li>
            <li>The timings and warnings might be useful to someone concerned about whether they&#x27;re brushing correctly.  </li>
            <li>The 5 different brush modes are nice.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had one as a child for a heathy smile....</li>
            <li>Worth Every Penney, do yourself a favor and get one today.</li>
            <li>I sort of think that this is more for kids than adults even though this is an adult toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But, if you know you&#x27;re own brushing routine and don&#x27;t need a visual reminder, then I say save yourself some money and get the version without the wireless LCD unit.</li>
            <li>so I am anxious to see if this corrects the issue, but thus far I am super impressed!</li>
            <li>It certainly is the top of the line, but I believe you can get as good an experience with the other models in the Braun/Oral-B stable if your needs/desires are less than my own.</li>
            <li>He was right; it helps me get to hard-to-reach wisdom teeth and ensures I brush thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>In fact in many ways it seemed less a toothbrush and more like the polisher that dentist uses.  </li>
            <li>The Philips brush head was more elongated (vs. the round Oral-B), and the vibration of the Oral-B seemed quite a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li>a small amount of toothpaste does a great job.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about the Oral-B is how much easier it is keep clean than the Philips was.</li>
            <li>the seperate digital monitor great help in timing the 30 second intrevals.  </li>
            <li>With all the features included in this brush, this seems like a pretty good value, considering our last electric toothbrush is 6 years old and counting.</li>
            <li>With all the features included in this brush, this seems like a pretty good value, considering our last electric toothbrush is 6 years old and counting.</li>
            <li>If you need a great toothbrush for less money, they&#x27;re several available.</li>
            <li>My gums seem much healthier and I can really feel that my teeth are clean.  </li>
            <li>YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE BRUSHING TOO HARD GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>The wireless smart timer provides great visual feedback and is something that should be included with all kids&#x27; toothbrushes to help them get in the habit of brushing properly.  </li>
            <li>so now i just use the oral-b 5000 at low speed and my gums are looking better.</li>
            <li>When our first kiddo got braces, we were told to start using an electric toothbrush and purchased two of these.  </li>
            <li>It even has a happy/sad face to indicate if you are using too much pressure!  </li>
            <li>When I first got this, it seemed like more technology than you could possibly need from a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I do my brushing in the shower, so I was worried about using the clock at first</li>
            <li>intimidating(sort of like a first date.)  </li>
            <li>This is a top-quality tooth cleaner, on a par with Oral-B&#x27;s earlier top models.  </li>
            <li>Since there are many reviews already, I&#x27;ll keep my review short and to the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush does make me feel a difference, and i am more efficient when it come to the cleaning since the timer let&#x27;s me know about moving on to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I love is the small space it takes up on my bathroom counter top and the ease of swapping out the tooth</li>
            <li>I think they were also one of the first companies to introduce the electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I would prefer a more streamlined, smaller charging base.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The LCD indicator is currently sitting on my bathroom counter and being used more for a clock than anything else.  </li>
            <li>The small head of a Floss-Action brush head is perfect at reaching those back teeth against the jaw bone and it allows for precision on each tooth.</li>
            <li>But, with use, I have found it helps me keep a consistent brushing pattern.</li>

            <li>Listerine Antiseptic Adult Mouthwash Advanced with Tartar Protection Citrus, 1.5 Liter]]</li>
            <li>I had a Philips Sonicare for over 5 years and it was my first electronic brush</li>
            <li>- I much prefer my OralB 5000!  </li>
            <li>I have used most of them, though I tend to stick with either the Daily Clean or the Deep Clean modes.</li>
            <li>The two extra brush modes are nice -- it has a deep clean mode that lasts for 3 minutes -- but</li>
            <li>I had the original, the Excel, the 3D, the Professional Care, the 1000 and now the 5000.  </li>
            <li>Still, the very visible timer and the different modes make this a better model.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you check the cost of brush-replacements to see how much it will cost you per year overall.  </li>
            <li>The Smartguide sounds good in theory but I can&#x27;t really figure it out or am just too impatient.</li>
            <li>It shows what mode you&#x27;re on, has a circle broken into four quadrants and each quadrant flashes or fills at the appropriate time, it shows stars that fill as each quadrant is completed, has a frown face and red light for too much pressure, and a happy face when the brushing is complete.</li>
            <li>my* toothbrush, while the Philips has been fully given over to my husband.s a circle broken into four quadrants and each quadrant flashes or fills at the appropriate time, it shows stars that fill as each quadrant is completed, has a frown face and red light for too much pressure, and a happy face when the brushing is complete.</li>
            <li>I have not tested all the settings and i am not sure if i will, but the goldbox deal price and the fact that this is the top of the line Oral-b toothbrush, made an easy decision to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I opted for the 5000 series because I liked the idea of being warned when I was brushing too hard and having a nice visual feedback of my brushing results/style and what setting</li>
            <li>plenty long for most trips without needing to recharge.</li>
            <li>and this is the first one that I don&#x27;t like much.  </li>
            <li>The smiley face definitely makes me want to go for the full two minutes!</li>
            <li>I have never owned an electric toothbrush before, so I was a little surprised at how powerful this one is while in use, but the multiple settings allow for sensitive mode, whitening mode, etc., and are all awesome!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare and others far in the past - this works as well cleaning as those, but the timing features are great.</li>
            <li>Had to replace my oral B smart guide which I lost while moving.</li>
            <li>The smart guide monitor tracks the 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model comes with a charger, one head, a traveling case and a separate wireless smart guide unit.</li>
            <li>The Smart Guide takes some explaining.</li>
            <li>They all do the trick, so it is largely a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They all do the trick, so it is largely a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you brush for a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li>Also, the holder for the heads is large and takes up a lot of counter space.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a  Smart Guide which can stand up on the counter or be stuck to the mirror or wall.</li>
            <li>last Oral-B toothbrush was the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li>This new one needs to be recharged for the better part of a day if it has been used for several brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The side monitor takes a little getting used to but it is kind of neat.</li>
            <li>This new shape to the stand is stable and won&#x27;t tip over, it is more stable than older model&#x27;s recharging stands which were smaller and just wider than the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I suggest this toothbrush to everyone and occasionally Oral-B has such amazing rebates</li>
            <li>The brush has a built in red (LED) light that starts to flash when you apply too much pressure on your teeth&lt;</li>
            <li>The biggest changes are important but not essential if you are somewhat budget</li>
            <li>It is very misleading.  </li>
            <li>It shows you a running total of time elapsed during brushing, and displays a circle with each quadrant filled in as you brush.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward</li>
            <li>(well, not that fast</li>
            <li>but I can see how it may be helpful to young children when brushing and may add a bit of fun to the process.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the sensor tells if you are exerting too much pressure on the teeth - this is to help prevent enamel abrasion.</li>
            <li>Who really needs a WiFi toothbrush?  </li>
            <li>I deeply appreciate Amazon&#x27;s frustration free packaging.  </li>
            <li>You just pop it out of the box and onto the charger, and once it is powered up you are ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aside from being a regular clock, when you turn on the toothbrush it kicks into brushing mode, and shows a circle with each quadrant filled it as you move along.  </li>
            <li>so much, it has become *</li>
            <li>so much, it has become *</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really need the Smartguide.</li>
            <li>The various modes available, after trying them out, haven&#x27;t been returned to.  </li>
            <li>very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t used this feature much yet.  </li>
            <li>I do think they should have made it to show something much quicker as unless you read the manual closely describing this</li>
            <li>It is much louder than the 1000.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I don&#x27;t see much use for it.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a week straight without a recharge</li>
            <li>The polishing mode is fantastic, and my teeth have never been this white without using a tooth whitener.  </li>
            <li>It does have a gentle mode too, but I haven&#x27;t ever used it.  </li>
            <li>It makes brushing your teeth so much easier.</li>
            <li>Charge lasts the whole week.</li>
            <li>so much cleaner everytime</li>
            <li>and I really missed the electric one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, much like they do after a trip to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Set the time and you will be ready to brush with some charging of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I had switched to a super soft manual brush, but then felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting my teeth clean enough.  </li>
            <li>The power of the toothbrush is much stronger than the ones I have owned before.</li>
            <li>While novel, the timer really doesn&#x27;t add anything to the functionality of the brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you care about your teeth!</li>
            <li>Or you can choose the polishing mode to have a George Clooney&#x27;s smile in no time but, because it is early in the morning, your brain its still booting and there you are brushing your teeth, you&#x27;re no longer forgetting the quadrant you were cleaning because the display will give you all the info you need to know</li>
            <li>absolutely nothing can beat the level of cleanliness</li>
            <li>absolutely nothing can beat the level of cleanliness</li>
            <li>so you need to take that if you will be gone for very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have much preferred a design that could be wall-mounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have much preferred a design that could be wall-mounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed it is quite spendy, but if it lasts more than a few years, I would say that it might be worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I find the different modes very useful.  </li>
            <li>Could be a good thing, but not on a daily basis due to ruining enamel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a great job cleaning, and I even found on the day of transitioning from the old to the new model that my teeth felt instantly cleaner with a bit fewer rough spots (my 6 month cleaning is tomorrow).  </li>
            <li>It does come with a travel case, which is a nice benefit, as it&#x27;s far too large for a typical toothbrush</li>
            <li>Teeth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li>The Deep Clean bumps that up to 45 seconds per quadrant.</li>
            <li>The brushing is pleasant -- not as hard as some other electric toothbrushes -- and it leaves your teeth feeling smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I was finally ready to try something new, this toothbrush turned out a real hit.</li>
            <li>throw away your old electric brush, but if you are ready for an upgrade to a state-of-art model, I recommend this model!</li>
            <li>On a full charge it would last me maybe 3 days.</li>
            <li>Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a number of different brands of electric Toothbrushes over the years and find the Oral-B Smart-series 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush performs in the top 3.</li>
            <li>My check ups are short and sweet.</li>
            <li>caddy holds 4 separate brush heads for 4 different users, and that may be useful for families with kids who share a bathroom and can, thus, share a power toothbrush body, keeping their brush heads separate (different colored rings are available for each brush</li>
            <li>caddy holds 4 separate brush heads for 4 different users, and that may be useful for families with kids who share a bathroom and can, thus, share a power toothbrush body, keeping their brush heads separate (different colored rings are available for each brush</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this toothbrush, although I am convinced that a less pricey model of the same brand would do just as good a job.</li>
            <li>Of all of them, the 1000, while a stripped down model is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The brush automatically beeps (in the daily clean cycle) every 30 seconds to indicate when the recommended two minute brushing time is complete and the SmartGuide has a large quadrant icon showing the stages of brushing.</li>
            <li>Without the timer, you&#x27;d kind of be hard pressed to know if you were on massage mode, deep clean mode, etc.</li>
            <li>The cleaning modes for the brush are Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, and Massage.</li>
            <li>Though I wonder just how sensitive the sensor is because I could not set it off in my mouth and had to push it against my hand to put enough pressure on it to light up.  </li>
            <li>Sure, I brushed twice a day, but it was probably closer to 30 seconds total, rather than 30 seconds for each quarter of my mouth.</li>
            <li>that does a decent job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First (and most obviously) the toothbrush pauses at the 30 second mark.  </li>
            <li>If you are skeptical that electric is better than manual, I can tell you that I am so glad I switched and should have done it years ago.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to buy in bulk replacement heads from Costco, so the overall maintenance of this product is low.</li>
            <li>I have found that this electric toothbrush actually does a better job of brushing than I could with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This model, the Smart Series 5000 professional care model has some improvements over the older models which some of us were still using, so I could compare them side by side.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For performance and the ability to interchange brush heads throughout the Oral-B line-up (unlike Sonicare models), highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended..</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Older model died, needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really a sign of the times to see just how far we&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>we were very please with the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 (ASIN: B004O76DEC)</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, considering my preference for my old sonic, I&#x27;d probably be happier with the [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic]], a slim, much cheaper sonic model</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, considering my preference for my old sonic, I&#x27;d probably be happier with the [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic]], a slim, much cheaper sonic model</li>
            <li>What I like most about this Electric Toothbrush is that it actually tells you how long to brush as it beeps every thirty seconds (forty-five on one setting) for each quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>If you do not want to use the device it still works as a normal clock...</li>
            <li>and I was feeling pretty much the same about my Sonicare experiences</li>
            <li>Similarly, there&#x27;s a variety of replacement heads available for sensitive, whitening, floss action, etc.</li>
            <li>you own this unit and read the owner manual you realize the unit can be further customized to your personal liking by buying a different replacement head.</li>
            <li>It did not, however, come in normal packaging with the UPC barcode on it.  </li>
            <li>so I plugged it into my bedroom outlet (which is where I normally charge it) and the lights wouldn&#x27;t indicate it was charging.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think the Smartguide is worth paying extra for.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge well, for over a week of normal use for me.  </li>
            <li>I just brush my teeth with it in normal mode.  </li>
            <li>in all, aside from my minor critiques (the \\&quot;cons\\&quot; above), I cannot imagine needing more than this in an electric/rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>But the extra money is definitely worth the difference.</li>
            <li>As a nice touch, the piece also has a lid that folds down to cover the brushes to help keep them from getting any extra germs from flushing toilets and the like.</li>
            <li>As a nice touch, the piece also has a lid that folds down to cover the brushes to help keep them from getting any extra germs from flushing toilets and the like.</li>
            <li>nice features include that it actually tells you when you are pressing too hard by alerting you with a red light on the brush.  </li>
            <li>The brush and the smart guide will warn you with red flashing lights if you put too much pressure on your teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a new design to the stand which keeps it plugged into the charger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a new travel case which we appreciate since we do travel with our electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It holds the unit and additional brush heads.s a new travel case which we appreciate since we do travel with our electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>If you do that, it will stay looking new.  </li>
            <li>I feel comfortable that I&#x27;m actually giving myself enough dental attention these days.</li>
            <li>my teeth have never been cleaner, particularly when using the floss action brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Of the 4 modes, I pretty much only use the normal or the polishing mode.  </li>
            <li>i like the fact that if apply to much pressure on my teeth the brush LED light turns red and you can see a sad face notification on my SMART GUIDE that&#x27;s cool!</li>
            <li>: it beeps once for the first quadrant, twice for the second one, and so on.  </li>
            <li>probably ten years ago, and switched to a Phillips Sonicare because I just wasn&#x27;t feeling as refreshed; AND the toothbrush was getting pretty yucky.</li>
            <li>time consuming than ordinary brush and more expensive&lt;</li>
            <li>If you do get it, you better use it or you might as well stick with the ordinary brush.  </li>
            <li>Either way, I like how it peeps to indicate you brushed a specific area significantly.</li>
            <li>, I thought it would last much longer!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll see the first of 3 lights shortly.  </li>
            <li>[i regularly keep it on deep clean ]</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a substantial improvement over the power cell in the old Triumph, which didn&#x27;t perform that well even when new.  </li>
            <li>You can also change the settings on the brush to, daily, deep clean, sensitive, whitening and massage mode.  </li>
            <li>My hygienist recommended the Oral-B brand over others on the market for plaque removal (stating that the brushing action is better than the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrushes), I&#x27;m not sure the validity of this claim, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>The whole set ended up costing me $90, so about double of what I normally would pay.</li>
            <li>The Daily clean is exactly what it sounds like - the typical 30 seconds per quadrant that is recommended.</li>
            <li>I ended up contacting Amazon and they allowed me to return it with a restocking fee deducted (I wasn&#x27;t aware of this until the item was in Amazon&#x27;s possession but at least I got most of my refund back).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took awhile to get used to the smaller brush head of the Oral-B toothbrush, but the combination of smaller head and slimmer neck make reaching the back molars much easier than either of the other toothbrushes I own.  </li>
            <li>The regular pulse is pretty darn intense of a vibration and a bit jarring especially for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Its brush head is smaller and less effective than the 5000&#x27;s, and it has only 3 modes rather than 5 and doesn&#x27;t come with a SmartGuide.</li>
            <li>This functional electric toothbrush does the job, but is bulkier and less comfortable than my old Oral-B Sonic Complete (since discontinued).  </li>
            <li>I placed it on my large mirror and it syncs with the toothbrush and not only counts the time brushing, but where to be brushing.  </li>
            <li>This Smart Series 5000 is just as solid.</li>
            <li>For that purpose, the SmartGuide may have some application, but for my purposes, it is of little more use than as a digital clock.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For that purpose, the SmartGuide may have some application, but for my purposes, it is of little more use than as a digital clock.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the feature of letting you know if you are brushing too hard as that will cause gum recession too, but believe the 1000 has that feature as well.</li>
            <li>I kept the old one for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old, darn it.</li>
            <li>With the timer, it makes it much easier to anticipate when to move forward to the next step.</li>
            <li>I also have an [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Care 3000]]</li>
            <li>This review was also updated on 9/07/12 after comparing it to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Floss Action model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mode for floss action requires the use of the floss action head which does not come with this model.</li>
            <li>I already have an [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional 3000 Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li>5000 is both lighter and bulkier than my old Oral B.  </li>
            <li>is the floss action head, and</li>
            <li>also really like the different setting options.</li>
            <li>With the Sensitive mode, there is a noticeable difference in vibration power.</li>
            <li>How much can actually build</li>
            <li>It cleans teeth really well and tells you when to switch to the next set of teeth.  </li>
            <li>When it is complete, it doesn&#x27;t show the lights anymore.  </li>
            <li>Replacement brush heads for the Oral-B are much cheaper than the Sonicare, which adds another plus, but are similar in price to the A&amp;H replacement brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>reviewer mentioned that it gets gross really fast.  </li>
            <li>There is even a battery life indicator that tells you how much charge is left in the unit.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it flashes red when you are using to much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Our family has been using the Braun / Oral-B since early ninetees and gone through all their generations.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>came was Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush(ASIN: B007VXJK6O), which showed to be an updated version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>were you are, how much time is left and which part of your mouth you&#x27;re supposed to be brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>Sensitive tooth that is a gentler 2 minute brushing cycle.</li>
            <li>B007VXJK6O Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]....  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of use for the accessories (though I am thankful for the addition of a hard-plastic travel case) such as the \\&quot;SmartGuide,\\&quot; which really seems to be designed for parents of toddlers who are teaching their kids how to use a toothbrush.  </li>

            <li>It seems silly, at first, but it makes brushing the right way, for enough time, so easy.</li>
            <li>The basic speed for a daily clean seems to be the same, and the heads and the charger from my old unit are compatible.</li>
            <li>with all Oral-B brushes, the brush head is small and easily navigates over and around your teeth during brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Something that I particularly like, and that is different from the Philips, is that once the brush time is complete, the brush notifies you and then keeps going.</li>
            <li>Something that I particularly like, and that is different from the Philips, is that once the brush time is complete, the brush notifies you and then keeps going.</li>
            <li>You will definitely feel the results after your first brushing sessions and future sessions to come.</li>
            <li>First, it is big and gets larger toward the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it more powerful to begin with, but it holds enough power for at least 8-10 brushings lasting about 3-3:30 minutes each.  </li>
            <li>The timer also signals when you&#x27;re putting on too much pressure by emitting a red light behind the LCD screen when you apply too much force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They sell 6 different brush heads in all, one is for sensitive teeth which is new.</li>
            <li>However, I only saw a bit of pink on the first couple of brushes; after that, no problems even on the normal setting.</li>
            <li>My first impression of this was that it was really rough on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I had a friend who kept raving about this toothbrush and told me that once I started using an electric toothbrush, I wouldn&#x27;t go back to the normal ones</li>
            <li>The timer helped me because I would actually count down while brushing to make sure I went over my teeth several times even though the toothbrush would stop vibrating every 30 seconds to signal you to move on to the next area.</li>
            <li>The other problem is that it is kind of fun to see the sad face popping up, so I find myself brushing incorrectly on purpose just to see</li>
            <li>The other problem is that it is kind of fun to see the sad face popping up, so I find myself brushing incorrectly on purpose just to see</li>
            <li>They both pause when it is time to move to a new brushing zone and have the pressure sensor that lights a red LED when you press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(This is a new charger design than the former 5000 series model had, that one could be used in Europe.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>: LED battery indicator lights - way too bright, flashy - not necessarily an improvement.</li>
            <li>It has different settings, so if your gums are sensitive, you could start on the sensitive gum setting.</li>
            <li>also found that with the timer, it was much easier to see what mode it was currently working under as this model has five different modes to choose from.</li>
            <li>The Whitening mode might work, but the only way to really know would be to use only that for a time and then check for any difference.</li>
            <li>The accompanying monitor is very helpful in performing the proper brushing time for your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only remark concerns the charging time.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good system that keeps you on track without getting too complicated.  </li>
            <li>Has a timer/detector that comes with it, and a indicator light when you brush to hard, or not hard enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m deducting a star because I think the 4000 series is just fine without the need for the LCD monitor about how hard you are brushing your teeth and the LCD countdown timer.  </li>
            <li>and I was apprehensive that I would have major damage on my gums.  </li>
            <li>this Smartseries toothbrush enough for it to last that long, but more generally I&#x27;d like to see Oral-B and other vendors provide replaceable battery packs.  </li>

            <li>but it eventually went down to the red light (low battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first glance, even down to the accessories, it looks nearly identical to the old \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot; model, functions almost identically, and even takes the same heads.  </li>
            <li>This machine solves the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra timer accessory is a bit odd, but at least it is a way to keep track of good brushing habits.</li>
            <li>This subtle 30 second remind is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>While I loved that old \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot; model, my one complaint was that the battery didn&#x27;t hold a very sizable charge, and with age it just got worse -- at the time of my replacing it, it was only holding enough charge for about 2 brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the new [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>like the fact that the brush warns if you&#x27;re brushing too hard: there&#x27;s a light on the handle and a prompt on the SmartGuide.</li>
            <li>wireless function is mostly meant to show you when to move to the next quadrant of your mouth, as well as display the current brushing mode, a clock, and a warning if you are pressing too hard--</li>
            <li>The SmartSeries 5000 is a step up from my old brush, but not a giant step.  </li>
            <li>brush has several cleaning settings, depending on how vigorously or softly you wish to brush.  </li>
            <li>They market this same basic device calling it floss action and that model has the floss action head not the precision cleaning brush head.</li>
            <li>There is the standard recommended 2-minute mode, a 4-minute mode for deep-cleaning, a sensitive mode, a polishing mode, and a gum massage.  </li>
            <li>There is the standard recommended 2-minute mode, a 4-minute mode for deep-cleaning, a sensitive mode, a polishing mode, and a gum massage.  </li>
            <li>Be it a different technology or a smaller head, my teeth feel much, much cleaner since I bought it, especially at the gum lines, where I always had problems.</li>
            <li>I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this.</li>
            <li>The old unit had an ENORMOUS, bulky (transformer?)</li>
            <li>With earlier models, you&#x27;d have to rely on the toothbrush itself to signal you when it was time to move to a different area of your mouth, which they would normally do with a timed vibration.</li>
            <li>This may seem a bit unnecessary to some, but I find that I do brush longer and better with this</li>
            <li>It has all the same features as my old brush: the brush signals when you have completed a quadrant and lets you know to move on, and a red light turns on when you are pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li>me, the separate readout unit with timer and other features hasn&#x27;t been of much use.  </li>
            <li>It buzzes when it&#x27;s time to change, and there&#x27;s a red light that comes on when you&#x27;re pressing too hard to brush.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The display (and toothbrush) also flash a red light if you are brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I expected too much, but I thought my teeth would feel like I had just left my dentist.</li>
            <li>I have found that there are times when I just want to cover a spot a little more thoroughly or want a little extra brush time.</li>

            <li>The head is a little thick (vs my Sonic heads), meaning I have to brush with my mouth kind of open (toothpaste dribble).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve played around with all of them, although I generally default to the standard 2-minute mode, followed by some time with the gum massage.  </li>

            <li>For children that are learning to brush, having the visuals would be extremely helpful, particularly for the quadrant times and the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I had to replace the older model 5000 Smartseries (the one with the LCD battery indicator window in the handle) due to accidental damage to the notched metal spindle that holds the brush head in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush head that came with the electric brush (floss action head) felt pretty hard to the touch</li>
            <li>I am not sure why there are  bad reviews for this brush, been using it for almost a year, works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The charging time is much much longer compared to the previous model&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>did not even realize that with my old system, I was not brushing for long enough and</li>
            <li>Also, the toothbrush has a lot of cool settings for heavier and lighter sessions, and a small interface showing you how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
            <li>Be ready for your gums to bleed a little for the first few days if you aren&#x27;t used to an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This series comes with a base charger that is more fancy than the regular bases because this one is larger with a covered clear compartment to the right where you can store your spare brush heads.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine until approximately 4 months after purchasing it</li>
            <li>That will encourage little ones to brush the whole 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>It was hard to get used to an electric toothbrush, but it is definately worth the effort and the expense.</li>
            <li>At least the batteries in this new model are NIMH, which neither have a \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot; nor are particularly toxic if you throw the unit away.  </li>

            <li> I found this toothbrush to be good</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this brush after asking for a good dental cleaning system.</li>

            <li> Love this thing!</li>

            <li> if cheaper would be best because they have sensitive mode as well</li>
            <li> I have had electric tooth brushes off and on in my life since being a kid and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> and with this kind of brushes you have to get used to it because they are simply better</li>
            <li> and with this kind of brushes you have to get used to it because they are simply better</li>
            <li> I got this model to replace the Oral-B/Braun \\&quot;Triumph Professional Care\\&quot; (now discontinued) toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 years now and that I&#x27;ve been very happy with.  </li>
            <li> brushing unit itself has a good gripping surface that makes it easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> , it almost goes without saying that this toothbrush does a good job getting my teeth clean--</li>
            <li> The clock is actually useful and attractive, and easy to read.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve learned to deal with this by just making sure my lips are sealed when I brush.  </li>
            <li> I did not switch over many years before.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad they did.</li>
            <li> The timer helps me make sure I have done an efficient job brushinf my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a nice variety of replacement heads/brushes available for a variety of styles and needs.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can get a better one.</li>
            <li> Much better and does a better job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, let me say that this toothbrush is not ordinary---it is more of an investment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced that all the \\&quot;bells &amp; whistles\\&quot; are necessary, but given the sale price, and a $20 rebate program, the purchase was a great value!</li>
            <li> , the brush came with a piece that allows the stand to be inserted and holds 4 different heads - especially handy for families sharing the brush.</li>
            <li> , the brush came with a piece that allows the stand to be inserted and holds 4 different heads - especially handy for families sharing the brush.</li>
            <li> I tried all of them and found \\&quot;Daily Clean\\&quot; to be my best option.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to run it twice a day for more than two weeks before charging.  </li>
            <li> you have children who will use the toothbrush, the display may help them brush better and keep their interest.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice compact design that fits nicely and sightly on my bathroom countertop and is easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> I do have healthy teeth and gums and I am a stickler when it comes about toothbrushing, but i am sure that my method with the toothbrush is not the optimal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m using the flossing toothbrush that came with it and love it.  </li>
            <li> and I always brush for more than the recommended 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> , this electric is much better.</li>
            <li> I must say the Sonicare toothbrush works much better for me.</li>
            <li> I now love brushing my teeth 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> all this is one of my favorite buys.</li>
            <li> I have found that the longer I have this toothbrush, the more I like it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using the timer that automatically starts when you use the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Find it interesting truly.</li>
            <li> more thing...</li>
            <li> more thing...</li>
            <li> I have had an Oral B rechargeable for many years.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers are saying that this has to many.</li>
            <li> It comes with a nice travel case but the charger doesn&#x27;t fit in it</li>
            <li> I love my tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It is a good motivator to keep you brushing right, and made me feel like the displays on exercise bikes at the gym that take your pulse and let you know when you are in \\&quot;the zone.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you need the LCD display to easily distinguish between the various modes so although it has a travel case, it is not the best choice as a travel model.  </li>
            <li> I think the timer will be excellent for my 8 yr old (he is quickly eating dinner</li>
            <li> The bleeding doesn&#x27;t occur at all after the first week and my teeth feel great after each clean.</li>
            <li> Comparing this to the 1000, I like the slimmer more comfortable handle of the 1000 and more compact charger.</li>
            <li> One of the nice things about this one, is that it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> so he can try it out.)I feel as clean as I do after a visit to the dentist!</li>
            <li> I was brushing because one of the advantages of this model is that you can allocate 30 to 45 seconds for each mouth quadrant ( the 3000 model only had 30 seconds ) assuring you cover all the areas for a perfect clean mouth in 2 to 2:30 minutes...</li>
            <li> I have been using this one for about 3 weeks now, and I have decided that I greatly prefer it over my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you&#x27;ve got the money and think you need the machine to tell you what quadrant to brush or if you tend to brush with too much gusto, then this unit is good for you.</li>
            <li> The guide is not a necessity but kind of fun plus</li>
            <li> You will not be able to get the refund without the acutal packaging that the toothbrush originally came in.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t heard the spiel on electric toothbrushes and why they clean your teeth so much better, it&#x27;s worth researching, but the summary would be: more cleaning motion, more consistently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but once i read the Manuel it was easy to deal with....5 modes of brushing</li>
            <li> Everything is packed neatly and easy to set</li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel with the electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It performs well - it is easy to hold, easy to use, and hassle-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After that it&#x27;s as easy as can be.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to get replaceable heads for them.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B 5000 is an excellent toothbrush, but the extra bells and whistles, while novel, aren&#x27;t really worth the premium.</li>
            <li> It easily holds a charge for a week of brushing, so that isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> I would choose a command strip rather than the one they supply to make it easy to remove someday.</li>
            <li> The polishing mode has helped brighten my teeth more than special toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> But the Smartseries 5000 is still an effective cleaning tool for someone willing to invest a bit in their oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some brushes build up junk on them after weeks of use, but this brush is amazingly clean and bright after much use for one month.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Perfect check ups, less tartar buildup.</li>
            <li> If you are fine with that, then this toothbrush will serve you well.  </li>
            <li> However after getting used to it, this brush does a fine job of cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The charge station is very nice and easy to use unless you don&#x27;t have a constant electric source in the bath, like me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finding this information is a huge chore.  </li>
            <li> This would be great for kids as you can get extra heads and the kids</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the Oral-B Smartseries 5000.</li>
            <li> I have always had great experiences with purchasing from Amazon; this definitely was not one of them.  </li>
            <li> Great product overall</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic piece of machinery.  </li>
            <li> This electric (automatic) toothbrush was a fantastic addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it charges, one light will stay on and continue up to 3.  </li>
            <li> great brush and can use multiple heads for whitening, flossing etc.</li>
            <li> I tried a cheap battery powered one, but when I saw that I would be replacing batteries every 3 weeks, it went into the bottom drawer.  </li>
            <li> Skip spending money on cheap battery powered ones too</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> lcd display can be attached to your mirror and believeme, it looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> There are seven brush heads to choose from that fit this brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a good, clear system.  </li>
            <li> However, the more I used it, the more I really began to like</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a significant improvement on the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to see right out of the box and after the first charge that it has much more power, which is a welcome change.  </li>
            <li> Before this, I had the pulsonic, thinking that a sonic toothbrush would do a better job, but I really think this one does a much better job of scrubbing the teeth clean</li>
            <li> timer display is very useful, even if you don&#x27;t have kids.</li>
            <li> Anyway I am more than happy and love the small circular head.</li>
            <li> It might have been better if the unit were designed to allow you to choose the function first, then start the brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve successfully built one terrific toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am so far very pleased with my Oral-B Smartseries 5000 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When I go into my dentist for my annual cleaning she always raves how clean my teeth are.  </li>
            <li> The kit also includes a carrying container for the brush, which keeps it clean in your suitcase or travel bag.  </li>
            <li> It performs well, is easy to use, and comes with a useful set of parts.</li>
            <li> so I know I can also disassemble to spot clean if need be.</li>
            <li> (At current prices, they&#x27;re a bit more than a nice manual toothbrush, but not by much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never had my teeth feel so clean, it is almost unreal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This model comes with the PRECISION CLEAN head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush stays clean after each use.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the cleaning action of the head on the Oral-B design for 6 years now, and since this one works just the same way, though with a bit more power, I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be as happy with this one as with the last.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be able to see what mode you are in on the clock aka smart</li>
            <li> All in all, I give it 5 stars because it works great, love the sensitive mode lacking on the 1000 and my gum line recession has actually improved.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B is slim and attractive looking and has an electronic display for battery power, time, and time spent brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cool to see the two items work in tandem</li>
            <li> If I feel like I need some supplemental cleaning after a full cycle, the toothbrush remains on and</li>
            <li> The stop is longer than the Sonicare, which for me makes it better, and readily noticeable.  </li>
            <li> hooray.. it&#x27;s something you has to do if you want to have the necessary tools to chew your food and look good when smiling</li>
            <li> Excellent product so far based on limited use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Third this brush comes with a light right on the handle to let me know it is charging.  </li>
            <li> It is always more fun to write a positive review about a product and this time is no exception.</li>
            <li> (but I was happy enough for many years and many new brush-heads and one complete replacement of the Sonicare) .</li>
            <li> There is also a handy little travel case for the brush, which is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is also a handy little travel case for the brush, which is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The separate LCD is good but the viewing angle isn&#x27;t great so to see the timer you have to either bend your head down (allowing toothpaste to drip out your mouth) or back up (away from the sink).</li>
            <li> I do use the timer as guidance to receive the right amount of time per quadrant for a full clean and luv that added bonus.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean and my mouth so fresh after brushing.</li>
            <li> They have been great not only for the kids with braces, but for the whole family.  </li>
            <li> I started with the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; setting since I&#x27;m pregnant and that tends to increase the chances of bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> brush notifies you when it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants - it beeps and pauses before continuing on - another touch that would be great for kids both young and old.</li>
            <li> brush notifies you when it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants - it beeps and pauses before continuing on - another touch that would be great for kids both young and old.</li>
            <li> Tremendous - get as a gift to yourself.</li>
            <li> The next best thing to going to your dental hygienist daily.</li>
            <li> i recommend that you charge it full the first time and use it till the battery dies out redo the process don&#x27;t ever leave it on the charger after its fully charged it&#x27;ll just kill the battery!</li>
            <li> At $5 a pop, that&#x27;s a lot more than a normal toothbrush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To find out how long I would have to look at those BRIGHT flashing LEDs before the handle would be fully charged.</li>
            <li> Good for a long vacation, but</li>
            <li> toothbrush seems to be easy to clean and keep clean, and the instructions clearly show how to disassemble the brush to replace the rechargeable battery (if needed)</li>
            <li> I am sure all these modes are fine, but 98 percent of the time I use \\&quot;Daily Clean.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It is also nice that it comes with a carrying case in case you ever want to travel with it (though make sure it is fully charged before you leave because the charger does not fit in the case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for several years, and have always liked them.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush was pricey but with the rebate I felt it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Are all the bells and whistles worth it?</li>
            <li> The 5000 is better for me, however, because I prefer the sensitive mode.</li>
            <li> The timings and warnings might be useful to someone concerned about whether they&#x27;re brushing correctly.  </li>
            <li> The 5 different brush modes are nice.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had one as a child for a heathy smile....</li>
            <li> Worth Every Penney, do yourself a favor and get one today.</li>
            <li> I sort of think that this is more for kids than adults even though this is an adult toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But, if you know you&#x27;re own brushing routine and don&#x27;t need a visual reminder, then I say save yourself some money and get the version without the wireless LCD unit.</li>
            <li> so I am anxious to see if this corrects the issue, but thus far I am super impressed!</li>
            <li> It certainly is the top of the line, but I believe you can get as good an experience with the other models in the Braun/Oral-B stable if your needs/desires are less than my own.</li>
            <li> He was right; it helps me get to hard-to-reach wisdom teeth and ensures I brush thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> In fact in many ways it seemed less a toothbrush and more like the polisher that dentist uses.  </li>
            <li> The Philips brush head was more elongated (vs. the round Oral-B), and the vibration of the Oral-B seemed quite a bit more powerful.</li>
            <li> a small amount of toothpaste does a great job.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about the Oral-B is how much easier it is keep clean than the Philips was.</li>
            <li> the seperate digital monitor great help in timing the 30 second intrevals.  </li>
            <li> With all the features included in this brush, this seems like a pretty good value, considering our last electric toothbrush is 6 years old and counting.</li>
            <li> With all the features included in this brush, this seems like a pretty good value, considering our last electric toothbrush is 6 years old and counting.</li>
            <li> If you need a great toothbrush for less money, they&#x27;re several available.</li>
            <li> My gums seem much healthier and I can really feel that my teeth are clean.  </li>
            <li> YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE BRUSHING TOO HARD GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> The wireless smart timer provides great visual feedback and is something that should be included with all kids&#x27; toothbrushes to help them get in the habit of brushing properly.  </li>
            <li> so now i just use the oral-b 5000 at low speed and my gums are looking better.</li>
            <li> When our first kiddo got braces, we were told to start using an electric toothbrush and purchased two of these.  </li>
            <li> It even has a happy/sad face to indicate if you are using too much pressure!  </li>
            <li> When I first got this, it seemed like more technology than you could possibly need from a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I do my brushing in the shower, so I was worried about using the clock at first</li>
            <li> intimidating(sort of like a first date.)  </li>
            <li> This is a top-quality tooth cleaner, on a par with Oral-B&#x27;s earlier top models.  </li>
            <li> Since there are many reviews already, I&#x27;ll keep my review short and to the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush does make me feel a difference, and i am more efficient when it come to the cleaning since the timer let&#x27;s me know about moving on to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I love is the small space it takes up on my bathroom counter top and the ease of swapping out the tooth</li>
            <li> I think they were also one of the first companies to introduce the electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I would prefer a more streamlined, smaller charging base.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The LCD indicator is currently sitting on my bathroom counter and being used more for a clock than anything else.  </li>
            <li> The small head of a Floss-Action brush head is perfect at reaching those back teeth against the jaw bone and it allows for precision on each tooth.</li>
            <li> But, with use, I have found it helps me keep a consistent brushing pattern.</li>
            <li> Listerine Antiseptic Adult Mouthwash Advanced with Tartar Protection Citrus, 1.5 Liter]]</li>
            <li> Listerine Antiseptic Adult Mouthwash Advanced with Tartar Protection Citrus, 1.5 Liter]]</li>
            <li> I had a Philips Sonicare for over 5 years and it was my first electronic brush</li>
            <li> - I much prefer my OralB 5000!  </li>
            <li> I have used most of them, though I tend to stick with either the Daily Clean or the Deep Clean modes.</li>
            <li> The two extra brush modes are nice -- it has a deep clean mode that lasts for 3 minutes -- but</li>
            <li> I had the original, the Excel, the 3D, the Professional Care, the 1000 and now the 5000.  </li>
            <li> Still, the very visible timer and the different modes make this a better model.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you check the cost of brush-replacements to see how much it will cost you per year overall.  </li>
            <li> The Smartguide sounds good in theory but I can&#x27;t really figure it out or am just too impatient.</li>
            <li> It shows what mode you&#x27;re on, has a circle broken into four quadrants and each quadrant flashes or fills at the appropriate time, it shows stars that fill as each quadrant is completed, has a frown face and red light for too much pressure, and a happy face when the brushing is complete.</li>
            <li> my* toothbrush, while the Philips has been fully given over to my husband.s a circle broken into four quadrants and each quadrant flashes or fills at the appropriate time, it shows stars that fill as each quadrant is completed, has a frown face and red light for too much pressure, and a happy face when the brushing is complete.</li>
            <li> I have not tested all the settings and i am not sure if i will, but the goldbox deal price and the fact that this is the top of the line Oral-b toothbrush, made an easy decision to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I opted for the 5000 series because I liked the idea of being warned when I was brushing too hard and having a nice visual feedback of my brushing results/style and what setting</li>
            <li> plenty long for most trips without needing to recharge.</li>
            <li> and this is the first one that I don&#x27;t like much.  </li>
            <li> The smiley face definitely makes me want to go for the full two minutes!</li>
            <li> I have never owned an electric toothbrush before, so I was a little surprised at how powerful this one is while in use, but the multiple settings allow for sensitive mode, whitening mode, etc., and are all awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare and others far in the past - this works as well cleaning as those, but the timing features are great.</li>
            <li> Had to replace my oral B smart guide which I lost while moving.</li>
            <li> The smart guide monitor tracks the 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model comes with a charger, one head, a traveling case and a separate wireless smart guide unit.</li>
            <li> The Smart Guide takes some explaining.</li>
            <li> They all do the trick, so it is largely a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> so you brush for a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li> Also, the holder for the heads is large and takes up a lot of counter space.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a  Smart Guide which can stand up on the counter or be stuck to the mirror or wall.</li>
            <li> last Oral-B toothbrush was the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]]</li>
            <li> This new one needs to be recharged for the better part of a day if it has been used for several brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The side monitor takes a little getting used to but it is kind of neat.</li>
            <li> This new shape to the stand is stable and won&#x27;t tip over, it is more stable than older model&#x27;s recharging stands which were smaller and just wider than the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I suggest this toothbrush to everyone and occasionally Oral-B has such amazing rebates</li>
            <li> The brush has a built in red (LED) light that starts to flash when you apply too much pressure on your teeth&lt;</li>
            <li> The biggest changes are important but not essential if you are somewhat budget</li>
            <li> It is very misleading.  </li>
            <li> It shows you a running total of time elapsed during brushing, and displays a circle with each quadrant filled in as you brush.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward</li>
            <li> (well, not that fast</li>
            <li> but I can see how it may be helpful to young children when brushing and may add a bit of fun to the process.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the sensor tells if you are exerting too much pressure on the teeth - this is to help prevent enamel abrasion.</li>
            <li> Who really needs a WiFi toothbrush?  </li>
            <li> I deeply appreciate Amazon&#x27;s frustration free packaging.  </li>
            <li> You just pop it out of the box and onto the charger, and once it is powered up you are ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aside from being a regular clock, when you turn on the toothbrush it kicks into brushing mode, and shows a circle with each quadrant filled it as you move along.  </li>
            <li> so much, it has become *</li>
            <li> so much, it has become *</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really need the Smartguide.</li>
            <li> The various modes available, after trying them out, haven&#x27;t been returned to.  </li>
            <li> very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t used this feature much yet.  </li>
            <li> I do think they should have made it to show something much quicker as unless you read the manual closely describing this</li>
            <li> It is much louder than the 1000.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I don&#x27;t see much use for it.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a week straight without a recharge</li>
            <li> The polishing mode is fantastic, and my teeth have never been this white without using a tooth whitener.  </li>
            <li> It does have a gentle mode too, but I haven&#x27;t ever used it.  </li>
            <li> It makes brushing your teeth so much easier.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts the whole week.</li>
            <li> so much cleaner everytime</li>
            <li> and I really missed the electric one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , much like they do after a trip to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Set the time and you will be ready to brush with some charging of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I had switched to a super soft manual brush, but then felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting my teeth clean enough.  </li>
            <li> The power of the toothbrush is much stronger than the ones I have owned before.</li>
            <li> While novel, the timer really doesn&#x27;t add anything to the functionality of the brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you care about your teeth!</li>
            <li> Or you can choose the polishing mode to have a George Clooney&#x27;s smile in no time but, because it is early in the morning, your brain its still booting and there you are brushing your teeth, you&#x27;re no longer forgetting the quadrant you were cleaning because the display will give you all the info you need to know</li>
            <li> absolutely nothing can beat the level of cleanliness</li>
            <li> absolutely nothing can beat the level of cleanliness</li>
            <li> so you need to take that if you will be gone for very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have much preferred a design that could be wall-mounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have much preferred a design that could be wall-mounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed it is quite spendy, but if it lasts more than a few years, I would say that it might be worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I find the different modes very useful.  </li>
            <li> Could be a good thing, but not on a daily basis due to ruining enamel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a great job cleaning, and I even found on the day of transitioning from the old to the new model that my teeth felt instantly cleaner with a bit fewer rough spots (my 6 month cleaning is tomorrow).  </li>
            <li> It does come with a travel case, which is a nice benefit, as it&#x27;s far too large for a typical toothbrush</li>
            <li> Teeth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li> The Deep Clean bumps that up to 45 seconds per quadrant.</li>
            <li> The brushing is pleasant -- not as hard as some other electric toothbrushes -- and it leaves your teeth feeling smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I was finally ready to try something new, this toothbrush turned out a real hit.</li>
            <li> throw away your old electric brush, but if you are ready for an upgrade to a state-of-art model, I recommend this model!</li>
            <li> On a full charge it would last me maybe 3 days.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a number of different brands of electric Toothbrushes over the years and find the Oral-B Smart-series 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush performs in the top 3.</li>
            <li> My check ups are short and sweet.</li>
            <li> caddy holds 4 separate brush heads for 4 different users, and that may be useful for families with kids who share a bathroom and can, thus, share a power toothbrush body, keeping their brush heads separate (different colored rings are available for each brush</li>
            <li> caddy holds 4 separate brush heads for 4 different users, and that may be useful for families with kids who share a bathroom and can, thus, share a power toothbrush body, keeping their brush heads separate (different colored rings are available for each brush</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this toothbrush, although I am convinced that a less pricey model of the same brand would do just as good a job.</li>
            <li> Of all of them, the 1000, while a stripped down model is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The brush automatically beeps (in the daily clean cycle) every 30 seconds to indicate when the recommended two minute brushing time is complete and the SmartGuide has a large quadrant icon showing the stages of brushing.</li>
            <li> Without the timer, you&#x27;d kind of be hard pressed to know if you were on massage mode, deep clean mode, etc.</li>
            <li> The cleaning modes for the brush are Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, and Massage.</li>
            <li> Though I wonder just how sensitive the sensor is because I could not set it off in my mouth and had to push it against my hand to put enough pressure on it to light up.  </li>
            <li> Sure, I brushed twice a day, but it was probably closer to 30 seconds total, rather than 30 seconds for each quarter of my mouth.</li>
            <li> that does a decent job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First (and most obviously) the toothbrush pauses at the 30 second mark.  </li>
            <li> If you are skeptical that electric is better than manual, I can tell you that I am so glad I switched and should have done it years ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to buy in bulk replacement heads from Costco, so the overall maintenance of this product is low.</li>
            <li> I have found that this electric toothbrush actually does a better job of brushing than I could with a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This model, the Smart Series 5000 professional care model has some improvements over the older models which some of us were still using, so I could compare them side by side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For performance and the ability to interchange brush heads throughout the Oral-B line-up (unlike Sonicare models), highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended..</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Older model died, needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really a sign of the times to see just how far we&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> we were very please with the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 (ASIN: B004O76DEC)</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, considering my preference for my old sonic, I&#x27;d probably be happier with the [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic]], a slim, much cheaper sonic model</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, considering my preference for my old sonic, I&#x27;d probably be happier with the [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic]], a slim, much cheaper sonic model</li>
            <li> What I like most about this Electric Toothbrush is that it actually tells you how long to brush as it beeps every thirty seconds (forty-five on one setting) for each quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> If you do not want to use the device it still works as a normal clock...</li>
            <li> and I was feeling pretty much the same about my Sonicare experiences</li>
            <li> Similarly, there&#x27;s a variety of replacement heads available for sensitive, whitening, floss action, etc.</li>
            <li> you own this unit and read the owner manual you realize the unit can be further customized to your personal liking by buying a different replacement head.</li>
            <li> It did not, however, come in normal packaging with the UPC barcode on it.  </li>
            <li> so I plugged it into my bedroom outlet (which is where I normally charge it) and the lights wouldn&#x27;t indicate it was charging.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think the Smartguide is worth paying extra for.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge well, for over a week of normal use for me.  </li>
            <li> I just brush my teeth with it in normal mode.  </li>
            <li> in all, aside from my minor critiques (the \\&quot;cons\\&quot; above), I cannot imagine needing more than this in an electric/rechargeable toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> But the extra money is definitely worth the difference.</li>
            <li> As a nice touch, the piece also has a lid that folds down to cover the brushes to help keep them from getting any extra germs from flushing toilets and the like.</li>
            <li> As a nice touch, the piece also has a lid that folds down to cover the brushes to help keep them from getting any extra germs from flushing toilets and the like.</li>
            <li> nice features include that it actually tells you when you are pressing too hard by alerting you with a red light on the brush.  </li>
            <li> The brush and the smart guide will warn you with red flashing lights if you put too much pressure on your teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a new design to the stand which keeps it plugged into the charger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a new travel case which we appreciate since we do travel with our electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It holds the unit and additional brush heads.s a new travel case which we appreciate since we do travel with our electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> If you do that, it will stay looking new.  </li>
            <li> I feel comfortable that I&#x27;m actually giving myself enough dental attention these days.</li>
            <li> my teeth have never been cleaner, particularly when using the floss action brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Of the 4 modes, I pretty much only use the normal or the polishing mode.  </li>
            <li> i like the fact that if apply to much pressure on my teeth the brush LED light turns red and you can see a sad face notification on my SMART GUIDE that&#x27;s cool!</li>
            <li> : it beeps once for the first quadrant, twice for the second one, and so on.  </li>
            <li> probably ten years ago, and switched to a Phillips Sonicare because I just wasn&#x27;t feeling as refreshed; AND the toothbrush was getting pretty yucky.</li>
            <li> time consuming than ordinary brush and more expensive&lt;</li>
            <li> If you do get it, you better use it or you might as well stick with the ordinary brush.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I like how it peeps to indicate you brushed a specific area significantly.</li>
            <li> , I thought it would last much longer!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see the first of 3 lights shortly.  </li>
            <li> [i regularly keep it on deep clean ]</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a substantial improvement over the power cell in the old Triumph, which didn&#x27;t perform that well even when new.  </li>
            <li> You can also change the settings on the brush to, daily, deep clean, sensitive, whitening and massage mode.  </li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended the Oral-B brand over others on the market for plaque removal (stating that the brushing action is better than the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrushes), I&#x27;m not sure the validity of this claim, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> The whole set ended up costing me $90, so about double of what I normally would pay.</li>
            <li> The Daily clean is exactly what it sounds like - the typical 30 seconds per quadrant that is recommended.</li>
            <li> I ended up contacting Amazon and they allowed me to return it with a restocking fee deducted (I wasn&#x27;t aware of this until the item was in Amazon&#x27;s possession but at least I got most of my refund back).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took awhile to get used to the smaller brush head of the Oral-B toothbrush, but the combination of smaller head and slimmer neck make reaching the back molars much easier than either of the other toothbrushes I own.  </li>
            <li> The regular pulse is pretty darn intense of a vibration and a bit jarring especially for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Its brush head is smaller and less effective than the 5000&#x27;s, and it has only 3 modes rather than 5 and doesn&#x27;t come with a SmartGuide.</li>
            <li> This functional electric toothbrush does the job, but is bulkier and less comfortable than my old Oral-B Sonic Complete (since discontinued).  </li>
            <li> I placed it on my large mirror and it syncs with the toothbrush and not only counts the time brushing, but where to be brushing.  </li>
            <li> This Smart Series 5000 is just as solid.</li>
            <li> For that purpose, the SmartGuide may have some application, but for my purposes, it is of little more use than as a digital clock.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For that purpose, the SmartGuide may have some application, but for my purposes, it is of little more use than as a digital clock.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the feature of letting you know if you are brushing too hard as that will cause gum recession too, but believe the 1000 has that feature as well.</li>
            <li> I kept the old one for traveling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old, darn it.</li>
            <li> With the timer, it makes it much easier to anticipate when to move forward to the next step.</li>
            <li> I also have an [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Care 3000]]</li>
            <li> This review was also updated on 9/07/12 after comparing it to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Floss Action model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mode for floss action requires the use of the floss action head which does not come with this model.</li>
            <li> I already have an [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional 3000 Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
            <li> 5000 is both lighter and bulkier than my old Oral B.  </li>
            <li> is the floss action head, and</li>
            <li> also really like the different setting options.</li>
            <li> With the Sensitive mode, there is a noticeable difference in vibration power.</li>
            <li> How much can actually build</li>
            <li> It cleans teeth really well and tells you when to switch to the next set of teeth.  </li>
            <li> When it is complete, it doesn&#x27;t show the lights anymore.  </li>
            <li> Replacement brush heads for the Oral-B are much cheaper than the Sonicare, which adds another plus, but are similar in price to the A&amp;H replacement brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> reviewer mentioned that it gets gross really fast.  </li>
            <li> There is even a battery life indicator that tells you how much charge is left in the unit.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it flashes red when you are using to much pressure.  </li>
            <li> Our family has been using the Braun / Oral-B since early ninetees and gone through all their generations.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> came was Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush(ASIN: B007VXJK6O), which showed to be an updated version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> were you are, how much time is left and which part of your mouth you&#x27;re supposed to be brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> Sensitive tooth that is a gentler 2 minute brushing cycle.</li>
            <li> B007VXJK6O Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]....  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of use for the accessories (though I am thankful for the addition of a hard-plastic travel case) such as the \\&quot;SmartGuide,\\&quot; which really seems to be designed for parents of toddlers who are teaching their kids how to use a toothbrush.  </li>

            <li> It seems silly, at first, but it makes brushing the right way, for enough time, so easy.</li>
            <li> The basic speed for a daily clean seems to be the same, and the heads and the charger from my old unit are compatible.</li>
            <li> with all Oral-B brushes, the brush head is small and easily navigates over and around your teeth during brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Something that I particularly like, and that is different from the Philips, is that once the brush time is complete, the brush notifies you and then keeps going.</li>
            <li> Something that I particularly like, and that is different from the Philips, is that once the brush time is complete, the brush notifies you and then keeps going.</li>
            <li> You will definitely feel the results after your first brushing sessions and future sessions to come.</li>
            <li> First, it is big and gets larger toward the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it more powerful to begin with, but it holds enough power for at least 8-10 brushings lasting about 3-3:30 minutes each.  </li>
            <li> The timer also signals when you&#x27;re putting on too much pressure by emitting a red light behind the LCD screen when you apply too much force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They sell 6 different brush heads in all, one is for sensitive teeth which is new.</li>
            <li> However, I only saw a bit of pink on the first couple of brushes; after that, no problems even on the normal setting.</li>
            <li> My first impression of this was that it was really rough on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I had a friend who kept raving about this toothbrush and told me that once I started using an electric toothbrush, I wouldn&#x27;t go back to the normal ones</li>
            <li> The timer helped me because I would actually count down while brushing to make sure I went over my teeth several times even though the toothbrush would stop vibrating every 30 seconds to signal you to move on to the next area.</li>
            <li> The other problem is that it is kind of fun to see the sad face popping up, so I find myself brushing incorrectly on purpose just to see</li>
            <li> The other problem is that it is kind of fun to see the sad face popping up, so I find myself brushing incorrectly on purpose just to see</li>
            <li> They both pause when it is time to move to a new brushing zone and have the pressure sensor that lights a red LED when you press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (This is a new charger design than the former 5000 series model had, that one could be used in Europe.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> : LED battery indicator lights - way too bright, flashy - not necessarily an improvement.</li>
            <li> It has different settings, so if your gums are sensitive, you could start on the sensitive gum setting.</li>
            <li> also found that with the timer, it was much easier to see what mode it was currently working under as this model has five different modes to choose from.</li>
            <li> The Whitening mode might work, but the only way to really know would be to use only that for a time and then check for any difference.</li>
            <li> The accompanying monitor is very helpful in performing the proper brushing time for your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only remark concerns the charging time.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good system that keeps you on track without getting too complicated.  </li>
            <li> Has a timer/detector that comes with it, and a indicator light when you brush to hard, or not hard enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m deducting a star because I think the 4000 series is just fine without the need for the LCD monitor about how hard you are brushing your teeth and the LCD countdown timer.  </li>
            <li> and I was apprehensive that I would have major damage on my gums.  </li>
            <li> this Smartseries toothbrush enough for it to last that long, but more generally I&#x27;d like to see Oral-B and other vendors provide replaceable battery packs.  </li>

            <li> but it eventually went down to the red light (low battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first glance, even down to the accessories, it looks nearly identical to the old \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot; model, functions almost identically, and even takes the same heads.  </li>
            <li> This machine solves the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra timer accessory is a bit odd, but at least it is a way to keep track of good brushing habits.</li>
            <li> This subtle 30 second remind is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> While I loved that old \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot; model, my one complaint was that the battery didn&#x27;t hold a very sizable charge, and with age it just got worse -- at the time of my replacing it, it was only holding enough charge for about 2 brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the new [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> like the fact that the brush warns if you&#x27;re brushing too hard: there&#x27;s a light on the handle and a prompt on the SmartGuide.</li>
            <li> wireless function is mostly meant to show you when to move to the next quadrant of your mouth, as well as display the current brushing mode, a clock, and a warning if you are pressing too hard--</li>
            <li> The SmartSeries 5000 is a step up from my old brush, but not a giant step.  </li>
            <li> brush has several cleaning settings, depending on how vigorously or softly you wish to brush.  </li>
            <li> They market this same basic device calling it floss action and that model has the floss action head not the precision cleaning brush head.</li>
            <li> There is the standard recommended 2-minute mode, a 4-minute mode for deep-cleaning, a sensitive mode, a polishing mode, and a gum massage.  </li>
            <li> There is the standard recommended 2-minute mode, a 4-minute mode for deep-cleaning, a sensitive mode, a polishing mode, and a gum massage.  </li>
            <li> Be it a different technology or a smaller head, my teeth feel much, much cleaner since I bought it, especially at the gum lines, where I always had problems.</li>
            <li> I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this.</li>
            <li> The old unit had an ENORMOUS, bulky (transformer?)</li>
            <li> With earlier models, you&#x27;d have to rely on the toothbrush itself to signal you when it was time to move to a different area of your mouth, which they would normally do with a timed vibration.</li>
            <li> This may seem a bit unnecessary to some, but I find that I do brush longer and better with this</li>
            <li> It has all the same features as my old brush: the brush signals when you have completed a quadrant and lets you know to move on, and a red light turns on when you are pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> me, the separate readout unit with timer and other features hasn&#x27;t been of much use.  </li>
            <li> It buzzes when it&#x27;s time to change, and there&#x27;s a red light that comes on when you&#x27;re pressing too hard to brush.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The display (and toothbrush) also flash a red light if you are brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I expected too much, but I thought my teeth would feel like I had just left my dentist.</li>
            <li> I have found that there are times when I just want to cover a spot a little more thoroughly or want a little extra brush time.</li>
            <li> I have found that there are times when I just want to cover a spot a little more thoroughly or want a little extra brush time.</li>
            <li> The head is a little thick (vs my Sonic heads), meaning I have to brush with my mouth kind of open (toothpaste dribble).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve played around with all of them, although I generally default to the standard 2-minute mode, followed by some time with the gum massage.  </li>

            <li> For children that are learning to brush, having the visuals would be extremely helpful, particularly for the quadrant times and the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I had to replace the older model 5000 Smartseries (the one with the LCD battery indicator window in the handle) due to accidental damage to the notched metal spindle that holds the brush head in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush head that came with the electric brush (floss action head) felt pretty hard to the touch</li>
            <li> I am not sure why there are  bad reviews for this brush, been using it for almost a year, works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The charging time is much much longer compared to the previous model&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> did not even realize that with my old system, I was not brushing for long enough and</li>
            <li> Also, the toothbrush has a lot of cool settings for heavier and lighter sessions, and a small interface showing you how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
            <li> Be ready for your gums to bleed a little for the first few days if you aren&#x27;t used to an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This series comes with a base charger that is more fancy than the regular bases because this one is larger with a covered clear compartment to the right where you can store your spare brush heads.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine until approximately 4 months after purchasing it</li>
            <li> That will encourage little ones to brush the whole 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get used to an electric toothbrush, but it is definately worth the effort and the expense.</li>
            <li> At least the batteries in this new model are NIMH, which neither have a \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot; nor are particularly toxic if you throw the unit away.  </li>

            <li> It was very hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li> The brush has a pressure sensor in it that activates a red light in the handle if you are pressing down to hard on your teeth as your brush.  </li>
            <li> I like to think I have been brushing long enough ever since, but I have a sinking suspicion that I may be undercutting my brushing, especially when I am in a rush.  </li>
            <li> Using the Sonicare, sometimes I don&#x27;t know it has stopped briefly as it doesn&#x27;t stop long enough.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;ve been in the business long enough that the basic functionality just works.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my teeth did not feel at all clean!</li>
            <li> SmartGuide initially seemed a little over-the-top to me, but I can see how it would be extremely handy for a family with children who used an Oral-B brush as well.</li>
            <li> I usually brush for 4 minutes, which may be too much, but 2 or 3 minutes just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> or maybe I am just keeping my mouth open too long, but my mouth never gets sore after brushing, but my mouth gets sore after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When you activate your toothbrush it sends a signal to the SmartGuide and shows how long you have been brushing your teeth and with the use of multiple icons how well you have been doing.  </li>
            <li> Only time will tell if I or my dentist will notice improved oral health in the long run.</li>
            <li> I just hope the battery life is long, but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> IT HAS A LONG LASTING BATTERY ,</li>
            <li> The charge/storage stand is a flat thing meant to sit on the counter, unlike my Sonic&#x27;s wall-mount.</li>
            <li> The charge/storage stand is a flat thing meant to sit on the counter, unlike my Sonic&#x27;s wall-mount.</li>
            <li> My only complaint in the battery department is that this unit charges even more slowly than its predecessor, which used to recharge overnight.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY not super positive comment I would have about this is what a previous review stated about \\&quot;drooling\\&quot; onto the countertop</li>
            <li> brand new mouth everyday...</li>
            <li> brand new mouth everyday...</li>
            <li> so if you want to get rid of absolutely everything like tartar and cavities and bad breath you can complement the fantastic job of this brush with the [[ASIN:</li>

            <li> The 5000 is less bulky and seems to hold a charge longer as well, nearly 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The case not only keeps the brush heads from being crushed but it protects the actual device.</li>
            <li> The case not only keeps the brush heads from being crushed but it protects the actual device.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not real clear at what to do at the start, so</li>
            <li> This confused me at first, so I will repeat: the unit has different cleaning modes but for each you need a different head, each are purchased</li>
            <li> It holds a charge long enough that two of us can use it without needing to charge it every single</li>
            <li> I originally started using an electric toothbrush because a problem with my thumb joints made it difficult to hold a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B stops briefly, and long enough every 30 seconds so that you can stop and start brushing other quadrants of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The unit is a little loud, but you get used to</li>
            <li> I am using the charging base from my older 3D, which is more compact and holds 4 heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> The machine separates your mouth into 4 quadrants and it acts like a mini-timer telling you if you&#x27;ve brushed long enough, if you&#x27;re brushing too hard, too soft, etc.</li>
            <li> When I was a kid, my mother put an hourglass in the bathroom to give us an idea just how long we should be brushing our teeth were.  </li>
            <li> how long you have brushing and tells the time when the brush is not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pause that lets me know I need to change where I&#x27;m brushing is a bit too long, esp.</li>
            <li> should you be forgetful (such as when you are groggy in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a timer/clock that comes with it that times how long to brush.</li>
            <li> I am curious to see what my dentist says next month when I go for my checkup.  </li>
            <li> I am not getting 10 days of use between charges (maybe 4, but I always charge it before it is \\&quot;empty\\&quot; because it takes so darn long to recharge)but</li>
            <li> The battery life is long and I can take it with me as I travel for a couple weeks at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the wireless display that tells you how long you have been brushing your teeth is all show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would recommend this toothbrush for all adults, but iffy for kids, as they always brush too long with these brushes as I have learned.</li>
            <li> Regular 2 minute brush (30 sec per quarter).</li>
            <li> Longer cleaning 3 minute deep cleaning (45 sec.</li>
            <li> The manual states that 40 mins (from empty) will give you enough charge for a 2-minute brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral-B is just one long piece that clicks on, no big empty space that feel the need to fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought the old brush was a 5-star product, so I can&#x27;t see that this one is anything less than a 5-star product either!  </li>

            <li> The only drawback I can think of is that a smaller head makes brushing your tongue slightly less convenient.</li>
            <li> May be less likely to be accidentally knocked over; however, the pylon is relatively short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gripe:</li>
            <li> but it is not soft enough as the other Oral B products have proven.</li>
            <li> Other than where the tooth brush connects, there isn&#x27;t anyplace for water to penetrate and create a slimy mess like I had with the last major brand</li>
            <li> When you are done brushing, the clock displays the total brushing time for a little while before going back to displaying the time.  </li>
            <li> It lacks the lower speed of the other models, which is my only complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing that flustered me just a tiny little bit, were the instructions.  </li>
            <li> I was recommended by my dentist to use an electric toothbrush since I have a dry mouth which often causes tooth decay.</li>
            <li> The cord for the recharger base is short; would be nice if it were a bit</li>
            <li> The kit includes a single brush head.  </li>
            <li> I had the previous model, with the timer on the handle, and I didn&#x27;t like not knowing how long I had brushed.  </li>
            <li> Someone must have complained how hard it was to clean and they switched to this setup.  </li>
            <li> If you prefer a rotary brush, try the next step down, the [[ASIN:B007VXJK6E Oral-B Smartseries 4000]], which is a bit cheaper and omits the wireless</li>
            <li> If you prefer a rotary brush, try the next step down, the [[ASIN:B007VXJK6E Oral-B Smartseries 4000]], which is a bit cheaper and omits the wireless</li>
            <li> This model of the Oral-B offers a remote timer that also warns if you&#x27;re pushing too hard against your teeth, the remote has a LCD screen you watch while brushing, it also reverts to a digital clock after brushing.</li>
            <li> I had less tartar on my teeth the last time I went in for a dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li> A standard manual brush can work too too, but it takes less effort when using a brush like the 5000.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t care about the bells and whistles or the multiple modes, the 1000 is less than 1/3rd the cost.</li>
            <li> While marketed as a travel tooth brush the charger takes only 110 Volt (the previous model works at 230V as well)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The only differences seem to be the lack of timer and two less cleaning modes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I would recommend the Oral-B 3000 instead of this brush, since it&#x27;s basically the same thing, but retails for $30 - $50 less, depending on where you get it.</li>
            <li> In fact, I only bought the model that had this feature because the Gold Box sale price was less than that of the lower level series without it.  </li>
            <li> i was a bit confused about the \\&quot;smart guide \\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;d rather save a little money and just get the brush.</li>
            <li> it is big enough that it make it hard to recommend is that my mouth always feels sore after using it.  </li>
            <li> The only one I haven&#x27;t used is the Massage mode, as I simply have a hard time imagining why I would need it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you press too hard, you get a sad face on the display along with the red light on the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> used my old Oral-B Sonic Complete for 6 years before its batteries (soldered in, officially non-replaceable) finally failed.</li>

            <li> The brush handle has a solid feel, without being too heavy to hold.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to drop it when brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Indicators on remote guide panel are easier to read and icons are improved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been partial to Oral-B electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> not really essential.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For those who already have a previous model - this brush cannot be charged by the previous model&#x27;s charging unit - it is simply not possible physically - it does not fit).</li>
            <li> It feels awkward in my hand, whereas all the other models are comfortable.  </li>
            <li> When done brushing, rinse the head with the toothbrush running, then remove the head and rinse down the hole in the bottom of the head then rinse the body of the brush and towel dry before putting it in the charger.  </li>
            <li> at the same time the pause isn&#x27;t long enough for me to get annoyed.  </li>
            <li> Just feel gimmicky and not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The head is different as well, with little whip-like brushes that seek out those hidden areas on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The snap-on base holds several brush heads so you can conveniently keep your heads organized and is dishwasher-safe for easy sterilization/clean-</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t consider any other device.</li>
            <li> The motor is a bit louder than other Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> but there were no more left on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s intuitive to use (other than a couple of things like setting the clock) and seems to get my teeth cleaner than when I brush with a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This stand holds other brush heads if other family members are sharing the unit with you.</li>
            <li> I have owned other electric toothbrushes including other Oral-B&#x27;s, but this has a couple of</li>
            <li> The head on this toothbrush is small enough to make that</li>
            <li> Not so with the other models.  </li>
            <li> other item that I could have done without was the clock/brush monitor.</li>
            <li> You can read plenty of reviews about its features in other reviews</li>
            <li> I recommend this over the Sonicare due to all the features.</li>
            <li> the other hand, when using the 3000 model, sometimes I forgot what was the part of my mouth</li>
            <li> There were other models available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the wireless issues, some other quibbles I had:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I used a manual toothbrush my dentist constantly reminded me to get behind my back molars.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bulkier, but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me even though I have small hands.  </li>
            <li> I found that I had actually been brushing too hard before I got this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> And it would be simple enough to have the unit beep or slow down when pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;my gums where looking bad with red marks small bumps,  reseeding gums useing the oral-b 5000 at full speed  </li>
            <li> I tested the battery life and found that it did last at least the 10 days it promises with twice-daily brushing, so</li>
            <li> For $109, it&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint on the Oral-B is that it continues brushing after two minutes, although I believe there is a way to program it in the manual</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that sometimes the residual moisture from the brush head drips down and gets on my countertop.  </li>
            <li> It sounds like the revving of a race car engine - up and down - the entire cycle (at least according to my Nascar-crazy husband).</li>
            <li> and there were a couple of times that I set it down</li>
            <li> This means you must look down while brushing to see it</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t even tell if it was slowing down.  </li>
            <li> We brush according to the instructions and have very little tartar or plaque buildup, no bleeding gums, and no new cavities.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Other than being a little noisey</li>
            <li> The lights on the unit are intuitive: there are green indicators for charging state, and a red indicator that lets you know if you are \\&quot;pushing\\&quot; too hard with the brush.  </li>
            <li> the fact that a display gives you the time of the day, the elapsed brushing time, gives you an alarm when you press your brush against your teeth too hard, and put a silly smile decreases the anxiety created by the fact</li>
            <li> I had my previous machine for 5 years, no issues.</li>
            <li> The subtle beep will let you know that its time to switch to the next quadrant.  </li>
            <li> It is subtle enough to remind without interrupting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why, having owned the previous version 5000, did I need a user&#x27;s guide?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to the previous version which I would give 4.5 stars, the changes are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It indicates how long to brush in each area, warns you if you&#x27;re pushing too hard, and also is a clock.</li>
            <li> but the 5000 is just too big for his hands and not good for a child in my opinion</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s not easy to look down while brushing!)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> My wife prefers the polishing mode, I think because of the little diamond that shows up on the display when you are using it.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;To start off with, it took a little bit to get used to.</li>
            <li> To start, you&#x27;ll need a little patience once you set up this toothbrush to charge the battery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to receiving the Oral-B 5000, I had used its little brother, the Oral-B 3000.</li>
            <li> At each of my cleanings, the hygienist always compliments me on how little plaque I have, so that&#x27;s a compliment to the Oral-B design as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I share the base with my husband, and the charge lasts fine for two people.</li>
            <li> It is a little harsh on the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t give it five stars since it is a little gimmicky with the wireless features.</li>
            <li> I do not think it is harsh on my gums at all.</li>
            <li> It can get anywhere in my mouth, even behind my last molars.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, I got the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 and have had a chance to use it</li>
            <li> the brush unit itself, the kit comes with a clock, which has two purposes: (1) to monitor how long you brush for each day, and (2) to serve as a regular digital clock.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few quibbles.</li>
            <li> One downside is that the toothbrush case (not the blue one but the one that&#x27;s part of the charging base) does get kind of dirty after awhile.</li>
            <li> The base for storing heads is also very useful.</li>
            <li> The base where the toothbrush sits on to charge gets a little gunky too and for some reason after a week or two, it became kind of difficult to slide the brush head onto the metal part of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like that the brush head is small and round.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing inherently wrong with the toothbrush but in my opinion, it has a lot of needless bells and whistles, which make it more difficult and complex to operate, too large and the LCD display takes up needless counter space.  </li>
            <li> the little flat \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; felt, well, weird.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush for the past four years and regret</li>
            <li> This is a small wireless device (comes with optional wall mount)</li>
            <li> I was not able to get the rebate with the information that was provided on the box that I received this product in.  </li>
            <li> In the past I used a [[ASIN:B0019ZGU1S Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite R732]]</li>
            <li> However, it does not stay on the selected cycle, it randomly cycles thru several speeds.</li>
            <li> Not sure if there was buildup in there</li>
            <li> In the past, I have bought Oral-B electric toothbrushes in the 30-50$ range.</li>
            <li> me, brushing my teeth is one of the most boring things I can do with my time,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also prefer to have a brushing-mode indicator on a small screen on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That gets tedious if you brush several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like</li>
            <li> Also included is the charger, which can be used as a simple base for the brush or expanded into a holder for up to three brush heads if you have multiple people using the unit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could say anything negative about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I always had one of the less expensive models.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and I was pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> Also like the timer and when you press too hard, it warns you to ease off.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> It also lets you know if you&#x27;re pushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I am one who always presses too hard, and when I change toothbrushes, I always get irritation spots until I break the toothbrush in.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint, and</li>
            <li> So do not expect a rebate if offered, at least from the buyer I bought it from.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit awkward to start the unit then change functions while the brush is in your mouth, but if you do it differently toothpaste flies around!  </li>
            <li> at least one</li>
            <li> to hear that the toothbrush is now garbage - actually worse because the battery is toxic waste and needs to be disposed of through a specialty recycler.</li>
            <li> The snap on base can be seperated so that you need very little space for brush in medicine cabinet or on counter if you are a single user and don&#x27;t need the other brush head storage.</li>
            <li> For people with very small hands, the brush might feel a bit</li>
            <li> If this looks very expensive, remember you can use the very same toothbrush for all your family by just changing the brushes.</li>
            <li> If this looks very expensive, remember you can use the very same toothbrush for all your family by just changing the brushes.</li>
            <li> I thought this was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Second, the directions are vague and I am unable to problem solve the issue.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about needing the little timer but find it helpful.</li>
            <li> With the old brush, there was a base that collected that.</li>
            <li> A major plus in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The charger and base unit separate if need be (e.g. travel)</li>
            <li> People with small mouths might find it uncomfortable</li>
            <li> This seems to me like an unnecessary touch (but my 4-year-old finds it interesting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The travel case is bulky and somewhat unnecessary if you don&#x27;t plan to use it when traveling.</li>
            <li> It was annoying because the Sonicare does that, and when my two minutes are up with the Oral-B, I remove from my mouth only to get sprayed with toothpaste on my shirt (which stains).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> Speaking of cost, replacement brush heads are rather expensive as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Silly as it sounds</li>
            <li> The Philips brush required a big piece that was screwed on, and all kinds of gunk and nasty would build up under there.</li>
            <li> I take the A&amp;H one with me on vacation because I don&#x27;t want to lose, by hook or by crook, an expensive toothbrush ($100</li>
            <li> but oh boy, I was sooo wrong...</li>
            <li> It also has a largely useless wireless function, and some suboptimal design choices.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I was a kid, my mother put an hourglass in the bathroom to give us an idea just how long we should be brushing our teeth were.  I like to think I have been brushing long enough ever since, but I have a sinking suspicion that I may be undercutting my brushing, especially when I am in a rush.  What I like most about this Electric Toothbrush is that it actually tells you how long to brush as it beeps every thirty seconds (forty-five on one setting) for each quadrant of your mouth.  It even comes with a clock that counts up giving you an idea how long you have brushing and tells the time when the brush is not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other nice features include that it actually tells you when you are pressing too hard by alerting you with a red light on the brush.  Though I wonder just how sensitive the sensor is because I could not set it off in my mouth and had to push it against my hand to put enough pressure on it to light up.  It is also nice that it comes with a carrying case in case you ever want to travel with it (though make sure it is fully charged before you leave because the charger does not fit in the case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Electric Toothbrush is about as effective as the one that I replaced it with in that it does a very good job making you mouth feel as clean as you can get without a trip to the dentist.  My biggest complaint, and it is big enough that it make it hard to recommend is that my mouth always feels sore after using it.  Maybe this is too big for my mouth or maybe I am just keeping my mouth open too long, but my mouth never gets sore after brushing, but my mouth gets sore after using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> bad for gums&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my gums where looking bad with red marks small bumps,  reseeding gums useing the oral-b 5000 at full speed  so now i just use the oral-b 5000 at low speed and my gums are looking better.</li>
            <li> When our first kiddo got braces, we were told to start using an electric toothbrush and purchased two of these.  They have been great not only for the kids with braces, but for the whole family.  We brush according to the instructions and have very little tartar or plaque buildup, no bleeding gums, and no new cavities.&lt;br /&gt;The timer display is very useful, even if you don&#x27;t have kids.</li>
            <li> Bought this on the recommendation of my dentist.  He was right; it helps me get to hard-to-reach wisdom teeth and ensures I brush thoroughly.  The timer is a great help, much better than the one in my head!</li>
            <li> Had to replace my oral B smart guide which I lost while moving. Didn&#x27;t consider any other device. It makes me want to brush my teeth. Teeth feel extra clean. The smart guide monitor tracks the 2 minutes. Perfect check ups, less tartar buildup. I had my previous machine for 5 years, no issues. Replace brushes every 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I think this toothbrush is great.  I had the previous model, with the timer on the handle, and I didn&#x27;t like not knowing how long I had brushed.  With this model, the timer is visible.  I kept the old one for traveling.  I do not think it is harsh on my gums at all. It has different settings, so if your gums are sensitive, you could start on the sensitive gum setting. My only complaint is that sometimes the residual moisture from the brush head drips down and gets on my countertop.  With the old brush, there was a base that collected that. Someone must have complained how hard it was to clean and they switched to this setup.  Still, the very visible timer and the different modes make this a better model.  It tells you when the brush head needs replaced too.  I like that the brush head is small and round.  It can get anywhere in my mouth, even behind my last molars.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was initially hesitant on spending the extra money for this type of toothbrush which in hindsight I wish I would have purchased this years ago!  This is hands down the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  When I go into my dentist for my annual cleaning she always raves how clean my teeth are.  The battery life is great, the timer feature is awesome and it&#x27;s extremely comfortable.  I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could say anything negative about this toothbrush.  The ONLY not super positive comment I would have about this is what a previous review stated about \\&quot;drooling\\&quot; onto the countertop but I&#x27;ve learned to deal with this by just making sure my lips are sealed when I brush.  I suggest this toothbrush to everyone and occasionally Oral-B has such amazing rebates it&#x27;s a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> It is always more fun to write a positive review about a product and this time is no exception. I have been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush for the past four years and regret I did not switch over many years before. My teeth definitely feel cleaner after a two minute session and my dentist assures me that my gums are healthier. The SmartSeries 5000 is a step up from my old brush, but not a giant step.  The basic speed for a daily clean seems to be the same, and the heads and the charger from my old unit are compatible. The biggest changes are important but not essential if you are somewhat budget minded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with a charger, one head, a traveling case and a separate wireless smart guide unit. The cleaning modes for the brush are Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, Whitening, and Massage. I am sure all these modes are fine, but 98 percent of the time I use \\&quot;Daily Clean.\\&quot; The Smart Guide takes some explaining. This is a small wireless device (comes with optional wall mount) that is basically a timer for your brush cycles.  When you activate your toothbrush it sends a signal to the SmartGuide and shows how long you have been brushing your teeth and with the use of multiple icons how well you have been doing.  It even has a happy/sad face to indicate if you are using too much pressure!  If you do not want to use the device it still works as a normal clock... The brush automatically beeps (in the daily clean cycle) every 30 seconds to indicate when the recommended two minute brushing time is complete and the SmartGuide has a large quadrant icon showing the stages of brushing. I laughed when I saw this, but now I am hooked and watch the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t throw away your old electric brush, but if you are ready for an upgrade to a state-of-art model, I recommend this model!</li>
            <li> It was hard to get used to an electric toothbrush, but it is definately worth the effort and the expense.</li>
            <li> this product is AWESOME ! i was a bit confused about the \\&quot;smart guide \\&quot;  but once i read the Manuel it was easy to deal with....5 modes of brushing [i regularly keep it on deep clean ] i like the fact that if apply to much pressure on my teeth the brush LED light turns red and you can see a sad face notification on my SMART GUIDE that&#x27;s cool! :) i recommend that you charge it full the first time and use it till the battery dies out redo the process don&#x27;t ever leave it on the charger after its fully charged it&#x27;ll just kill the battery! once it&#x27;s fully charged the battery LED light will turn off on its own! GREAT PRODUCT !</li>
            <li> Other than being a little noisey I love this toothbrush.  I do want to comment on the rebate that was offered with this product.  I was not able to get the rebate with the information that was provided on the box that I received this product in.  It is very misleading.  You will not be able to get the refund without the acutal packaging that the toothbrush originally came in. This toothbrush must have been put in another package before it was sent to me although it had a \\&quot;label\\&quot; on it. I did send it in for the rebate but it was returned to me and I was told that it was not the correct label.  So do not expect a rebate if offered, at least from the buyer I bought it from.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for several years, and have always liked them.  Previously, I always had one of the less expensive models.  A few weeks ago, I got the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 and have had a chance to use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are my impressions...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL IMPRESSION&lt;br /&gt;Generally, this is a high-quality item.  The brush handle has a solid feel, without being too heavy to hold.  The lights on the unit are intuitive: there are green indicators for charging state, and a red indicator that lets you know if you are \\&quot;pushing\\&quot; too hard with the brush.  Everything looks good, is well designed, and works as advertised.  The motor is a bit louder than other Oral-B electric toothbrushes.  The instructions are good, and do a fine job explaining all the features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INCLUDED PARTS&lt;br /&gt;Besides the brush unit itself, the kit comes with a clock, which has two purposes: (1) to monitor how long you brush for each day, and (2) to serve as a regular digital clock.  The clock is actually useful and attractive, and easy to read.  The kit also includes a carrying container for the brush, which keeps it clean in your suitcase or travel bag.  I found the container quite convenient when I traveled with the brush.  Also included is the charger, which can be used as a simple base for the brush or expanded into a holder for up to three brush heads if you have multiple people using the unit.  The kit includes a single brush head.  Everything is packed neatly and easy to set up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EASE OF USE&lt;br /&gt;The brush has several cleaning settings, depending on how vigorously or softly you wish to brush.  There are two buttons -- one to start the unit and another to toggle through the various settings.  It&#x27;s a bit awkward to start the unit then change functions while the brush is in your mouth, but if you do it differently toothpaste flies around!  It might have been better if the unit were designed to allow you to choose the function first, then start the brush.  But the awkwardness disappears after you get accustomed to the unit.  After a couple of days, I did it without thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushing unit itself has a good gripping surface that makes it easy to hold.  For people with very small hands, the brush might feel a bit large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all Oral-B brushes, the brush head is small and easily navigates over and around your teeth during brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush \\&quot;beeps\\&quot; at various intervals, letting you know which \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; of teeth you should be finishing: it beeps once for the first quadrant, twice for the second one, and so on.  This is a good, clear system.  The digital clock is connected to the brush via radio signal. It shows you a running total of time elapsed during brushing, and displays a circle with each quadrant filled in as you brush.  Overall, this is a good system that keeps you on track without getting too complicated.  When you are done brushing, the clock displays the total brushing time for a little while before going back to displaying the time.  The clock even displays a smiley face when you&#x27;re done. This seems to me like an unnecessary touch (but my 4-year-old finds it interesting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Smartseries 5000 is a great electric toothbrush.  It performs well, is easy to use, and comes with a useful set of parts.</li>
            <li> Probably the best toothbrush available.  Our dentist recommended it and I&#x27;m glad they did. The timer helps me make sure I have done an efficient job brushinf my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the 4000 Oral-B but there were no more left on Amazon.  I was skeptical about needing the little timer but find it helpful. Sometime I do lose track of where I&#x27;m am in the cycle.  I find the different modes very useful.  The polishing mode has helped brighten my teeth more than special toothpastes.  I had less tartar on my teeth the last time I went in for a dental cleaning.  My gums have always given me problems and this check-up there has been an improvement as noted by the dental hygienist.  The toothbrush was pricey but with the rebate I felt it was worth it.  I would recommend this toothbrush for anyone who has gum problems and tartar buildup.</li>
            <li> I thought this was ridiculous. A fancy toothbrush with a monitor to tell me what to do? I&#x27;m 31 years old, darn it. I know how to brush my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just kidding. I found I wasn&#x27;t doing it nearly enough. Sure, I brushed twice a day, but it was probably closer to 30 seconds total, rather than 30 seconds for each quarter of my mouth. Oh, and I was pressing too hard. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The monitor. It seems silly, at first, but it makes brushing the right way, for enough time, so easy. It indicates how long to brush in each area, warns you if you&#x27;re pushing too hard, and also is a clock. We didn&#x27;t have a clock in the bathroom before. Randomly handy.&lt;br /&gt;- The toothbrush itself. It buzzes when it&#x27;s time to change, and there&#x27;s a red light that comes on when you&#x27;re pressing too hard to brush.&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life is excellent. It holds a charge long enough that two of us can use it without needing to charge it every single day.&lt;br /&gt;- It does come with a travel case, which is a nice benefit, as it&#x27;s far too large for a typical toothbrush case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The replacement brush heads are quite expensive. At $5 a pop, that&#x27;s a lot more than a normal toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s rather expensive. Are all the bells and whistles worth it? I&#x27;m pretty sure. I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare and others far in the past - this works as well cleaning as those, but the timing features are great. I feel comfortable that I&#x27;m actually giving myself enough dental attention these days.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these over time.  I quit trying to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush comes with a separate timer that activates wirelessly the moment you power up the toothbrush. With earlier models, you&#x27;d have to rely on the toothbrush itself to signal you when it was time to move to a different area of your mouth, which they would normally do with a timed vibration. With the timer, it makes it much easier to anticipate when to move forward to the next step. It&#x27;s really cool to see the two items work in tandem and it&#x27;s really a sign of the times to see just how far we&#x27;ve come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found that with the timer, it was much easier to see what mode it was currently working under as this model has five different modes to choose from. Without the timer, you&#x27;d kind of be hard pressed to know if you were on massage mode, deep clean mode, etc. The timer also signals when you&#x27;re putting on too much pressure by emitting a red light behind the LCD screen when you apply too much force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very impressive product and I&#x27;m more than happy to recommend it for those in the market for a new electric toothbrush. It has enough modes so it guarantees you will find at least one that&#x27;s perfect for you.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun toothbrush (before they co-branded with Oral-B) probably ten years ago, and switched to a Phillips Sonicare because I just wasn&#x27;t feeling as refreshed; AND the toothbrush was getting pretty yucky. It was very hard to keep clean. Fast forward (well, not that fast I guess) to 2012 and I was feeling pretty much the same about my Sonicare experiences (but I was happy enough for many years and many new brush-heads and one complete replacement of the Sonicare) . SO I decided to give the Braun/Oral-B a try after seeing it at my dentist&#x27;s office twice a year. I opted for the 5000 series because I liked the idea of being warned when I was brushing too hard and having a nice visual feedback of my brushing results/style and what setting I had selected.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, I said setting, as this toothbrush has different settings based on how you need/want to brush and the type of [replacement] head you are using.&lt;br /&gt;What an incredible difference in results! My mouth definitely feels fresher than it has in a while and I haven&#x27;t changed toothpastes either. I often cheated the Sonicare countdown on which quadrant of my teeth I should be cleaning but find that with the feedback of the Braun display I don&#x27;t. I spend about ten seconds of each quadrant cycle on the front tops and backs (each) of my teeth. If I feel like I need some supplemental cleaning after a full cycle, the toothbrush remains on and I just circle back.&lt;br /&gt;There are a nice variety of replacement heads/brushes available for a variety of styles and needs.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush seems to be easy to clean and keep clean, and the instructions clearly show how to disassemble the brush to replace the rechargeable battery (if needed) so I know I can also disassemble to spot clean if need be. A major plus in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The charger and base unit separate if need be (e.g. travel) so the charging base is quite compact. The snap-on base holds several brush heads so you can conveniently keep your heads organized and is dishwasher-safe for easy sterilization/clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice travel case that will keep the brush safe as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this toothbrush and heartily recommend it to anyone. It certainly is the top of the line, but I believe you can get as good an experience with the other models in the Braun/Oral-B stable if your needs/desires are less than my own. They&#x27;ve successfully built one terrific toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am so far very pleased with my Oral-B Smartseries 5000 toothbrush. It&#x27;s intuitive to use (other than a couple of things like setting the clock) and seems to get my teeth cleaner than when I brush with a manual toothbrush. The SmartGuide lets you know when you&#x27;ve brushed the recommended 2 minutes and even signals to move to the next quadrant of your mouth every 30 seconds. This may seem a bit unnecessary to some, but I find that I do brush longer and better with this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that the brush warns if you&#x27;re brushing too hard: there&#x27;s a light on the handle and a prompt on the SmartGuide. I tested the battery life and found that it did last at least the 10 days it promises with twice-daily brushing, so plenty long for most trips without needing to recharge. The included travel case makes that convenient. The different settings are another plus. I started with the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; setting since I&#x27;m pregnant and that tends to increase the chances of bleeding gums. However, I only saw a bit of pink on the first couple of brushes; after that, no problems even on the normal setting. Similarly, there&#x27;s a variety of replacement heads available for sensitive, whitening, floss action, etc. (At current prices, they&#x27;re a bit more than a nice manual toothbrush, but not by much.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s plenty to like about this brush. The only drawback I can think of is that a smaller head makes brushing your tongue slightly less convenient. Only time will tell if I or my dentist will notice improved oral health in the long run. Until then, my teeth feel cleaner and this has been pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> I had the Phillips Sonic brush and I like that one until I found this one.  I have never had my teeth feel so clean, it is almost unreal.  The electronic counter is wonderful too.  I placed it on my large mirror and it syncs with the toothbrush and not only counts the time brushing, but where to be brushing.  I love it.  I have nothing but good to say about it and now switch between the two brushes, this and the Sonic.  This would be great for kids as you can get extra heads and the kids could watch the timer, getting them to actually put their brushing time in, one that you can actually check.  The charge station is very nice and easy to use unless you don&#x27;t have a constant electric source in the bath, like me.  I fully recommend this appliance for dental hygiene.  I don&#x27;t think you can get a better one.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the Oral-B Smartseries 5000. In addition, I have a slim [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic]] that I use when traveling. I also have an [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Care 3000]] that does a decent job of cleaning. Its brush head is smaller and less effective than the 5000&#x27;s, and it has only 3 modes rather than 5 and doesn&#x27;t come with a SmartGuide. The 5000 is less bulky and seems to hold a charge longer as well, nearly 2 weeks. Aside from that, they are fairly similar. They both pause when it is time to move to a new brushing zone and have the pressure sensor that lights a red LED when you press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few quibbles. The pause that lets me know I need to change where I&#x27;m brushing is a bit too long, esp. when it reaches 3 pulses. It is louder than Sonicare electric toothbrushes though not as noisy as the Pulsonic or 3000 model. The travel case is bulky and somewhat unnecessary if you don&#x27;t plan to use it when traveling. I don&#x27;t use the SmartGuide but I can see how it may be helpful to young children when brushing and may add a bit of fun to the process. Personally, I&#x27;d rather save a little money and just get the brush. Speaking of cost, replacement brush heads are rather expensive as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it easier to get a thorough brushing with a powered toothbrush. A standard manual brush can work too too, but it takes less effort when using a brush like the 5000. In the past I used a [[ASIN:B0019ZGU1S Philips Sonicare HealthyWhite R732]] and I have to give the cleaning edge to the Sonicare. But the Smartseries 5000 is still an effective cleaning tool for someone willing to invest a bit in their oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
            <li> Took the place of a Phillips Soni-care.  Much better and does a better job.  Also like the timer and when you press too hard, it warns you to ease off.&lt;br /&gt;Very good product.</li>
            <li> Our family has been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for years. This model, the Smart Series 5000 professional care model has some improvements over the older models which some of us were still using, so I could compare them side by side. This review was also updated on 9/07/12 after comparing it to the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Floss Action model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the sensor tells if you are exerting too much pressure on the teeth - this is to help prevent enamel abrasion. This sensor also tells you which quadrant to brush and shows when you are done with that quadrant should you be forgetful (such as when you are groggy in the morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a new design to the stand which keeps it plugged into the charger. If you want to not use electricity all the time unplug it from your electrical outlet. This stand holds other brush heads if other family members are sharing the unit with you. This new shape to the stand is stable and won&#x27;t tip over, it is more stable than older model&#x27;s recharging stands which were smaller and just wider than the toothbrush. I note the charger on THIS UNIT is NOT compatible for use in Europe. (This is a new charger design than the former 5000 series model had, that one could be used in Europe.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with the PRECISION CLEAN head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you own this unit and read the owner manual you realize the unit can be further customized to your personal liking by buying a different replacement head. They sell 6 different brush heads in all, one is for sensitive teeth which is new. The mode for floss action requires the use of the floss action head which does not come with this model. They market this same basic device calling it floss action and that model has the floss action head not the precision cleaning brush head. This confused me at first, so I will repeat: the unit has different cleaning modes but for each you need a different head, each are purchased separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a new travel case which we appreciate since we do travel with our electric toothbrushes. The case not only keeps the brush heads from being crushed but it protects the actual device. It holds the unit and additional brush heads.s a new travel case which we appreciate since we do travel with our electric toothbrushes. The case not only keeps the brush heads from being crushed but it protects the actual device. It holds the unit and additional brush heads.</li>
            <li> The product came with a $20 mail-in-rebate which I sent in immediately after receiving the toothbrush.  It did not, however, come in normal packaging with the UPC barcode on it.  I submitted every barcode looking print on the box in addition to proof of purchase, etc.  By the time I received noticed that, \\&quot;The UPC(s) submitted with your submission are not valid for this offer,\\&quot; the return period had already expired.  In addition, the timer for the toothbrush does not work.  I have always had great experiences with purchasing from Amazon; this definitely was not one of them.  Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> When I first got this, it seemed like more technology than you could possibly need from a toothbrush.  Who really needs a WiFi toothbrush?  I already have an [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional 3000 Electric Toothbrush]] that times my brushing and does everything I thought I could possibly need.  The clock just seemed like a cumbersome gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I tried it. And I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the package, it is easy to set up and use.  I deeply appreciate Amazon&#x27;s frustration free packaging.  You just pop it out of the box and onto the charger, and once it is powered up you are ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5000 is both lighter and bulkier than my old Oral B.  The handle is wider, presumably to hold the WiFi tech and the different modes.  The head is different as well, with little whip-like brushes that seek out those hidden areas on your teeth.  It has all the same features as my old brush: the brush signals when you have completed a quadrant and lets you know to move on, and a red light turns on when you are pressing too hard.  It works perfectly well without the display clock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the display clock, however, it levels up to awesome.  Aside from being a regular clock, when you turn on the toothbrush it kicks into brushing mode, and shows a circle with each quadrant filled it as you move along.  You get a star with each quadrant, and a happy face shows up when you have all four stars filled in.  If you press too hard, you get a sad face on the display along with the red light on the toothbrush.  Silly as it sounds, I like using the display.  It is a good motivator to keep you brushing right, and made me feel like the displays on exercise bikes at the gym that take your pulse and let you know when you are in \\&quot;the zone.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush and the clock are both waterproof.  I do my brushing in the shower, so I was worried about using the clock at first but there have been no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5000 toothbrush also has five modes.  There is the standard recommended 2-minute mode, a 4-minute mode for deep-cleaning, a sensitive mode, a polishing mode, and a gum massage.  I&#x27;ve played around with all of them, although I generally default to the standard 2-minute mode, followed by some time with the gum massage.  My wife prefers the polishing mode, I think because of the little diamond that shows up on the display when you are using it.  They all do the trick, so it is largely a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the only flaws I could point out is that the modes are not indicated on the toothbrush itself.  You have to look at the display to see what mode you are using, so if you don&#x27;t like the display or if it ever gets broke then the modes are hampered. The other problem is that it is kind of fun to see the sad face popping up, so I find myself brushing incorrectly on purpose just to see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a great toothbrush, one of the best I have ever owned!modes.

            <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Great cleaning, in-the-dentist-chair feel every time&lt;br /&gt;*Great accessories bundle to get the best results&lt;br /&gt;*Built-in \\&quot;beep\\&quot; timer to let you know to switch sides&lt;br /&gt;*Rechargeable means no need for batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Steep-learning curve&lt;br /&gt;*More time consuming than ordinary brush and more expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me say that this toothbrush is not ordinary---it is more of an investment.  If you do get it, you better use it or you might as well stick with the ordinary brush.  In order to get the best results, you should follow the instructions and recommendations.  Make sure you check the cost of brush-replacements to see how much it will cost you per year overall.  If you are fine with that, then this toothbrush will serve you well.  Getting to know this brush can be a tad intimidating(sort of like a first date.)  There are several components and sensors that are included like a SmartGuide, which can be attached to a wall(presumably in your bathroom.)  If you are strapped for time in the morning, you might not have the patience with this brush as you have to take it out of the case, put the head on and brush until it tells you to stop.  Then you rinse it off, put it back in the case and off you go.  As I&#x27;ve said before:  If you are OK with time and money, this will be one of the best toothbrushes that you&#x27;ll ever buy.  The headbrush looks very complicated with strategically-designed bristles to help with the molars.  The subtle beep will let you know that its time to switch to the next quadrant.  You will definitely feel the results after your first brushing sessions and future sessions to come.</li>
            <li> I love how clean my teeth feel with the electric tooth brush. I am a little disappointed that I bought the \\&quot;Smartseries\\&quot; for several reasons. One, I followed the directions and select the program/speed of brush head I desire. However, it does not stay on the selected cycle, it randomly cycles thru several speeds. Second, the directions are vague and I am unable to problem solve the issue. Either way, I like how it peeps to indicate you brushed a specific area significantly. However, the display cycles thru an array of screens with different time modes and I don&#x27;t know what it means. Urg. Reflecting back, I rather have a brush that stays on one specific mode (i.e. gums, whitening, etc...). Maybe, I not operating the product correctly but I am following directions correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced that all the \\&quot;bells &amp; whistles\\&quot; are necessary, but given the sale price, and a $20 rebate program, the purchase was a great value!</li>
            <li> My first impression of this was that it was really rough on my teeth.  In fact in many ways it seemed less a toothbrush and more like the polisher that dentist uses.  However after getting used to it, this brush does a fine job of cleaning your teeth.  It uses what looks to be an inductance charging stand, and the control panel actually is connected to the brush via radio.  The brush has a pressure sensor in it that activates a red light in the handle if you are pressing down to hard on your teeth as your brush.  The wiresless control display acts as a time for each quadrant of your mouth so you brush for a certain amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same toothbrush for...about 6 years now? My husband and I have been using a Philips Sonicare Elite, until the chance to try this one came along. I have been using this one for about 3 weeks now, and I have decided that I greatly prefer it over my old toothbrush. Here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off with, it took a little bit to get used to. The Philips brush head was more elongated (vs. the round Oral-B), and the vibration of the Oral-B seemed quite a bit more powerful. In addition, the brush head that the Oral-B came with is the floss action head, and the little flat \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; felt, well, weird. However, the more I used it, the more I really began to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the Oral-B is how much easier it is keep clean than the Philips was. The Philips brush required a big piece that was screwed on, and all kinds of gunk and nasty would build up under there. The Oral-B is just one long piece that clicks on, no big empty space that feel the need to fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the different setting options. I have used most of them, though I tend to stick with either the Daily Clean or the Deep Clean modes. The Daily clean is exactly what it sounds like - the typical 30 seconds per quadrant that is recommended. The Deep Clean bumps that up to 45 seconds per quadrant. With the Sensitive mode, there is a noticeable difference in vibration power. The Whitening mode might work, but the only way to really know would be to use only that for a time and then check for any difference. It sounds like the revving of a race car engine - up and down - the entire cycle (at least according to my Nascar-crazy husband). The only one I haven&#x27;t used is the Massage mode, as I simply have a hard time imagining why I would need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SmartGuide initially seemed a little over-the-top to me, but I can see how it would be extremely handy for a family with children who used an Oral-B brush as well. It shows what mode you&#x27;re on, has a circle broken into four quadrants and each quadrant flashes or fills at the appropriate time, it shows stars that fill as each quadrant is completed, has a frown face and red light for too much pressure, and a happy face when the brushing is complete. For children that are learning to brush, having the visuals would be extremely helpful, particularly for the quadrant times and the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush notifies you when it&#x27;s time to switch quadrants - it beeps and pauses before continuing on - another touch that would be great for kids both young and old. Something that I particularly like, and that is different from the Philips, is that once the brush time is complete, the brush notifies you and then keeps going. I have found that there are times when I just want to cover a spot a little more thoroughly or want a little extra brush time. I can choose to do that as it continues and then just manually turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the charging stand, the brush came with a piece that allows the stand to be inserted and holds 4 different heads - especially handy for families sharing the brush. As a nice touch, the piece also has a lid that folds down to cover the brushes to help keep them from getting any extra germs from flushing toilets and the like. There is also a handy little travel case for the brush, which is a nice bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even without regular use of the Whitening mode, I have noticed my teeth are a shade or two whiter than they were using the Philips. With all the features included in this brush, this seems like a pretty good value, considering our last electric toothbrush is 6 years old and counting. I like the Oral-B so much, it has become *my* toothbrush, while the Philips has been fully given over to my husband.s a circle broken into four quadrants and each quadrant flashes or fills at the appropriate time, it shows stars that fill as each quadrant is completed, has a frown face and red light for too much pressure, and a happy face when the brushing is complete.

            <li> This is an excellent unit with good cleaning results. The accompanying monitor is very helpful in performing the proper brushing time for your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only remark concerns the charging time. It takes overnight to fully charge! I wonder if it is in reality supposed to be 220 volts and not 120 volts since it is built by Siemens of Germany.</li>
            <li> Older model died, needed a new one.  Opted for this model.  The smiley face definitely makes me want to go for the full two minutes!</li>
            <li> I had a friend who kept raving about this toothbrush and told me that once I started using an electric toothbrush, I wouldn&#x27;t go back to the normal ones so I decided to give this one a shot. It worked fine until approximately 4 months after purchasing it, I noticed it wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore. I thought maybe it was the outlet in my bathroom which tends to charge slower so I plugged it into my bedroom outlet (which is where I normally charge it) and the lights wouldn&#x27;t indicate it was charging. I thought maybe the lights were messed up so I kept running the toothbrush but it eventually went down to the red light (low battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the actual toothbrush while it still worked? I thought it worked well. On a full charge it would last me maybe 3 days. The timer helped me because I would actually count down while brushing to make sure I went over my teeth several times even though the toothbrush would stop vibrating every 30 seconds to signal you to move on to the next area. The time was convenient too because I didn&#x27;t have a clock in my bathroom. One downside is that the toothbrush case (not the blue one but the one that&#x27;s part of the charging base) does get kind of dirty after awhile. The base where the toothbrush sits on to charge gets a little gunky too and for some reason after a week or two, it became kind of difficult to slide the brush head onto the metal part of the toothbrush. Not sure if there was buildup in there but after 2 weeks?? How much can actually build up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the hefty price of this toothbrush, I thought it would last much longer! I ended up contacting Amazon and they allowed me to return it with a restocking fee deducted (I wasn&#x27;t aware of this until the item was in Amazon&#x27;s possession but at least I got most of my refund back). I guess I&#x27;m going to buy a cheaper electric toothbrush, possibly by Sonicare. Hopefully that one lasts longer than 4 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Phillips Sonicare user for years. When I was finally ready to try something new, this toothbrush turned out a real hit. Be it a different technology or a smaller head, my teeth feel much, much cleaner since I bought it, especially at the gum lines, where I always had problems. Also, the toothbrush has a lot of cool settings for heavier and lighter sessions, and a small interface showing you how long you&#x27;ve been brushing. I share the base with my husband, and the charge lasts fine for two people. The base for storing heads is also very useful. I would highly recommend this toothbrush, although I am convinced that a less pricey model of the same brand would do just as good a job.</li>
            <li> Comparing this to the 1000, I like the slimmer more comfortable handle of the 1000 and more compact charger. But they both work great. The 5000 is better for me, however, because I prefer the sensitive mode. The regular pulse is pretty darn intense of a vibration and a bit jarring especially for sensitive gums. The charger for the 5000 has room to store different heads but I find that an unncessary space waster since I find a head I like and stick with that anyway. The 5000 comes with a case which is nice for travel. The Smartguide sounds good in theory but I can&#x27;t really figure it out or am just too impatient. I had thought it would be good for my son learning to brush well but the 5000 is just too big for his hands and not good for a child in my opinion and I use the toothbrush and I don&#x27;t really need the Smartguide. All in all, I give it 5 stars because it works great, love the sensitive mode lacking on the 1000 and my gum line recession has actually improved. Love the feature of letting you know if you are brushing too hard as that will cause gum recession too, but believe the 1000 has that feature as well. All in all, I think models 3000 or 4000 if cheaper would be best because they have sensitive mode as well and I don&#x27;t think the Smartguide is worth paying extra for. Great product overall and it seems to be promoting healthier gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a top-quality tooth cleaner, on a par with Oral-B&#x27;s earlier top models.  It&#x27;s a little bulkier, but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me even though I have small hands.  It holds a charge well, for over a week of normal use for me.  I haven&#x27;t noticed the extra noise some have pointed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the separate readout unit with timer and other features hasn&#x27;t been of much use.  When the (included) batteries ran out, I didn&#x27;t miss it.  The various modes available, after trying them out, haven&#x27;t been returned to.  I just brush my teeth with it in normal mode.  The timings and warnings might be useful to someone concerned about whether they&#x27;re brushing correctly.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t pay the extra cost.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fantastic.  I have owned other electric toothbrushes including other Oral-B&#x27;s, but this has a couple of really nice features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First (and most obviously) the toothbrush pauses at the 30 second mark.  One of the bad habits I had was rushing through brushing my teeth.  This subtle 30 second remind is fantastic!  It helps me stay on task and makes it so I don&#x27;t have to stare at the clock.  I can focus on whatever I want and the pause will remind me when it is time to move on - at the same time the pause isn&#x27;t long enough for me to get annoyed.  It is subtle enough to remind without interrupting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second is the brush head itself.  When I used a manual toothbrush my dentist constantly reminded me to get behind my back molars.  The head on this toothbrush is small enough to make that very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third this brush comes with a light right on the handle to let me know it is charging.  My last electric toothbrush didn&#x27;t have that and there were a couple of times that I set it down that it wasn&#x27;t charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth is the modes.  I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t used this feature much yet.  But it lets you adjust from \\&quot;Daily Clean\\&quot;, \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; , \\&quot;Massage\\&quot;, \\&quot;Whitening\\&quot; and \\&quot;Deep Clean\\&quot;.  I tried all of them and found \\&quot;Daily Clean\\&quot; to be my best option.  But the fact that I have a \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; and \\&quot;Deep Clean\\&quot; does intrigue me.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic piece of machinery.  It cleans teeth really well and tells you when to switch to the next set of teeth.  The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last.  Mine died after a 2 years and the battery is NOT replaceable.  There is a warranty but, without the receipt, it&#x27;s garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding this information is a huge chore.  Braun (the maker of the toothbrush) has an unhelpful web site and it took quite of bit of time and effort to get someone on the phone....to hear that the toothbrush is now garbage - actually worse because the battery is toxic waste and needs to be disposed of through a specialty recycler. For $109, it&#x27;s not worth it.  Look for a product that last longer or has a replaceable battery.</li>
            <li> This electric (automatic) toothbrush was a fantastic addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not even realize that with my old system, I was not brushing for long enough and I tended to brush longer in some areas.  This machine solves the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra timer accessory is a bit odd, but at least it is a way to keep track of good brushing habits.</li>
            <li> To start, you&#x27;ll need a little patience once you set up this toothbrush to charge the battery.  It shows no charging lights for several minutes so just let it be and you&#x27;ll see the first of 3 lights shortly.  As it charges, one light will stay on and continue up to 3.  When it is complete, it doesn&#x27;t show the lights anymore.  I do think they should have made it to show something much quicker as unless you read the manual closely describing this you&#x27;ll wonder if something is wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both a Philips Sonicare and Arm &amp; Hammer toothbrushes to compare to this Oral-B toothbrush.  I take the A&amp;H one with me on vacation because I don&#x27;t want to lose, by hook or by crook, an expensive toothbrush ($100+) like the Sonicare and Oral-B versions.  The Oral-B is slim and attractive looking and has an electronic display for battery power, time, and time spent brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took awhile to get used to the smaller brush head of the Oral-B toothbrush, but the combination of smaller head and slimmer neck make reaching the back molars much easier than either of the other toothbrushes I own.  The Oral-B stops briefly, and long enough every 30 seconds so that you can stop and start brushing other quadrants of your mouth.  The stop is longer than the Sonicare, which for me makes it better, and readily noticeable.  Using the Sonicare, sometimes I don&#x27;t know it has stopped briefly as it doesn&#x27;t stop long enough.  My only complaint on the Oral-B is that it continues brushing after two minutes, although I believe there is a way to program it in the manual but I haven&#x27;t done yet.  It was annoying because the Sonicare does that, and when my two minutes are up with the Oral-B, I remove from my mouth only to get sprayed with toothpaste on my shirt (which stains).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life of the Oral-B is similar to the Sonicare.  I have been able to run it twice a day for more than two weeks before charging.  Good for a long vacation, but I would never know, I wouldn&#x27;t risk taking it where it might get lost in airline luggage, etc.  Replacement brush heads for the Oral-B are much cheaper than the Sonicare, which adds another plus, but are similar in price to the A&amp;H replacement brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re in the market for a toothbrush, this has a lot of good features to make your teeth as happy as the smiley on the electronic display.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;ve had several Braun/Oral-B toothbrushes and this is the first one that I don&#x27;t like much.  I had the original, the Excel, the 3D, the Professional Care, the 1000 and now the 5000.  Of all of them, the 1000, while a stripped down model is my favorite.  It lacks the lower speed of the other models, which is my only complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the 5000.  First, it is big and gets larger toward the bottom.  It feels awkward in my hand, whereas all the other models are comfortable.  I have to be careful not to drop it when brushing my teeth.  Not so with the other models.  It is much louder than the 1000.  It had a separate LCD panel that tells you if you did a good job brushing with a 1-4 star rating.  The display (and toothbrush) also flash a red light if you are brushing too hard.  The toothbrush itself has 5 modes but you need the LCD display to easily distinguish between the various modes so although it has a travel case, it is not the best choice as a travel model.  There is nothing inherently wrong with the toothbrush but in my opinion, it has a lot of needless bells and whistles, which make it more difficult and complex to operate, too large and the LCD display takes up needless counter space.  Also, the holder for the heads is large and takes up a lot of counter space.  I am using the charging base from my older 3D, which is more compact and holds 4 heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned that it gets gross really fast.  When done brushing, rinse the head with the toothbrush running, then remove the head and rinse down the hole in the bottom of the head then rinse the body of the brush and towel dry before putting it in the charger.  If you do that, it will stay looking new.  It takes about 10 sec.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have children who will use the toothbrush, the display may help them brush better and keep their interest.  Otherwise, I don&#x27;t see much use for it.  If you don&#x27;t care about the bells and whistles or the multiple modes, the 1000 is less than 1/3rd the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for around one month (via Amazon&#x27;s VINE program).  Since there are many reviews already, I&#x27;ll keep my review short and to the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The timer clock is helpful, but must be placed on a counter.  This means you must look down while brushing to see it (and it&#x27;s not easy to look down while brushing!)&lt;br /&gt;2) There are five modes, but the only way to know which mode you&#x27;re in is to look at the graphic on the clock.  Would have been nicer to have the mode indicator on the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;3) The cord for the recharger base is short; would be nice if it were a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) Battery life is amazing.  I used it for a week straight without a recharge and I couldn&#x27;t even tell if it was slowing down.  There is even a battery life indicator that tells you how much charge is left in the unit.&lt;br /&gt;2) The 5 different brush modes are nice.  I was expecting the modes to be the same, but they are noticeably different.&lt;br /&gt;3) The brush stays clean after each use.  Some brushes build up junk on them after weeks of use, but this brush is amazingly clean and bright after much use for one month.&lt;br /&gt;4) It performs well - it is easy to hold, easy to use, and hassle-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, aside from my minor critiques (the \\&quot;cons\\&quot; above), I cannot imagine needing more than this in an electric/rechargeable toothbrush.  I noticed it is quite spendy, but if it lasts more than a few years, I would say that it might be worth the money.  I&#x27;m a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works incredibly well - my teeth have never been cleaner, particularly when using the floss action brush heads.  The wireless smart timer provides great visual feedback and is something that should be included with all kids&#x27; toothbrushes to help them get in the habit of brushing properly.  I also like the fact that it flashes red when you are using to much pressure.  Of the 4 modes, I pretty much only use the normal or the polishing mode.  The polishing mode is fantastic, and my teeth have never been this white without using a tooth whitener.  It does have a gentle mode too, but I haven&#x27;t ever used it.  Before this, I had the pulsonic, thinking that a sonic toothbrush would do a better job, but I really think this one does a much better job of scrubbing the teeth clean and I no longer use the pulsonic - my teeth just feel cleaner using this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  I wish I would have purchased this sooner.  It was recommended by my dentist.  It makes brushing your teeth so much easier.</li>
            <li> It is a little harsh on the teeth and gums. I was under the impression that Oral B was the Rolls Royce of tooth care. I found this toothbrush to be good but it is not soft enough as the other Oral B products have proven. If you need a great toothbrush for less money, they&#x27;re several available. I have always trusted Oral B for the newest technology in dental care. My dentist recommended this brush after asking for a good dental cleaning system. I wish I had one as a child for a heathy smile....</li>
            <li> I am not sure why there are  bad reviews for this brush, been using it for almost a year, works wonderfully. I have stopped bleeding gums after using this brush. For those that complain it doesn&#x27;t work for gums, you can set it to just work on your gums. Charge lasts the whole week. great brush and can use multiple heads for whitening, flossing etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great value.  My teeth feel so much cleaner everytime I brush now.  I feel like I just stepped out of the dentist office after every use.  I do use the timer as guidance to receive the right amount of time per quadrant for a full clean and luv that added bonus.  I like the ability to use interchangeable brushes such as deep cleaning and polishing.  It is a nice compact design that fits nicely and sightly on my bathroom countertop and is easy to keep clean.  It is also nice this product comes with a handy travel case.  Very satisfied!!!  I just hope the battery life is long, but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended the Oral-B brand over others on the market for plaque removal (stating that the brushing action is better than the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrushes), I&#x27;m not sure the validity of this claim, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.  I have never owned an electric toothbrush before, so I was a little surprised at how powerful this one is while in use, but the multiple settings allow for sensitive mode, whitening mode, etc., and are all awesome! The teeth feel like they have just been cleaned after each use.  Recently took a vacation and had to go back to the manual toothbrush and I really missed the electric one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m deducting a star because I think the 4000 series is just fine without the need for the LCD monitor about how hard you are brushing your teeth and the LCD countdown timer.  Just feel gimmicky and not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I do have healthy teeth and gums and I am a stickler when it comes about toothbrushing, but i am sure that my method with the toothbrush is not the optimal. This electric toothbrush does make me feel a difference, and i am more efficient when it come to the cleaning since the timer let&#x27;s me know about moving on to the next quadrant. I have not tested all the settings and i am not sure if i will, but the goldbox deal price and the fact that this is the top of the line Oral-b toothbrush, made an easy decision to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Tremendous - get as a gift to yourself. The next best thing to going to your dental hygienist daily. I have been using the same one for 10 years, never needed to buy a new one. I switch the brush out every 3 months or so. I can still remember the epic difference between my regular toothbrush and this. a small amount of toothpaste does a great job. Worth Every Penney, do yourself a favor and get one today.</li>
            <li> Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a number of different brands of electric Toothbrushes over the years and find the Oral-B Smart-series 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush performs in the top 3. I prefer the Sonicare over the Oral-B but that&#x27;s just my preference, I like the back and forth movement of the Oral-B Smart-series, the Sonicare is ultrasonic verses the Oral-B&#x27;s spinning back and forth movement. This model of the Oral-B offers a remote timer that also warns if you&#x27;re pushing too hard against your teeth, the remote has a LCD screen you watch while brushing, it also reverts to a digital clock after brushing. They both do a good job cleaning I just find my mouth and teeth feel cleaner after brushing with the Sonicare brush. The cost of replacement brushes is often cheaper at Amazon, they offer different types of brush heads too so depending on your needs they have a choice to choose from.</li>
            <li> This electric tooth brush is so easy to use and makes my teeth feel great, much like they do after a trip to the dentist.  I have had electric tooth brushes off and on in my life since being a kid and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  One of the nice things about this one, is that it&#x27;s easy to keep clean.  Other than where the tooth brush connects, there isn&#x27;t anyplace for water to penetrate and create a slimy mess like I had with the last major brand I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using the flossing toothbrush that came with it and love it.  There&#x27;s a timer/clock that comes with it that times how long to brush. It also lets you know if you&#x27;re pushing too hard.  You don&#x27;t need to push any buttons on the clock, it just starts up when you start to brush.  You can also change the settings on the brush to, daily, deep clean, sensitive, whitening and massage mode.  You&#x27;ll be able to see what mode you are in on the clock aka smart guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I love is the small space it takes up on my bathroom counter top and the ease of swapping out the tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that flustered me just a tiny little bit, were the instructions.  They&#x27;re not real clear at what to do at the start, so I&#x27;ll help you out.  The back of the clock, just pulls off. Then push and slide the back panel to get to the battery compartment. Set the time and you will be ready to brush with some charging of the toothbrush.  After that it&#x27;s as easy as can be.</li>
            <li> My dentist had been after me forever to try an electric toothbrush, but I always balked at spending over $100 for a toothbrush.  I tried a cheap battery powered one, but when I saw that I would be replacing batteries every 3 weeks, it went into the bottom drawer.  I read independent reviews that stated that this toothbrush (actually the 4000 series) was their \\&quot;pick\\&quot; and decided to give it a try.  I am very pleased!  I am one who always presses too hard, and when I change toothbrushes, I always get irritation spots until I break the toothbrush in.  I had switched to a super soft manual brush, but then felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting my teeth clean enough.  The brush head that came with the electric brush (floss action head) felt pretty hard to the touch and I was apprehensive that I would have major damage on my gums.  Well, I&#x27;ve been using this brush almost a month and I have not had any irritation or bleeding at all.  My gums seem much healthier and I can really feel that my teeth are clean.  I usually brush for 4 minutes, which may be too much, but 2 or 3 minutes just doesn&#x27;t cut it. It is just really fun to brush teeth now, and I want to do a really good job! I am curious to see what my dentist says next month when I go for my checkup.  He may tell me that I&#x27;m brushing all my enamel off!  I am not getting 10 days of use between charges (maybe 4, but I always charge it before it is \\&quot;empty\\&quot; because it takes so darn long to recharge)but that is because my husband is also using the brush and I always brush for more than the recommended 2 minutes. If you are skeptical that electric is better than manual, I can tell you that I am so glad I switched and should have done it years ago.  Skip spending money on cheap battery powered ones too, this electric is much better.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. Perhaps I expected too much, but I thought my teeth would feel like I had just left my dentist. Unfortunately my teeth did not feel at all clean! I am now saddled with a product that cannot be returned, and I am stuck with it. I must say the Sonicare toothbrush works much better for me.</li>
            <li> This is my second Smartseries 5000 PC purchase. I had to replace the older model 5000 Smartseries (the one with the LCD battery indicator window in the handle) due to accidental damage to the notched metal spindle that holds the brush head in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improvements: Beeps (1x-2x-3x-4x) in addition to stuttering every thirty seconds of brushing to indicate quadrant change. Indicators on remote guide panel are easier to read and icons are improved. Biggest improvement - change to standard AC two-prong electrical plug. The old unit had an ENORMOUS, bulky (transformer?) plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changes: LED battery indicator lights - way too bright, flashy - not necessarily an improvement. Ditto, the lighted power, function switch and \\&quot;Guide\\&quot; lettering on the handle. The handle is now inserted onto a pylon on the charger instead of resting in a charging ring. May be less likely to be accidentally knocked over; however, the pylon is relatively short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gripe: No instruction booklet included in packaging. Had a very difficult time finding the correct, up-to-date user&#x27;s guide online, even on the Oral-B web site. Why, having owned the previous version 5000, did I need a user&#x27;s guide? To find out how long I would have to look at those BRIGHT flashing LEDs before the handle would be fully charged. Oddly enough, the answer is not even in the UG. Answer: +/- 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For performance and the ability to interchange brush heads throughout the Oral-B line-up (unlike Sonicare models), highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great and I really enjoy brushing my teeth.  I travel a lot and it stays charged for the entire time.  It also has a great carrying case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been partial to Oral-B electric toothbrushes. I think they work well and it&#x27;s easy to get replaceable heads for them.  I think they were also one of the first companies to introduce the electric toothbrush so I think they got a solid product on their hands. This Smart Series 5000 is just as solid. But, I think in hindsight I would have bought the cheaper  version (i.e. the version without the bells and whistles) and been just as happy.  This series comes with a base charger that is more fancy than the regular bases because this one is larger with a covered clear compartment to the right where you can store your spare brush heads.  I store my brush heads in the Costco packaging that it comes in so I don&#x27;t think I would purposely take it out of the Costco blister packaging to refill this compartment.  That maybe just me. I would prefer a more streamlined, smaller charging base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other item that I could have done without was the clock/brush monitor. It&#x27;s the LCD rectangular-looking object you see in the product photo.  It connects wirelessly to the the toothbrush itself and it sort of gives you a second-by-second update of what quadrant you are brushing in your mouth.  The machine separates your mouth into 4 quadrants and it acts like a mini-timer telling you if you&#x27;ve brushed long enough, if you&#x27;re brushing too hard, too soft, etc. I sort of think that this is more for kids than adults even though this is an adult toothbrush. While I appreciate the machine keeping tabs on my brushing, I don&#x27;t think I would have paid extra for this feature. The LCD indicator is currently sitting on my bathroom counter and being used more for a clock than anything else.  I looked at it in the beginning and then stopped after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;ve got the money and think you need the machine to tell you what quadrant to brush or if you tend to brush with too much gusto, then this unit is good for you. But, if you know you&#x27;re own brushing routine and don&#x27;t need a visual reminder, then I say save yourself some money and get the version without the wireless LCD unit. In my opinion, the extra money you spend doesn&#x27;t justify the extra stuff you get.</li>
            <li> I got the Oral-B Smartseries 5000 when it was a daily deal on Amazon. In the past, I have bought Oral-B electric toothbrushes in the 30-50$ range. The whole set ended up costing me $90, so about double of what I normally would pay. But the extra money is definitely worth the difference. The power of the toothbrush is much stronger than the ones I have owned before. The battery life is long and I can take it with me as I travel for a couple weeks at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to buy in bulk replacement heads from Costco, so the overall maintenance of this product is low. However, the wireless display that tells you how long you have been brushing your teeth is all show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, I don&#x27;t give it five stars since it is a little gimmicky with the wireless features.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST TOOTH BRUSH I&#x27;VE EVER USED IT HAS A LONG LASTING BATTERY , DIFFERENT SETTINGS WHEN BRUSHING YOUR THEETH AND A SENSOR THAT LETS YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE BRUSHING TOO HARD GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Our family has been using the Braun / Oral-B since early ninetees and gone through all their generations.&lt;br /&gt;As we were very please with the Oral-B Professional Care SmartSeries 5000 (ASIN: B004O76DEC) we ordered what we thought just another one. As the name and the picture looked identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What came was Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush(ASIN: B007VXJK6O), which showed to be an updated version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the previous version which I would give 4.5 stars, the changes are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive:&lt;br /&gt;+ The brush has a built in red (LED) light that starts to flash when you apply too much pressure on your teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;- The charging time is much much longer compared to the previous model&lt;br /&gt;- While marketed as a travel tooth brush the charger takes only 110 Volt (the previous model works at 230V as well)&lt;br /&gt;- For those who already have a previous model - this brush cannot be charged by the previous model&#x27;s charging unit - it is simply not possible physically - it does not fit). SO the idea of having only one charding unit for two brushes in one&#x27;s bathroom or on a longer trip does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is still a good brush. You can read plenty of reviews about its features in other reviews</li>
            <li> I now love brushing my teeth 2-3 times a day. I was never one to care for brushing between meals but this is brush changed the way I look at my teeth. The small head of a Floss-Action brush head is perfect at reaching those back teeth against the jaw bone and it allows for precision on each tooth. I recommend this over the Sonicare due to all the features. The separate LCD is good but the viewing angle isn&#x27;t great so to see the timer you have to either bend your head down (allowing toothpaste to drip out your mouth) or back up (away from the sink). I am going to mount it up on the wall so it is eye level to prevent this issue, so I won&#x27;t dock a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all this is one of my favorite buys. Be ready for your gums to bleed a little for the first few days if you aren&#x27;t used to an electric toothbrush. But that is not a consequence of the Oral-B 5000. The bleeding doesn&#x27;t occur at all after the first week and my teeth feel great after each clean.</li>
            <li> I love this tooth brush! Has a timer/detector that comes with it, and a indicator light when you brush to hard, or not hard enough. Love this thing! Would recommend this toothbrush for all adults, but iffy for kids, as they always brush too long with these brushes as I have learned. Could be a good thing, but not on a daily basis due to ruining enamel.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B 5000 toothbrush is an excellent product for those interested in getting an electric toothbrush. It has five cleaning modes, a rechargeable battery and a wireless timer. The brushing is pleasant -- not as hard as some other electric toothbrushes -- and it leaves your teeth feeling smooth and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to receiving the Oral-B 5000, I had used its little brother, the Oral-B 3000. The only differences seem to be the lack of timer and two less cleaning modes. The timer that comes with the 5000, while novel, is not really necessary; the brush beeps in 30 second intervals when you&#x27;re brushing, so you know when the 2 minute recommended brushing time is done. While novel, the timer really doesn&#x27;t add anything to the functionality of the brush. The two extra brush modes are nice -- it has a deep clean mode that lasts for 3 minutes -- but not really essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I would recommend the Oral-B 3000 instead of this brush, since it&#x27;s basically the same thing, but retails for $30 - $50 less, depending on where you get it. The Oral-B 5000 is an excellent toothbrush, but the extra bells and whistles, while novel, aren&#x27;t really worth the premium.</li>
            <li> so far,the disadvantage i know is the voltage,only used in US,not for 220v voltage.This should notice in items detail information.</li>
            <li> I have found that the longer I have this toothbrush, the more I like it.  I originally started using an electric toothbrush because a problem with my thumb joints made it difficult to hold a regular toothbrush.  I have found that this electric toothbrush actually does a better job of brushing than I could with a regular toothbrush.  It easily holds a charge for a week of brushing, so that isn&#x27;t a problem.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about using the timer that automatically starts when you use the toothbrush.  In fact, I only bought the model that had this feature because the Gold Box sale price was less than that of the lower level series without it.  But, with use, I have found it helps me keep a consistent brushing pattern.</li>
            <li> I never review anything but this toothbrush is amazing! It makes my spin-brush seem like a toy. My gums are in bad shape so I am anxious to see if this corrects the issue, but thus far I am super impressed! I think the timer will be excellent for my 8 yr old (he is quickly eating dinner so he can try it out.)I feel as clean as I do after a visit to the dentist!</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my dentist to use an electric toothbrush since I have a dry mouth which often causes tooth decay. I started using this toothbrush since my dentist found 4 dental cavities in my mouth. I have been using this item in the last 13 months with no cavities. I highly recommend this if you care about your teeth!</li>
            <li> Excellent product so far based on limited use.  I will update after reviewing all functionalities fairly soon. Find it interesting truly.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last Oral-B toothbrush was the [[ASIN:B003UKKHB4 Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]] and i had a wonderful experience with that one but now, the 5000 addresses some points that leaved room for improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning, I felt the only difference between the 3000 toothbrush and the 5000 model I&#x27;m revieweing now was the LCD screen gadget you can see on the photos and that i gave you no added value but oh boy, I was sooo wrong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, brushing my teeth is one of the most boring things I can do with my time, hooray.. it&#x27;s something you has to do if you want to have the necessary tools to chew your food and look good when smiling but.. once understood, it remains boring so, the fact that a display gives you the time of the day, the elapsed brushing time, gives you an alarm when you press your brush against your teeth too hard, and put a silly smile decreases the anxiety created by the fact you&#x27;re doing something boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, when using the 3000 model, sometimes I forgot what was the part of my mouth I was brushing because one of the advantages of this model is that you can allocate 30 to 45 seconds for each mouth quadrant ( the 3000 model only had 30 seconds ) assuring you cover all the areas for a perfect clean mouth in 2 to 2:30 minutes... Or you can choose the polishing mode to have a George Clooney&#x27;s smile in no time but, because it is early in the morning, your brain its still booting and there you are brushing your teeth, you&#x27;re no longer forgetting the quadrant you were cleaning because the display will give you all the info you need to know were you are, how much time is left and which part of your mouth you&#x27;re supposed to be brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lcd display can be attached to your mirror and believeme, it looks fantastic. You can even detach the display because what you attach is a base so you can still take the brush with you when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing... brushing is boring... already said that... and with this kind of brushes you have to get used to it because they are simply better so they are different but.... believe me when I say... Nothing... absolutely nothing can beat the level of cleanliness you feel once you&#x27;ve gone through all the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 38 and i have no cavities... never had and hopefully never will but about the tartar... so if you want to get rid of absolutely everything like tartar and cavities and bad breath you can complement the fantastic job of this brush with the [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]. &#x60;the way I use it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use water from a reverse osmosis like [[ASIN:B002LHDL7E 5 Stage Reverse Osmosis Water Filter System With Storage Tank Removes Fluoride]] then I add a capfull of [[ASIN:B0054J2IO8 Listerine Antiseptic Adult Mouthwash Advanced with Tartar Protection Citrus, 1.5 Liter]] to the water... wash my teeth gums with that listerine-water \\&quot;alloy\\&quot; and then brush my teeth with the Oral-B Smartseries 5000... wow... brand new mouth everyday...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing... If this looks very expensive, remember you can use the very same toothbrush for all your family by just changing the brushes. When you buy brushes heads for this gadget, they have color coded rounds for you to identify each brush head so all your family can share this product. You can do the same with the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JPe the brush with you when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing... brushing is boring... already said that... and with this kind of brushes you have to get used to it because they are simply better so they are different but.... believe me when I say... Nothing... absolutely nothing can beat the level of cleanliness you feel once you&#x27;ve gone through all the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 38 and i have no cavities... never had and hopefully never will but about the tartar... so if you want to get rid of absolutely everything like tartar and cavities and bad breath you can complement the fantastic job of this brush with the [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]. &#x60;the way I use it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use water from a reverse osmosis like [[ASIN:B002LHDL7E 5 Stage Reverse Osmosis Water Filter System With Storage Tank Removes Fluoride]] then I add a capfull of [[ASIN:B0054J2IO8 Listerine Antiseptic Adult Mouthwash Advanced with Tartar Protection Citrus, 1.5 Liter]] to the water... wash my teeth gums with that listerine-water \\&quot;alloy\\&quot; and then brush my teeth with the Oral-B Smartseries 5000... wow... brand new mouth everyday...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing... If this looks very expensive, remember you can use the very same toothbrush for all your family by just changing the brushes.

            <li> great product. fits well in hand.  the seperate digital monitor great help in timing the 30 second intrevals.  The snap on base can be seperated so that you need very little space for brush in medicine cabinet or on counter if you are a single user and don&#x27;t need the other brush head storage.</li>
            <li> I have had an Oral B rechargeable for many years. When it was time to replace it I chose this one. It has some great features. I like bells and whistles. Some reviewers are saying that this has to many. Why did they order it them? There were other models available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are five different functions. 1. Regular 2 minute brush (30 sec per quarter). 2. Longer cleaning 3 minute deep cleaning (45 sec. per quarter). 3. Sensitive tooth that is a gentler 2 minute brushing cycle. 4. Tooth polishing. 5. Massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a  Smart Guide which can stand up on the counter or be stuck to the mirror or wall. I would choose a command strip rather than the one they supply to make it easy to remove someday. The guide is not a necessity but kind of fun plus it functions as a clock. That&#x27;s handy since I don&#x27;t keep a clock in my bathroom.  The guide is not necessary to tell which brush function you are in. You just push the on switch repeatedly and watch what the tooth brush is doing. You can tell the function by what the brush is doing. Just keep pushing until you are in the mode you want. When your done brushing you get a smiley face. That will encourage little ones to brush the whole 2 minutes. I do travel with it. It comes with a nice travel case but the charger doesn&#x27;t fit in it so you need to take that if you will be gone for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use different heads for polishing, flossing, etc.  There are seven brush heads to choose from that fit this brush.  The brush and the smart guide will warn you with red flashing lights if you put too much pressure on your teeth. I found that I had actually been brushing too hard before I got this toothbrush. That was handy to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started to use Oral B my dentist loves my teeth. My check ups are short and sweet. I don&#x27;t have a lot of tarter buildup and no cavities.</li>
            <li> I got this model to replace the Oral-B/Braun \\&quot;Triumph Professional Care\\&quot; (now discontinued) toothbrush that I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 years now and that I&#x27;ve been very happy with.  While I loved that old \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot; model, my one complaint was that the battery didn&#x27;t hold a very sizable charge, and with age it just got worse -- at the time of my replacing it, it was only holding enough charge for about 2 brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the new [[ASIN:B007VXJK6O Oral-B Smartseries 5000 Professional Care Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]....  At first glance, even down to the accessories, it looks nearly identical to the old \\&quot;Triumph\\&quot; model, functions almost identically, and even takes the same heads.  However, it&#x27;s a significant improvement on the old model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to see right out of the box and after the first charge that it has much more power, which is a welcome change.  Not only is it more powerful to begin with, but it holds enough power for at least 8-10 brushings lasting about 3-3:30 minutes each.  That&#x27;s a substantial improvement over the power cell in the old Triumph, which didn&#x27;t perform that well even when new.  My only complaint in the battery department is that this unit charges even more slowly than its predecessor, which used to recharge overnight.  This new one needs to be recharged for the better part of a day if it has been used for several brushings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job cleaning, and I even found on the day of transitioning from the old to the new model that my teeth felt instantly cleaner with a bit fewer rough spots (my 6 month cleaning is tomorrow).  I have been very pleased with the cleaning action of the head on the Oral-B design for 6 years now, and since this one works just the same way, though with a bit more power, I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;ll be as happy with this one as with the last.  At each of my cleanings, the hygienist always compliments me on how little plaque I have, so that&#x27;s a compliment to the Oral-B design as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed with the performance of this toothbrush, which I&#x27;ve been using for about 10 days now.  It&#x27;s an improvement in power over the older model I had, and the build quality is superb.  I can&#x27;t say I have a lot of use for the accessories (though I am thankful for the addition of a hard-plastic travel case) such as the \\&quot;SmartGuide,\\&quot; which really seems to be designed for parents of toddlers who are teaching their kids how to use a toothbrush.  For that purpose, the SmartGuide may have some application, but for my purposes, it is of little more use than as a digital clock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The caddy holds 4 separate brush heads for 4 different users, and that may be useful for families with kids who share a bathroom and can, thus, share a power toothbrush body, keeping their brush heads separate (different colored rings are available for each brush head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very impressed that Oral-B has continued the tradition of quality and performance that I had grown used to over the years with their older power toothbrush, and I am also pleased that they&#x27;ve improved on the performance of the power cells.  I thought the old brush was a 5-star product, so I can&#x27;t see that this one is anything less than a 5-star product either!

            <li> This functional electric toothbrush does the job, but is bulkier and less comfortable than my old Oral-B Sonic Complete (since discontinued).  It also has a largely useless wireless function, and some suboptimal design choices.  It has a nice travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering Oral-B&#x27;s history, it almost goes without saying that this toothbrush does a good job getting my teeth clean-- they&#x27;ve been in the business long enough that the basic functionality just works.  If you haven&#x27;t heard the spiel on electric toothbrushes and why they clean your teeth so much better, it&#x27;s worth researching, but the summary would be: more cleaning motion, more consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wireless function is mostly meant to show you when to move to the next quadrant of your mouth, as well as display the current brushing mode, a clock, and a warning if you are pressing too hard-- that&#x27;s it.  Considering there&#x27;s already an audio cue and a pause in the head-rotation at each 30 second mark, the visual \\&quot;next quadrant\\&quot; cue seems extraneous.  And it would be simple enough to have the unit beep or slow down when pressing too hard.  And I don&#x27;t need a clock in my bathroom (though that might the wireless display&#x27;s best use).  I&#x27;d also prefer to have a brushing-mode indicator on a small screen on the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the wireless issues, some other quibbles I had:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The head is a little thick (vs my Sonic heads), meaning I have to brush with my mouth kind of open (toothpaste dribble).  People with small mouths might find it uncomfortable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The unit does not remember the last mode used, so if you prefer \\&quot;gentle\\&quot;, you have to power the brush on and hit the mode button a couple of times.  That gets tedious if you brush several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The unit is a little loud, but you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It took over 24 hours to initially fully charge the brush.  The manual states that 40 mins (from empty) will give you enough charge for a 2-minute brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The charge/storage stand is a flat thing meant to sit on the counter, unlike my Sonic&#x27;s wall-mount. My bathroom counter is short on space, so that means the charger goes in the closet and I have to fish it out every time I want to charge.  I&#x27;d have much preferred a design that could be wall-mounted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, considering my preference for my old sonic, I&#x27;d probably be happier with the [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic]], a slim, much cheaper sonic model (doesn&#x27;t have a rotary head). If you prefer a rotary brush, try the next step down, the [[ASIN:B007VXJK6E Oral-B Smartseries 4000]], which is a bit cheaper and omits the wireless gadgetry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my old Oral-B Sonic Complete for 6 years before its batteries (soldered in, officially non-replaceable) finally failed. I&#x27;m not sure I like this Smartseries toothbrush enough for it to last that long, but more generally I&#x27;d like to see Oral-B and other vendors provide replaceable battery packs.  Charge a premium for them, but make it so I don&#x27;t have to junk the device or pull out the soldering iron when the batts fail.  At least the batteries in this new model are NIMH, which neither have a \\&quot;memory effect\\&quot; nor are particularly toxic if you throw the unit away.  (although, you should still recycle them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended since the toothbrush cleans well, but with some reservations..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The charge/storage stand is a flat thing meant to sit on the counter, unlike my Sonic&#x27;s wall-mount.

            <li> I am very impressed with my new tooth brush. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and love it!  I had a Philips Sonicare for over 5 years and it was my first electronic brush - I much prefer my OralB 5000!  The side monitor takes a little getting used to but it is kind of neat. If you have kids it would be great and encouraging for them. Anyway I am more than happy and love the small circular head.</li>
            <li> I love my tooth brush. My teeth feel so clean and my mouth so fresh after brushing. Does an excellent job on my teeth and my gums feel so much better since I have been using this tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Virginia Deraney</li>
