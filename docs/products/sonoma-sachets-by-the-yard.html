            <li> wonderfully fragrant.  pretty</li>
            <li> The product is very nicely packed, has a good amount of lavander and smells strong, which I hope will keep the moths away; My mother in law brought some of her woolen clothes when moving with us, and I know she had a moth problem at her house.... I am hoping the problem doesn&#x27;t move with us as well ;))</li>
            <li> Really excellent. I bought several other brands but this is the best.  I have bought more than a dozen, after the first order, a gifts for friends.</li>
            <li> beautifully presented and packaged.  comes with a pretty ribbon at the top, to hang in your closet, or you can cut them in between the sachets very easily to put in your drawers.  scent is very pretty. shipped quickly too.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on a Friday not expecting them for at least a week...imagine my surprise when they showed up on Monday! The sachets are just what I was looking for! The fragrance is not overpowering but it helps to keep clothes in dresser drawers fresh and prevent them from smelling like the varnish! I will most definitely buy these again when I am out from this seller!!</li>
            <li> my title says it all. i love the scent , but it&#x27;s almost impreceptible after i&#x27;ve put 2 satchets in each drawer. i&#x27;ve purchased one more pack and will put more in my closet and see if it makes a difference. would be nice if i could actually smell it!</li>
            <li> Nice presentation. Makes a lovely present.  The lavender smell is strong when you first get it and can be replenished later on with a spray.  Moths ran away when I bought several of these and put them in my closet and drawers. Much nicer than those disgusting moth lavender scented balls sold at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Nothing toxic. Like Cedar they need to be freshened up every now and then.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time, as described.  It was wrapped nicely and was packaged well. The aroma is wonderful! I would buy from this vender again.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Very fresh and clean smelling. Not dusty at all like some lavender can be. Wrapped very nicely too. Package came on time.</li>
            <li> Lovely!  The scent is gorgeous.  It wafted out of the packaging!</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  The quantity for the price was very fair, and the packaging was very nice as well.  Thank you</li>
            <li> my entire mailbox smelled lovely when these arrived these arrived in the package! i cut each satchel and used my own ribbon to tie and hang in closets and on walls and kitchen cabinets. you can just cut each satchel and lay them in closets etc. but they are pretty so i like displaying them. lavender repels moths and the moths have not gone near my kitchen with thesr, plus i have cedar oil sprayed in kitchen.  you csn freshen the scent by adding essential oils to the satchel.</li>
            <li> This is a welcome substitution for those awful smelly moth balls that is both healthy and beautiful.  The sachets bring a scent of a French garden into your home and will repel insects as well.</li>
            <li> Very little fragrance.  Not worth the money.  I hung it in closet and there is no fragrance that hangs in air or clings to clothes.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent. I like it very much!</li>
            <li> These are great. There are 8 sachets in a yard that can easily be snipped off to spread out in your drawers or throughout your closet. There is ribbon at one end that can easily be tied to whatever you want to hang it off of in your closet. I like that you can see the lavender buds -- confirming that it&#x27;s truly lavender and not something artificial. They smell really nice as well. The next test is to see how long the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> This makes a great gift! I bought one as a Christmas present and now I am ordering one for myself. You get eight satchels that you can hang or cut into individuals. Delivery was fast!</li>
            <li> Fantastic - and I couldn&#x27;t find this product elsewhere.  Perfect for unexpected gift obligations and also for a treat for myself.</li>
            <li> The sachets are lovely packed with a pretty bow. The smell is not strong, the lavender&#x27;s color is beautiful and all my closets smell amazing. I highly recommend this item, enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful  item that works. Fantastic for closets and dresser drawers for. Aroma  and to keep away moths.  I keep mine refreshed every few months by purchasing lavender oil and putting several drops on each square and  rubbing it in and they last forever by keeping them refreshed.  These make great gift items.</li>
            <li> You will feel like you stepped into a spa with the wonderful aroma these give off. I use lavender for everything in my home. Such a great price compared to other online sites.</li>
            <li> i ORDERED THESE TO HANG IN ALL OF MY CLOSETS AND LINEN DRAWERS TO PROTECT FROM BUGS  THEY ARRIVED QUICKLY AND ARE HARD AT WORK THROUGHOUT MY HOUSE.</li>
            <li> these smell so good. the scent lasts very very long. they still have scent almost a year later. i use them in dresser drawers</li>
            <li> received as promised!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s presented very nicely.</li>
            <li> This is the second yard of lavender I have purchased because the first proved so useful.  I cut the packets apart, using pinking shears, for use as sachets in all our sweaters and wool items.  We live in a rural area where clothes moths have been a problem.  The lavender makes a pleasant repellant; I just crush the sachets in my hand from time to time to keep the bouquet fresh.  My husband is as willing to wear sweaters protected by lavender as I because he likes the aroma, too.  It&#x27;s certainly far more pleasant than the scent of mothballs!</li>
            <li> these are sssssso nice..Love the shells that come in the bag...nice fresh scent too...will use them all over the house</li>
            <li> I found a hole in one of my dresses last year and while I am not sure if the hole was due to moths or my dog, I went into moth panic mode. I have a small fortune invested in clothes so I went and bought a whole bunch of moth prevention stuff. This was one of my purchases. I got them due to the great reviews and I was not disappointed.  Its been a year and they still smell great!  I have a large 7x15 closet. I split them in half and hung them at two points in my closet.  Every couple of weeks I scrunch them and they will smell great again. They make my entire closet smell good. Considering how long they&#x27;ve lasted, they have been a great investment.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my home and they have no lavendar scent to them at all.  Waste of money and effort.  Would not order again.</li>
            <li> I am finally organizing my seasonal clothing and have found these little packets handy to avoid musty smells.  They are a bit pricey, but highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Sonoma lavender sachets by the yard ... what a lovely idea.  For those who love the scent of lavender, here is an economical way to put sachets in all places where you want the scent of lavender, including placing one with a sweater gift, or other clothing gift,  for a delightful addition when the gift is opened.  Would purchase again when needed from this seller.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Repeat customer many times over! Wonderful gifts!</li>
            <li> Bought two for Christmas presents this year.  Beautifully wrapped.  Pretty bow and tulle fabric with a nice tag. Fragrance is wonderful.  I want to order one for myself!</li>
            <li> Very nice lavender scent. Love that that it can be cut into individual pouches.  Have given several as gifts and I will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> The scent was heavenly. It was attractively packaged - absolutely loved the presentation. It was shipped in a timely fashion.</li>
