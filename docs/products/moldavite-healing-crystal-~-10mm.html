            <li>Beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful crystal.</li>
            <li>Beautiful piece of Moldavite.</li>
            <li>I am happy with it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will cost me more to return, not going to put salt into the wound!</li>
            <li>Is it really authentic!</li>
            <li>It has a warm tingling feeling that everyone feels.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging with instructions.</li>
            <li>Very strong energy.</li>
            <li>Goodness, the postage cost more than the piece.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this was packaged with the story of the meteorite</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>*** ain&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>Authentic moldavite is pricy and you have to be willing to pay because the s</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool.  </li>
            <li>How cool is that.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it came fast.</li>
            <li>It came quickly which is always a plus</li>
            <li>The moldavite is small but it has an amazing energy to it!</li>
            <li>Better to shop for stones in person at an actual store.</li>
            <li>Even more so than some of my bigger moldavites.  </li>
            <li>Very small...not worth the money....</li>
            <li>I was expecting an actual crystal and what I received was more like a piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li>Appears authentic, but is a sliver...1/2&amp;#34; at its widest and 1&amp;#34; long  and about 1/8 inch at its thickest with ends that taper to a point and weighs almost nothing.  </li>
            <li>picture is of a pure crystal...</li>
            <li>The price was very affordable.</li>
            <li>am very desapointed</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel anything from this particular piece.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest that when buying moldavite online - you educate yourself on what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>Small tiny piece...not thrilled.  </li>
            <li>The item was so tiny it looked like a chip that fell off the real crystal when someone dropped it.  </li>
            <li>but i what I expected given how rare of a stone it is.</li>
            <li>A very tiny piece of a stone - which is completely overpriced!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never expected such a miniature piece.  </li>

            <li> not at all what I expected...</li>
            <li> extremely small, can&#x27;t visually tell what it is.</li>
            <li> Bought with 2 other stones...</li>
            <li> it is so very small you can barely hold it between your fingertips.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the expense.</li>
            <li> The price was average from I what I have seen.</li>
            <li> And I mean tiny!</li>
            <li> I found the stone to be extremely too small...</li>
            <li> It looked like a tiny piece of broken black glass.</li>
            <li> Also the price is a dead giveaway.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was small</li>
            <li> This is NOT authentic moldavite, it&#x27;s recycled bottle glass.</li>
            <li> Very small, not the size shown in the picture.</li>

            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!! NEVER AGAIN</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it was I actually received, but it was definitely not moldavite. It looked like a tiny piece of broken black glass. And I mean tiny! Very disappointing! Buyers beware when ordering crystals online! Better to shop for stones in person at an actual store.</li>
            <li> The moldavite is small but it has an amazing energy to it! The price was very affordable. Sometimes people complain about the cost and size of moldavite stones, but I have to say the one I have is very small but highly charged. Even more so than some of my bigger moldavites.  So, I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool.  I thought it&#x27;d be a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Appears authentic, but is a sliver...1/2&amp;#34; at its widest and 1&amp;#34; long  and about 1/8 inch at its thickest with ends that taper to a point and weighs almost nothing.  I had hoped it would be larger.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest that when buying moldavite online - you educate yourself on what you are looking for. You can tell from this picture that someone to make glass look like moldavite. Also the price is a dead giveaway. Authentic moldavite is pricy and you have to be willing to pay because the s*** ain&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> it was so tiny that I felt like no energy can be communicated.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking 3.5 inches instead I received .04 total. A very tiny piece of a stone - which is completely overpriced!&lt;br /&gt;It will cost me more to return, not going to put salt into the wound!</li>
