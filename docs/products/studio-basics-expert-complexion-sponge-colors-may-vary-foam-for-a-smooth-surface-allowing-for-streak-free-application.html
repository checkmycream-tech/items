            <li> It works fine but I prefer to buy the small disposable ones so I don&#x27;t have to wash it all the time.</li>

            <li> Great applicator!! Blends my foundation and concealor smoothly.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as a beauty blender. The only thing is, I found these at dollar tree so I&#x27;m a little disappointed I got it here.</li>
            <li> Little stiff of a sponge, but good quality for the price</li>
            <li> Oh.my.gosh!  A friend suggested I try these beauty blenders.  The ones I found were way too expensive.  I refuse to spend $25-50 on a makeup sponge!  So, I bought this brand and I love it!  It blends my makeup very smoothly and naturally.  My husband even noticed that my foundation looked more natural.  The tip gets in the crevices around the nose and around the eyes.  Only negative is that it does initially soak up a lot of foundation.  I have no problem with that because I&#x27;ve found that once initially saturated, it doesn&#x27;t soak up too much on future uses.  I would definitely recommend purchasing!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Colors Vary&amp;#34; is very accurate. I received a beige sponge.. never seen that color.  I figured since it&#x27;s getting covered in foundation what the heck. It is definitely a nice sponge for the money.</li>
            <li> I use this sponge to apply liquid under eye concealer mostly, and it&#x27;s perfect for that with the tapered end. It does soak up a lot of foundation/BB cream, so I don&#x27;t use it a lot for applying that, but I do like the smooth finish it gives me. It&#x27;s great for blending and the shape is great for reaching all areas of your face.</li>
            <li> Pretty happy with this sponge. Use it daily now to put on my make-up. It has made the process quicker and blends it very well.</li>
            <li> These work well, but I found another brand on save and subscribe that works just as well at a fraction of the cost of these.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great! It makes my makeup look flawless and covers very well! It is also the perfect size and becomes very soft when moist. The best way to apply makeup using this product is getting it damp. The only issues I have had with this sponge is that it absorbs makeup very easily and therefore I have to use more makeup to cover what I want to cover. It also does not wash as well as I would like. Overall, the pros definitely outweigh the cons and I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
