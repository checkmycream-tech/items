            <li>I love this size -</li>
            <li>, many of the creams I have tried before have not smelled very well, this one smells great.</li>
            <li>But if you choose just use your hands ok</li>
            <li>all and all this cream works : )&lt;</li>
            <li>She says her skin seems smoother, more tone and tighter.</li>

            <li>Love the feel of this.</li>

            <li>Excited to see results!</li>
            <li>Smells nice (mild scent)</li>
            <li>It came nicely packaged and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Koi feels more moisturized, toned, smooth.</li>
            <li>I love the light scent it has and how easy it is to put on.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not just lay on top of the skin.  </li>
            <li>It was extremely important to me that this company does not test on animals.</li>
            <li>Smooth silky lotion</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Really works!!!</li>
            <li>at first i see nothing, but after 14 days my thighs are almost cellulite free, i know its not a permanent fix but its better than what i was looking at before.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li>it is receiving, or if one or more of these ingredients really do lessen cellulite -- but either way -- I will take it!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>Excited about results with continued use,</li>
            <li>I am excited to see results.</li>
            <li>Just a tip- when you&#x27;re applying the lotion to areas of cellulite, make sure to really take your time massaging it into the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is starting to feel smoother and as a woman that makes me feel good about myself.  </li>
            <li>The company recommends to use this product I think for 2-3 months to see the full affect that it has to offer but from what I used I feel that this will do everything it claims to do.  </li>
            <li>This is a new line of products and so far I am loving them :)</li>
            <li>I could smell the clean, fresh scent when I opened the box, with a handwritten thank</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t too greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Item came quickly shipped at weight of 3.2 oz</li>
            <li>Item came quickly shipped at weight of 3.2 oz</li>
            <li>Plus it is not greasy as other products I have tried, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Fast absorption, my skin feels so smooth when I massage the area with this cream</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s nice product</li>
            <li>I purchase the smaller bottle it does have a nice smell and</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier that the product is doing what it describes and that I made the right decision to purchase this for her.</li>
            <li>I received my cellulite cream right on time..</li>
            <li>I have been working out and eatting right, so I will update in a week or so if I see any changes.</li>
            <li>The smell is a light citrus scent that isn&#x27;t over powering and won&#x27;t over power your normal perfume or body sprays.</li>
            <li>so you get a lot with your first order.  </li>
            <li>:) Keeping legs hydrated is key.</li>
            <li>and you really will see results!  </li>
            <li>She has been using it for a short time but asked how she could get more of it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>smells really good compared to other cellulite lotions and also, i really liked that i  immediately just felt a little tighter in the area where i put it after rubbing it in</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer as well, which has made me seriously consider just using it as a lotion</li>
            <li>I have only tried it for a few days now, but I love it and will purchase more!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I really can tell a difference in the texture of my skin --</li>
            <li>Skin is more firm leaving it so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I really wished I could have used it.</li>
            <li>I really like this anti-cellulite body lotion</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>

            <li>and I can see better tone on my thighs after using it consistently every morning for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Although the bottle is rather small, this lotion is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a slight reduction, waiting on more as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li>High hopes dashed, still lumpy and bumpy.....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s working really well.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice thick cream, and</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make any difference yet, I am excited to see how it works!</li>
            <li>Gave this to my wife, she&#x27;s been using this and told me that she really felt her skin on her face got soft and after three days of using this her skin never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how well it works at this point, but I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>feels exactly like a regular lotion and the size of a travel size lotion</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Wow amazed at how my face felt so new and soft!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take very long for it to get absorbed.</li>
            <li>Light moisturizer that I been applying to the typical problem areas of thigh, buttocks, and abdomen.</li>
            <li>I love this cream so much that I am torn because I want to use it everywhere -- but I have a small bottle and want it to last  too!</li>
            <li>however I did order the smaller size, and using it for more than &#x27;spot treatments&#x27; would be a little cost prohibitive.</li>
            <li>and so far I think I need to use longer to see results</li>
            <li>So far I think that I like this.</li>
            <li>I like what I see so far but will update as time passes.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Almond Oil - Helps to make the skin supple, silky, soft.</li>
            <li>I used this product and when I first applied the product to my freshly cleaned skin I had a slight tingly feeling that went away about 2 mins later.  </li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance, but it is not strong enough for me to notice a particular &#x27;scent&#x27;.</li>

            <li> It is super easy to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li> it is receiving, or if one or more of these ingredients really do lessen cellulite -- but either way -- I will take it!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Excited about results with continued use,</li>
            <li> I am excited to see results.</li>
            <li> Just a tip- when you&#x27;re applying the lotion to areas of cellulite, make sure to really take your time massaging it into the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is starting to feel smoother and as a woman that makes me feel good about myself.  </li>
            <li> The company recommends to use this product I think for 2-3 months to see the full affect that it has to offer but from what I used I feel that this will do everything it claims to do.  </li>
            <li> This is a new line of products and so far I am loving them :)</li>
            <li> I could smell the clean, fresh scent when I opened the box, with a handwritten thank</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t too greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Item came quickly shipped at weight of 3.2 oz</li>
            <li> Item came quickly shipped at weight of 3.2 oz</li>
            <li> Plus it is not greasy as other products I have tried, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Fast absorption, my skin feels so smooth when I massage the area with this cream</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s nice product</li>
            <li> I purchase the smaller bottle it does have a nice smell and</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier that the product is doing what it describes and that I made the right decision to purchase this for her.</li>
            <li> I received my cellulite cream right on time..</li>
            <li> I have been working out and eatting right, so I will update in a week or so if I see any changes.</li>
            <li> The smell is a light citrus scent that isn&#x27;t over powering and won&#x27;t over power your normal perfume or body sprays.</li>
            <li> so you get a lot with your first order.  </li>
            <li> :) Keeping legs hydrated is key.</li>
            <li> and you really will see results!  </li>
            <li> She has been using it for a short time but asked how she could get more of it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> smells really good compared to other cellulite lotions and also, i really liked that i  immediately just felt a little tighter in the area where i put it after rubbing it in</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer as well, which has made me seriously consider just using it as a lotion</li>
            <li> I have only tried it for a few days now, but I love it and will purchase more!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I really can tell a difference in the texture of my skin --</li>
            <li> Skin is more firm leaving it so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I really wished I could have used it.</li>
            <li> I really like this anti-cellulite body lotion</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>

            <li> and I can see better tone on my thighs after using it consistently every morning for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Although the bottle is rather small, this lotion is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a slight reduction, waiting on more as I continue to use it.</li>

            <li> So far, it&#x27;s working really well.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice thick cream, and</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make any difference yet, I am excited to see how it works!</li>
            <li> Gave this to my wife, she&#x27;s been using this and told me that she really felt her skin on her face got soft and after three days of using this her skin never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it works at this point, but I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> feels exactly like a regular lotion and the size of a travel size lotion</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Wow amazed at how my face felt so new and soft!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take very long for it to get absorbed.</li>
            <li> Light moisturizer that I been applying to the typical problem areas of thigh, buttocks, and abdomen.</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much that I am torn because I want to use it everywhere -- but I have a small bottle and want it to last  too!</li>
            <li> however I did order the smaller size, and using it for more than &#x27;spot treatments&#x27; would be a little cost prohibitive.</li>
            <li> and so far I think I need to use longer to see results</li>
            <li> So far I think that I like this.</li>

            <li> I used this product and when I first applied the product to my freshly cleaned skin I had a slight tingly feeling that went away about 2 mins later.  </li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance, but it is not strong enough for me to notice a particular &#x27;scent&#x27;.</li>

            <li> Now it tighten up my inner thigh areas ~ and I noticed a little bit of the saggy areas in the thighs and lower butt cheeks starting too tighten up a little more this stuff works</li>
            <li> I think maybe you shouldn&#x27;t use it generously if you want it to last long enough to see it&#x27;s affect.</li>
            <li> My skin has become very tight and the cellulite is almost completely gone!!</li>
            <li> It definitely is a fantastic lotion but is expensive for just lotion.</li>
            <li> Only used a few days so no major findings</li>
            <li> It does slightly tighten the skin and reduce the appearance of cellulite, on a temporary basis- which is going to be the result of any cream, so this is not a draw back.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for only a few days but can feel a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself is pink.</li>

            <li> I have only been using it for a few days, and after applying it 2xs a day, I am already seeing a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure if it&#x27;s only temporary.</li>
            <li> not sure if this is simply due to the nourishment and extra moisture</li>
            <li> - not just put it on like any other cream.  </li>
            <li> Only been using for a few hours and seems to be doing a difference!</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle, but a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> High hopes dashed, still lumpy and bumpy.....</li>
            <li> Nice feel and smell. Excited to see results!</li>
            <li> This cream smells great! A little bit of it goes a long way. Just a tip- when you&#x27;re applying the lotion to areas of cellulite, make sure to really take your time massaging it into the skin. This not only helps the lotion sink in and do its job, but you&#x27;re also stimulating blood flow to the area, which will only help to lessen the appearance of cellulite. It was extremely important to me that this company does not test on animals. Kudos for a great cream and ethical standing. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for only a few days but can feel a difference in my skin.  My skin is starting to feel smoother and as a woman that makes me feel good about myself.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what it does after a month :)</li>
            <li> Great item, just what i expected.&lt;br /&gt;Great Item and Great seller. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.&amp;#34;  I used this product and when I first applied the product to my freshly cleaned skin I had a slight tingly feeling that went away about 2 mins later.  The company recommends to use this product I think for 2-3 months to see the full affect that it has to offer but from what I used I feel that this will do everything it claims to do.  I also got a call from customer service for a follow up I thought that was a good service to offer plus they send a coupon to use on your next order so you get a lot with your first order.  I will use this product again thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now. I like the smell and so far I think I need to use longer to see results</li>
            <li> So far I think that I like this. It has only been a week since I have been using it. I like what I see so far but will update as time passes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good product but it&#x27;s smaller than i thought. But overall it&#x27;s nice product</li>
            <li> I purchase the smaller bottle it does have a nice smell and its been a couple weeks since I been using it.  Honestly not seeing any difference</li>
            <li> Loved it.. i see the difference in just couple days.</li>
            <li> This product smells FANTASTIC!  I&#x27;m not sure how well it works at this point, but I love the way it smells.  I&#x27;d use it for that alone.</li>
            <li> I can feel an instant firming action with this. I believe overtime it will make the cellulite on my thighs look to be less. :) Keeping legs hydrated is key. This isn&#x27;t too greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Although the bottle is rather small, this lotion is amazing.  Smells wonderful, does not leave your feeling greasy nor is it too think and you really will see results!  Been using for over 6 months now and will keep ordering!</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s working really well.  I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement.  I&#x27;m just not sure if it&#x27;s only temporary. We will see.</li>
            <li> I gave this 2 weeks before deciding to leave a review because creams like these do not work overnight an needs time, at first i see nothing, but after 14 days my thighs are almost cellulite free, i know its not a permanent fix but its better than what i was looking at before.</li>
            <li> Really works!!! Improved cellulite after 2 weeks!!</li>
            <li> Just started using it, it smells great! I&#x27;ll post in a few weeks to tell you if I notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged. It has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I love the fact that it is organic and not tested on animals! Appears to be working, but I will update in a few weeks when I have used it for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> Makes a big difference in appearance of cellulite.</li>
            <li> The cellulite creams smells so good! It has a flowery smell. I love putting it on because it makes me smell good. The lotion itself is pink. It is super easy to rub into your skin. It doesn&#x27;t take very long for it to get absorbed. While I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make any difference yet, I am excited to see how it works! Honestly, even if it doesn&#x27;t work, I would still use it for the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this at a discounted price in order to give my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> feels exactly like a regular lotion and the size of a travel size lotion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often take the time to sit and write a review however, I was impressed from the start! The shipping was prompt, and the packaging had eye appeal. I could smell the clean, fresh scent when I opened the box, with a handwritten thank you note inside...who does that nowadays? I have only tried it for a few days now, but I love it and will purchase more!</li>
            <li> This is a new line of products and so far I am loving them :)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking to purchase a great product at an AFFORDABLE PRICE!</li>
            <li> My niece just had a baby and she is using it --- she loves it and says it works wonders !</li>
            <li> I have been working this lotion into my work out routine and I am starting to see improvements. I recommend getting the bigger bottle, the 2oz is just not enough! So happy I chose this product.</li>
            <li> I feel like it gives me a bit more confidence during this swim season.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through a friend and purchased it for my Mom as a gift. She has been using it for a short time but asked how she could get more of it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier that the product is doing what it describes and that I made the right decision to purchase this for her.</li>
            <li> Smooth silky lotion..Love it!</li>
            <li> This organic cellulite cream is a great formula of quality ingredients. It does slightly tighten the skin and reduce the appearance of cellulite, on a temporary basis- which is going to be the result of any cream, so this is not a draw back. It has a light fragrance, but it is not strong enough for me to notice a particular &#x27;scent&#x27;. It is a nice thick cream, and a quarter sized amount seems to work for me for each thigh. It is a great moisturizer as well, which has made me seriously consider just using it as a lotion all over- however I did order the smaller size, and using it for more than &#x27;spot treatments&#x27; would be a little cost prohibitive. I recommend purchasing the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Thanks for an organic and good for me product!</li>
            <li> WOW!  Love this!  The smell reminds me of the beach and tanning. LOL  There is NO feeling of greasiness or residue leftover. Absorbs quickly. Fingers don&#x27;t feel sticky at all!  GREAT product and HIGHLY recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast! thank you!!! I have been using this for about 5 days now. It smells wonderful, with a citrusy scent and leaves my skin feeling super soft... but NOT greasy. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Oh my noticed difference in one day!!!! Wow amazed at how my face felt so new and soft!</li>
            <li> Minty refreshing lotion.  My skin feels at least a little bit tighter I thnk!</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I had used this for a while before I left a review. This cream is amazing! My skin has become very tight and the cellulite is almost completely gone!! I can not praise this cream enough. I would highly recommend. Give it enough time to actually work.</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much that I am torn because I want to use it everywhere -- but I have a small bottle and want it to last  too! The ingredient list is what convinced me to try it - the way it is nourishing my skin is what will keep me using it.  I use it on my upper arms and thighs - and I really can tell a difference in the texture of my skin -- not sure if this is simply due to the nourishment and extra moisture it is receiving, or if one or more of these ingredients really do lessen cellulite -- but either way -- I will take it!</li>
            <li> Love this. Has a nice clean scent. Not runny, not too thick. Just kind of... perfect. In just a few days, I am seeing my thighs look and feel smoother! So happy with this!</li>
            <li> Im not so crazy about the caffeine but hey it works great! This is an awesome cellulite cream. It is organic and that&#x27;s a plus! Skin is more firm leaving it so soft and smooth. Goodbye cellulite with this product. Definitely worth the buy! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Light moisturizer that I been applying to the typical problem areas of thigh, buttocks, and abdomen. Nice grapefruit smell. Koi feels more moisturized, toned, smooth. Excited about results with continued use,</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful when I put it on. It is nice and creamy and easy to spread. It soaks in and makes my skin feel great. The problem is there are only 2 ounces and it says to use generously on cellulite areas. I used it on my butt, stomach and thighs. I think I will run out of the cream before I will be able to see any affect it has. I have used it three nights in a row and no change yet but I am getting to the end of it. It definitely is a fantastic lotion but is expensive for just lotion. I&#x27;m hoping to see changes soon before it&#x27;s all gone. I think maybe you shouldn&#x27;t use it generously if you want it to last long enough to see it&#x27;s affect.</li>
            <li> I Love that this Cellulite Cream is Organic &amp; made from Botanicals &amp; Herbs. Very impressive!</li>
            <li> smells really good compared to other cellulite lotions and also, i really liked that i  immediately just felt a little tighter in the area where i put it after rubbing it in</li>
            <li> Most people no matter your size have stretch marks or cellulite of some sort. This an amazing organic product that will help combat those marks on your skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Divine Alchemy Cellulite Cream for a few weeks now - I use it at night after my shower and I take a few minutes to massage it in where I have cellulite - not just put it on like any other cream.  I love the light scent it has and how easy it is to put on.  It absorbs quickly and does not just lay on top of the skin.  My skin looks more plumped - so I think it is getting well hydrated.  I will see in time if it helps with the cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have horrible eczema and probably should have known better than to try a different cream.  I put this cream on my thighs and within a day I had horrible eczema all over my legs and butt.  I had to quit using it.  The smell was great and I really wished I could have used it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Fast absorption, my skin feels so smooth when I massage the area with this cream</li>
            <li> Gave this to my wife, she&#x27;s been using this and told me that she really felt her skin on her face got soft and after three days of using this her skin never felt so soft. So writing this to say great you got an A+ for this, thank you.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to say that I was not pleased with this product.  I did continue the bottle until it was gone but didn&#x27;t notice any change of my skin and cellulite.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Its ok makes skin feel good.</li>
            <li> I have the 8 oz bottle as well. I love this size - I have it in my gym bag and apply it after my workout/shower.</li>
            <li> First and foremost this stuff smells great, many of the creams I have tried before have not smelled very well, this one smells great. I have seen a slight reduction, waiting on more as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This did not work at all anywhere. This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really like this anti-cellulite body lotion - it&#x27;s a pink cream that&#x27;s very moisturizing. Smells nice (mild scent) and I can see better tone on my thighs after using it consistently every morning for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moMNOLXL27J0IU]]I&#x27;ve been using this beautifully fragrant cream for  about 9 days .

            <li> My wife is using this and says it&#x27;s nice and it&#x27;s working. She is using it in her legs and two keloid scars. She says her skin seems smoother, more tone and tighter. She already asked me to order more for her.</li>
            <li> Only been using for a few hours and seems to be doing a difference!</li>
            <li> I received my cellulite cream right on time.. I have only been using it for a few days, and after applying it 2xs a day, I am already seeing a slight improvement. I cant wait to see my results after a month or two of use! Plus it is not greasy as other products I have tried, and it smells amazing! I would highly recommend getting this product! I received this product at a discounted price for my unbiased review!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I have some cellulite on my upper back thighs and when offered this product I couldn&#x27;t resist not giving it a try. It came nicely packaged and arrived quickly.  The cream is very nice and smooth and applies nicely over the skin. I have only used it a few days so I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a change, but I will update as I continue to use the product. The smell is a light citrus scent that isn&#x27;t over powering and won&#x27;t over power your normal perfume or body sprays. The scent does fade of which is nice if you do use any perfumes or body sprays.  It is a small bottle, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this.</li>
            <li> Excited to see results! Only used a few days so no major findings but it smells great and feels good on skin</li>
            <li> So far so good! Nice light scent too!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!!! The scent is amazing (very fresh and clean), and it leaves no greasy residue on my hands after applying or on my body!!! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Received the product very quick! I am very pleased with the very light scent it has. It is not overpowering. I am excited to see results. I have been working out and eatting right, so I will update in a week or so if I see any changes. Also, I am glad there is a protective seal. It lets me know it has never been used!</li>
