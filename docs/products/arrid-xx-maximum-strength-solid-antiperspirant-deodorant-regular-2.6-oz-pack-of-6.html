            <li>It does a good job of keeping you dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One consumer note, watch the price if you use Subscribe and Save.  </li>
            <li>loved this for a while.  </li>
            <li>The fragnace is not the best, but it is a powerful deorderant.</li>
            <li>It might be a pH thing and not be perfect for everyone - but it&#x27;s the right one for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having to watch out of the corners of my eyes now to make sure one of the guys  doesn&#x27;t beat me to death because I smell like a box of tampons soaked in potpourri !    </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>Arrid XX gives max protection with almost no scent of its own.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice just having a stick to go to when you run out.</li>
            <li>It was a great mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love the product, and the fact that they shipped it abroad was amazing</li>
            <li>I found cheap and smell good.</li>
            <li>I find this scent to not be overly masculine so its perfect for a girl (me) or a man.</li>
            <li>I like it because its own scent is very mild</li>
            <li>have really enjoyed shopping with Amazon as It allows me to stay away from Walmart -</li>
            <li>my husband favorite</li>
            <li>/&gt;You also won&#x27;t find it at a better price than this.</li>
            <li>The stores cost more and don&#x27;t never carry all what you need</li>
            <li>This popular brand is not always available in whatever store we happen to be shopping in so</li>
            <li>For many years I used unscented deodorants because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of any scented deodorants I tested (not tested by buying them; I just pull the cap off in the store to see what they smell like, and most of them make we want to puke.)  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>After try for long time some antiperspirants - deodorant, Arrid is the best.</li>
            <li>Six might seem like a lot, but it is really great to just reach into the cupboard when I need a new one.</li>
            <li>Very loyal to it as it was to me.</li>
            <li>It is now way too strong and cologne-y smelling.</li>
            <li>I did notice that the scent was now much more mild.</li>
            <li>Our days together ended i found another and things are going good so far.</li>
            <li>Found this at the mens side at a rite aid near my home loved it.</li>
            <li>Original formula lasted all day&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I prefer the smell of my own body odor (after a week with no shower) to the new Arrid XX formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many deodorants - some that are unisex like this one, some aimed directly at women...</li>
            <li>Affordable, clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the B.O. away for me all day</li>
            <li>I did not find anything as good, so when I heard that Arrid had brought the original scent back</li>
            <li>Been using it since high school, works great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As expected happy with purchase</li>
            <li>I use to feel fresh and clean all day.</li>
            <li>* Mild scent, blocks odor well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased that I don&#x27;t need to find a new brand.</li>
            <li>They changed the fragrance formula and now it is TOO strong and smells too much like a teenager&#x27;s body spray.  </li>
            <li>would be nice if they would let us do a trade-in of the new toxic waste version for the one everyone loved.</li>
            <li>Regular scent is the amazing</li>
            <li>Arrid no longer keeps me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried this particular product, but I can certainly identify with those who are complaining about the nauseating stink of most deodorants.  </li>
            <li>Arrid XX never disappoints and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>, then I sweat it off right away.</li>
            <li>Please be assured that performance, efficacy and safety is always the top priority and this product will deliver the same underarm odor and wetness protection as it has in the past.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>This is a solid sundry, and one that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>I order this every six months, one for me and one for my husband each month which is MORE than enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll wait for it to go on sale or even pay more for it at the local drugstore before I&#x27;d ever buy this again.</li>
            <li>What concerns me, having used this product for the last 25 years, is that I now have more of the scent I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m on Amazon now is to see whether I could get a better deal through Amazon, but</li>
            <li>Sure, they call it a value, but you only get 1/2 a container!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s back though, so the negative reviews of this great product can stop!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since high school, and to be completely honest with you, I didn&#x27;t notice the fragrance change, BUT they have, according the lable, brought back the \\&quot;classic fragrance\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>But I discovered that Arrid&#x27;s \\&quot;Cool Shower\\&quot; scent is much more tolerable (at least tolerable for me, your mileage may vary :^&gt;) than any other I&#x27;ve been exposed to, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and find it available in a lot more places.  </li>
            <li>the best online deal I could find costs 32% more (on a price + shipping, per-ounce basis) than what I&#x27;m paying now, and the worst I&#x27;ve seen costs 274% more (and I&#x27;m excluding those little 1 ounce versions which cost 339% and 625% more per ounce.  </li>
            <li>a man shouldn&#x27;t smell like a field of roses--but it is extremely effective in doing what it&#x27;s sold to do, even over my typical 14-15 hour days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the whole idea behind deodorant is that it does its job without making you smell like your great aunt&#x27;s 1930&#x27;s obnoxious anisette flower perfume...    </li>
            <li>- thanks, Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was very convenient to purchase multiples online.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the scent -</li>
            <li>Thanks for everyone else who commented here.</li>
            <li>Do they really think we dont notice this</li>
            <li>This has been the only product that is not sticky, is mild, goes on smoothly, does not transfer to clothing, keeps me dry and smelling fresh all day no matter the temperature or activity.</li>
            <li>: I found the original formula at Safeway this week, with a red \\&quot;Classic Fragrance\\&quot; label on the cap.  </li>
            <li>less smell to me, no disgusting fragrances,  very efficient.  </li>
            <li>The price nearly doubled from my first purchase.  </li>
            <li>M.Goff, I haven&#x27;t been able to track down the \\&quot;classic\\&quot;</li>
            <li>You have to screw the plunger half way to the top to get product.</li>
            <li>When Amazon has a \\&quot;Classic Fragrance\\&quot; catalog item, I&#x27;ll rate that accordingly.]</li>
            <li>Arrid XX Antiperspirant/Deodorant has worked for both male and female members of our family for years and we are quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products, Dove, Degree, Secret without consistent success.</li>
            <li>According to the company - \\&quot;In an effort to maintain a product that meets the high expectations of the ArridÂ® Deodorant Anti-Perspirant consumers</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great Product - but this price is too high....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for as long as I can remember and I am so glad to have it back</li>
            <li>It smells pretty much the same, but it makes my armpits itch</li>
            <li>The smell is very subtle and pleasant - like baby powder.</li>
            <li>That is until my wife brought home the new look Arrid</li>
            <li>New look?  </li>
            <li>Although the Supermarket did have the new stinky stuff on sale for $1.50 a stick a week or so ago.</li>
            <li>Maybe Arrid is realizing they made a \\&quot;New Coke\\&quot; type mistake?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finding a new deodorant is the pits...</li>
            <li>--I&#x27;m a pretty traditional guy when it comes to scent...</li>
            <li>The old product has this code at the bottom: LL1175 and the new one has:</li>
            <li>I liked the super strong smell everyone complained about, I&#x27;m sorry to see that it&#x27;s gone now.</li>
            <li>Arrid Extra Dry Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Clear Gel, Morning Clean, 2.6 oz (73 g)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for near 20 years.</li>
            <li>still miss you old arrid</li>
            <li>So I guess I was using my old stash.</li>
            <li>Anyone have advice on a product that works and smells like the old arrid</li>
            <li>as there are probably still some of the old spice rejects hanging around.</li>
            <li>I noticed the ingredients differ from my old stick and from what is listed &amp; pictured here.</li>
            <li>It is one of the few deodorants, that will keep me clean and smelling decent after working 14 hours in the kitchen, or doing car work outside for 6 hours in 90 degree weather.</li>
            <li>this is the only one I&#x27;ve used that keeps me dry and odor free all day long and does not cause irritation on my skin after shaving my armpits.</li>
            <li>Once in a while I try a new brand, but always come back to Arrid XX.</li>
            <li>Ive never felt compelled to comment on personal hygiene products until I had the displeasure of using the \\&quot;New look-Crummy smell\\&quot;</li>
            <li>New formula doesn&#x27;t last all day&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Does anyone really have the time to blow dry their under arms these days?    </li>
            <li>Arrid XX has 19 percent aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly (active ingredient) most others that are 17 percent or less, and do not work for dryness or stank.</li>
            <li>, a fragrance modification was made to keep the product modern and aligned with current personal care fragrance trends.</li>
            <li>Scents and fragrances are tightly-linked to identity, and forcing customers to reevaluate their relationship with such an intimate product will definitely backfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No other product works 100% of the time.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Arrid keeps me dry in the hot, humid days of south Alabama AND the scent does not compete with my regular perfume.  </li>
            <li>This may disqualify my review from getting posted, but the cheapest place I&#x27;ve found to buy \\&quot;Cool Shower\\&quot;, along with several other varieties of deodorant, is at my local Walmart which has the 2.8oz containers for $1.97 + tax.  </li>
            <li>I wont begin to try comment for other folks, but I don&#x27;t particularly care to smell like deodorant,</li>
            <li>It compares ingredient wise to Clinical Strength Secret and is usually located next to it, IF you can find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>I just bought Arrid extra Dry clear gel.</li>
            <li>Apparently enough people wrote in concerning the horrible new fragrance that they&#x27;ve now changed it back to the original one that we all know and love.  </li>

            <li> Arrid XX Antiperspirant/Deodorant has worked for both male and female members of our family for years and we are quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products, Dove, Degree, Secret without consistent success.</li>
            <li> According to the company - \\&quot;In an effort to maintain a product that meets the high expectations of the ArridÂ® Deodorant Anti-Perspirant consumers</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great Product - but this price is too high....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for as long as I can remember and I am so glad to have it back</li>
            <li> It smells pretty much the same, but it makes my armpits itch</li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle and pleasant - like baby powder.</li>
            <li> That is until my wife brought home the new look Arrid</li>
            <li> New look?  </li>
            <li> Although the Supermarket did have the new stinky stuff on sale for $1.50 a stick a week or so ago.</li>
            <li> Maybe Arrid is realizing they made a \\&quot;New Coke\\&quot; type mistake?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finding a new deodorant is the pits...</li>
            <li> --I&#x27;m a pretty traditional guy when it comes to scent...</li>
            <li> The old product has this code at the bottom: LL1175 and the new one has:</li>
            <li> I liked the super strong smell everyone complained about, I&#x27;m sorry to see that it&#x27;s gone now.</li>
            <li> Arrid Extra Dry Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Clear Gel, Morning Clean, 2.6 oz (73 g)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for near 20 years.</li>
            <li> still miss you old arrid</li>
            <li> So I guess I was using my old stash.</li>
            <li> Anyone have advice on a product that works and smells like the old arrid</li>
            <li> as there are probably still some of the old spice rejects hanging around.</li>
            <li> I noticed the ingredients differ from my old stick and from what is listed &amp; pictured here.</li>
            <li> It is one of the few deodorants, that will keep me clean and smelling decent after working 14 hours in the kitchen, or doing car work outside for 6 hours in 90 degree weather.</li>
            <li> this is the only one I&#x27;ve used that keeps me dry and odor free all day long and does not cause irritation on my skin after shaving my armpits.</li>
            <li> Once in a while I try a new brand, but always come back to Arrid XX.</li>
            <li> Ive never felt compelled to comment on personal hygiene products until I had the displeasure of using the \\&quot;New look-Crummy smell\\&quot;</li>
            <li> New formula doesn&#x27;t last all day&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Does anyone really have the time to blow dry their under arms these days?    </li>
            <li> Arrid XX has 19 percent aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly (active ingredient) most others that are 17 percent or less, and do not work for dryness or stank.</li>
            <li> , a fragrance modification was made to keep the product modern and aligned with current personal care fragrance trends.</li>
            <li> Scents and fragrances are tightly-linked to identity, and forcing customers to reevaluate their relationship with such an intimate product will definitely backfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No other product works 100% of the time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Arrid keeps me dry in the hot, humid days of south Alabama AND the scent does not compete with my regular perfume.  </li>
            <li> This may disqualify my review from getting posted, but the cheapest place I&#x27;ve found to buy \\&quot;Cool Shower\\&quot;, along with several other varieties of deodorant, is at my local Walmart which has the 2.8oz containers for $1.97 + tax.  </li>
            <li> I wont begin to try comment for other folks, but I don&#x27;t particularly care to smell like deodorant,</li>
            <li> It compares ingredient wise to Clinical Strength Secret and is usually located next to it, IF you can find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> I just bought Arrid extra Dry clear gel.</li>
            <li> Apparently enough people wrote in concerning the horrible new fragrance that they&#x27;ve now changed it back to the original one that we all know and love.  </li>
            <li> I live in Panama and they stopped bringing this product down here alltogether</li>
            <li> This new smell of Arrid XX literally makes me sick and if I can smell it, everyone within a 5 foot circle can too, including the guys on the jobsite that might think Ive gotten light in the shoes !</li>
            <li> I brought a few new ones a month ago</li>
            <li> Does not last long and has a strange smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m finding in recent years that unscented versions keep getting harder to find, and I also resent what seems like price gouging in the unscented deodorant market.  </li>
            <li> Ran out and tried some other brands lately, whew, I&#x27;m back and will never run out again, thanks to Amazon, with the automatic delivery option.</li>
            <li> tried the other scent, and the same problem happened.</li>
            <li> Arrid XXtra dry .    </li>
            <li> , while not causing dry rashes, it lets through some sweat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am always dry.</li>
            <li> every single stick.  </li>
            <li> It gets 5 stars for being a multi-pack that was just slightly cheaper than what I buy individually from the store.  </li>
            <li> But, when I am not working hard, or just relaxing, I always use my Old Spice or Axe deodorant.</li>
            <li> Now the shelves are empty.</li>
            <li> Just be careful about buying without smelling for awhile,</li>
            <li> This is the second S&amp;S item to jump to a crazy high price just a month or two later.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had found it ten years ago, what a waste of time and money other products have been until now!</li>
            <li> , he tried other products but he always ask me to get this one and ignore the rest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cobbling of six individual items, all defaced with stickers and brutally strapped together with plastic wrap and more stickers.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> apply this product after a shower and in less than 2 hours I noticed that this alleged ANTI ANTIPERSPIRANT does NOT work.</li>
            <li> I am an active 40yo, lean, I eat well, and I will be discontinue the use of this product.</li>
            <li> This brand is hard to find in the store and it&#x27;s the only brand that doesn&#x27;t make my bf&#x27;s skin itchy.</li>
            <li> If church and Dwight wants to cater to children and or modern people that like to smell funky, then release Arrid for teenagers or folks that obviously have Dorito bag B.O. warranting this dreadful scents cover up.    </li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant since at least the mid-1990s and it has been the only deodorant that works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other deodorants, but I feel like I need to reapply other brands after just a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Every deodorant stick in my pack had a hidden air pocket (deformity)  at the bottom of the stick.  </li>
            <li> That said, \\&quot;Get rid of the new scent, It smells worse than any b.o. one could ever muster\\&quot; !</li>
            <li> I recommended to keep your armpits dried...</li>
            <li> Same blue tube, new dreadful smell !    </li>
            <li> BUT DONT MESS WITH WHAT THE MASSES HAVE TO COME TO ACCEPT AS THE NORM !    </li>
            <li> Then last week I bought another and the same bad smell.</li>
            <li> So, I resorted to Secret and a few other brands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, for recent reviewers who wrote about a weird scent, I don&#x27;t know what you are talking about.  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering like others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I can only assume that this company purchased factory seconds and failed to disclose this.</li>
            <li> I used to get at least two wearings out of dress shirts before needing to launder them--but now they stink by the end of one day.</li>
            <li> So you may want to give that a try - or at least a cap-off sniff in the store.    </li>
            <li> I mean, with Arrid, I can mow my yard for hours and STILL not reek.  </li>
            <li> When it fails, droplets run down, even when not in the heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just adding my voice to the chorus of people who hate the new updated formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> This is not a good trend for Amazon and their resellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the environment is hot and nasty, I need something that will work.</li>
            <li> I am forced to order online, this is the online deodorant that works for me!</li>
            <li> I am convinced they changed the formula for the worse.</li>
            <li> (It gets worse once you put it on.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving my one-star review since this product is the new, terrible, formula.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what happened, but about a year or so ago, Arrid deodorant became IMPOSSIBLE to find.  </li>
            <li> and I thought I bought the wrong scent.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve bought twice and still get the same horrible stench.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really weird about deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was going crazy.</li>
            <li> WRONG !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad -</li>
            <li> They changed the scent and its bad.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointing that the price on this is up over 6 dollars from when I bought it in June - 6 Dollars really??&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but with this price increase I would be stupid to purchase here instead of Walmart.......</li>
            <li> I buy this stuff in bulk because I hate shopping for it.</li>
            <li> I hate going to the store.</li>
            <li> HATED THEM!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Church &amp; Dwight Co. have made a terrible marketing mistake.  </li>

            <li> I am not sure what happened, but about a year or so ago, Arrid deodorant became IMPOSSIBLE to find.  None at WalMart, none at Walgreens, none at CVS.  So, I resorted to Secret and a few other brands.  HATED THEM! I smelled like wilted flowers or wilted baby powder - ewwww!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrid keeps me dry in the hot, humid days of south Alabama AND the scent does not compete with my regular perfume.  I mean, with Arrid, I can mow my yard for hours and STILL not reek.  I have used this brand for as long as I can remember and I am so glad to have it back - thanks, Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, with Amazon Subscriptions program, it&#x27;s a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for recent reviewers who wrote about a weird scent, I don&#x27;t know what you are talking about.  Arrid XX gives max protection with almost no scent of its own.  It&#x27;s still the best!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years now. Once in a while I try a new brand, but always come back to Arrid XX.</li>
            <li> They changed the fragrance formula and now it is TOO strong and smells too much like a teenager&#x27;s body spray.  My husband and I have both stopped using it.  According to the company - \\&quot;In an effort to maintain a product that meets the high expectations of the ArridÂ® Deodorant Anti-Perspirant consumers, a fragrance modification was made to keep the product modern and aligned with current personal care fragrance trends. Please be assured that performance, efficacy and safety is always the top priority and this product will deliver the same underarm odor and wetness protection as it has in the past.\\&quot;    I wish companies would stop catering to a teenage audience and appreciate their long-term customers.  It&#x27;s too bad - I have used this brand since college.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for near 20 years. It was a great mild fragrance. All of a sudden they change the fragrance. It is now way too strong and cologne-y smelling. Horrible.</li>
            <li> Ive never felt compelled to comment on personal hygiene products until I had the displeasure of using the \\&quot;New look-Crummy smell\\&quot; Arrid XXtra dry .    I&#x27;ll preface this lambasting by saying that Ive been an ARRID user since 1984 and have always like that this particular deodorant was previously non   competing with colognes nor did one wreak of it as it did it&#x27;s job...    That is until my wife brought home the new look Arrid and I basically smeared a box of ARRID labeled deodorant tampons soaked in potpourri under my arms last week ... What ever happened to truth in product labeling? New look?  WRONG ! Same blue tube, new dreadful smell !    I wont begin to try comment for other folks, but I don&#x27;t particularly care to smell like deodorant, the whole idea behind deodorant is that it does its job without making you smell like your great aunt&#x27;s 1930&#x27;s obnoxious anisette flower perfume...    This new smell of Arrid XX literally makes me sick and if I can smell it, everyone within a 5 foot circle can too, including the guys on the jobsite that might think Ive gotten light in the shoes ! I&#x27;m having to watch out of the corners of my eyes now to make sure one of the guys  doesn&#x27;t beat me to death because I smell like a box of tampons soaked in potpourri !    If church and Dwight wants to cater to children and or modern people that like to smell funky, then release Arrid for teenagers or folks that obviously have Dorito bag B.O. warranting this dreadful scents cover up.    BUT DONT MESS WITH WHAT THE MASSES HAVE TO COME TO ACCEPT AS THE NORM !    I called C&amp;D to complain and the offered my money back and some coupons for another product. In essence they basically told me to use a roll-on as that scent is still the same. Roll-on ? Seriously? Does anyone really have the time to blow dry their under arms these days?    Church and Dwight.... You just lost a 27 year customer, and my search for a non invasive scented deodorant begins today....27 years of deodorant buying can put akid through college for what you people charge today !    That said, \\&quot;Get rid of the new scent, It smells worse than any b.o. one could ever muster\\&quot; !</li>
            <li> I live in Panama and they stopped bringing this product down here alltogether so no I am forced to order online, this is the online deodorant that works for me!</li>
            <li> Hey deodorant is deodorant.</li>
            <li> I prefer the smell of my own body odor (after a week with no shower) to the new Arrid XX formula. Arrid must be going after the market segment occupied by street people. Arrid&#x27;s market research must have concluded that the majority of us will soon be in that segment with the economy headed in the current direction. Maybe they should call it Arrid SP.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointing that the price on this is up over 6 dollars from when I bought it in June - 6 Dollars really??&lt;br /&gt;I have really enjoyed shopping with Amazon as It allows me to stay away from Walmart - but with this price increase I would be stupid to purchase here instead of Walmart.......Come on Amazon don&#x27;t stop being competitive with them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product - but this price is too high....</li>
            <li> The only deodorant I use. Been using it since high school, works great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant since 1995. I&#x27;ve tried all the fragances, excellent product, no complains at all... I recommended to keep your armpits dried...</li>
            <li> I called the company and they said marketing had determined an update was in order. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 20+ years, but they&#x27;ve lost my business. Guess I have to find another deodorant made by someone else. Although the Supermarket did have the new stinky stuff on sale for $1.50 a stick a week or so ago. Now the shelves are empty. Maybe Arrid is realizing they made a \\&quot;New Coke\\&quot; type mistake?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only hope. Finding a new deodorant is the pits...</li>
            <li> my husband favorite, he tried other products but he always ask me to get this one and ignore the rest.</li>
            <li> This is a solid sundry, and one that I have used for many years. I like it because its own scent is very mild--I&#x27;m a pretty traditional guy when it comes to scent... a man shouldn&#x27;t smell like a field of roses--but it is extremely effective in doing what it&#x27;s sold to do, even over my typical 14-15 hour days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also won&#x27;t find it at a better price than this. Six might seem like a lot, but it is really great to just reach into the cupboard when I need a new one. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just adding my voice to the chorus of people who hate the new updated formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Church &amp; Dwight Co. have made a terrible marketing mistake.  Scents and fragrances are tightly-linked to identity, and forcing customers to reevaluate their relationship with such an intimate product will definitely backfire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike M.Goff, I haven&#x27;t been able to track down the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update Jun. 23]: I found the original formula at Safeway this week, with a red \\&quot;Classic Fragrance\\&quot; label on the cap.  I&#x27;m pleased that I don&#x27;t need to find a new brand. I&#x27;m leaving my one-star review since this product is the new, terrible, formula.  When Amazon has a \\&quot;Classic Fragrance\\&quot; catalog item, I&#x27;ll rate that accordingly.]</li>
            <li> I was an arrid user for 5 years. Very loyal to it as it was to me. But someone decided to change the fragrance and the ingredients in it. Wish i could beat that person up. We had a good thing going. I use to feel fresh and clean all day. No foul odors in these pitts. Our days together ended i found another and things are going good so far. Arrid no longer keeps me smelling fresh. Does not last long and has a strange smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they can bring back the fragrance and everything it had to offer before i would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am female and used arrid for a while i found it was stronger than a womans deodorant. Found this at the mens side at a rite aid near my home loved it. Got hooked on it. But i always felt that it was open to both genders it didnt smell manly just good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still miss you old arrid</li>
            <li> awesome product i like it!</li>
            <li> USED it for YEARS.  The only deodaurant that does the job for me.  The regret I do have is that it contains harmful ingredients.  Aluminum is a contributor to ALZHIEMER&#x27;s!!!  PLEASE CHANGE THE INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deodorant.  Nothing fancy about it.  It gets 5 stars for being a multi-pack that was just slightly cheaper than what I buy individually from the store.  It&#x27;s nice just having a stick to go to when you run out.</li>
            <li> It compares ingredient wise to Clinical Strength Secret and is usually located next to it, IF you can find it in the stores. I order this every six months, one for me and one for my husband each month which is MORE than enough. Great price and love subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Greeting,&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product and I was happy to find a bulk pack.  It does a good job of keeping you dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One consumer note, watch the price if you use Subscribe and Save.  The price nearly doubled from my first purchase.  Only by chance did  notice this before the order shipped.  This is the second S&amp;S item to jump to a crazy high price just a month or two later.  This is not a good trend for Amazon and their resellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-D</li>
            <li> I have found the best deal for deod. The stores cost more and don&#x27;t never carry all what you need</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, and great service.</li>
            <li> Love the product, and the fact that they shipped it abroad was amazing</li>
            <li> I found cheap and smell good.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going crazy. I buy this stuff in bulk because I hate shopping for it. So I guess I was using my old stash. I brought a few new ones a month ago and I thought I bought the wrong scent. Then last week I bought another and the same bad smell. They changed the scent and its bad. It actually gives me a headache.    Anyone have advice on a product that works and smells like the old arrid xx??????</li>
            <li> As advertised and on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many deodorants - some that are unisex like this one, some aimed directly at women... this is the only one I&#x27;ve used that keeps me dry and odor free all day long and does not cause irritation on my skin after shaving my armpits. The smell is very subtle and pleasant - like baby powder. I&#x27;ve never had this stuff stain a blouse. It might be a pH thing and not be perfect for everyone - but it&#x27;s the right one for me.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Original formula lasted all day&lt;br /&gt;* Does not clump&lt;br /&gt;* Mild scent, blocks odor well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* New formula doesn&#x27;t last all day&lt;br /&gt;* When it fails, droplets run down, even when not in the heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved this for a while.  I had a couple of 6-packs, and thought I&#x27;d found my product.&lt;br /&gt;Then on a refill, it stopped working all day.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the other scent, and the same problem happened.</li>
            <li> Arrid XX never disappoints and the price is right.  With three kids, who i would appreciate wearing deoderant, this gives them no excuses.  I&#x27;ve ordered the 6 pack twice, now, and the teenagers are grabbing one when they need it.  Phew!!</li>
            <li> less smell to me, no disgusting fragrances,  very efficient.  not much more to describe this product that i&#x27;m aware of</li>
            <li> Apparently enough people wrote in concerning the horrible new fragrance that they&#x27;ve now changed it back to the original one that we all know and love.  Just be careful about buying without smelling for awhile, as there are probably still some of the old spice rejects hanging around.</li>
            <li> This popular brand is not always available in whatever store we happen to be shopping in so it was very convenient to purchase multiples online.  Arrid XX Antiperspirant/Deodorant has worked for both male and female members of our family for years and we are quite pleased.  This product performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> Arrid works great and I really like the scent - basically smells like fabric softener used to smell before it got spiked a decade or so ago.  But be warned that it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;pack of six\\&quot; in the way a rational person would expect a quantity retail pack to be.  It&#x27;s a cobbling of six individual items, all defaced with stickers and brutally strapped together with plastic wrap and more stickers.  I&#x27;ll wait for it to go on sale or even pay more for it at the local drugstore before I&#x27;d ever buy this again.</li>
            <li> What concerns me is not that they changed the scent--the only scent I care about is body odor. What concerns me, having used this product for the last 25 years, is that I now have more of the scent I don&#x27;t like. I am convinced they changed the formula for the worse. I used to get at least two wearings out of dress shirts before needing to launder them--but now they stink by the end of one day.</li>
            <li> As expected happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Affordable, clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the B.O. away for me all day, while not causing dry rashes, it lets through some sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves &amp;#34;bleach&amp;#34; stains on shirts if left unwashed.&lt;br /&gt;Ruined 2 shirts already.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this particular product, but I can certainly identify with those who are complaining about the nauseating stink of most deodorants.  For many years I used unscented deodorants because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of any scented deodorants I tested (not tested by buying them; I just pull the cap off in the store to see what they smell like, and most of them make we want to puke.)  But I&#x27;m finding in recent years that unscented versions keep getting harder to find, and I also resent what seems like price gouging in the unscented deodorant market.  But I discovered that Arrid&#x27;s \\&quot;Cool Shower\\&quot; scent is much more tolerable (at least tolerable for me, your mileage may vary :^&gt;) than any other I&#x27;ve been exposed to, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and find it available in a lot more places.  So you may want to give that a try - or at least a cap-off sniff in the store.    P.S.  This may disqualify my review from getting posted, but the cheapest place I&#x27;ve found to buy \\&quot;Cool Shower\\&quot;, along with several other varieties of deodorant, is at my local Walmart which has the 2.8oz containers for $1.97 + tax.  The only reason I&#x27;m on Amazon now is to see whether I could get a better deal through Amazon, but the best online deal I could find costs 32% more (on a price + shipping, per-ounce basis) than what I&#x27;m paying now, and the worst I&#x27;ve seen costs 274% more (and I&#x27;m excluding those little 1 ounce versions which cost 339% and 625% more per ounce.  Ouch!)</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers. The fragnace is not the best, but it is a powerful deorderant. I use it when I am working in the kitchen or outside doing yard work. When the environment is hot and nasty, I need something that will work. It is one of the few deodorants, that will keep me clean and smelling decent after working 14 hours in the kitchen, or doing car work outside for 6 hours in 90 degree weather. But, when I am not working hard, or just relaxing, I always use my Old Spice or Axe deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since high school, and to be completely honest with you, I didn&#x27;t notice the fragrance change, BUT they have, according the lable, brought back the \\&quot;classic fragrance\\&quot;.  I did notice that the scent was now much more mild. It&#x27;s back though, so the negative reviews of this great product can stop!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product. I love it. Now that I can purchase it prime in addition to the discounted price compared to the local store, no trip to the store and multi pack will last for a year.</li>
            <li> Always works great, good price for the bundle of 6.</li>
            <li> Ran out and tried some other brands lately, whew, I&#x27;m back and will never run out again, thanks to Amazon, with the automatic delivery option. Now I&#x27;ll get a case of 6 every 6 months! I hate going to the store. I liked the super strong smell everyone complained about, I&#x27;m sorry to see that it&#x27;s gone now. Arrid XX has 19 percent aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly (active ingredient) most others that are 17 percent or less, and do not work for dryness or stank.</li>
            <li> This is my go to deodorant. Not overpowering like others I&#x27;ve used in the past. I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> After try for long time some antiperspirants - deodorant, Arrid is the best. I am always dry. Regular scent is the amazing</li>
            <li> Thought I was losing my mind. Thanks for everyone else who commented here. Gross. I don&#x27;t know who found the \\&quot;classic\\&quot; smell again but I&#x27;ve bought twice and still get the same horrible stench. (It gets worse once you put it on.) would be nice if they would let us do a trade-in of the new toxic waste version for the one everyone loved. I bet this stuff causes cancer and who knows what else.</li>
            <li> They have changed the formula again and it does not work as well. I have used this deodorant since at least the mid-1990s and it has been the only deodorant that works for me. When Arrid changed the scent in 2011 to something that resembled urine, I had to look around for another product. I did not find anything as good, so when I heard that Arrid had brought the original scent back, I was so relieved. This has been the only product that is not sticky, is mild, goes on smoothly, does not transfer to clothing, keeps me dry and smelling fresh all day no matter the temperature or activity. I recently had to replenish my supply and now it does not work for me at all. It smells pretty much the same, but it makes my armpits itch, then I sweat it off right away. I noticed the ingredients differ from my old stick and from what is listed &amp; pictured here. The old product has this code at the bottom: LL1175 and the new one has: LL425J.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New inactive ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;PPG-14 Butyl Ether&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane&lt;br /&gt;Stearyl Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate&lt;br /&gt;Talc&lt;br /&gt;Hydrogenated Castor Oil&lt;br /&gt;Petrolatum&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Laureth-4&lt;br /&gt;Blue 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;Diisopropyl adipate&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane&lt;br /&gt;Stearyl Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;PPG-14 Butyl Ether&lt;br /&gt;Talc&lt;br /&gt;Hydrogenated Castor Oil&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Laureth-4&lt;br /&gt;Blue 1</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products, Dove, Degree, Secret without consistent success. No other product works 100% of the time. I find this scent to not be overly masculine so its perfect for a girl (me) or a man. LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Wish I had found it ten years ago, what a waste of time and money other products have been until now!</li>
            <li> I have never had defective deodorant before, until now.  Every deodorant stick in my pack had a hidden air pocket (deformity)  at the bottom of the stick.  The result is the product plopping out of the container onto the floor once you try to use the bottom third- every single stick.  I can only assume that this company purchased factory seconds and failed to disclose this.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Does not work.&lt;br /&gt;I apply this product after a shower and in less than 2 hours I noticed that this alleged ANTI ANTIPERSPIRANT does NOT work. I am an active 40yo, lean, I eat well, and I will be discontinue the use of this product. There has to be a reason why this product costs $1 on sale at Pathmark when others start at $3.</li>
            <li> This brand is hard to find in the store and it&#x27;s the only brand that doesn&#x27;t make my bf&#x27;s skin itchy. Like getting a multi-pack so you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works. Always and forever!</li>
            <li> I just bought Arrid extra Dry clear gel. It is 2.6 Oz by weight, but who dispenses anti-perspirant by weight? You have to screw the plunger half way to the top to get product. Sure, they call it a value, but you only get 1/2 a container! Do they really think we dont notice this ripoff?[[ASIN:B001E7BAG6 Arrid Extra Dry Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Clear Gel, Morning Clean, 2.6 oz (73 g) (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arrid XX since I was a teenager (over 30 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really weird about deodorant.  I can&#x27;t stand sticky armpits.  I&#x27;ve tried other deodorants, but I feel like I need to reapply other brands after just a few hours.  When I use Arrid XX I can go all day without reapplying, but I prefer to reapply the deodorant in the afternoon.  I feel like Arrid lasts the longest of any deodorants I have tried.</li>
