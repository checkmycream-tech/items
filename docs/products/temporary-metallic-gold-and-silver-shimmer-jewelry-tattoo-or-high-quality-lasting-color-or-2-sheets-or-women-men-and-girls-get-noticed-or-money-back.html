            <li>I&#x27;ve seen so many girls wearing these metallic tattoos, so when I was given the opportunity to test them out in exchange for an honest review, of course I said yes.</li>
            <li>These tattoos are an it item as of right now and the set I got came with great designs.</li>

            <li>However, if you&#x27;re applying as a bracelet, it&#x27;s best to seek the help of another so that your skin isn&#x27;t stretched which helps the tattoo to stick better.</li>

            <li> Fast Shipping! Love the product! It was just as described! Would order again!</li>
            <li> These metallic temporary tattoos are wildly cool, easy to apply, and last quite a few days before starting to crackle and wear off. I applied them before going to a family holiday get together and everybody commented positively on them. They look cool, and vaguely tribal. My favorites are the feathers and the bracelets that have black and gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These would make a fantastic gift for a preteen, teen, or young college student who enjoys fashion or having fun with her appearance. Though I am 35, I really enjoyed them too. There are multiple sheets in each package and you get enough tattoos that it is easy to share with friends or young relatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Beautiful jewelry for less!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen so many girls wearing these metallic tattoos, so when I was given the opportunity to test them out in exchange for an honest review, of course I said yes. Now I am unfamiliar with other brands, but let me tell you about Bolt Bands.. These. Will. Last. I tried the feather design on my ankle more than TWO WEEKS AGO, and it still almost fully intact (see picture). Even with daily showers and working out 5 days a week, the feather remains. I haven&#x27;t tried rigorously scrubbing it off, as I don&#x27;t want to remove it purposely. I plan to start applying a few more before the SXSW festival, and I am confident these designs will last throughout the week. Great product!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tattoos are just like the temporary/fake tattoos we all played with as kids - just a grown up, chic version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package comes with 2 sheets of tattoos. One sheet contains 6 tattoos in different patterns that range 7-7.75\\&quot; in length, perfect for bracelet applications or vertical placement on the side of your forearm. The other sheet contains 14 tattoos comprised mostly of feathers (bird, peacock) and other patterns that include a cherry, a diamond, triangles, and 2 tattoos meant to be necklaces. Each sheet comes with instructions with pictures on the back. There&#x27;s also a separate sheet with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tattoos are very easy to apply. However, if you&#x27;re applying as a bracelet, it&#x27;s best to seek the help of another so that your skin isn&#x27;t stretched which helps the tattoo to stick better. Make sure that your skin is clean and dry, and free of any oils or lotions before applying. These tattoos are great for parties and stick on  your skin even after a few washings. Great buy and perfect for gifts as well!</li>

            <li> Love it! I bought similar ones from Nordstrom and these will be great to wear on my vacation in the Philippines. :)</li>
            <li> These temporary tattoos are beautiful. In the package you get two sheets of tattoos in golds, silvers and black. You also get a set of instructions and some cotton balls to help you put them on. They are easy to put on. I was able to get one on by myself, but they do recommend that you get some help, especially with the bracelet bands. I didn&#x27;t have any type of skin reaction to these at all. I plan to buy some for my granddaughters. They are very elegant temporary tattoos.</li>
            <li> Thought this would bd a fun little extra gift for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Great product. The tatoos looked so real and stayed on over a week. Would definatrly purchase this high quality product again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Wish there was another sheet in the contents.</li>
            <li> Cute, just use for fun and stayed on well!</li>
            <li> They are so fun and look great on, especially if you were going on a fun in the sun vacation.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend and she just loved it. These tattoos are an it item as of right now and the set I got came with great designs. It also came with cotton balls for application. Really cool item!</li>
            <li> These are the most beautiful temporary tattoos I have personally experienced.  They are truly metallic-looking and absolutely stunning.  They are easy to apply.  They&#x27;re just as easy as the gumball machine tattoos but SO much better.  You do have to be careful to not twist or stretch your skin during application.  It&#x27;s best to have someone help you.  I also used these on my daughter, who is 12.  She loves them!</li>
            <li> A lot of fun! Tattoos for adults! My daughter and I enjoyed playing with these. Easy to apply and remove.  Not tacky ;)</li>
            <li> Love them, and shipped quick as well!</li>
            <li> Very cute selection of tattoos. The gold makes things fun and takes them up a notch as far as overall appearance. The only reason they didn&#x27;t earn five stars from me is due to the fact that application isn&#x27;t always flawless, and this can take away from the look. Great value.</li>
            <li> I received these quickly after ordering. I received 2 sheets with easy to follow instructions. My daughter had a sleep over, so I tested them on her and her friends. They applied easily and lasted several days and through several washes.</li>
            <li> These are surprisingly practical&lt;br /&gt;and great to wear for almost any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to certain types of jewelry&lt;br /&gt;which makes this item a viable option.&lt;br /&gt;The designs are beautifully made and&lt;br /&gt;are easy to apply.  And complement&lt;br /&gt;any wardrobe ranging from casual to&lt;br /&gt;elegant.  Highly recommended for&lt;br /&gt;anyone looking for a functional accessory.</li>
            <li> Super cute! I haven&#x27;t seen metallic temporary tattoos before and these are really cool! There are 2 sheets, one with bracelet designs and another with necklaces and small items. I played around with them and put the diamond tattoo on my wrist. Super easy to put on and long lasting! I showered with this tattoo on my wrist and its still pristine! Fun for all ages! *sample provided for review*</li>
            <li> I’ve been seeing a lot of these jewelry inspired temporary tattoos everywhere - used by celebrities, on models in magazine photos, online stores, and in well-known beauty stores such as Sephora.  So I was excited to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.  These are such beautiful designs – very elegant and classy looking.  I just love the shiny, foiled colors and detailed designs.  They applied easily and lasted through several showers before I finally scrubbed it off with ease.  I definitely recommend these and look forward to more designs from this company as I’m sure they won’t disappoint.</li>
            <li> I love how these tattoos look. I&#x27;ve had them on for 2 days and it hasn&#x27;t faded or peeled off yet.</li>
            <li> This is a super cute idea for my little girl to experiment with some cute designs that are all totally temporary.  I think it also makes a great gift.  A nice way to add some sparkle to your outfit for a party or whenever you go out.</li>
            <li> I have two teenage daughters who thought these were really cool and plan on using them during sandal season. I will update on how well they wear and last.</li>
            <li> I was expecting my order Monday or Tuesday, but it arrived on Sunday! My birthday! An awesome gift to me from me! The seller, Bolt Bands, was fast in delivery and something that I&#x27;m not accustomed too.&lt;br /&gt;Bolt Bands Gold Temporary Tattoos is a new product to me. I purchased this product thinking to gift it to my daughter (16yrs). Now seeing it, decided to share it with her.  I love the way it shimmers like jewelry, she loves both the shimmery and glitter of it. The product is exactly what is described and it is two sheets. My daughter chose the jewelry and feather designs, I was left with the bands designs. The directions is included with the product along with a few cotton balls to help with application and it&#x27;s easy to follow. We had no problems in applying, having fun, and the removal was easy. I had recommended this to my neighbors who asked, my daughter told me that recommended to her friends that wanted to know where she got it from. I also suggest that you should give it a try.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and quality product!</li>
            <li> Great for a night out!</li>
            <li> These are bold tattoos! I had the opportunity to try these out at a heavily discounted price, and I will say that they are very shiny, the kids love them, and they last for a week+. However, I don&#x27;t think that I would personally purchase them at their going price.</li>
