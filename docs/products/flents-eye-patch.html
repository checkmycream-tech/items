            <li>Great product and great service</li>

            <li>Good price and delivery from seller.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>Bought to patch my good, dominant eye to &amp;#34;entrain&amp;#34; my non-dominant, cataract-operated eye.</li>
            <li>I am using them to isolate my good eye and thus strengthen the weaker eye.</li>
            <li>Gives good coverage without any pressure on the eye.</li>
            <li>Good quality eye patch.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>so I could wear my glasses to see out of my one good eye.</li>
            <li>Good eye patch.</li>
            <li>This patch does a good job.</li>
            <li>It fits good and leaves plenty of space for the eye.</li>
            <li>The fit is perfect.</li>
            <li>this eyepatch is more like a joke!</li>
            <li>someone mentioned they can wear it on top of glasses !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a joke !</li>
            <li>Works great and fits fine.</li>
            <li>Great to use after cataract surgery when you want to block out the light.</li>
            <li>Works great I might not be able to close my eye but using these eye patches I am able to aim when I shoot.</li>
            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>THEY WORKED OUT NICE FOR THAT</li>
            <li>They allow the user to wear glasses over the patch which is nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that there are three in the box</li>
            <li>Great product, super speedy delivery, thank you</li>
            <li>If you cut a piece of cardboard and attach a string to it you will be more satisfied!</li>
            <li>This is a good product and is cheap and affordable that does the job.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product for keeping light out of one&#x27;s eye, when dealing with a situation requiring such.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>good value, comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable too.</li>
            <li>No pressure on his eye at all, and the elastic strap is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Was very comfortable and allowed me to blink without brushing the patch.</li>
            <li>and it was very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are cupped which makes them very comfortable since  nothing touches the covered eye.</li>
            <li>If you have hat size greater than 7.5 this may be</li>
            <li>way WAY better that what the hospitals had</li>
            <li>The appropriate price should have one dollar per count, as priced in the dollar tree stores.</li>
            <li>Ok in an emergency.</li>
            <li>It works, but you expect something better from this.</li>
            <li>I do need more already.</li>
            <li>Maybe during daytime it would be better.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m glad to say, my vision is 20/20 again.</li>
            <li>The patch cut out all light and was a nice relief to give my eye a break.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t end up using it but instead bought a better patch from my eye doctor after the operation in September.</li>
            <li>To allow myself a bit more wriggle room, I removed one of the lenses from a pair of glasses and the patch doesn&#x27;t interfere with the glasses at all</li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The patch isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is more than sufficient for my needs, and I will likely order this product again if I ever need more patches.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I have used these patches for many years</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never found any better for me.</li>
            <li>Excellent Product Overall!!!</li>
            <li>This style is so comfortable and protects the eye while I sleep !</li>
            <li>and this was way better than the patch they give you at the hospital.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you wanted to use it to hld gauze over the  eye it might be ok.</li>
            <li>im ok with it.</li>
            <li>One the bright side I am right handed</li>
            <li>a good addition to my first aide kit</li>
            <li>He says these are the most comfortable patches he has ever had.</li>
            <li>I wish they were a tad more ergonomic, but you can crush them as needed to keep light out.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty good fit</li>
            <li>Soft to the touch and feels great on the face.</li>
            <li>These are so cheap they don&#x27;t even line them with foam, so unless they happen to fit your face perfectly, there&#x27;s going to be a big gap between your eye and one of the edges.  </li>
            <li>so it can&#x27;t easily be worn under glasses.</li>
            <li>Item was received very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Great product and have ready in our first aid kit for any eye/corneal injury to the athletes</li>
            <li>Otherwise, comfortable and works fine.</li>
            <li>Great for astronomy and light polluted back yards.  </li>
            <li>Fairly comfortable with fabric rather than a strip of foam against the face.  </li>
            <li>The patch was comfortable to wear -</li>
            <li>Comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>but it is cheap and</li>
            <li>Fit well</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a cheap costume.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I have had to stretch some till they fit well.</li>
            <li>and he said the patch is comfortable , for being  what it is.</li>
            <li>so secure</li>
            <li>material is wipe clean.</li>
            <li>Right price, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>for that price it is good enough product for temporary use.</li>
            <li>this eye patch didn&#x27;t full cover my eye, or anyone who tried it on..</li>
            <li>She says that it lets in too much light as it doesn&#x27;t fit her really well.  </li>
            <li>Eye patches were ok, just expected them to fit better.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly so that the covered eye can remain open but blocked from seeing any distracting views or light while concentrating on looking through my telescope eyepiece with my other eye.</li>
            <li>BUYERS BE AWARE !</li>
            <li>Great price durable elastic band, but not too tight.</li>
            <li>That means if you need to cover an eye that can still see but needs to be isolated, you&#x27;re instead going to see tons of light because there is no foam to stop big gaps since these never fit your eye perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way too rigid and not even shaped quite the right way.  </li>
            <li>The shape does not seem quite right.</li>
            <li>The elastic band is just the right length, holding the patch in place without causing a feeling of tightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product is as expected, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>Very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I AM AN ARTIST WITH MACULAR DEGENERATION IN MY LEFT EYE, AND THOUGHT THAT COVERING THAT EYE WITH AN EYE PATCH, WHEN AT MY EASEL, WOULD MAKE THE RIGHT EYE WORK BETTER......</li>
            <li>My husband loves it very much.</li>
            <li>I ordered Flents Eye Patch, they are exactly as advertised, arrived a day earlier &amp; very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much Amazon:) I will be back soon.</li>
            <li>It is neither soft or smooth.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t  completely cover the eye so there are slices where light can be seen.</li>
            <li>it is an INSULT to the people and the seller should really be ashamed !</li>
            <li>I had a problems with this at first and hit me a mailbox-</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s a funny guy.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>It completely covers my eye and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>&gt; The only other consideration is price and AMAZON offers the best choices.</li>
            <li>The elastic band was too tight at first, but with continued wear it stretches out to be more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Far to rigid and doesn&#x27;t fit eye leaving large gaps over nose.</li>
            <li>Oh for ten toes beneath me and me good eye back!</li>
            <li>A younger child would easily cheat and look around them though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than any other eye patch I&#x27;ve tried, but I still haven&#x27;t found one that really gets it right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started leaving the elastic band wrapped around large objects when not in use.</li>
            <li>The patch size is just as ridiculously large as the photo on the box.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in this product.</li>
            <li>Works for me very well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seat very well, but functional.</li>
            <li>Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>The elastic stretches way to much.</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the concave design</li>
            <li>I bought this eye patch to be able to cover one eye while looking through my telescope eyepieces, so that I wouldn&#x27;t need to scruntch one eye closed.</li>
            <li>Helped my eye heal much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now when I get my drink on I can drive with both hand on the wheels again thanks to this eyepatches.</li>
            <li>We have been using them for months now and they have held up really well.  </li>
            <li>This is probably a case by case basis because everyone&#x27;s face is different, but I can only judge from my own experience.</li>
            <li>The eye patch helps you relax the muscles of each eye, practice accommodation, and see if one eye or the other needs more attention.</li>
            <li>/&gt;How can one eyepatch be used for both left and right eyes?!</li>
            <li>Not very comfortable but ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less strain on the bothersome eye - which helps me feel better faster.  </li>
            <li>Obviously my facial bones are crooked :).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Works well, used to train high school basketball player for 3 point shot improvement</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>(Actually ordered to complete a costume for a stage musical, actor says very comfortable even after 3 hrs)</li>
            <li>The patch is ok but the band is not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get it under my glasses by crushing it down just a little.</li>
            <li>its just ok, not able to cover eyes as well as those people said.&lt;br</li>
            <li>KEEP THE LIGHT DOWN IN THE EYE</li>
            <li>I bought a parrot to go along with this patch and to complete my look, but was dismayed to find out they live 75 years.  </li>
            <li>It fits reasonably well, although there is a small amount of light leakage no matter how I position the patch.</li>
            <li>It also means it&#x27;s going to be much less comfortable because you have a rigid edge pressing against your face instead of</li>
            <li>In order to make sure that my hole eye is covered, I have to turned the patch upside-down for it to cover most of my eye, but it feels very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several different eye patches to see what I like best, and this is the most comfortable of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elastic stretches and wears out after a while, but I finally realized I could solve that problem by cutting it, and then just tying it behind my head.</li>
            <li>But havin&#x27; lost it, I&#x27;m glad t&#x27; at least have a patch t</li>
            <li>Just a 30 minute session every few weeks keeps them free of vision problems.  </li>
            <li>Sticks out way to far unless you wear a monocle or don&#x27;t need glasses.</li>
            <li>my grandson has decided he wants to be a pirate next halloween</li>
            <li>No problems as far as I know.</li>
            <li>The picture on the box isn&#x27;t the actual shape of the patch and it doesn&#x27;t cover as much.  </li>
            <li>soft foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attached a picture to show what I&#x27;m talking about.  </li>
            <li>It was far too pointy for my 5 year son too wear with his glasses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The more expensive patches costs 10 times as much have much&lt;br /&gt;cleaner and professional edging than this unit.  </li>
            <li>The Flents Eye Patch is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Bought if for occasional patching for an 11 year old.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a usable patch, but protrudes far enough that wearing it under glasses can be problematic (it works, but it will offset the glasses a bit).</li>
            <li>In 2012 I suffered a major stroke affecting my left side.</li>
            <li>The elastic strap was not sturdy enough and would break, come loose, under normal wear.</li>
            <li>Provides decent blockage of light and vision, but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li>Thrthe only way to get it completely blacked out is to have the elastic directly over my other eye.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit to the rim of my eye socket, leaves a little gap near the nose usually.</li>
            <li>He has to wear it on his good eye to strengthen his bad eye.</li>

            <li> Now, I&#x27;m glad to say, my vision is 20/20 again.</li>
            <li> The patch cut out all light and was a nice relief to give my eye a break.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up using it but instead bought a better patch from my eye doctor after the operation in September.</li>
            <li> To allow myself a bit more wriggle room, I removed one of the lenses from a pair of glasses and the patch doesn&#x27;t interfere with the glasses at all</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The patch isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is more than sufficient for my needs, and I will likely order this product again if I ever need more patches.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I have used these patches for many years</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never found any better for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product Overall!!!</li>
            <li> This style is so comfortable and protects the eye while I sleep !</li>
            <li> and this was way better than the patch they give you at the hospital.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you wanted to use it to hld gauze over the  eye it might be ok.</li>
            <li> im ok with it.</li>
            <li> One the bright side I am right handed</li>
            <li> a good addition to my first aide kit</li>
            <li> He says these are the most comfortable patches he has ever had.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a tad more ergonomic, but you can crush them as needed to keep light out.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good fit</li>
            <li> Soft to the touch and feels great on the face.</li>
            <li> These are so cheap they don&#x27;t even line them with foam, so unless they happen to fit your face perfectly, there&#x27;s going to be a big gap between your eye and one of the edges.  </li>
            <li> so it can&#x27;t easily be worn under glasses.</li>
            <li> Item was received very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Great product and have ready in our first aid kit for any eye/corneal injury to the athletes</li>
            <li> Otherwise, comfortable and works fine.</li>
            <li> Great for astronomy and light polluted back yards.  </li>
            <li> Fairly comfortable with fabric rather than a strip of foam against the face.  </li>
            <li> The patch was comfortable to wear -</li>
            <li> Comfortable to wear.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> but it is cheap and</li>
            <li> Fit well</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a cheap costume.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I have had to stretch some till they fit well.</li>
            <li> and he said the patch is comfortable , for being  what it is.</li>
            <li> so secure</li>
            <li> material is wipe clean.</li>
            <li> Right price, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> for that price it is good enough product for temporary use.</li>
            <li> this eye patch didn&#x27;t full cover my eye, or anyone who tried it on..</li>
            <li> She says that it lets in too much light as it doesn&#x27;t fit her really well.  </li>
            <li> Eye patches were ok, just expected them to fit better.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly so that the covered eye can remain open but blocked from seeing any distracting views or light while concentrating on looking through my telescope eyepiece with my other eye.</li>
            <li> BUYERS BE AWARE !</li>
            <li> Great price durable elastic band, but not too tight.</li>
            <li> That means if you need to cover an eye that can still see but needs to be isolated, you&#x27;re instead going to see tons of light because there is no foam to stop big gaps since these never fit your eye perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too rigid and not even shaped quite the right way.  </li>
            <li> The shape does not seem quite right.</li>
            <li> The elastic band is just the right length, holding the patch in place without causing a feeling of tightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product is as expected, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I AM AN ARTIST WITH MACULAR DEGENERATION IN MY LEFT EYE, AND THOUGHT THAT COVERING THAT EYE WITH AN EYE PATCH, WHEN AT MY EASEL, WOULD MAKE THE RIGHT EYE WORK BETTER......</li>
            <li> My husband loves it very much.</li>
            <li> I ordered Flents Eye Patch, they are exactly as advertised, arrived a day earlier &amp; very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much Amazon:) I will be back soon.</li>
            <li> It is neither soft or smooth.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t  completely cover the eye so there are slices where light can be seen.</li>
            <li> it is an INSULT to the people and the seller should really be ashamed !</li>
            <li> I had a problems with this at first and hit me a mailbox-</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s a funny guy.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> It completely covers my eye and is comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> &gt; The only other consideration is price and AMAZON offers the best choices.</li>
            <li> The elastic band was too tight at first, but with continued wear it stretches out to be more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Far to rigid and doesn&#x27;t fit eye leaving large gaps over nose.</li>
            <li> Oh for ten toes beneath me and me good eye back!</li>
            <li> A younger child would easily cheat and look around them though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than any other eye patch I&#x27;ve tried, but I still haven&#x27;t found one that really gets it right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started leaving the elastic band wrapped around large objects when not in use.</li>
            <li> The patch size is just as ridiculously large as the photo on the box.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Works for me very well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seat very well, but functional.</li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> The elastic stretches way to much.</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the concave design</li>
            <li> I bought this eye patch to be able to cover one eye while looking through my telescope eyepieces, so that I wouldn&#x27;t need to scruntch one eye closed.</li>
            <li> Helped my eye heal much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now when I get my drink on I can drive with both hand on the wheels again thanks to this eyepatches.</li>
            <li> We have been using them for months now and they have held up really well.  </li>
            <li> This is probably a case by case basis because everyone&#x27;s face is different, but I can only judge from my own experience.</li>
            <li> The eye patch helps you relax the muscles of each eye, practice accommodation, and see if one eye or the other needs more attention.</li>
            <li> /&gt;How can one eyepatch be used for both left and right eyes?!</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable but ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less strain on the bothersome eye - which helps me feel better faster.  </li>
            <li> Obviously my facial bones are crooked :).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Works well, used to train high school basketball player for 3 point shot improvement</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> (Actually ordered to complete a costume for a stage musical, actor says very comfortable even after 3 hrs)</li>
            <li> The patch is ok but the band is not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get it under my glasses by crushing it down just a little.</li>
            <li> its just ok, not able to cover eyes as well as those people said.&lt;br</li>
            <li> KEEP THE LIGHT DOWN IN THE EYE</li>
            <li> I bought a parrot to go along with this patch and to complete my look, but was dismayed to find out they live 75 years.  </li>
            <li> It fits reasonably well, although there is a small amount of light leakage no matter how I position the patch.</li>
            <li> It also means it&#x27;s going to be much less comfortable because you have a rigid edge pressing against your face instead of</li>
            <li> In order to make sure that my hole eye is covered, I have to turned the patch upside-down for it to cover most of my eye, but it feels very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several different eye patches to see what I like best, and this is the most comfortable of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elastic stretches and wears out after a while, but I finally realized I could solve that problem by cutting it, and then just tying it behind my head.</li>
            <li> But havin&#x27; lost it, I&#x27;m glad t&#x27; at least have a patch t</li>
            <li> Just a 30 minute session every few weeks keeps them free of vision problems.  </li>
            <li> Sticks out way to far unless you wear a monocle or don&#x27;t need glasses.</li>
            <li> my grandson has decided he wants to be a pirate next halloween</li>
            <li> No problems as far as I know.</li>
            <li> The picture on the box isn&#x27;t the actual shape of the patch and it doesn&#x27;t cover as much.  </li>
            <li> soft foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attached a picture to show what I&#x27;m talking about.  </li>
            <li> It was far too pointy for my 5 year son too wear with his glasses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The more expensive patches costs 10 times as much have much&lt;br /&gt;cleaner and professional edging than this unit.  </li>
            <li> The Flents Eye Patch is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Bought if for occasional patching for an 11 year old.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a usable patch, but protrudes far enough that wearing it under glasses can be problematic (it works, but it will offset the glasses a bit).</li>
            <li> In 2012 I suffered a major stroke affecting my left side.</li>
            <li> The elastic strap was not sturdy enough and would break, come loose, under normal wear.</li>
            <li> Provides decent blockage of light and vision, but it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> Thrthe only way to get it completely blacked out is to have the elastic directly over my other eye.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit to the rim of my eye socket, leaves a little gap near the nose usually.</li>
            <li> He has to wear it on his good eye to strengthen his bad eye.</li>
            <li> If your goal is to correct a lazy eye, complete your halloween costume, or even live out your life-long fantasies of being a pirate while your alone in your room, you&#x27;ve found your product.</li>
            <li> I actually squashed mine to make it flat</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t flat against my eye.</li>
            <li> The patch cuts out all light and doesn&#x27;t feel weird over the eye.</li>
            <li> Not a soft patch.  </li>
            <li> generally wear my glasses down on my nose a bit, so the protruding cone of the patch just comes against the lens.</li>
            <li> These are smaller in depth than the ones I previously purchased from a local drug store.</li>
            <li> I keep a stock of these for people I care for that have double vision due to neurological problems.</li>
            <li> got them to improve my vision and they definitely have made me notice some things about my individual eye vision and how to correct them a little bit</li>
            <li> Bought these for my dry eye condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, there are not much choice in Amazon at this price range.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> But be careful though.</li>
            <li> simple adjustable band would have easily fixed this poorly designed product.</li>
            <li> I purchased these over the adhesives which are very uncomfortable and much higher quality than the old pirate eye patches that I thought I was going to have to wear.</li>
            <li> I went blind of the right eye for 3 months.</li>
            <li> But, due to the surgery I had gone through I could not use patch  because of pain it caused around the eye.</li>
            <li> I have a somewhat lazy left eye</li>
            <li> funny thing is the fake reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried other brands but have never found one that feels better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than this, they are good.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This product absolutely does not fit behind my glasses.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The strap is elastic and not adjustable and uncomfortably tight for my average sized head.  </li>
            <li> These are pointy and odd looking.</li>
            <li> ( I acknowledge it would probably loosen), but the actual eye cup was hard and stiff and kept pressing into the skin around my eye.</li>
            <li> For me, the fit is somewhat poor, making it a little uncomfortable to wear and leaving marks on the skin under my eye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it a four because other eye patches I&#x27;ve used have been so much worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on the material&#x27;s quality, I believe the three patch worth about 2 dollars in total.&lt;br /&gt;btw, it is VERY uncomfortable if you wear glasses</li>
            <li> They were hard to wear- very tight and the strap left little room for blood circulation.</li>
            <li> The band was so tight around my head that it hurt all around my eye.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The elastic is too tight.</li>
            <li> The elastic around the head was too tight</li>
            <li> Elastic strap is tight and causes a headache after extended use</li>
            <li> seemed tight and unfomfortable when worn for extended period of time</li>
            <li> No where do they mention that these WILL NOT fit under eye glasses.</li>
            <li> My had been having trouble with one of his eyes and his doctors suggested he use an eyepatch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit hard to make it out because it&#x27;s black on black, but my finger is pointing at an eye patch that has foam around the edge.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable, stiff and too short elastic.</li>
            <li> I have a lazy eye and need to wear a patch periodically to strengthen my eye.</li>
            <li> a tight fit.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber band may leave you squeezed in all the wrong places.&lt;br /&gt;The material used for the patch is not sewn along the seam from center</li>
            <li> horrible fit on my grandson&#x27;s eye</li>
            <li> Also it is very stiff and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The outer edge is rather hard and digs in making it difficult to wear for any length of time.</li>
            <li> Poor advertising</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> so things could have been much worse.</li>
            <li> This product is poor.</li>
            <li> Bought these for doing the eye exercises to improve focus in one eye which has poor focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use them for maintaining dark adaptation when stargazing, so this can be slightly annoying.</li>
            <li> It is rather expensive, considering the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> It fits well over my blind eye.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Impossible to wear with glasses.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with false claims of &amp;#34;One Size Fits All&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I use these when I get migraines and the worst of the pain is gone, but still have residual pain behind one eye.  </li>
            <li> It is impossible !</li>
            <li> This is horrible!  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer was correct in saying that these are insulting.</li>
            <li> It makes it almost worst than wearing no patch.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, super speedy delivery, thank you</li>
            <li> If you have hat size greater than 7.5 this may be a tight fit.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber band may leave you squeezed in all the wrong places.&lt;br /&gt;The material used for the patch is not sewn along the seam from center&lt;br /&gt;radiating to the edge.  The radial edge is exposed and raised that is&lt;br /&gt;commensurate with the cost of the item.e&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more expensive patches costs 10 times as much have much&lt;br /&gt;cleaner and professional edging than this unit.  Bit, for about 3$&lt;br /&gt;each the differences in quality is expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, there are not much choice in Amazon at this price range.&lt;br /&gt;And for that price it is good enough product for temporary use.</li>
            <li> Fairly comfortable with fabric rather than a strip of foam against the face.  Built in a cone shape (Like Madonna&#x27;s bra) so it can&#x27;t easily be worn under glasses. Good price and delivery from seller.</li>
            <li> This patch is practically unwearable.  It&#x27;s way too rigid and not even shaped quite the right way.  Very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is neither soft or smooth.  Very dissapointed in this product. Can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> Does what it was made for and does it well.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Excellent. As advertised. Bought to patch my good, dominant eye to &amp;#34;entrain&amp;#34; my non-dominant, cataract-operated eye. Doesn&#x27;t work well under glasses but that&#x27;s not their fault.</li>
            <li> way WAY better that what the hospitals had</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with false claims of &amp;#34;One Size Fits All&amp;#34;. The band was so tight around my head that it hurt all around my eye.&lt;br /&gt;A simple adjustable band would have easily fixed this poorly designed product.</li>
            <li> On time. Works for me very well.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife.  She says that it lets in too much light as it doesn&#x27;t fit her really well.  But, it does help her vision problem.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seat very well, but functional.</li>
            <li> I am using them to isolate my good eye and thus strengthen the weaker eye. For this purpose they are subpar. They don&#x27;t  completely cover the eye so there are slices where light can be seen. This somewhat defeats my purpose. Thrthe only way to get it completely blacked out is to have the elastic directly over my other eye.  Also it is very stiff and uncomfortable. The outer edge is rather hard and digs in making it difficult to wear for any length of time.</li>
            <li> This is horrible!  I gave these as a gift to my brother who lost an eye to cancer and it was embarrassing!  If you want a visual of how these look; Madonna&#x27;s cone bra thingy. These are pointy and odd looking. Another reviewer was correct in saying that these are insulting. In the trash!</li>
            <li> Great price durable elastic band, but not too tight. Gives good coverage without any pressure on the eye.</li>
            <li> Good quality eye patch.  But, due to the surgery I had gone through I could not use patch  because of pain it caused around the eye.</li>
            <li> This eye patch is perfect for my needs.  It is very comfortable too.</li>
            <li> Provides decent blockage of light and vision, but it&#x27;s not perfect. It&#x27;s better than any other eye patch I&#x27;ve tried, but I still haven&#x27;t found one that really gets it right. After wearing it for an hour, I am left with an impression on my forehead that lasts about a day. Maybe my head is just too big. I&#x27;ve started leaving the elastic band wrapped around large objects when not in use. I am hoping that that loosens the patch and prevents the marks on my face from showing up, but we&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;m only giving it a four because other eye patches I&#x27;ve used have been so much worse.</li>
            <li> The patch works well.</li>
            <li> Oh for ten toes beneath me and me good eye back! But havin&#x27; lost it, I&#x27;m glad t&#x27; at least have a patch t&#x27; keep t&#x27; bugs out o&#x27; t&#x27; eye socket.</li>
            <li> I have a somewhat lazy left eye so I patch myself once in a while while watching tv and such.  This is a good product and is cheap and affordable that does the job.  Great.</li>
            <li> Not a soft patch.  Impossible to wear with glasses. Poor advertising</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my friend who has to wear an eye patch all the time. He has to wear it on his good eye to strengthen his bad eye. He says these are the most comfortable patches he has ever had. No pressure on his eye at all, and the elastic strap is very comfortable. I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable. The shape does not seem quite right. The elastic is too tight. It is inexpensive and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The quality is like the one you find in dollar trees stores. It is rather expensive, considering the quality of the product. The appropriate price should have one dollar per count, as priced in the dollar tree stores.</li>
            <li> Great to use after cataract surgery when you want to block out the light. Then, after the eye heals, you can use them for your pirate costume!</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable but ok</li>
            <li> I bought them for my husband, since he had a stroke 10 yrs ago, he has double vision and has to cover one eye.</li>
            <li> its just ok, not able to cover eyes as well as those people said.&lt;br /&gt;Based on the material&#x27;s quality, I believe the three patch worth about 2 dollars in total.&lt;br /&gt;btw, it is VERY uncomfortable if you wear glasses</li>
            <li> Ok in an emergency. Poor quality. Not adjustable. Good price.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, they are for Telescope observing; however, I can&#x27;t image any issues.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it very much. He is handicap. he uses it when we go out. It helps him from the Sun or the brightness outside. Thank you very much Amazon:) I will be back soon.</li>
            <li> fits great, can&#x27;t be the price, got 3 for the price of 1. You can&#x27;t adjust the strap but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the tension on it, and I even have a tiny head.</li>
            <li> For me, the fit is somewhat poor, making it a little uncomfortable to wear and leaving marks on the skin under my eye.</li>
            <li> Works well, used to train high school basketball player for 3 point shot improvement</li>
            <li> Right price, easy to use.  I wish they were a tad more ergonomic, but you can crush them as needed to keep light out.</li>
            <li> For some reason this eyepatch does not seem to work on any head shape flawlessly. It works, but you expect something better from this.</li>
            <li> I use these when I get migraines and the worst of the pain is gone, but still have residual pain behind one eye.  It&#x27;s less strain on the bothersome eye - which helps me feel better faster.  Was happy to find these online.</li>
            <li> The Flents Eye Patch is exactly what I expected.  It fits well over my blind eye.</li>
            <li> I ordered Flents Eye Patch, they are exactly as advertised, arrived a day earlier &amp; very comfortable. (Actually ordered to complete a costume for a stage musical, actor says very comfortable even after 3 hrs)</li>
            <li> The elastic stretches way to much. Also the material the eye patch is made of is not a quality product. It seams to wear out.  I wear an eye  patch e every day.  I do need more already.</li>
            <li> No where do they mention that these WILL NOT fit under eye glasses. If you wear glasses, don&#x27;t buy them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to sleep in and protect my eye at night. The elastic around the head was too tight ( I acknowledge it would probably loosen), but the actual eye cup was hard and stiff and kept pressing into the skin around my eye. Couldn&#x27;t wear it at all. Maybe during daytime it would be better. Oh well, the kids will have a Halloween enhancement!</li>
            <li> Product is as expected, good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Bought these because I had cataract surgery and this was a great alternative to taping the metal cup to my face that the eye doctor provided.  Have even shared them with a neighbor that had eye surgery</li>
            <li> Good product. Works as advertised. This item will get a lot of use come halloween (lol).</li>
            <li> In 2012 I suffered a major stroke affecting my left side. Now 2 1/2 years later I can&#x27;t close just my left eye. One the bright side I am right handed so things could have been much worse. One of my longtime passions is shooting. However, I can&#x27;t close my left eye to aim. The idea came to me to try an eye patch. Works great I might not be able to close my eye but using these eye patches I am able to aim when I shoot.</li>
            <li> I went blind of the right eye for 3 months. These patches helped. Now, I&#x27;m glad to say, my vision is 20/20 again. No surgery, no nothing, the vision just came back. Go figure...</li>
            <li> I keep a stock of these for people I care for that have double vision due to neurological problems. Very helpful.</li>
            <li> Very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> If your goal is to correct a lazy eye, complete your halloween costume, or even live out your life-long fantasies of being a pirate while your alone in your room, you&#x27;ve found your product.</li>
            <li> Fits over eye perfectly!!! Great price!!! Will definitely order again!!!</li>
            <li> a good addition to my first aide kit</li>
            <li> Bought these for my dry eye condition. Item was received very quickly. The patch was comfortable to wear - I appreciated the concave design so it wasn&#x27;t flat against my eye. The patch cut out all light and was a nice relief to give my eye a break.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover the eye properly. There is always a centimeter-wide gap no matter how I place it. Maybe it&#x27;s the shape of my head. Otherwise, comfortable and works fine.</li>
            <li> Was very comfortable and allowed me to blink without brushing the patch.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to wear.  Nice quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye patch to be able to cover one eye while looking through my telescope eyepieces, so that I wouldn&#x27;t need to scruntch one eye closed. It works perfectly so that the covered eye can remain open but blocked from seeing any distracting views or light while concentrating on looking through my telescope eyepiece with my other eye.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up using it but instead bought a better patch from my eye doctor after the operation in September.</li>
            <li> Excellent product; doesn&#x27;t bother patient&#x27;s eye.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Who can &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; an eye patch?  But it fits perfectly.  Does the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the only photographer my age who does not wear glasses.  Why?  Because I have kept my eyesight from deteriorating with Bates eye exercises. Just a 30 minute session every few weeks keeps them free of vision problems.  The eye patch helps you relax the muscles of each eye, practice accommodation, and see if one eye or the other needs more attention.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable, stiff and too short elastic.</li>
            <li> Not for under glasses. Didn&#x27;t fit. Had to throw away.</li>
            <li> If you cut a piece of cardboard and attach a string to it you will be more satisfied! this eyepatch is more like a joke! it is an INSULT to the people and the seller should really be ashamed ! people who buy eye patches have medical conditions. If you want to earn profit go choose another business !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How can one eyepatch be used for both left and right eyes?! It is impossible ! beside there is no comfort or anything in this piece of CARDBOARD ! I will be also writing to amazon regarding this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funny thing is the fake reviews of this product. someone mentioned they can wear it on top of glasses ! It&#x27;s more like a joke ! BUYERS BE AWARE !</li>
            <li> The patch is too big and the cord has no way to expand and retract to adjust to the size of the head</li>
            <li> the eye patch works great.thank you.</li>
            <li> this eye patch didn&#x27;t full cover my eye, or anyone who tried it on.. but it is cheap and you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Not for anyone who wears glasses. Sticks out way to far unless you wear a monocle or don&#x27;t need glasses. It&#x27;s like a miniature pointed witches hat. I actually squashed mine to make it flat so I could wear my glasses to see out of my one good eye. Ironically, now that it&#x27;s deformed from me squashing it, it&#x27;s quite comfortable and fits well behind my glasses. I ordered this the day I found out I had to have my eye removed, so it is the only patch I have. I have since found another brand I have ordered that is supposed to work well with glasses. If you don&#x27;t need glasses and don&#x27;t mind the pointed style, you might give it 4 or 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I could not see out of the eye the Patch was on and it was very comfortable to wear. A+++++</li>
            <li> Great for astronomy and light polluted back yards.  Helps you keep your night vision.</li>
            <li> This product is poor. The patches are now made in Bangladesh and are smaller than they used to be. I wont be using them again.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Does not even cover the eye. In order to make sure that my hole eye is covered, I have to turned the patch upside-down for it to cover most of my eye, but it feels very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good fit</li>
            <li> AAARRRGGGGG!  I have a lazy eye and need to wear a patch periodically to strengthen my eye. So these were perfect-- and its a 3 pack...</li>
            <li> Fit well and I was able to get it under my glasses by crushing it down just a little. Helped my eye heal much quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus my grandson has decided he wants to be a pirate next halloween so it&#x27;s a cheap costume.</li>
            <li> It is perfect to pretend to be a pirate in the bathtub.  I bought a parrot to go along with this patch and to complete my look, but was dismayed to find out they live 75 years.  I left all the windows open and now I like to imagine my bird &amp;#34;chirpy&amp;#34; as the leader of the pigeons.  He gives orders and doesn&#x27;t take any flack from anyone.</li>
            <li> I AM AN ARTIST WITH MACULAR DEGENERATION IN MY LEFT EYE, AND THOUGHT THAT COVERING THAT EYE WITH AN EYE PATCH, WHEN AT MY EASEL, WOULD MAKE THE RIGHT EYE WORK BETTER......IT MAYBE DID, BUT WASN&#x27;T THAT NOTICEABLE.</li>
            <li> Elastic strap is tight and causes a headache after extended use</li>
            <li> Good eye patch. Easy to use</li>
            <li> They were hard to wear- very tight and the strap left little room for blood circulation.</li>
            <li> Great product and have ready in our first aid kit for any eye/corneal injury to the athletes</li>
            <li> HAD EYE LAZER SURGERY  IT HELPED  KEEP THE LIGHT DOWN IN THE EYE&lt;br /&gt;  THEY WORKED OUT NICE FOR THAT AND THAT WHAT THERE FOR RIGHT&lt;br /&gt;  SO THEY DID WHAT THEY WHERE MADE TO DO  AND DID IT WELL</li>
            <li> got them to improve my vision and they definitely have made me notice some things about my individual eye vision and how to correct them a little bit</li>
            <li> Works great and fits fine. Soft to the touch and feels great on the face. Also looks great along with a good price</li>
            <li> This patch does a good job. It fits reasonably well, although there is a small amount of light leakage no matter how I position the patch. Obviously my facial bones are crooked :). The elastic band is just the right length, holding the patch in place without causing a feeling of tightness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally wear my glasses down on my nose a bit, so the protruding cone of the patch just comes against the lens. To allow myself a bit more wriggle room, I removed one of the lenses from a pair of glasses and the patch doesn&#x27;t interfere with the glasses at all now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The patch isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is more than sufficient for my needs, and I will likely order this product again if I ever need more patches.</li>
            <li> Bought if for occasional patching for an 11 year old.  He wears them over his glasses and it seems to work okay.  A younger child would easily cheat and look around them though.</li>
            <li> I have used these patches for many years and I&#x27;ve never found any better for me. Over the years I have tried other brands but have never found one that feels better.&lt;br /&gt; The only problem that I have had is that there is some inconsistency in the band length. I have even contacted the manufacturer about this and was told that they are within tolerance. Therefore, I have had to stretch some till they fit well. Other than this, they are good.&lt;br /&gt; The only other consideration is price and AMAZON offers the best choices.</li>
            <li> I like these patches to help protect the eye as it doesn&#x27;t have the foam which some come with. The elastic band was too tight at first, but with continued wear it stretches out to be more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product Overall!!!</li>
            <li> The patch is ok but the band is not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> I like to get my drink on. When I do, I see double. You caint see to drive when you be seeing double- who has time for that? Now when I get my drink on I can drive with both hand on the wheels again thanks to this eyepatches. But be careful though. Only puts ONE on. I had a problems with this at first and hit me a mailbox- one of them bigass blue ones on the corner.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several different eye patches to see what I like best, and this is the most comfortable of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elastic stretches and wears out after a while, but I finally realized I could solve that problem by cutting it, and then just tying it behind my head. Works perfectly that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a bargain, recommended.</li>
            <li> seemed tight and unfomfortable when worn for extended period of time</li>
            <li> Perfect. It fits good and leaves plenty of space for the eye. No problems as far as I know. Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> The elastic strap was not sturdy enough and would break, come loose, under normal wear. I recommend finding another product to use.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for keeping light out of one&#x27;s eye, when dealing with a situation requiring such.&lt;br /&gt;This three pack was an inexpensive way to have several on hand for when the need arises.</li>
            <li> Just had a corneal transplant must wear a patch at night ... This style is so comfortable and protects the eye while I sleep ! Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a usable patch, but protrudes far enough that wearing it under glasses can be problematic (it works, but it will offset the glasses a bit).</li>
            <li> These are smaller in depth than the ones I previously purchased from a local drug store. They allow the user to wear glasses over the patch which is nice. I bought them for husband and he said the patch is comfortable , for being  what it is.</li>
            <li> fits confortable. so secure</li>
            <li> Eye patches were ok, just expected them to fit better.</li>
            <li> The strap is elastic and not adjustable and uncomfortably tight for my average sized head.  The patch size is just as ridiculously large as the photo on the box.</li>
            <li> excellent solution for my damaged eye</li>
            <li> great. good value, comfortable.</li>
            <li> Had Cataract surgery and this was way better than the patch they give you at the hospital.  Enough left over to play pirate at the net Holloween Carnivale!</li>
            <li> I actually got the eyepatch for medical reasons, so I didn&#x27;t stop there. I got a pirate hat and a hook prop, and two digital parrots.</li>
            <li> My friend lost his eye in a car accident. I bought these for him. He loves them and wears them when out in public. He says that he will use until he gets his glass eye. The fit is perfect. material is wipe clean.</li>
            <li> My had been having trouble with one of his eyes and his doctors suggested he use an eyepatch. he&#x27;s a funny guy. I got him these as a present for Father&#x27;s Day and painted eyeballs on them.</li>
            <li> horrible fit on my grandson&#x27;s eye</li>
            <li> Far to rigid and doesn&#x27;t fit eye leaving large gaps over nose. It makes it almost worst than wearing no patch.  The picture on the box isn&#x27;t the actual shape of the patch and it doesn&#x27;t cover as much.  Basically this is a piece of  plastic or cardboard folded to make a cone. Maybe if you wanted to use it to hld gauze over the  eye it might be ok.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these patches!  She preferred them to the patches she received from the doctors office because they are cupped and it didn&#x27;t feel like there was added pressure to her eye when she was wearing them.  We have been using them for months now and they have held up really well.  I liked the fact that there are three in the box so she can keep one at school, one in her make up bag and one at home.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Great product and great service</li>
            <li> These are great if they had the foam padding in them, but they do the job so im ok with it.</li>
            <li> These are so cheap they don&#x27;t even line them with foam, so unless they happen to fit your face perfectly, there&#x27;s going to be a big gap between your eye and one of the edges.  That means if you need to cover an eye that can still see but needs to be isolated, you&#x27;re instead going to see tons of light because there is no foam to stop big gaps since these never fit your eye perfectly.  It also means it&#x27;s going to be much less comfortable because you have a rigid edge pressing against your face instead of soft foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have attached a picture to show what I&#x27;m talking about.  It&#x27;s a little bit hard to make it out because it&#x27;s black on black, but my finger is pointing at an eye patch that has foam around the edge.  This one is on the left with no foam.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit to the rim of my eye socket, leaves a little gap near the nose usually. I use them for maintaining dark adaptation when stargazing, so this can be slightly annoying. This is probably a case by case basis because everyone&#x27;s face is different, but I can only judge from my own experience.</li>
            <li> It was far too pointy for my 5 year son too wear with his glasses.</li>
            <li> Bought these for doing the eye exercises to improve focus in one eye which has poor focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are cupped which makes them very comfortable since  nothing touches the covered eye. It completely covers my eye and is comfortable to wear. The patch cuts out all light and doesn&#x27;t feel weird over the eye. There is room with the concave design if you were to have a swollen eye to still wear this comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I purchased these over the adhesives which are very uncomfortable and much higher quality than the old pirate eye patches that I thought I was going to have to wear.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely does not fit behind my glasses.</li>
