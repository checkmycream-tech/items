            <li>The blades have lasted really great.</li>
            <li>They work great</li>
            <li>This works great as I have been using this product for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li>It sure improved my shave!!</li>
            <li>I find that a good triple blade works great on my beard.  </li>
            <li>It is good to replace this part, I had not replaced it since I bought the razor over 1 year ago.  </li>
            <li>and it gives a good cut.</li>
            <li>Good price at amazon.</li>

            <li>Good service.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Glad it worked!  </li>
            <li>Great to have a place to get replacements easily.</li>

            <li>fit exacly...now can use my beloved panasonic shaver again.  </li>
            <li>Fit perfect and saved us from buying a new razor!</li>
            <li>I have used both screen and rotory versions and both seem okay</li>
            <li>Love my Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>After reading many of the reviews decided to take my chances with this Panasonic model.  </li>
            <li>Wife loves it, battery life is good, easy to clean ... best to use in shower as the shaved hair stubble is not caught in the shave like most mens facial electric shavers.</li>
            <li>After many years the foil had worn out.</li>
            <li>Authentic Panasonic product.</li>
            <li>I would say that&#x27;s pretty good, a lot cheaper than buying disposables</li>
            <li>glad they still stocked them &amp; our model number was listed so it was easy to match.</li>
            <li>I did replace the blades and that helped a bit, but surprisingly replacing the foil helped more than a new blade.  </li>
            <li>Who would make better replacement parts than the original maker?</li>
            <li>It is easy to find on Amazon by searching the part number.</li>
            <li>Easy fix for my razor.  </li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend buying the heads with it.</li>
            <li>item itself is absolutely fine.  </li>
            <li>replacement part - worked fine</li>
            <li>It works fine on my beard.  </li>
            <li>The razor is easy to clean, the blades and foil pop off easily for cleaning.</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>If the foil was more durable, I would give it a lot higher rating.</li>
            <li>Even though the original foil wasn&#x27;t damaged, this new foil makes the shaver sound and run much better.</li>
            <li>These screens are as good as the originals wihich are as good as every one elses screens, no better, no worse.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Product arrives quickly, just as described.</li>
            <li>Glad I can just get replacements instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>better than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t realize that the top foil also needs replacing until you use the shaver with the new replacements.</li>
            <li>That is original factory outer foil, and works exactly how it should be.</li>
            <li>Got it the items  quickly and put me right to work  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to install, and it really does get the razor back to the kind of shave that it started out with a year ago.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective giving close shaves along with budget savings.</li>
            <li>A nice simple replacement to the stock foil.</li>
            <li>Both the original screen that came with razor and a replacement were very fragile - and broke easily.</li>
            <li>so if you drop it these will most likely break, but they do not wear out quickly and blades are bought very infrequently.  </li>
            <li>Gives a good shave, but it may take a little time to set your beard up for it.</li>
            <li>These foils come on the original razor, so these replacements make the razor feel like new again.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a big problem spending a lot on a shaver, but I guess I hope that I get more.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that I got anything more with the Panasonic shaver and blades than I did with my prior Braun, Norelco or Remmington shavers.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have also spent a great deal of time on the phone, in chats, and emailing with Customer Service for Panasonic and no one seems able to tell me which foil will actually fit my shaver so be careful if you have the same shaver.</li>
            <li>I recommend that when you replace the blades, you should definitely also replace the foil top.</li>
            <li>This product was shipped in a timely manner and will come in handy when I have to change the outside foil as recommended on an annual basis in early June.</li>
            <li>This works as an exact replacement for the damaged foil on my older Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>Recharge for a single shave is quick and a full recharge is a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast and it works as stated.</li>
            <li>Although the shaver is great, having to replace the outer foil frequently is frustrating.</li>
            <li>You can really tell the diferrence once you change these after the year of use.</li>
            <li>Nothing much to say.  </li>
            <li>I really noticed the difference after replacing both.</li>
            <li>This is the same as the original Foil that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li>Glides smoother and cuts much better and cut my shaving time down.</li>
            <li>The razor feels like new now!  </li>
            <li>I laughed to myself that he wasn&#x27;t even a little curious to know what made the improvement; he just smiled, closed the door and went back to shaving.</li>
            <li>Flimsy and wears down quickly -- I hade to replace them after 3 months consistently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li>Shave maybe every 2 days, will be buying new blades and replacement foils soon.</li>
            <li>Just like new.</li>
            <li>Working like new.  </li>
            <li>I order a new one each year for my 6 year old shaver.</li>
            <li>Amazon is way less on price than ordering through Panasonic and the products are genuine Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>After buying and installing this, it is clear that I should have done it years ago.  </li>
            <li>replacement blade for our old shaver.  </li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>and I can tell the difference once I get the old parts replace.</li>
            <li>My razor is several years old and it feels brand new when I shave.</li>
            <li>Will make sure to wash both inside and outside of outer foil with soap at least every week to help prevent corrosion that irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>Original screen that came with razor proved very fragile - dented easily, and developed a small crack which soon enlarged, rendering shaver useless.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Panasonic wet/dry shaver about 8 years ago and just purchased a new one late last year.  </li>

            <li> It is louder than I would like with a sound similar to a swarm of angry bees.  </li>
            <li> After my other half dropped enough hints about wanting a new electric razor, I did some research and decided on this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The battery stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> I shave dry</li>
            <li> Gave up and went back to Braun, whose foils and shavers don&#x27;t break down as rapidly.  </li>
            <li> Blades work as expected.</li>
            <li> This is the OEM replacement, so not much to say.</li>
            <li> Only had the shaver a few months.</li>
            <li> Wide eyed, he said \\&quot;Thank you!</li>
            <li> A definite must if you purchased the Panasonic well built product in the past.</li>
            <li> Ordered another screen and am very careful in handling  and cleaning it.</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for 3 years and had to buy a replacement on an average 1 a year.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to change the inner blades on your Panasonic electric shaver at least once every two year.</li>
            <li> It has held up very well except for this dang foil which is very thin and tends to develop holes in it after 4-6 months or so of use.</li>
            <li> Leaves a black residue on my husband&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> so there is not need to mess with all the cleaner things.</li>
            <li> The set is a little pricy</li>
            <li> There was little improvement from before I replaced the blades and the foil.  </li>
            <li> A little deception however, the blades they refer to are the rows on the foil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the electric razor for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> Bought a few packs of these.  </li>
            <li> This foil does NOT fit the Panasonic ES-ST25KS Wet/Dry shaver as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I have to buy is replacement foils and blades when they wear out or get broken.  </li>
            <li> I have replaced the blades a number of times (over the past seven years), but never the outer foil.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find these locally.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to change out the outer foil on your Panasonic electric shaver at least once a year.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> This outer foil is critical to the function of my Panasonic shaver.  I have replaced the blades a number of times (over the past seven years), but never the outer foil.  After buying and installing this, it is clear that I should have done it years ago.  Even though the original foil wasn&#x27;t damaged, this new foil makes the shaver sound and run much better.</li>
            <li> This foil goes with the wet/dry shaver. I would strongly recommend buying the heads with it. The set is a little pricy but this shaver is one of the best I have ever owned. Gives a good shave, but it may take a little time to set your beard up for it. It works even better in the shower, giving me a shave that is good for the day. You may find that the shaver battery will last about two sets of replacement foils and heads. After that the battery will start to conk out. My experience is that the blade/head set will last 9 to 12 months.</li>
            <li> I like this razor.  I never get as close a shave as with a blade, but this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve found.  I recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It is good to replace this part, I had not replaced it since I bought the razor over 1 year ago.  I did replace the blades and that helped a bit, but surprisingly replacing the foil helped more than a new blade.  Glides smoother and cuts much better and cut my shaving time down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a big problem spending a lot on a shaver, but I guess I hope that I get more.  I don&#x27;t feel that I got anything more with the Panasonic shaver and blades than I did with my prior Braun, Norelco or Remmington shavers. I have used both screen and rotory versions and both seem okay but neither great.  I am still looking for that perfect shave.  These screens are as good as the originals wihich are as good as every one elses screens, no better, no worse.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and wears down quickly -- I hade to replace them after 3 months consistently.  Gave up and went back to Braun, whose foils and shavers don&#x27;t break down as rapidly.  (Note, I use it on my face AND head.)</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and it works as stated.</li>
            <li> As this is an item mandatory to make the razor operate properly, it still seems to be rather pricey for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item itself is absolutely fine.  It is easy to find on Amazon by searching the part number.</li>
            <li> For me, several passes are required, even after only one day&#x27;s growth, regardless of how I use it (e.g., stretching the skin, manipulating the amount of pressure, trying different directions, etc.).  I also changed the blades.  There was little improvement from before I replaced the blades and the foil.  It appears to be in the design.  The item is overpriced for what it is.  I&#x27;m looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> Fit perfect and saved us from buying a new razor!</li>
            <li> Leaves a black residue on my husband&#x27;s face.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It pays to change this once a year.  If you can, but two at a time to save money in the future.</li>
            <li> This fits perfectly my boyfriend&#x27;s machine.</li>
            <li> Got it the items  quickly and put me right to work  yes they were needed</li>
            <li> After my other half dropped enough hints about wanting a new electric razor, I did some research and decided on this [[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Silver]]. I was thanked profusely then and occasionally afterwards in the two years it&#x27;s been in use. A week or so ago I was told the razor didn&#x27;t seem to be performing as well. I went online and learned that the manufacturer recommends replacing the Outer Foil yearly and these [[ASIN:B001159UMM Panasonic WES9068PC Men&#x27;s Shaver Replacement Inner Blade]] every two years. I ordered both and followed the simple installation instructions yesterday afternoon. This morning I made a point of staying nearby in order to hear a reaction when the razor was put to use. It buzzed on and then, just seconds later, was turned off. He opened the door and found me standing there. Wide eyed, he said \\&quot;Thank you! It&#x27;s like brand new.\\&quot; I laughed to myself that he wasn&#x27;t even a little curious to know what made the improvement; he just smiled, closed the door and went back to shaving.</li>
            <li> Both the original screen that came with razor and a replacement were very fragile - and broke easily. Although the shaver is great, having to replace the outer foil frequently is frustrating.</li>
            <li> Easy fix for my razor.  Luvs it</li>
            <li> This works as an exact replacement for the damaged foil on my older Panasonic shaver. The price is quite a bit cheaper than the OEM store too.</li>
            <li> Great!!  I&#x27;ve had the electric razor for a few years now.  Glad I can just get replacements instead of buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Item as advertised. I have owned this razor for 3 years and had to buy a replacement on an average 1 a year. I would say that&#x27;s pretty good, a lot cheaper than buying disposables and it gives a good cut.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Good price at amazon. Thanks!</li>
            <li> You can really tell the diferrence once you change these after the year of use. Your skin will feel the change and the shave will be feel like baby skin. Love my Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> replacement blade for our old shaver.  Glad it worked!  glad they still stocked them &amp; our model number was listed so it was easy to match.</li>
            <li> As advertised !! very very happy....save me a lot of time shopping around at brick and mortar store...saved me a lot of time !!!</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with these replacement heads for his favorite electric razor. I like the economy of keeping his razor in service with these parts. Simple and effective giving close shaves along with budget savings.</li>
            <li> Blades work as expected. Still not getting the close shave I need, but I probably need to replace the inner blades also.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say.  Replaced the worn out foil and a blades.  Works like the day i go it. Would recommend a friend.</li>
            <li> This is the OEM replacement, so not much to say. These foils come on the original razor, so these replacements make the razor feel like new again. Have had the razor for over 4 years, been using these replacements for about 2 years with no problem. Shave maybe every 2 days, will be buying new blades and replacement foils soon.</li>
            <li> Fits well and works well</li>
            <li> Bought a few packs of these.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Fit perfect. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery works perfectly.</li>
            <li> That is original factory outer foil, and works exactly how it should be. I bought 2 because it is the same price as buying one locally. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> What can I say...it is an OE replacement and fits and works great. The outer foil and inner blades need to be changed at a minimum yearly and often sooner. I really noticed the difference after replacing both.</li>
            <li> replacement part - worked fine</li>
            <li> This is the same as the original Foil that came with the shaver. This is the second one that I purchased.</li>
            <li> This foil does NOT fit the Panasonic ES-ST25KS Wet/Dry shaver as advertised.  This is not the seller&#x27;s fault, though, as the Panasonic website itself says it is.  I have bought from four different places, including the Panasonic website and this foil is not correct.  I have also spent a great deal of time on the phone, in chats, and emailing with Customer Service for Panasonic and no one seems able to tell me which foil will actually fit my shaver so be careful if you have the same shaver.</li>
            <li> After reading many of the reviews decided to take my chances with this Panasonic model.  It works fine on my beard.  It is louder than I would like with a sound similar to a swarm of angry bees.  Getting use to that.  Battery life is shorter than preferable.  Recharge for a single shave is quick and a full recharge is a couple of hours.  This makes the shorter battery life tolerable.</li>
            <li> I like the shaver but have never needed the cleaner kit. I shave dry so there is not need to mess with all the cleaner things. Plus the cleaner adds cost..</li>
            <li> I bought my first Panasonic wet/dry shaver about 8 years ago and just purchased a new one late last year.  They are great.  The only thing I have to buy is replacement foils and blades when they wear out or get broken.  The razors are resiliant but the foils and housing are plastic so if you drop it these will most likely break, but they do not wear out quickly and blades are bought very infrequently.  Amazon is way less on price than ordering through Panasonic and the products are genuine Panasonic.  If you need replacements go to the Panasonic web-site, key in the model number of your shaver and you can locate the numbers for the replacement parts then come back to Amazon and order your replacement parts.  I find that a good triple blade works great on my beard.  A little deception however, the blades they refer to are the rows on the foil.  Even if it is a two blade or three blade it is only going to have 2 rotating blades under the foil.  But please understand me even though there are only two actual blades on the triple blade razor the triple rows on the foil do make a difference.  I tried one with just double rows on the foil and it did not shave as close as the triple did.</li>
            <li> better than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Original screen that came with razor proved very fragile - dented easily, and developed a small crack which soon enlarged, rendering shaver useless.Only had the shaver a few months. Ordered another screen and am very careful in handling  and cleaning it.</li>
            <li> Great body shaver for both men and women, even works to shave mens face if need.  Wife loves it, battery life is good, easy to clean ... best to use in shower as the shaved hair stubble is not caught in the shave like most mens facial electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I purchased my shaver because of the durability-you get what you pay for. After many years the foil had worn out. Who would make better replacement parts than the original maker? You guessed it.</li>
            <li> It sure improved my shave!! I thought I was going to have to replace the blades as well. Makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> A nice simple replacement to the stock foil. I&#x27;ve had to replace these twice, and they last about a year each time, with daily use.</li>
            <li> Product arrives quickly, just as described. No complaints—it does what it says. And I thought it was a good price, too.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped in a timely manner and will come in handy when I have to change the outside foil as recommended on an annual basis in early June.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find these locally. Authentic Panasonic product. I order a new one each year for my 6 year old shaver.</li>
            <li> I thought my razor was dying.  I had replaced the blades, but it still didn&#x27;t cut well.  Afterwards, I started getting scratches on my face, so I figured I&#x27;d take a shot at replacing the foil.  WOW.  What a difference.  The razor feels like new now!  If you want to replace the blades, you should also replace the foil.  Makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I recommend that when you replace the blades, you should definitely also replace the foil top. You don&#x27;t realize that the top foil also needs replacing until you use the shaver with the new replacements. What a difference. Just like new.</li>
            <li> This product worked just like I thought it would.  You are supposed to change out the outer foil on your Panasonic electric shaver at least once a year.  You are supposed to change the inner blades on your Panasonic electric shaver at least once every two year.</li>
            <li> Working like new.  My razor is several years old and it feels brand new when I shave.</li>
            <li> I have had my Panasonic ES8103 razor for several years. It has held up very well except for this dang foil which is very thin and tends to develop holes in it after 4-6 months or so of use. When a hole develops, it cuts my face. So, I have to order another one. When this razor dies, if it ever does, I will go with another brand. I have no complaints of the razor itself or the blades under the foil. The blades have lasted really great. The razor is easy to clean, the blades and foil pop off easily for cleaning. It also shaves nicely except when the hole appears in the outer foil - then I have to toss it. The battery stays charged for a long time. I took it to Europe for 2 weeks and started with 100% charge and the last day of our trip, it had 30% left, so I never had to charge it while we were over there. If the foil was more durable, I would give it a lot higher rating. For the price, it should last longer.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Good service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to install, and it really does get the razor back to the kind of shave that it started out with a year ago.</li>
            <li> I have used these as replacements the last 5 years. They work great and I can tell the difference once I get the old parts replace. A definite must if you purchased the Panasonic well built product in the past.</li>
            <li> fit exacly...now can use my beloved panasonic shaver again.  Will make sure to wash both inside and outside of outer foil with soap at least every week to help prevent corrosion that irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Great to have a place to get replacements easily. This works great as I have been using this product for a couple of years now.  Nice to have spares around when you need it.</li>
