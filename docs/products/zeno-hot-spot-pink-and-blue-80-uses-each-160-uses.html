            <li>Just bought one for my mother, and she was so impressed, that she immediatly went out and bought one for her best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really good for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this product before and it works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with Zeno , my skin look clean now.</li>
            <li>Great for quick healing also.</li>
            <li>Love the Zeno to zap zits.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended :)</li>
            <li>doesnt work but looks cute</li>
            <li>I use my handy zeno hot spot a couple of times a day and ----- Presto Chango!  </li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this product and the price for 2 is great and is nice and compact could fit in my purse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>hot spot works so much better than acne creams.  </li>
            <li>Zeno hot spot is a great product for the occasional blemish.</li>
            <li>Thanks Zeno :-))</li>
            <li>Good for those deep ones that seem to take forever to go away.</li>
            <li>great but needs to last much much longer for the price.</li>
            <li>Both benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid are great for mature acne but the Zeno works on those, you know the ones, on the side of the nose, next to the ear</li>
            <li>Its worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the uv light zapper that I have from a different company.  </li>
            <li>Why the Zeno Hot Spot is now discontinued, I&#x27;ll never understand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>neither did my Zeno Hot Spot.</li>
            <li>My daughter says the Zeno works better than anything on the market for deep zits.</li>
            <li>for the whole family.</li>
            <li>This was my first use of the newly designed Zeno.</li>
            <li>but the cost is prohibitive especially once u realize that this is a despot able unit that will only work a set number of times.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>Appears it works as well as the older model.</li>
            <li>so I ordered some more, but this time one of them would not turn on at all and another one died after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed because this is a good gadget...when I am actually able to turn it on and use it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to waste any more time w/ this product.</li>
            <li>This has completely cleared up her problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought her the Tanda and several other heat and light devices, but she says the Zeno is the only one that can eliminate the zit.</li>
            <li>I have a daughter in graduate school who is experiencing breakouts for the first time - due to stress!</li>

            <li> I have used Zeno Hot Spot many times in the past and it seriously warms up enough, not to hurt your skin but to release all that is trapped inside by letting it sort of melt out.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these little gadgets for several years now.  </li>
            <li> I often get painful cyst type pimples at certain times of the month, this is one of the very few things that truly helps them go away quickly.</li>
            <li> average, twice a day for 2 to 3 days is all you need.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crap - nothing more to add.</li>
            <li> Its really stupid they only have a few number of uses on them, but for me it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This little device works wonders!</li>
            <li> (Other things help a bit but don&#x27;t seem to work for the deep painful zits.)</li>
            <li> to at least do one.  </li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re red, painful, and feel like a rock under your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Immediatley after using it is flatter and less painful.</li>
            <li> The worst one I every had took 5 days to clear up</li>
            <li> I get a lot of hard, painful eruptions on my face that don&#x27;t come to a head by themselves.  </li>
            <li> This is a fail.</li>
            <li> And even though its expensive, its tons cheaper than a doctor visit</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was beyond my 30 days when it broke.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something to help with my hormonal acne</li>

            <li> Why the Zeno Hot Spot is now discontinued, I&#x27;ll never understand.&lt;br /&gt;It has saved my skin from the dreaded breakout.  And all with no chemicals, no side-effects.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product before and it works great so I ordered some more, but this time one of them would not turn on at all and another one died after just a few uses. I tried changing the battery as well but that did not do anything....I&#x27;m disappointed because this is a good gadget...when I am actually able to turn it on and use it.</li>
            <li> This little device works wonders! I&#x27;ve had pimples start to come up and the Zeno made them go away the next day. I would recommend this to anyone who gets breakouts.</li>
            <li> Works well but the cost is prohibitive especially once u realize that this is a despot able unit that will only work a set number of times.&lt;br /&gt;Works great but needs to last much much longer for the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have a daughter in graduate school who is experiencing breakouts for the first time - due to stress! This has completely cleared up her problem. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using these little gadgets for several years now.  I get a lot of hard, painful eruptions on my face that don&#x27;t come to a head by themselves.  I use my handy zeno hot spot a couple of times a day and ----- Presto Chango!  They get zapped and relief comes several days earlier than without any treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Zeno hot spot works so much better than acne creams.  Both benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid are great for mature acne but the Zeno works on those, you know the ones, on the side of the nose, next to the ear, they&#x27;re red, painful, and feel like a rock under your skin.&lt;br /&gt;On average, twice a day for 2 to 3 days is all you need.  The worst one I every had took 5 days to clear up but I didn&#x27;t give up and neither did my Zeno Hot Spot.</li>
            <li> Have used this product several times.  It truly works well in keeping acne at bay.  Great for quick healing also.</li>
            <li> I often get painful cyst type pimples at certain times of the month, this is one of the very few things that truly helps them go away quickly. Immediatley after using it is flatter and less painful. Its really stupid they only have a few number of uses on them, but for me it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a fail. Don&#x27;t buy! Did not work at all. I was desperate to find something to help with my hormonal acne but this did not help!</li>
            <li> Love the Zeno to zap zits.  Wish it lasted longer.  Or didn&#x27;t run out of uses...</li>
            <li> Zeno hot spot is a great product for the occasional blemish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months now, and it truly gets rid of my pimples. Just bought one for my mother, and she was so impressed, that she immediatly went out and bought one for her best friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended :)</li>
            <li> Really good for me! I&#x27;m really happy with Zeno , my skin look clean now. Thanks Zeno :-))</li>
            <li> My daughter says the Zeno works better than anything on the market for deep zits. If she feels a deep one forming, she can use the Zeno for 3 sessions (2 minutes automatic it turns off ( spread out over several hours, and the next day the zit is gone. I&#x27;ve bought her the Tanda and several other heat and light devices, but she says the Zeno is the only one that can eliminate the zit. (Other things help a bit but don&#x27;t seem to work for the deep painful zits.) And even though its expensive, its tons cheaper than a doctor visit and she isn&#x27;t getting acne scars. Its worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This heads off those subway zits and helps make the world an easier place to face.&lt;br /&gt;Good for the whole family.</li>
            <li> Should be no o stars on this one but Amazon forces you to at least do one.  It&#x27;s crap - nothing more to add. Don&#x27;t want to waste any more time w/ this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a friend&#x27;s referral.  It stopped working after 10-15 uses.  I changed batteries, and yet nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. Unfortunately it was beyond my 30 days when it broke.</li>
            <li> It works, believe it or not.  I like it better than the uv light zapper that I have from a different company.  I bought the pack of two so I have these for a while.  I have used Zeno Hot Spot many times in the past and it seriously warms up enough, not to hurt your skin but to release all that is trapped inside by letting it sort of melt out.  Good for those deep ones that seem to take forever to go away.</li>
            <li> This was my first use of the newly designed Zeno. Appears it works as well as the older model. I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this product and the price for 2 is great and is nice and compact could fit in my purse.</li>
            <li> doesnt work but looks cute</li>
