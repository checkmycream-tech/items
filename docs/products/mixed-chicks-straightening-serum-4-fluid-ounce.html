    <ol>
            <li>This is the best straightening serum I have ever used.</li>
            <li>AWESOME product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the best smelling product I&#x27;ve use</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>So I decided to give this a try &amp; loved it!</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ve made a great improvement in my granddaughters hair, but</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>But it smells good.</li>
            <li>and then I realized I was going to be Weavy-wonder/baldy-locks if i didn&#x27;t stop using this science fair project in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Before I can give it a fair review</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that is a silky sort of texture (very fine) - this stuff doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all!</li>
            <li>My hair looked as amazing as it does when my stylist did it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky smooth !</li>
            <li>It was more tangly</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>, I love it, I love it.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more of this for sure.</li>
            <li>But I just wish I can get more of it for the price.</li>
            <li>Love been using this product for years.</li>
            <li>The hair silk was better than the straightening serum</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It is ok if you have a perm already</li>
            <li>I am glad she didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>If you use this every once in a while...you should be okay but more than once</li>
            <li>There are better products on the market than this.</li>
            <li>I have tried using it many ways and nothing.</li>
            <li>I Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I give it a just ok, because it seems to work ok on my hair</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I love their leave in moisturizing conditioner I purchased from them.  </li>
            <li>Let me say that the first time I used this product I LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>We have not tried to straighten her hair yet with the product (as she preferes the curly look) but it has been a great product that we will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>this does help with the drying time and hair is smooth to start with, but begins to curl again during the day.</li>
            <li>but both were a bit light for her hair.</li>
            <li>and you are trying to smooth out the hair after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My aunt recommended mix chicks for me and it was love at first use .the</li>
            <li>and my hair is always full of body.</li>
            <li>My hair is super curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li>i have naturally curly kinky hair and using this product helped me achieve and amazing blow out right at home.  </li>
            <li>first time I ever used it my hair was silky smooth</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this from all the positive reviews I read as well.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The shampoo, leave-in conditioner, and deep conditioner were far more effective.</li>
            <li>This is the only stuff, coupled with their leave in conditioner that makes my hair look good curly or straight.</li>
            <li>It left my hair fealing light and soft with amazing sheen.  </li>
            <li>Good - a little pricy however</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t work the same for everyone.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not even enough to knock off a star.:)</li>
            <li>and it did exactly what it said it would do.  </li>
            <li>After using this my hair felt more course than before and my hair would constantly knot up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other MC products with great success (Deep Conditioner and Leave-In Conditioner)</li>
            <li>Not only did it stay smooth</li>
            <li>It works really well with my hair.</li>
            <li>Mixed chicks hair products really keep my hair from getting frizzy when I wear it curly and help keep it smooth when I wear it straight.</li>
            <li>get just as much smoothing with nothing.</li>
            <li>I have kinky/curly hair which can sometimes be a challenge getting straight.  </li>
            <li>My hair got bone straight</li>
            <li>like it made my hair brittle and was breaking it off as my hair was getting straight.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work too..</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very manageable.</li>
            <li>My curls are now very shiny.</li>
            <li>This product is ok, but it didn&#x27;t work as well as expected.</li>
            <li>Seeing the words MiXed Girls got me excited...</li>
            <li>My Granddaughter, a little mixed chick, loves these products for her gorgeous hair</li>
            <li>but I guess my particular mix doesn&#x27;t mix with this product.  </li>
            <li>I live in FL</li>
            <li>She has very thick, extra curly natural hair and blow drying it straight was very challenging even with this product.</li>
            <li>We have had a hard time finding something that helped her hair from getting frizzy more than a day or two after straightening it.</li>
            <li>My daughter is half Nigerian &amp; she has tight, very cute, curls.</li>
            <li>I really like Mixed Chicks products</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say I went out in 102 degree straight humidity weather and the only thing that happend</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I really started to notice that the product was sticky in my hands and made my dampened hair stick together and feel coarse.  </li>
            <li>This product feels like a homemade remedy with some products that probably do actually get your hair straight but at a cost.  </li>
            <li>So far frizzes are gone</li>
            <li>I live in NYC and with this humidity in the air whenever I straighten it, as soon as I turn the flat iron off, it is time for me to turn it right back on again.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I am mixed (black and white).  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to any girl who is mixed!</li>
            <li>I was so excited I told my sister who has hair down her back</li>
            <li>This gave my hair the bone straight look and didn&#x27;t not make my hair feel weighed down like some serums can do.</li>
            <li>She is very active &amp; very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have looked high and low for the proper hair prodcuts to give her enough moisture without weighing it down or making her hair greasy.  </li>

            <li> Due to her young age, (she&#x27;s just turned 9)</li>
            <li> Being mixed (white and black), there are not any hair products out there for my hair.</li>
            <li> All it did was dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> My curly hair is type 3C, color treated, and dry.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my hair..make it dry</li>
            <li> but it made my hair dry and coarser than it was.  </li>
            <li> it got straight, but this time I noticed some serious breakage- its</li>
            <li> I will be going back to my previous straightening serum.</li>
            <li> I found my hair was breaking off alot at the ends when using this and made my hair look very dry.</li>
            <li> I combined this with a flat iron thermal spray by Tychee Black and finished the job with a touch of Argan Oil.    </li>
            <li> I found the MC Straightening Serum dried my hair out and left it feeling a bit tacky.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well for straightening as other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter, she doesn&#x27;t like it due to the way it makes her hair feel after drying and straightening.  </li>
            <li> My hair didnt feel weighed down like it does with other products.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work for me (but the other products don&#x27;t really work for me either).</li>
            <li> Too bad &#x27;cause it smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Blow drying and styling also takes half the time.</li>
            <li> I like them both for my straight/ slightly wavy hair, however.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, thick and course.  </li>
            <li> Just a little.</li>
            <li> We found that even with thorough application, it seemed to have little effect.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair a little on the sticky side.</li>
            <li> It relaxes the curl a bit but not more than that.</li>
            <li> Now I have no more frizz</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the mixed chicks straightening serum did not help when I tried to blow straighten my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> She has very tight coils, approximately the diameter of a thin pencil.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing this again.  </li>
            <li> Probably one of the worst straightening serums I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky smooth !</li>
            <li> This product just didn&#x27;t do the job. I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t work the same for everyone. I really like Mixed Chicks products and they&#x27;ve made a great improvement in my granddaughters hair, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I am mixed with Filipino and Jamaican. My hair is super curly and frizzy. I live in FL so I am used to humidity. This did not work at all. All it did was dry my hair out. It was more tangly and I doubt it protected my hair at all.</li>
            <li> My curly hair is type 3C, color treated, and dry. I live in NYC and with this humidity in the air whenever I straighten it, as soon as I turn the flat iron off, it is time for me to turn it right back on again. I have been searching and searching for products that will truly eliminate the humidity. THIS PRODUCT WORKS!!! I will forever have this in my hair products collections. I love it, I love it, I love it. Let&#x27;s just say I went out in 102 degree straight humidity weather and the only thing that happend is I lost the body and bounce, but that is because my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl well!    I combined this with a flat iron thermal spray by Tychee Black and finished the job with a touch of Argan Oil.    My hair looked as amazing as it does when my stylist did it.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have looked high and low for the proper hair prodcuts to give her enough moisture without weighing it down or making her hair greasy.  This product has made a world of difference in her hair.  It smooths her curls, yet still leaves them in place.  We have not tried to straighten her hair yet with the product (as she preferes the curly look) but it has been a great product that we will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter, a little mixed chick, loves these products for her gorgeous hair</li>
            <li> My daughter is half Nigerian &amp; she has tight, very cute, curls. We have had a hard time finding something that helped her hair from getting frizzy more than a day or two after straightening it. So I decided to give this a try &amp; loved it! Not only did it stay smooth but it actually rained two days after I used it on her hair &amp; it didn&#x27;t curl or frizz up at all. Will be buying more of this for sure.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my hair..make it dry</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  this does help with the drying time and hair is smooth to start with, but begins to curl again during the day.</li>
            <li> I found the MC Straightening Serum dried my hair out and left it feeling a bit tacky.  It didn&#x27;t work as well for straightening as other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightening serum I have ever used. It works really well with my hair. Since I&#x27;ve started using it, I have had no frizz. Blow drying and styling also takes half the time. It smells great. You don&#x27;t even need to use a lot. Just a little. It is worth the money. But I just wish I can get more of it for the price.</li>
            <li> AWESOME product. Frizzless hair is no longer a myth</li>
            <li> My aunt recommended mix chicks for me and it was love at first use .the first time I ever used it my hair was silky smooth like I went to the hair salon. The only thing that bothers me is the smell it&#x27;s not the best smelling product I&#x27;ve use but that&#x27;s not even enough to knock off a star.:)</li>
            <li> Love been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my future stepdaughter&#x27;s hair. Her heritage is African American &amp; Italian/European. She has very tight coils, approximately the diameter of a thin pencil. Due to her young age, (she&#x27;s just turned 9) she has difficulty managing her hair. She is very active &amp; very prone to frizz. We found that even with thorough application, it seemed to have little effect. The shampoo, leave-in conditioner, and deep conditioner were far more effective. The hair silk was better than the straightening serum but both were a bit light for her hair. I like them both for my straight/ slightly wavy hair, however.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff, coupled with their leave in conditioner that makes my hair look good curly or straight. I even use the straightener when I leave my hair curly bc I have NO FRIZZ when I do that. I&#x27;ve been using this for two years now. Even my hairdresser noticed the difference in body and health of my hair with these products. He couldn&#x27;t get over what a difference it made. You don&#x27;t have to be a mixed chic for this stuff to work! Love it.</li>
            <li> ..... but it made my hair dry and coarser than it was.  Too bad &#x27;cause it smells fabulous.  I&#x27;ve used other MC products with great success (Deep Conditioner and Leave-In Conditioner) but I guess my particular mix doesn&#x27;t mix with this product.  The research continues.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of hair product! Being mixed (white and black), there are not any hair products out there for my hair. Mixed chicks hair products really keep my hair from getting frizzy when I wear it curly and help keep it smooth when I wear it straight. Would highly recommend this to any girl who is mixed!</li>
            <li> It is ok if you have a perm already and you are trying to smooth out the hair after washing it.&lt;br /&gt;I get just as much smoothing with nothing. But it smells good.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I am mixed (black and white).  I have kinky/curly hair which can sometimes be a challenge getting straight.  I am also a product junkie so I am always searching for a product that can perform...especially on MY hair.  Let me say that the first time I used this product I LOVED it.  My hair got bone straight and it did exactly what it said it would do.  I was so excited I told my sister who has hair down her back (curlier texture/thick/mixed like mine but longer) to go out and buy it.  I am glad she didn&#x27;t.  The next time I used it I really started to notice that the product was sticky in my hands and made my dampened hair stick together and feel coarse.  Once again..it got straight, but this time I noticed some serious breakage- its like it made my hair brittle and was breaking it off as my hair was getting straight.  I used it a third time and noticed the same thing again, at that point- I decided to discontinue the use of this product and advised my sister to not purchase it if she hadn&#x27;t already.  This product feels like a homemade remedy with some products that probably do actually get your hair straight but at a cost.  If you use this every once in a while...you should be okay but more than once a month- beware.  I really wanted this to work too..especially because I felt like someone finally made a product for MY hair.  Seeing the words MiXed Girls got me excited...and then I realized I was going to be Weavy-wonder/baldy-locks if i didn&#x27;t stop using this science fair project in a bottle.  There are better products on the market than this.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that is a silky sort of texture (very fine) - this stuff doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair at all! I have tried using it many ways and nothing. It relaxes the curl a bit but not more than that. I gave it 3 stars cause it is one of the safest straightening products on the market, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t work for me (but the other products don&#x27;t really work for me either).</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It leaves my hair very manageable. My curls are now very shiny. Now I have no more frizz and my hair is always full of body. Only product I use now!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair a little on the sticky side. Before I can give it a fair review i think I will need to stop my Kerastase Heat protectant as they may be conflicting.. So far frizzes are gone</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the mixed chicks straightening serum did not help when I tried to blow straighten my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has very thick, extra curly natural hair and blow drying it straight was very challenging even with this product.</li>
            <li> Good - a little pricy however</li>
            <li> I am relaxed but my hair still is quite textured. This gave my hair the bone straight look and didn&#x27;t not make my hair feel weighed down like some serums can do.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.  i have naturally curly kinky hair and using this product helped me achieve and amazing blow out right at home.  It left my hair fealing light and soft with amazing sheen.  My hair didnt feel weighed down like it does with other products.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter, she doesn&#x27;t like it due to the way it makes her hair feel after drying and straightening.  I give it a just ok, because it seems to work ok on my hair and I am not bi-racial.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;The product was just as described.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but it didn&#x27;t work as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I love their leave in moisturizing conditioner I purchased from them.  I figured if that product worked so well this product would be the same! I was excited to use this from all the positive reviews I read as well. My hair is very long, thick and course.  Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing this again.  Probably one of the worst straightening serums I&#x27;ve bought.  After using this my hair felt more course than before and my hair would constantly knot up. I found my hair was breaking off alot at the ends when using this and made my hair look very dry. Didn&#x27;t seem like it protected my hair from the heat of the iron. I would not recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking to get that straight/soft look after straightening your hair.  I will be going back to my previous straightening serum.</li>
            <li> Terrible! Makes my hair crunchy</li>
