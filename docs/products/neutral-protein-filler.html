            <li> so I had to dye it back my natural color dark brown.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, little ringlets of hair, but it was so dead my hair was practically straight.</li>
            <li> It was my second time dying in a single week--</li>
            <li> I found this product and I wet my hair and put it in then put plastic wrap over and a towel and left it on for about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, it just didn&#x27;t soak up as much of the dye I would have liked and was a little uneven in places.</li>
            <li> I had really dry, porous, and over processed hair.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t dry bc of the severe damage....</li>
            <li> I washed my hair, let it air dry a bit then sprayed this all over</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel so dry afterward either.</li>
            <li> When applied my hair was not wet just a little damp.  </li>
            <li> Im mixed with black, so</li>
            <li> After I was finished I was so amazed when i took the towel and plastic off because my hair actually curled out into little waves like it used to before it was all over processed.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get the even look I expected.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair w/ sulfate-free shampoo (no conditioner) and applied half the protein filler using a spray bottle while my hair was still damp.</li>
            <li> If using for a treatment between colorings, I&#x27;d use less.</li>
            <li> It is LONG, THICK, and CURLY and it feels like silk.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> My hair looked like dead grass.  </li>
            <li> I put 2 ounces on my towel dried hair, wrapped my hair in plastic wrap and then put a towel over it.  </li>
            <li> I had used demi hair dye a couple times then let it rest a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been adding it to my hair dying routine and my adding it into my hair mist for the past few months and noticed a difference in my hair immediately.</li>
            <li> After 20 mins I used the semi-permanent store bought, 10 minute dye and washed out as usual.</li>
            <li> Ill report back and update once I do.</li>
            <li> That said, the rest of my hair was over processed and I was afraid of frying it since it had taken so long to grow out to this length.  </li>
            <li> I am going to add this into my routine as it has decreased my hairs shedding and breakage.  </li>
            <li> It was so crazy</li>
            <li> I was so mad at myself.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed I paid $5.69 plus tax.  </li>

            <li> I had the toughest time keeping my hair from fading after dying it, it got to the point where my ends wouldnt even take color anymore. I heard about the filler on the internet, and it works amazingly! My hair color is even and not blotchy and after a week, my color hasnt faded at all! I will use this every time i dye my hair from now on.</li>
            <li> This worked WONDERS for me.  I applied the filler to my hair (per the directions!) and left on for a while before I dyed my hair.  It was my second time dying in a single week-- the first attempt left my roots a much lighter shade than the length and ends of my long and previously-dyed-dark-brown-hair.  I needed to get the roots to match the old color in the rest of my hair, and knew that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to match the color by only re-touching the roots.  That said, the rest of my hair was over processed and I was afraid of frying it since it had taken so long to grow out to this length.  I decided to re-dye my full head of hair using the protein filler to protect from further damage and make sure the roots didn&#x27;t over absorb the color.  Not only did it ensure that my color blended nicely from my roots to my ends, but it left my hair feeling SO much healthier.  I couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the results. I will never again dye my hair without using this product!</li>
            <li> I use this product to keep my long hair from becoming dry while growing it out after years of using lightening hair products. I use a capful mixed into my regular conditioner about every 2 weeks to maintain texture. It makes my hair shiny and easy to brush or comb. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I had really dry, porous, and over processed hair. I have naturally wavy, little ringlets of hair, but it was so dead my hair was practically straight. I found this product and I wet my hair and put it in then put plastic wrap over and a towel and left it on for about 45 minutes. After I was finished I was so amazed when i took the towel and plastic off because my hair actually curled out into little waves like it used to before it was all over processed. This was after one use, and 45 minutes. It was so crazy I&#x27;m definitely going to buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love this product it is a fantastic way to ensure your hair color takes evenly. I couldn&#x27;t use it recently when I colored my hair and I can tell the difference! Dark ends and light roots ugh. I will not color without this again. Arrives in a timely fashion with tape over the lid to help keep it from leaking in transit.</li>
            <li> I always use it before dying my hair and truly helps seal in the color and prevent breakage. This is definitely a must have if you want even coverage and protection when dying your hair.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuf . My sister bought it for me after I damaged my hair bleaching it until it started to fall out and break off. I have been adding it to my hair dying routine and my adding it into my hair mist for the past few months and noticed a difference in my hair immediately. It is softer and thicker and just looks healthier. People have been commenting on how much healthier and thicker my hair looks! I even started recommending (and even purchasing and giving) it to my friends who dye their hair and will continue to use this!</li>
            <li> I DONT KNOW WHY I HAVE THIS PRODUCT ?? BUT I USED IT ANYWAY AND MY HAIR LOOKS GREAT SO MAYBE I WILL ACCIDENTALLY BUY IT AGAIN ??</li>
            <li> This was applied to my hair by before a relaxer was applied my relaxer and after a relaxer. When applied my hair was not wet just a little damp.  Boy, result my hair is so silky, look at photo in my profile.  Look at my picture.  This works as a protein constructor. If you have any questions go to your hair stylist with this. Would recommend this product to be used by an professional  stylist or someone who is experienced with hair products.</li>
            <li> For me, this is more of an insurance policy. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my hair, but from what I&#x27;ve researched, protein filler can help quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I have been bleaching my hair for a long time and it was very damaged. Naturally a 7 or 8 Ash blonde, bleached to a 10 or even 11 N blonde. I decided to try and return to my natural color cause my hair was fried. The girl at Sally Beauty recommended this and it is a MIRACLE how soft my hair is. I applied it with a spray bottle to damp hair and left it on for 20 min before coloring. Followed with Wella Colorcharm 8NG. My hair is back to almost its natural color, which I thought I would never see again. I cannot stress enough how much better this made my hair feel. It is LONG, THICK, and CURLY and it feels like silk.&lt;br /&gt;I will never dye my hair again without this product.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money for me. I got it based on the great reviews. Oh well. I am glad it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> When I first applied I was a little worried because it made my hair feel very brittle and dry, but thats normal! I went from golden blond to dark chocolate brown, and the color came out perfect, no spots. Im mixed with black, so I have naturally curly/textured hair and this worked fine, so I recommend it .</li>
            <li> not so sure if it makes different to my hair, will keeping using it for some time</li>
            <li> I use this before coloring my hair and I believe it helps the color process evenly. I also use this as a conditioner.  The instructions on the bottle say to mix 1 ounce of water with 2 ounces of neutral protein and use a plastic cap in the shower and I think this is really good for my hair although I still have to follow-up with a regular conditioner, but my hair is quite dry.</li>
            <li> My hair looked like dead grass.  It was over colored and processed.  I went to Sally&#x27;s yesterday and bought this.  My hair looks like new hair.  It did wonders.  The high-lights that I have left in my hair, because I cut it short because of the damage, look like shiny ice. Not a hay field.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed I paid $5.69 plus tax.  I put 2 ounces on my towel dried hair, wrapped my hair in plastic wrap and then put a towel over it.  Left it on for 20 minutes, then rinsed and used a conditioner.  I have a shiny hair</li>
            <li> heres my story. I had used demi hair dye a couple times then let it rest a few months. then I did ombre ends which took 3 bleachings and 2 toners (40v bleach) then I conditioned it deep for weeks and used no heat (haven&#x27;t used heat on my hair in about 2 years so it was healthy at the beginning of all this) then I decided to bring the ombre up close to my roots and bleached with 40v again. it went orange. I bleached it again the next day with 40v. didn&#x27;t change at all. I then used toner and 10v developer hoping itd go blonde but no change except it lifted my roots .....so I had to dye it back my natural color dark brown. I dyed it with diluted 20v to about 10v and dyed it brown 3x and it just wasn&#x27;t sticking in areas. I was so mad at myself. I even tried using a red dye to get the color into it bc it was going murky brown and greyish, then added brown over it again....so my hair was like melted ont he ends, tangling, wouldn&#x27;t dry bc of the severe damage....I got this protein filler and more dye, it conditioned my hair so soft and my fingers ran right thru, the dye stuck evenly, my hair was saved!!!! all this took place over 3 days. I have enough to do a treatment next month. im hoping my roots will match up when they grow out bc I dont want to dye my hair ever again!!!!</li>
            <li> Keeps your color smooth and even.  No oops it will keep your hair color  smooth and even.  For all blonde hair coloring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my light brown hair an extra light blonde color for about a year now (I had a salon get me to the blonde I wanted and have just been doing my roots at home since then using Ion&#x27;s Hi-lift ash blonde and a 20 developer, on the roots only. Because my hair is brown, it leaves it a soft slightly warm light blonde color. The ash prevents any brass.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I decided with the current summer tan I have, my hair makes me look a little too much like Paris Hilton (or someone equally charming) so decided to put a medium blonde semi dye in it till my beach tan fades. The first time the color didnt take well. It wasn&#x27;t bad, it just didn&#x27;t soak up as much of the dye I would have liked and was a little uneven in places. I read up online and learned about how when hair is dyed it becomes more pourous so looked for something to overcome this problem. I saw many positive reviews on this product so thought I would give it a try. I washed my hair, let it air dry a bit then sprayed this all over (I bought a cheap spray bottle from the drugstore,) making sure I coated every strand of hair, especially my ends and roots. After 20 mins I used the semi-permanent store bought, 10 minute dye and washed out as usual. When I was all done and my hair was dry, I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it looked! It&#x27;s so even and my hair is so smooth - between the dye&#x27;s conditioner and the protein in this filler, my hair is in better shape than before I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to load up on this stuff and will plan on using it next time I dye with semi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did note there was a shortcut way to do it - by adding the filler to the dye. I didnt try this but might give it a go next time to see how it works. Ill report back and update once I do.</li>
            <li> It made my home hair-color turn out SO much nicer. I have reached the stage where basic boxed hair-color doesn&#x27;t give good gray coverage anymore. I use Madison Reed  hair-color now and this gave me better coverage of the stubborn grays along my hairline. It didn&#x27;t feel so dry afterward either. I washed my hair w/ sulfate-free shampoo (no conditioner) and applied half the protein filler using a spray bottle while my hair was still damp. Then, after 20 minutes, I applied the color. The parts of my hair that dried first felt like they had gel in them, but it didn&#x27;t affect anything. If using for a treatment between colorings, I&#x27;d use less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that it didn&#x27;t let the dye cover all my grays, my roots came out very light but it did grab on ends.  I was trying to go a shade lighter (medium brown to light brown) and I didn&#x27;t get the even look I expected.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I colored my hair and mixed this in with the color.  The color came up very true with very little change.  I also had minimal breakage and shedding even though I pulled the new color all the way out over older colored and highlighted hair.  I am going to add this into my routine as it has decreased my hairs shedding and breakage.  It also makes my curls pop!  I get curl definition out of this world.  Aphogee was good, but this stuff is better and less messy.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel healthy!</li>
