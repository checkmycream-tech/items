            <li>Best product out there for fine hair needs to go on the roots while damp.</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST volumnizer for fine hair</li>
            <li>I heard good things about Kevin Murphy products and do like the smell of the angel wash shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so I was delighted to see it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing like a good hair product</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>At a pricey &amp; trendy salon in Los Angeles</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, great product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever found so far.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair and this product gives me the body I need!</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair - this one is a must!</li>
            <li>My hair dresser first introduced me to this product and it works great at giving my hair a bit more volume.</li>
            <li>This smells fantastic and makes my hair look great without looking like it&#x27;s full of product.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that ANTI.GRAVITY works wonderfully on my hair - which is baby fine</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous volumizing product!</li>
            <li>Love it  </li>
            <li>Love the  product but looked like it was used.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love all kevin murphy products.</li>
            <li>I just love it and was able to&lt;br /&gt;order</li>
            <li>Love how it make my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell, but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to find it still available..  </li>
            <li>And I can get away without a wash when I use it too :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, love the scent though.</li>
            <li>and until now all I could do was wash it with Kevin Murphy Angel Wash, condition it with the Angel Rinse, adding a dollop of MOROCCANOIL Intense Hydrating Mask for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>stuff is just as good as it should be for the rather high price.  </li>
            <li>A must for fine hair</li>
            <li>I have medium curly rather fine hair.</li>
            <li>and it adds body to my fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t hold much of a style on its own.</li>
            <li>It truly works and gives hair fabulous volume and manageability.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li>/&gt;ANTI.GRAVITY has simplified all this as it is so light and weightless and yet adds body &amp;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kevin Murphy&#x27;s products are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, adds great body without making hair stiff.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product through a salon but found I could order it on line.  </li>
            <li>I received my order quickly too.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it for a while because I am not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I feel like this product really dries out your hair but other than that it works and smells great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use as a root lift for fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I pay $60.00 for each large (1 Litre / 33.6 Fl Oz) pump bottle of Kenneth Murphy Angel_Wash and Angel_Rinse while the prices on Amazon are selling for far more.</li>
            <li>Kevin Murphy Anti-gravity texturizer is an all natural product that delivers light texturizing/volume without heaviness.  </li>
            <li>I will keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li>Even better, it somehow adds shine AND keeps my hair from getting greasy at the same time-my style lasts for about three days now.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products but never had such results as with Anti-Gravity from Kevin Murphy.</li>
            <li>I have found that using it in moderation usually works best (even distribution is the key).  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Completely oil free.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely order more as needed.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good for a night out, but not on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li>Found an old bottle in my mother&#x27;s cabinet a few years after she died and I was thrilled to find it still for sale!</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner but the top was secured with what looked like white surgical tape....was unsure if it was new or used....</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;ve used this or any other product in the past, best to try it out in person before ordering on line.  </li>
            <li>Glad that I am able to get this through Amazon as it&#x27;s a very hard product to find in salons</li>
            <li>Very good product,but to expensive .</li>
            <li>Really made my hair thicker</li>
            <li>It really volumes my hair.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine curly hair, which I can&#x27;t dry with a dryer.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and this product does wonders for my thin fine hair (another stylist recommendation).</li>
            <li>worked on the fly-away hair and has a decent smell.</li>
            <li>To heavy for my fine hair!</li>
            <li>The one and only product I&#x27;ve used that not only provides volume but is not harsh on my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I only need to shampoo hair about every week I would refresh style by adding a bit more Phyto 9 to ends and either doing a quick blow dry using big sections and a couple of rollers OR using the ceramic EGO flat iron for a super-straight shiny do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The anti gravity product is a light volumizer that does not weigh my hair down and leaves it shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that is light and doesn&#x27;t dry out or make hair too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My fine, flat hair can not live without it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean, fragrant (but not overpowering), does not leave a residue or weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li>It eventually causes too much buildup and makes my roots look gross.</li>
            <li>it really does last forever.</li>
            <li>Which means it&#x27;s pretty much weighed down at my scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to get really oily and flat.</li>
            <li>This product smells AMAZING, but unfortunately that&#x27;s the only positive I have for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years on my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this for my thin, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I have really fine, thick hair.</li>
            <li>Just be careful , don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
            <li>I reduce the amount of Phyto 9 to a few drops on the ends, add the ANTI.GRAVITY and proceed as usual - getting far better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I get it colored with Goldwell permanent color every 4 weeks, and is difficult for me to style, tending to go flat with no body or shine especially in the humid climate I live in - as most products weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not weigh fine, limp hair down.</li>
            <li>Currently having issues with my hair due to menopause and  I must say that without this product I can&#x27;t even imagine how I would get my hair to look halfway decent.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, very little mess.</li>

            <li> Does not weigh fine, limp hair down.</li>
            <li> Currently having issues with my hair due to menopause and  I must say that without this product I can&#x27;t even imagine how I would get my hair to look halfway decent.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, very little mess.</li>
            <li> Also, since it is not heat-activated like other Kevin Murphy products or other lines, it works very well.</li>
            <li> It gives it body and lift with blow drying that I don&#x27;t normally get with just plain air drying, or blow drying without it.</li>
            <li> I have thin, baby fine hair that lacks body, and other products tend to cause major buildup and weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> to style I would massage in about a quarter to half teaspoon of PHYTO brand phyto 9 creme de jour \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; conditioning cream (throughout the ends only) and blow dry in 7 to 9 sections - winding each section on a large Velcro roller and leaving to set for a few minutes before removing rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have tried other products, but come back to this one.</li>
            <li> it is very long</li>
            <li> When you blow dry you won&#x27;t even recognize your hair.  </li>
            <li> I actually found that this product weighed my hair down instead of lifting it up.</li>
            <li> It is pricey for the amount, but a little goes a long way (on short hair).</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected but a little goes a  long way.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way, it lasts a long time and it smells devine - like a field of lavender in Provence.</li>
            <li> I get big, fluffy, shiny volume with this.</li>
            <li> I imagine a professional may have other ways of leveraging it, but I found it hard for home use.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have very fine hair works wonderful</li>
            <li> My hair dresser first introduced me to this product and it works great at giving my hair a bit more volume.</li>
            <li> Everything was great.</li>
            <li> Stopped using Kevin Murphy products.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about this on Killer Strands, and had to try it.  I have thin, baby fine hair that lacks body, and other products tend to cause major buildup and weigh my hair down.  Kevin Murphy Anti-gravity texturizer is an all natural product that delivers light texturizing/volume without heaviness.  It doesn&#x27;t have a perfumy scent; actually, it smells like the plant-based product that it is.  It is pricey for the amount, but a little goes a long way (on short hair).</li>
            <li> I did not check the price before I ordered it.  $31 for a hair product is outrageous.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous volumizing product! It&#x27;s clean, fragrant (but not overpowering), does not leave a residue or weigh down your hair. I highly recommend this for anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Introduced to me by my hairdresser at the salon, Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Anti-Gravity is a must for anyone that needs lift, and a little hold anywhere you put it.  I like to put it in the crown and around my face before I blow it out.  The lavender smell is amazing and you will be very happy with the result.  I will keep coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair (short highlights) too much.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use as a root lift for fine, thin hair. It give volume and hold without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of using product but my hair is thick and heavy so it won&#x27;t hold much of a style on its own. This smells fantastic and makes my hair look great without looking like it&#x27;s full of product. Even better, it somehow adds shine AND keeps my hair from getting greasy at the same time-my style lasts for about three days now. This never happened before this product. A little bit goes a long way so it seems to be a value for the money.</li>
            <li> Kevin and I go everywhere together! I love the scent and this product does wonders for my thin fine hair (another stylist recommendation).</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist as I have hair that has a tendency to be limp. It truly works and gives hair fabulous volume and manageability. Have tried other products, but come back to this one.</li>
            <li> To heavy for my fine hair! However they were great about returning it. Maybe  it would be great for someone else !</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner but the top was secured with what looked like white surgical tape....was unsure if it was new or used....worked on the fly-away hair and has a decent smell.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair and this product gives me the body I need!</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected but a little goes a  long way. This word requirement is stupid - you&#x27;re lucky I write anything!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for volume.  It dies not make hair feel dirty.  It smells wonderful and wires great. A must for fine hair</li>
            <li> Perfect for fine, limp hair. My hair tends to get really oily and flat. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that is light and doesn&#x27;t dry out or make hair too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that ANTI.GRAVITY works wonderfully on my hair - which is baby fine but I have tons of it, plus it is very long and I get it colored with Goldwell permanent color every 4 weeks, and is difficult for me to style, tending to go flat with no body or shine especially in the humid climate I live in - as most products weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use hairspray or other products intended to increase volume and texture at all and until now all I could do was wash it with Kevin Murphy Angel Wash, condition it with the Angel Rinse, adding a dollop of MOROCCANOIL Intense Hydrating Mask for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;Then to style I would massage in about a quarter to half teaspoon of PHYTO brand phyto 9 creme de jour \\&quot;leave-in\\&quot; conditioning cream (throughout the ends only) and blow dry in 7 to 9 sections - winding each section on a large Velcro roller and leaving to set for a few minutes before removing rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I only need to shampoo hair about every week I would refresh style by adding a bit more Phyto 9 to ends and either doing a quick blow dry using big sections and a couple of rollers OR using the ceramic EGO flat iron for a super-straight shiny do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANTI.GRAVITY has simplified all this as it is so light and weightless and yet adds body &amp;&lt;br /&gt;texture. I reduce the amount of Phyto 9 to a few drops on the ends, add the ANTI.GRAVITY and proceed as usual - getting far better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One issue however is the price! At a pricey &amp; trendy salon in Los Angeles I pay $22.00 for the 150mL / 5.1 Fl.Oz. size of ANTI.GRAVITY and was shocked to see the prices for the identical&lt;br /&gt;product selling at Amazon for well over double. This LA salon is very expensive and offers no discounts on their retail products.&lt;br /&gt;Am I missing something here?&lt;br /&gt;Also I pay $60.00 for each large (1 Litre / 33.6 Fl Oz) pump bottle of Kenneth Murphy Angel_Wash and Angel_Rinse while the prices on Amazon are selling for far more. Can someone explain this discrepancy?</li>
            <li> Great product, been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine curly hair, which I can&#x27;t dry with a dryer. This is probably the best product I have ever found.  I use a very small amount, probably the size of a pea, and it is not too heavy.  Also, since it is not heat-activated like other Kevin Murphy products or other lines, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I discovered this by accident and I am addicted. I have medium curly rather fine hair. This product provides body and the look of thickness without weighing my hair down. I buy two at a time now for feat this product will go away!</li>
            <li> Very good product,but to expensive .</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products but never had such results as with Anti-Gravity from Kevin Murphy. I had to share this with the world! If you have fine hair - this one is a must! Little goes a long way, it lasts a long time and it smells devine - like a field of lavender in Provence. Thank you Kevin Murphy! I will try other products from your line as well.</li>
            <li> Anti-gravity is one of the best thickening agents I have tried. I stopped using it for a while because I am not crazy about the smell.However, I have very thin, straight hair that never holds the style. I keep coming back to this product because nothing else works!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product through a salon but found I could order it on line.  Product is great!  I received my order quickly too.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this for my thin, naturally curly hair&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is just as good as it should be for the rather high price.  I have been trying different &amp;#34;volumizer&amp;#34; products as my hair is getting a little thin.  All I do is put a little of this in my hair when it is still wet after a shampoo, and when my hair dries it does not even need to by styled.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Performed as advertised, gives extra volume to hair. Easy to use, very little mess.</li>
            <li> The one and only product I&#x27;ve used that not only provides volume but is not harsh on my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> Best volumizer!  Does not weigh fine, limp hair down. Also, a great setting gel.</li>
            <li> I have really fine, thick hair. Which means it&#x27;s pretty much weighed down at my scalp. This stuff is good for a night out, but not on an everyday basis. It eventually causes too much buildup and makes my roots look gross.</li>
            <li> Kevin Murphy&#x27;s products are fabulous.  The anti gravity product is a light volumizer that does not weigh my hair down and leaves it shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> This product adds volume without weighing down the hair or drying it out. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever found so far.</li>
            <li> Love it  Really made my hair thicker</li>
            <li> Love the  product but looked like it was used.</li>
            <li> This product has a chemical smell and does not work as described.  Too bad I didn&#x27;t have an opportunity to test it out before I ordered it; this is a non returnable item.  Unless you&#x27;ve used this or any other product in the past, best to try it out in person before ordering on line.  I heard good things about Kevin Murphy products and do like the smell of the angel wash shampoo.  The anti gravity smell is nothing at all like the shampoo.  yuk.</li>
            <li> Great hold and smells amazing!  I have found that using it in moderation usually works best (even distribution is the key).  Love it.</li>
            <li> Currently having issues with my hair due to menopause and  I must say that without this product I can&#x27;t even imagine how I would get my hair to look halfway decent.  Great Smell and it adds body to my fine, wavy hair.  Granted it&#x27;s a little pricey for some people, but what&#x27;s the point of buying something less expensive if it doesn&#x27;t work.  Glad that I am able to get this through Amazon as it&#x27;s a very hard product to find in salons</li>
            <li> Best product out there for fine hair needs to go on the roots while damp.</li>
            <li> Honestly, adds great body without making hair stiff.  Worth every penny.  Found an old bottle in my mother&#x27;s cabinet a few years after she died and I was thrilled to find it still for sale!</li>
            <li> Love all kevin murphy products. Wish they were easier to get. Product does not weigh hair as advertised. I have very fine hair and this adds to volume.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. It works perfectly for my thinning hair, giving it volume and body :) Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product smells AMAZING, but unfortunately that&#x27;s the only positive I have for it. I actually found that this product weighed my hair down instead of lifting it up. I imagine a professional may have other ways of leveraging it, but I found it hard for home use.</li>
            <li> Before I moved from the Twin Cities to the north country of Minnesota, my hair&lt;br /&gt;stylist introduced me to this styling product. I just love it and was able to&lt;br /&gt;order it on Amazon. I will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Another incredible volumizing product from Kevin Murphy!!  My fine, flat hair can not live without it.  Completely oil free.  When you blow dry you won&#x27;t even recognize your hair.  Seriously!  Hard to find and can be very expensive, but you use so little it really does last forever.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this product on my hair.  Works well on find, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Definitely adds body and volume. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST volumnizer for fine hair Ive ever used .  Never can find a product that will add volume toy hair and this one definitely does!</li>
            <li> Love how it make my hair feel. I don&#x27;t love the smell, but it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years.  I have been having difficulty finding it so I was delighted to see it on Amazon.  There is nothing like a good hair product and I was thrilled to find it still available..  I will definitely order more as needed.</li>
            <li> I get big, fluffy, shiny volume with this. And I can get away without a wash when I use it too :-) It&#x27;s pricy but also lasts practically forever.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product really dries out your hair but other than that it works and smells great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, love the scent though.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Just be careful , don&#x27;t use to much.</li>
            <li> The product is great. It really volumes my hair. However, my salon sells this stuff way cheaper than Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years on my fine, limp hair.  It gives it body and lift with blow drying that I don&#x27;t normally get with just plain air drying, or blow drying without it.</li>
