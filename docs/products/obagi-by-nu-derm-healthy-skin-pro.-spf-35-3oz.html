            <li>It is excellent for skin cancer patients who require the use of sun screen daily.</li>
            <li>NU-DERM HEALTHY SKIN PRO.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it works.  </li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen because it&#x27;s very lightweight and non greasy!!!  </li>
            <li>Good for skin and protection of the sun, easy to apply and stays the whole day</li>
            <li>My favorite sunblock,  I have combination skin, so the non greasy texture in sunblock plays a big part in my decision on choosing sunblocks, and this one always feels great alone or under makeup.</li>
            <li>A good product for skin that burns easily and is sensitive to many sunburn lotions.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, light and</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything like it even in the off cheap brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, so it&#x27;s easy to clean off at night.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff because of its high SPF but more so because of its seal by the Skin Cancer Foundation.</li>
            <li>This is a good sunscreen for the face because its not too white or sticky.  </li>
            <li>You should save your money and buy something more affordable or buy the real thing from a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Obagi user.</li>
            <li>So far satisfied with all Obagi products purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a redhead with sensitive skin that easily sunburns, this product protects and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is not my first time purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that has not caused my eyes to burn or tear up not matter what the activity I am involved in.</li>
            <li>The Healthy Skin Pro spf 35 has been my go 2 facial suncreen for yrs.</li>
            <li>This is the first sunscreen I have ever purchased that you can put on your face and it does not feel greassey or cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of times to switch to different brand but KEEP going back to this one because it is so good.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.  :)</li>
            <li>Expected better quality.</li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law forgot her sunscreen and is very picky.  </li>
            <li>and it continues to work really well to protect my skin and keep my face moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that tends to get very oily through T zone in summer and dryish in the winter.</li>
            <li>Here in Texas, many of the Obagi products are virtually by prescription or completely banned, so mail-order is the only way to get them and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This items is not the real Obagi sold at doctor&#x27;s offices.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product because it is not oily on my face.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted something to keep the brown spots from popping up on my face and this sunscreen does the job.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this was an older product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Obagi.</li>
            <li>All the reasons I like this product: applies very smoothly, dries quickly, non-greasy,  a little goes a long way, and it does not interfere with the application of your make up.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have to worry about products breaking out my face.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied as usual.</li>
            <li>It is the only really non-greasy sunscreen that I have found.  </li>
            <li>I am blessed to have a 50+ year old wife who still looks 30, and people are always asking her how she looks so young.  </li>
            <li>After this arrived and I used it for a couple of weeks a rash developed.  </li>
            <li>High quality facial sunscreen that works...</li>
            <li>I work outside and wear this everyday March thru October...not greasy, does not make my pores large , not shiny or metallic looking either;)  </li>
            <li>My make-up glides on very well after application; so if you&#x27;ve been thinking about making this puchase go for it; its worth every penny and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty active, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  </li>
            <li>If you use more than a little, it will turn your face white, so be careful.</li>
            <li>Not a single spot.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am a loyal Obagi user. My dermatologist started me on this brand and their products do wonders for my 40 something skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunblock,  I have combination skin, so the non greasy texture in sunblock plays a big part in my decision on choosing sunblocks, and this one always feels great alone or under makeup.</li>
            <li> probably good as it gets</li>
            <li> This used to be a sun fader not a sun block.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, no allergic or acne reaction after using it. So far satisfied with all Obagi products purchased. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Expected better quality. If you use more than a little, it will turn your face white, so be careful. It will also flake off face. Maybe this was an older product.</li>
            <li> This is a good sunscreen for the face because its not too white or sticky.  Make-up goes on nicely after applying.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi Healthy Skin Protection for about two years now.  It is the only really non-greasy sunscreen that I have found.  I have very sensitive skin and have to worry about products breaking out my face.  This product never causes a breakout and it doesn&#x27;t make your face shiney.  I will continue to purchase this prduct and always get a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is still my favorite sun protection moisturizer to use and I have tried many.  Non-greasy, light and I don&#x27;t break out.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead with sensitive skin that easily sunburns, this product protects and does not irritate my skin.  A good product for skin that burns easily and is sensitive to many sunburn lotions.</li>
            <li> Having been using this product for 6 years religiously.  A little dab goes a long way. My daughter-in-law forgot her sunscreen and is very picky.  She loved how it went on and made her skin feel.</li>
            <li> I had orderd Number 6 which was supposed to be a moisturizer not a Sun Screen.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen because it&#x27;s very lightweight and non greasy!!!  I haven&#x27;t found anything like it even in the off cheap brands.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and it continues to work really well to protect my skin and keep my face moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard for me to find a daily wear sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t turn my face white. Or doesn&#x27;t make my face shine or look oily. Or doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Thank goodness for this sunscreen. It looks a bit white as I apply, but absorbs so quickly and leaves no white behind. Also it doesn&#x27;t make my face look shiny or feel oily. It feels like i have nothing on, yet my skin is nice and smooth. I give it about 5 minutes to absorb and follow with the Clenziderm moisturizer. I have combination skin that tends to get very oily through T zone in summer and dryish in the winter. In the summer particularly, adding any type of sunscreen or lotion to my T zone is usually a recipe for disaster. This product actually seems to absorb the moisture in my T zone. And again... it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Not a single spot. For me, that&#x27;s like a miracle. I think it helps that I use it in conjunction with the Clenziderm line. Obagi is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous sunblocks and this is just what I was looking for. I received a sample from a dermatologist, and I really liked it. It provides excellent protection and does not leave your skin looking or feeling greasy. The price was prohibitive however so I tried my go-to source for all types of products: Amazon. The price was half of what my dermatologist wanted. I highly recommend Obagi.</li>
            <li> I am blessed to have a 50+ year old wife who still looks 30, and people are always asking her how she looks so young.  Her answer is Obagi and she cannot imagine life without it.  Here in Texas, many of the Obagi products are virtually by prescription or completely banned, so mail-order is the only way to get them and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> love obagi... great product</li>
            <li> This is not my first time purchasing this product. I am satisfied as usual.</li>
            <li> I have tried several sunscreens for my face and this is the best!  It is not greasy and does not get in my eyes. This is the first one that has not caused my eyes to burn or tear up not matter what the activity I am involved in.</li>
            <li> The Healthy Skin Pro spf 35 has been my go 2 facial suncreen for yrs. Its not greasy leaves your face with a matte like finish. My make-up glides on very well after application; so if you&#x27;ve been thinking about making this puchase go for it; its worth every penny and a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is perfect!!  It has no odor. It&#x27;s not greasy, so it&#x27;s easy to clean off at night. I&#x27;m pretty active, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  Most importantly, it works.  It keeps the sun off of my face.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  This product gives you excellent protection without grease or odors.  It is excellent for skin cancer patients who require the use of sun screen daily.</li>
            <li> Every day use as a day cream. Good for skin and protection of the sun, easy to apply and stays the whole day</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer and sun protector on the market. Been using it for over 7 years. No comparison.</li>
            <li> All the reasons I like this product: applies very smoothly, dries quickly, non-greasy,  a little goes a long way, and it does not interfere with the application of your make up.  It is a little pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.  :)</li>
            <li> High quality facial sunscreen that works...I work outside and wear this everyday March thru October...not greasy, does not make my pores large , not shiny or metallic looking either;)  The price on Amazon has jumped $10 in the past 2 years...that&#x27;s dissapointing.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff because of its high SPF but more so because of its seal by the Skin Cancer Foundation. For that alone, winner</li>
            <li> This items is not the real Obagi sold at doctor&#x27;s offices.  The packaging is slightly different in the blue ring by the lid, the fonts are all different, the medical label that is attached to the back of some bottles is missing, and the critical digital lot numbers are missing.  Obagi is expensive for the active ingredients that helps your skin. Why would you buy this item when those ingredients are counterfeit? You should save your money and buy something more affordable or buy the real thing from a doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these on Amazon because I had ran out of mine and didn&#x27;t have time to drive two hours to my Dr office. After this arrived and I used it for a couple of weeks a rash developed.  The wonderful part is Amazon returned my money. I&#x27;m now taking this product to a chemist to figure out what I put on my skin and damaged it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let my nightmare be your warning.</li>
            <li> NU-DERM HEALTHY SKIN PRO. SPF 35--3OZ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product if users know how to use it. I have recommended the product to several of my friends.</li>
            <li> It is good I using all time</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it is not oily on my face.  It goes great under my make-up too.  I really wanted something to keep the brown spots from popping up on my face and this sunscreen does the job.  Does not cause my face to breakout.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin. I have lived in Florida for 20 years. I put this on my face before I go outside and I keep some in my purse to refresh it during the day. Other products have caused me to have small cysts and sometimes a rash.</li>
            <li> It is what you need to protect you skin from harmful sun rays. You don&#x27;t need much only spread evenly.</li>
            <li> This is the first sunscreen I have ever purchased that you can put on your face and it does not feel greassey or cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it almost every day with or without makeup</li>
            <li> I have been using for 6 years. I have tried a couple of times to switch to different brand but KEEP going back to this one because it is so good.</li>
            <li> The best skin protectort</li>
