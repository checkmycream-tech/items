            <li>But you also want to protect them from wear and tear well, this is the perfect solution.</li>

            <li>This is a good case.  </li>
            <li>fits great on my phone and is completely clear :D</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>So glad I found this case!</li>
            <li>I love this case!</li>
            <li>I love this case!</li>
            <li>Some nice quality feature - rounded edges and earphone cover.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect crystal clear and protects my phone, thank you!</li>
            <li>and my phone is still fine!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is made of the kind of plastic that slides easily in and out of your pocket (not the rubbery finish).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how satisfied I am with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this case.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these to have as spares.  </li>
            <li>It has all the appropriate holes for speakers, headphones, microphones, buttons, and camera.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed it, but it probably wouldn&#x27;t get the attention of many users.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good product and worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li>iPhones are sexy and you.</li>
            <li>Perfectly clear case to showcase your beautiful device.</li>
            <li>I love this case....very durable and inexpensive and it was so easy writing to the seller when I had a question.  </li>
            <li>It is reasonably easy to put on/remove</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly in about a week</li>
            <li>Also it fits my cheap after market lightning cable.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand.  </li>
            <li>It is not too bulky, yet offers good protection.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect because it covers the sides of the phone and has a small buffer on the front to protect when it falls.</li>
            <li>I paid close to $30 for a very similar case on the day the iPhone 5 launched, so I was really happy to see the price for this case and figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels like the nice clear BodyGlove cases.  </li>
            <li>, the button coverings are nice, it&#x27;s slim, 100% clear, and it has a border</li>
            <li>It really looks like a nice high end case.</li>
            <li>The fit is perfect, it came earlier then expected, the cut outs are in the right place</li>
            <li>I am kind of hard on phones, but I think this with a tempered glass screen protector will offer pretty good protection.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>It was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Item came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>so i got my money back and two free cases.</li>
            <li>It fits my iPhone 5 very well.  </li>
            <li>It was way better that what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>It also is very protective as I have dropped it twice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice jelly consistency and the phone has had a few falls</li>
            <li>More or less exactly what I was looking for in a case, and it arrived weeks before predicted delivery date.</li>
            <li>I have been looking long and hard for good cheap Clear Jelly case.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it looks lovely on my white iphone.</li>
            <li>This case is pretty gorgeous, but I got 1 good one and 1 bad one with dark spot contamination that cannot be removed by cleaning, embedded within the layer.</li>
            <li>A nice hard bendable rubber.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully this thing lasts for a long time cause it was TOTALLY worth the wait so far!!</li>
            <li>and it is very clear.</li>
            <li>Read other 5 star reviews, and you will find out that they are true.</li>
            <li>It is clear not frosted.</li>
            <li>It is completely clear with a shiny finish.  </li>
            <li>Super clear and protective and isn&#x27;t hard so it won&#x27;t break, and really durable I&#x27;ve had it for a while now!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly crystal clear, fits the new iphone 5 snugly, and hasn&#x27;t begun to yellow.  </li>
            <li>so I do not know if it will yellow or not, but that will not bug me and if it does I will buy a new one for the price.</li>
            <li>Perfectly clear, hard enought to withstand dropping but flexable enough to go on easy and not shatter when dropped.</li>
            <li>They do not have that cheap hard rubber feel.  </li>
            <li>It fits the iphone perfectly, the button parts (for the volume and lock) aren&#x27;t making it hard to press them, and the casing is not too thick to switch the silent button (unlike my previous case).</li>

            <li> I have not owned it long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally plain, obviously, it&#x27;s clear, but that&#x27;s what makes it rad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear but a little bit cloudy, almost unnoticed.</li>
            <li> But as expected, it yellows.</li>
            <li> It is right between hard and soft and it is very thin.  </li>
            <li> Goes with any other accessory you&#x27;d wanna put on your phone</li>
            <li> It is thin, completely transparent, and a pliable material.</li>
            <li> single negative was that the plastic near the volume on/off switch bent out of alignment a little (very small amount).  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a little protective</li>
            <li> so when you put it upside down the screen doesn&#x27;t get scratched!</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t dried dropping it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this case, considering the price point.  </li>
            <li> When it gets dirty I&#x27;ll just purchase another</li>

            <li> I love this case....very durable and inexpensive and it was so easy writing to the seller when I had a question.  I hope you are in the process of making the iphone 6 cases.....ha ha.....I will need one by the end of the year.....so happy with this product</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how satisfied I am with this purchase. Read other 5 star reviews, and you will find out that they are true.</li>
            <li> So I didn t get case on time so i got my money back and two free cases. I recommend to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Great! Exactly what I wanted! Super clear and protective and isn&#x27;t hard so it won&#x27;t break, and really durable I&#x27;ve had it for a while now!</li>
            <li> Item came exactly as described. It is thin, completely transparent, and a pliable material. More or less exactly what I was looking for in a case, and it arrived weeks before predicted delivery date. Not to mention under $3 shipped. I recommend this item!</li>
            <li> Love this case.  It&#x27;s truly crystal clear, fits the new iphone 5 snugly, and hasn&#x27;t begun to yellow.  It&#x27;s got a nice jelly consistency and the phone has had a few falls so it seems to be protective as well.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical on buying this product because I was scared it wouldn&#x27;t be clear like I expected. but it is!&lt;br /&gt;it fits great on my phone and is completely clear :D And it is jelly like described. I will definitely be purchasing this case again</li>
            <li> Like the case.  But as expected, it yellows.</li>
            <li> I have been looking long and hard for good cheap Clear Jelly case.  It is not too bulky, yet offers good protection.  Best thing of all it fits over a tempered glass screen protector.  I will be buying more of these to have as spares.  They do not have that cheap hard rubber feel.  It feels like the nice clear BodyGlove cases.  I am kind of hard on phones, but I think this with a tempered glass screen protector will offer pretty good protection.  Also it fits my cheap after market lightning cable.  I have not owned it long so I do not know if it will yellow or not, but that will not bug me and if it does I will buy a new one for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it! Perfectly clear, hard enought to withstand dropping but flexable enough to go on easy and not shatter when dropped. All the charging and headphone holes aline perfect!</li>
            <li> Really nice case for the price! I&#x27;m surprise with the quality</li>
            <li> This is a good case.  It fits my iPhone 5 very well.  I paid close to $30 for a very similar case on the day the iPhone 5 launched, so I was really happy to see the price for this case and figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made of the kind of plastic that slides easily in and out of your pocket (not the rubbery finish).

            <li> So glad I found this case! It&#x27;s perfect crystal clear and protects my phone, thank you!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it...iPhones are sexy and you. Want to show them off. But you also want to protect them from wear and tear well, this is the perfect solution. And for the price, you just can&#x27;t beat it. Perfectly clear case to showcase your beautiful device. Fits the iPhone 5S like a glove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect because it covers the sides of the phone and has a small buffer on the front to protect when it falls.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this case, considering the price point.  It is right between hard and soft and it is very thin.  It is reasonably easy to put on/remove and it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand.  It also has enough &#x27;grip&#x27; to keep my phone from sliding out of my pocket, which, if i could prevent that, i&#x27;d not use a  case at all.  That said, it&#x27;s as close to not having a case at all as I&#x27;ve come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my iphone for almost a week now and it&#x27;s been convenient. It fits the iphone perfectly, the button parts (for the volume and lock) aren&#x27;t making it hard to press them, and the casing is not too thick to switch the silent button (unlike my previous case). It&#x27;s clear but a little bit cloudy, almost unnoticed. Feels great for grip. Overall, it looks lovely on my white iphone.</li>
            <li> This case is pretty gorgeous, but I got 1 good one and 1 bad one with dark spot contamination that cannot be removed by cleaning, embedded within the layer.</li>
            <li> Shows off the beauty of the phone</li>
            <li> OMG YES!!! My case just came in from Hong Kong and it&#x27;s PERFECT!! I love it!! The fit is perfect, it came earlier then expected, the cut outs are in the right place, the button coverings are nice, it&#x27;s slim, 100% clear, and it has a border so when you put it upside down the screen doesn&#x27;t get scratched! Hopefully this thing lasts for a long time cause it was TOTALLY worth the wait so far!! I&#x27;ll update my review later.</li>
            <li> Awesome case. It was way better that what I expected it to be. Some nice quality feature - rounded edges and earphone cover. It really looks like a nice high end case.</li>
            <li> I love this case! It&#x27;s totally plain, obviously, it&#x27;s clear, but that&#x27;s what makes it rad. Goes with any other accessory you&#x27;d wanna put on your phone and you can totally put stickers on it and redecorate it. I guess it&#x27;s a little protective but I haven&#x27;t dried dropping it. If you&#x27;re looking for a protective case definitely get a Speck case not this one.</li>
            <li> I love this case! I received it very quickly in about a week and it is very clear. It also is very protective as I have dropped it twice and my phone is still fine!</li>
