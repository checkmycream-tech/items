            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get my new rack!!...!!! :)</li>
            <li>Dries very quick ans</li>
            <li>Washes easily and air drys.</li>
            <li>Stains do not set in and wash out easily.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly which was important.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect size for our countertop and actually does exactly what it says it should do.</li>
            <li>and after placing it flat it looked beautiful.</li>
            <li>I decided to wash it because if I am placing clean dishes on it, I want to make sure it is clean.</li>
            <li>Does a fair job but is easily stained, requiring frequent washing... like after each use.</li>
            <li>is the right size and is very easy to clean</li>
            <li>This mat is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I also dried it in the dryer and it looks perfect!</li>
            <li>It seems to resist mold, which is also important</li>
            <li>Looks nice on the counter and drys fast.</li>
            <li>Soaks up all the water and can easily toss it in the washing machine to clean it.</li>
            <li>How can one get excited over a dish drying mat??</li>
            <li>No more moldy funky dishtowels, this wondermat is the perfect substitute to absorb moisture from washed dishes etc.</li>
            <li>Also,  it hasn&#x27;t acquired any funky order - which is super important.  </li>
            <li>which was handy because I placed it in a drawer near the dishwasher</li>
            <li>love this thing and did not think I would use it as much as I have.</li>
            <li>I do not however like how quickly it formms mold &amp; gunk eew</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Ideal when you have guest or a big family, help to dry cookware or pans, even dishes and glasses, easy to storage everywhere also in shelves or drawers</li>
            <li>love the color, very soft and absorbent.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this as it is easy to wash and super convenient/cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have that extra drying space for hand washed dishes.</li>
            <li>economical.</li>
            <li>I use the In-Sink drainer along with this as I do not have counter space or storage space for a large dish drainer when dishes are clean and put away.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly, no smell, nice size and good neutral color for when it&#x27;s left out.</li>
            <li>Instead of water running all over my counter, this mat absorbs it nicely, cushions the china or glassware on it, and even helps it to dry faster.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Gave my first one to my MIL and am ordering another for myself.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted and needed.  </li>
            <li>We bought two to switch them out and allow for better drying time between uses, and wash them regularly.</li>
            <li>The drying mat makes life so much more simple and neat.</li>
            <li>Nice neutral color, thick enough and a good size.</li>
            <li>the empty counter that can then be used for other great, fun kitchen adventures...</li>
            <li>It did still have the marks from where it was folded and easily folded back up</li>
            <li>folds &amp; stores easily in kitchen towel drawer (deep drawer).</li>
            <li>The dish drying mat really works.</li>
            <li>I bought this to take an order to $35 to qualify for free standard shipping.</li>
            <li>But, it really shows no sign of wear yet.  </li>
            <li>One time I even had a paper towel roll on the counter and whole bottom just got soaked.</li>
            <li>Maybe there&#x27;s too much food prep happening nearby.</li>
            <li>It worked as advertised, but who wants a stained mat on the kitchen counter?  </li>
            <li>It also looks much neater than a dish towel which I was using.  </li>
            <li>the product came on time and is better than I expected...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see this being much help or improvement over the plastic liners underneath a full drying rack for a regular family size number of dishes.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this mat.</li>
            <li>Since I am placing clean dishes on it and it is dry when placed away, there is no need to wash it</li>
            <li>The mats dry quickly after getting wet, for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Nice pad for drying delicate wine glasses and china cups that you don&#x27;t want to put in the drain rack.</li>
            <li>The dishwasher (the mechanical one) is dead and I needed more drain space.</li>
            <li>it is the right size to hold several items.</li>
            <li>I have a very small kitchen area so, although my tiny dish drainer is great, a larger area is sometimes needed.  </li>
            <li>It also comes in handy if you have a lot of dishes that are hand wash only and your in sink dish holder is too small like mine.</li>
            <li>I am able to allow this to dry and then fold in a drawer until the next dish washing session, which of course is daily.  </li>
            <li>This is large enough to fit in between the \\&quot;legs\\&quot; of my wood dish rack and is wide enough to catch drips from glass ware.</li>
            <li>Gone are the old cotton place-mats I used.</li>
            <li>if the original ever gives out (I&#x27;ve has it awhile and its been through the wash a few times, but it shows no signs of deterioration).  </li>
            <li>I really like them because they look nice and you can just throw them in the washer when they start to look dirty.  </li>
            <li>Dishes get dry so fast.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to find one with a cream binding (I dislike the ones that have dark brown binding).</li>
            <li>This thing is just not nice, it stains really easily and just looks gross sitting on the counter.</li>

            <li> This thing is just not nice, it stains really easily and just looks gross sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li> I did a soak test with my sprayer and initially the back did not get wet.</li>
            <li> Just as long as you hang it to let it dry between uses and wash it often, it will last!</li>
            <li> Large and thick.</li>
            <li> That way, you can let one dry out and have a dry one left.</li>
            <li> I expected the mat to be big</li>
            <li> but it was bigger than expected</li>
            <li> Not classy</li>
            <li> I then let them air dry and put them away.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks of use, this mat had several stains that wouldn&#x27;t wash out.  </li>
            <li> After a full dunk, I wrung it, twisted it, and squeezed it dry (holds a lot of water!)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get soaking wet at all.</li>
            <li> have placed it on the counter over the dishwasher when I unload it and place the wet items on it.</li>
            <li> Each person can wash their mug and set it upside down not he mat to dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super absorbent although being in Florida I do expect I&#x27;ll have to bleach this bad boy occasionally.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing another for the other miniscule counter where I prep meals.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dish drying mat to be used with a  small group that regularly has coffee mugs.  </li>
            <li> This works well for a small, regular amount, not tons of drippy water.  </li>
            <li> The water would run down the counter, or along the counter and wet other things.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that these were a little small.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend getting at least two so that you can switch them out, three if you are like me and don&#x27;t get around to laundry as often as you should.  </li>
            <li> I used to place a lot of paper towels on the counter, place the wet items on the paper towels, then reuse the paper towels once dried.</li>

            <li> This mat is fabulous. Well made and soaks up water. If you wash dishes by hand rather than using your dishwasher, I&#x27;d get two. That way, you can let one dry out and have a dry one left. It doesn&#x27;t get soaking wet at all. It absorbs beautifully. Buy Two. They&#x27;re very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The dish drying mat really works. I use it all the time. Gave several as gifts to friends. Daniel P..</li>
            <li> does everything it says it will - cleans easily and very nice thickness.  would recommend this to anyone needing one.</li>
            <li> Great product, Speedy Shipping!</li>
            <li> I Love this drying mat. Dries quickly, no smell, nice size and good neutral color for when it&#x27;s left out.</li>
            <li> How can one get excited over a dish drying mat?? Ez-peazy if you&#x27;re OCD\\&quot;ish\\&quot;. This is exactly what I wanted. Gone are the old cotton place-mats I used. This is large enough to fit in between the \\&quot;legs\\&quot; of my wood dish rack and is wide enough to catch drips from glass ware. It&#x27;s super absorbent although being in Florida I do expect I&#x27;ll have to bleach this bad boy occasionally. I was lucky enough to find one with a cream binding (I dislike the ones that have dark brown binding). The weave is sewn a tad crooked on one side but it&#x27;s not prevalent enough to see when placed under my rack - otherwise I&#x27;d HAVE to return it (ya know?) I did a soak test with my sprayer and initially the back did not get wet. After a full dunk, I wrung it, twisted it, and squeezed it dry (holds a lot of water!) and after placing it flat it looked beautiful. Highly recommend. Can&#x27;t wait to get my new rack!!...!!! :)</li>
            <li> I have never heard of these things and figured I might be cluttering my kitchen with more items I did not need. I recently moved into a much bigger house and whenever I unload the dishwasher there are a lot of item with water on them. I used to place a lot of paper towels on the counter, place the wet items on the paper towels, then reuse the paper towels once dried. It was a ritual I became used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this mat it was folded up. I decided to wash it because if I am placing clean dishes on it, I want to make sure it is clean. I also dried it in the dryer and it looks perfect! It did still have the marks from where it was folded and easily folded back up which was handy because I placed it in a drawer near the dishwasher folded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have placed it on the counter over the dishwasher when I unload it and place the wet items on it. I then let them air dry and put them away. The mat then dries and I fold it up and place it back in the drawer for the next use. I think I will wash it about once a month. Since I am placing clean dishes on it and it is dry when placed away, there is no need to wash it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing and did not think I would use it as much as I have. It also comes in handy if you have a lot of dishes that are hand wash only and your in sink dish holder is too small like mine. I just place the extra items on the mat and let them air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had an issue with water soaking through. If you need extra room for dishes or want to save paper towels, this thing is for you!</li>
            <li> Good quality, great for letting dishes dry sitting on the counter.  The mats dry quickly after getting wet, for easy storage.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my granny and she loves it. Its good quality and there are no bad smells at all. Dishes get dry so fast. Was skeptical when ordered.</li>
            <li> Nice neutral color, thick enough and a good size. I do not however like how quickly it formms mold &amp; gunk eew</li>
            <li> Gave my first one to my MIL and am ordering another for myself.  It is a very handy item to have in the kitchen!</li>
            <li> Instead of water running all over my counter, this mat absorbs it nicely, cushions the china or glassware on it, and even helps it to dry faster. Great for things I don&#x27;t want to put in dishwasher. AND it&#x27;s machine washable.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take an order to $35 to qualify for free standard shipping. Turns out it was a big hit at the drain board. Nice pad for drying delicate wine glasses and china cups that you don&#x27;t want to put in the drain rack. Get your favorite dishwasher one of these and change your life.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. works great!</li>
            <li> The dishwasher (the mechanical one) is dead and I needed more drain space. I got this and it works great. Dries quickly, nice and absorbent. Good buy.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and needed.  When you don&#x27;t have a dishwasher, one of these mats is essential.  This one works great.   It dries very quickly which was important.  It seems to resist mold, which is also important (I say seems because I haven&#x27;t had a problem). Also,  it hasn&#x27;t acquired any funky order - which is super important.  the 16 x 18 is the perfect size for my drying rack too.  I&#x27;ll be coming back for another if the original ever gives out (I&#x27;ve has it awhile and its been through the wash a few times, but it shows no signs of deterioration).  But, it really shows no sign of wear yet.  I think it&#x27;ll be around for awhile.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have had this mat for several months. I hand wash my dishes everyday. It is a very nice mat and it absorbs the water so that my kitchen counter doesn&#x27;t get soaked. Would highly recommend this mat. I am going to buy two more.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Non Slip, can be laundered, and folded and put away!  Not a lot of colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> I have a very small kitchen area so, although my tiny dish drainer is great, a larger area is sometimes needed.  This is perfect and folds away neatly.</li>
            <li> Glad I got this! The water would run down the counter, or along the counter and wet other things. One time I even had a paper towel roll on the counter and whole bottom just got soaked. I would highly recommend this as it is easy to wash and super convenient/cheap.</li>
            <li> i should&#x27;ve bought a few more...worth the price! this might make a good gift for someone who likes kitchen items.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product, came as advertised, is a wonderful product and a great price for the value, will buy again</li>
            <li> Loved it. It absorbs the water well. It is what I think about the perfect size. Plenty of room for many dishes on it.</li>
            <li> Dish drying mat. Works great! Looks nice on the counter and drys fast. No more dish towels for dish draining mats!!</li>
            <li> I just love this mat, does the job. Dries very quick ans it is the right size to hold several items.</li>
            <li> No more moldy funky dishtowels, this wondermat is the perfect substitute to absorb moisture from washed dishes etc. and then air dries. Machine washable as well. I will be purchasing another for the other miniscule counter where I prep meals.</li>
            <li> Does a fair job but is easily stained, requiring frequent washing... like after each use. Maybe there&#x27;s too much food prep happening nearby.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have gotten this product years ago. You just put it under your dish Drain and no more water all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;Then just throw it in the washer every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> This mat works great soaks up the water is the right size and is very easy to clean I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks of use, this mat had several stains that wouldn&#x27;t wash out.  It worked as advertised, but who wants a stained mat on the kitchen counter?  I bought another one made by KitchenAid and it&#x27;s much better.  Have used it for months with no stains...</li>
            <li> love the color, very soft and absorbent.</li>
            <li> Very attractive and works well to keep drining of dishes contained to the mat. Washes easily and air drys. Stains do not set in and wash out easily.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mom and she loves it! We use it all the time. Just as long as you hang it to let it dry between uses and wash it often, it will last!</li>
            <li> I expected the mat to be big but it was bigger than expected (that&#x27;s a good thing). It&#x27;s nice to have that extra drying space for hand washed dishes. It fits pots and pans nicely and many utensils at a time. Love it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love it! It absorbs water very nicely. I would recommend this product for every household! We are very pleased!</li>
            <li> Ideal when you have guest or a big family, help to dry cookware or pans, even dishes and glasses, easy to storage everywhere also in shelves or drawers</li>
            <li> I purchased this dish drying mat to be used with a  small group that regularly has coffee mugs.  Each person can wash their mug and set it upside down not he mat to dry.  This mat is a definite improvement over a regular dish towel  It is absorbent and thick, and for the just a few dish uses it doesn&#x27;t get drenched and get the counter wet below it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see this being much help or improvement over the plastic liners underneath a full drying rack for a regular family size number of dishes.  This works well for a small, regular amount, not tons of drippy water.  One person did spill about half a cup of water on one part of the mat, and the mat was soaked through in that area.  This could lead to water damage if someone has the mat on a surface that could be water damaged.</li>
            <li> Got it for those few dishes that still can&#x27;t go into the dish washer. Large and thick. No problems yet.</li>
            <li> i love this mat.  It works well.  Leaves no watery mess or smell.  It also looks much neater than a dish towel which I was using.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be disgusting mold factories, but my boyfriend convinced me to try them out.  We bought two to switch them out and allow for better drying time between uses, and wash them regularly. They&#x27;re very absorbent and don&#x27;t seem to be breeding anything disgusting.</li>
            <li> This thing is just not nice, it stains really easily and just looks gross sitting on the counter. Not classy</li>
            <li> I hate having a large dish rack on my counter.  The drying mat makes life so much more simple and neat.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these drying mats to replace the plastic drying racks.  I really like them because they look nice and you can just throw them in the washer when they start to look dirty.  I would definitely recommend getting at least two so that you can switch them out, three if you are like me and don&#x27;t get around to laundry as often as you should.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that these were a little small.  You can not fit a lot of dishes on them.  But they do make them in larger sizes if you go through a lot of dishes.  Fuzzies also tend to stick on them making them look dirty when they really are not.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the perfect size for our countertop and actually does exactly what it says it should do. It absorbs water. Ta&#x27;Da!</li>
            <li> i use this one for extra drying space, when my jumbo mat isn&#x27;t enough. LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;especially the empty counter that can then be used for other great, fun kitchen adventures...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dries quickly. folds &amp; stores easily in kitchen towel drawer (deep drawer).</li>
            <li> the product came on time and is better than I expected...now I need nine more words...one two three four five</li>
            <li> I have a very small kitchen and purchased this for drying my cups or larger pots and pans.  I use the In-Sink drainer along with this as I do not have counter space or storage space for a large dish drainer when dishes are clean and put away.  I am able to allow this to dry and then fold in a drawer until the next dish washing session, which of course is daily.  LOVE IT!!!  Good cushion and absorbs water perfectly.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for use under my bamboo dish rack. Soaks up all the water and can easily toss it in the washing machine to clean it.</li>
            <li> great ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! convenient! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! economical.I used it from the word go .</li>
