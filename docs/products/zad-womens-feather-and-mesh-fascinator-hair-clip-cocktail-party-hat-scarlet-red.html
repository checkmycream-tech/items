            <li>This was an awesome cocktail hat, I admit, i did remove the lace, because I was creating another hat and thought the lace would look better on that, but in the end, my best friend, nor I used the mesh lace at all,</li>

            <li>It was beautiful and exactly (I thought) what I was looking for, so I ordered it immediately.</li>

            <li>still cute.</li>
            <li>and it still was cute.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly which had me psyched!</li>
            <li>The comb felt comfortable and held the hat in place securely, until I went out into the wind</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw this online.</li>
            <li>It seems it should be facing the other direction, but very cute!</li>
            <li>I bought this beautiful little fancy hat for an upcoming tea party with my granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>it is just what I waned  very pretty</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact everyone was so impressed, I had to order the hat in different for 6 other women.</li>

            <li>Pretty but not what&#x27;s in the picture</li>
            <li>It is just what I wanted, added a few more feathers and bingo!</li>
            <li>But when I opened the box, the flowers and feathers were damaged from the packaging, and I noticed the &amp;#34;polka dots&amp;#34; were made from pipe cleaners, which made it look really tacky.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really took away from the &amp;#34;class act&amp;#34; I thought it was.</li>

            <li>This a cute little clip.  </li>
            <li>Way too small and very cheap material.</li>
            <li>Cute, small and affordable.</li>
            <li>The little &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; that seemed so cute are actually pieces of pipe-cleaners.</li>
            <li>Much smaller and not near as many feathers as I expected.</li>

            <li> Lots of compliments at the party, but it is a bit odd the way they placed the comb to attach to your head.</li>
            <li> Cutest little hat on earth.</li>
            <li> the combs are just not strong enough and it kept falling off. :-(</li>
            <li> (Sorry).</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> , I was skeptical before I purchased, because it looked a tab bit orange...</li>

            <li> I was looking for a costume hat to wear for an event that is coming up. I was so excited when I saw this online. It was beautiful and exactly (I thought) what I was looking for, so I ordered it immediately. It arrived quickly which had me psyched! But when I opened the box, the flowers and feathers were damaged from the packaging, and I noticed the &amp;#34;polka dots&amp;#34; were made from pipe cleaners, which made it look really tacky. (Sorry). Also, there was a comb for attachment, not a clip as advertised, which is a problem for me because I have locs. I will be returning, BUT I did find a perfect match... on Amazon. ðŸ˜Š</li>

            <li> I like it but the red bead on little wires in the center of the flower are loose. A couple fell of in the bag and I lost another the first time I wore it. I purchased for \\&quot; red hat  meeting\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I just love the hat.  As a matter of fact everyone was so impressed, I had to order the hat in different for 6 other women.</li>
            <li> Way too small and very cheap material. Not impressed.</li>

            <li> Very cute for the wedding I will be attending and matches my dress perfectly.  As others have posted, because of the way packaged the netting will just need some straightening.</li>
            <li> the combs are just not strong enough and it kept falling off. :-(</li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted, added a few more feathers and bingo! Now it is perfect for the outfit</li>

            <li> Really cute little cap.  Wore it to a Red Hat Society Luncheon and received several compliments.  The comb felt comfortable and held the hat in place securely, until I went out into the wind and then it blew off.  So, just hold onto it in the wind.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This a cute little clip.  It is a little smaller than I was expecting it to be&lt;br /&gt;but still cute.</li>
            <li> I got this hat for my mom for Easter. She loved it. It went will with her red and white outfit. She looked great.  I will spread the word.</li>
            <li> Cute, small and affordable.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome cocktail hat, I admit, i did remove the lace, because I was creating another hat and thought the lace would look better on that, but in the end, my best friend, nor I used the mesh lace at all, and it still was cute. Also the hat is really RED, I was skeptical before I purchased, because it looked a tab bit orange...</li>
