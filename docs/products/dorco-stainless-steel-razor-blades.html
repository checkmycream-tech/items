            <li>Good price and quality!!</li>

            <li>Great deal for the money!!!  </li>
            <li>Best barber razors ever!!!</li>
            <li>Always works perfect.</li>
            <li>Also, the price for 100 from this seller is very good.</li>
            <li>These blades are an incredibly value at about 8Â¢ a piece.</li>
            <li>Great price -- Great Service !!!</li>
            <li>awesome price great deal</li>
            <li>Likewise, I can cut myself to pieces with an excellent blade - even with good technique - if I&#x27;m in a hurry, haven&#x27;t soaked my beard sufficiently, or am being poked by my toddler as I am trying to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is now a happy camper:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy R.</li>
            <li>These are a non aggressive blade that does the job and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Great razors....</li>
            <li>Great blades for a price.</li>
            <li>Great blades.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great price and got them on time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, if you prefer not having to re-learn to shave after years with a multi-blade system, or if you are happy with Dorco&#x27;s sharpness/smoothness/durability/price tradeoffs, this blade will serve you well.  </li>
            <li>My husband thought it a great idea as he use to have one.  </li>
            <li>And didn&#x27;t do so great against the thicker parts of my beard either.  </li>
            <li>It is a great blade for my face and razor.</li>
            <li>Great Price.</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a great shave with these razors...</li>
            <li>Great price, too.</li>
            <li>Great blade for beginners.  </li>
            <li>Very handy.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price and the quality is perfect oft for me.</li>
            <li>great value, works as good as blades 10 times the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dorcos are the best blades I&#x27;ve found for my face and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t go by my word - buy a sampler pack of many brands, and experiment.</li>
            <li>I love these blades they are the best, when I received my package</li>
            <li>The Dorco blades are very nice and not too aggressive, which suits me fairly well.</li>
            <li>Best way to shave, very cheap and does a good job.</li>
            <li>They proved to be the sweet spot between the ideal sharpness, good longevity and durability, and excellent pricing.</li>
            <li>Good quality, nice edge for the money very good.</li>
            <li>Great blades at an unreal price, very satisfied</li>
            <li>These blades have impressed this reviewer, though, and because of their consistency and value, I find it easy to give them five</li>
            <li>These blades have impressed this reviewer, though, and because of their consistency and value, I find it easy to give them five stars.    </li>
            <li>They make a fine product that gives a wonderful shave, of course.</li>
            <li>Good razors.</li>
            <li>but the price on these is good</li>
            <li>This razor are good</li>
            <li>I started with Feather because of all the hype and had good shaves.</li>
            <li>Both 300T and 301T are good.</li>
            <li>it is good price and good quality.</li>
            <li>I get one good shave out of these blades.</li>
            <li>still rate them 4 stars, since they are still good blades, but upset that they are not what I ordered, and that I wasn&#x27;t given an opportunity to provide vendor feedback.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully close nick free shaves.</li>
            <li>Comes boxed and each 10 blades are wrapped in paper inside a plastic case good for disposal of the used blades.</li>
            <li>This blade is sold all over the place; check for good deals.</li>
            <li>A good inexpensive blade.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, these blades weren&#x27;t a good value.  </li>
            <li>But these blades still give me a good shave.</li>
            <li>Either way the Dorcos are a good training blade.</li>
            <li>Good for people that cant use the sharpest blades.</li>
            <li>A good close shave.</li>
            <li>Very nice  not the best that I have used but pretty good</li>
            <li>This brand works great for me, better than the all famed Feather blades.  </li>
            <li>Good price, as good most others.</li>
            <li>These are the best I have found, and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Tried the blades for a month...not satisfied at all!  </li>
            <li>These are excellent razor blades, consistent in sharpness and providing an effective shave.  </li>
            <li>These blades are excellent and very smooth, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Great and cheap.  </li>
            <li>Ordered them many times before and they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>Great price fast shipping great product</li>
            <li>The plastic holder with 10 blades that accepts your used ones is a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Razor blades all have their own tradeoffs between sharpness, smoothness, durability, consistency and price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had any nicks except for my own negligence.</li>
            <li>Good &amp; cheap!  </li>
            <li>However, if you want something mild, then this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>Great blades fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>I purchased these because I had good results with the ST-300s that came as free samples with my razor and</li>
            <li>So good, so cheap, so durable.</li>
            <li>Cheap price, good blades.</li>
            <li>Good cheap blades.  </li>
            <li>Then i decided to try the free Dorco blades that came with my Weishi butterfly safety razor (great razor holder and CHEAP).</li>
            <li>After giving all blades a fair trial I found these blades to be the most consistent, which helped me learn better technique for my medium beard and fair skin.  </li>
            <li>These are great for the first shave.  </li>
            <li>My razor bumps have for all intents and purposes disappeared, and my skin feels better for it.</li>
            <li>im satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I hope it gets better  </li>
            <li>So many things come into account:  type of razor used, technique, beard type, skin type, etc., etc.  </li>
            <li>So many things come into account:  type of razor used, technique, beard type, skin type, etc., etc.  </li>
            <li>Astras, which work better for me.</li>
            <li>i get more cuts and irritation with these blades vs others.</li>
            <li>Yep better not like those others</li>
            <li>So many guys swear by Feather blades, but try as I might, they don&#x27;t do it for me -</li>
            <li>I just tried a 301 in the SA one more time (about the 7th time now) to see if there was some way to make the blades behave, but no dice -</li>
            <li>Read the reviews, but grab a sample-pack to be sure.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews, but grab a sample-pack to be sure.</li>
            <li>glad I switched from Mach 3</li>
            <li>These blades perfect but would only use 4x before tossing out.</li>
            <li>One of the better blades.</li>
            <li>Much better than the dorco 300.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>my husband love it</li>
            <li>I have always ordered these blades and I love them</li>
            <li>say Derby is a better value than these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just use them until they are gone and buy a better blade like Feather.</li>
            <li>These blades never leave my skin with razor burn like most others.</li>
            <li>But for me, the Derbys are better when I want forgiving blades, and the Astras and Rapiras are sharper and more efficient.  </li>
            <li>Man-up, get in the grove, and you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I just purchased 400 more.</li>
            <li>I was worry it will take more time to arrived</li>
            <li>Way better then any multi blade shaving systems</li>
            <li>and you keep more money in your pocket.</li>
            <li>Safer and a better shave.</li>
            <li>But then I tried the Astra SP&#x27;s which are leaps and bounds better than the Dorcos...</li>
            <li>at school, they said these were WAY better than the derby ones that came with my blade.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more as needed........</li>
            <li>buy again when I run out in about 10 years :)</li>
            <li>Then I tried these in an Edwin Jagger a more aggressive razor and they gave me a pretty good shave in two WTG</li>
            <li>Pretty good blade.</li>
            <li>my shave was closer and much more comfortable with no nicks, tug, or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While these don&#x27;t strike me as the sharpest blades I have used, I&#x27;ve never used more comfortable blades.  </li>
            <li>Save money while keeping a smooth face. :-)</li>
            <li>I did not know they even made these for shaving (I have used them to scrape paint off windows) and am pleased to find these still available.  </li>
            <li>but I got right on time!!</li>
            <li>Return was easy with Amazon.</li>
            <li>This brand could easily warrant five stars from plenty of people.</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when they not only gave me a great, close shave, but also turned out to be one of the most comfortable, forgiving blades</li>
            <li>I find this to be a very satisfying way to shave, thanks to the comments from all of you.</li>
            <li>in my modern razors not so well so like most brands, they may work differently depending on the razor, trial and error til you find a match that works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These blades were exactly as described, great price, extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The Dorco blades give me a quick shave because I am confident that I won&#x27;t get cut</li>
            <li>The combination of this mild forgiving blade with an aggressive razor is like magic.</li>
            <li>They are a very mild blade, and give a nice gentle shave</li>
            <li>They cut just fine, but leave a razor burn that reminds me of a cheap disposable.  </li>
            <li>These are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used, sharp &amp; smooth for a super close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>If you are in the camp that&#x27;s looking for the type of shave that looks and feels baby smooth 18 hours after shaving, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pairing these Dorco blades with my Edwin Jagger razor and Aveeno Positively Smooth shave gel</li>
            <li>Now I get a fantastic, close, comfortable shave for .08 cents a blade!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit my razor.  </li>
            <li>Therefore the shave is not as smooth..</li>
            <li>And the fact that these blades are so cheap?  </li>
            <li>After using Personna blades for a while, I decided to switch it up and see what else is available.</li>
            <li>I find them aggressive as Hades, no matter my prep nor light touch in use.</li>
            <li>the Gillette Silver Blue, Wilkinson and Feather blades all of which give great shaves-eh!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great deal this will last a longtime for me and compared to cost for these at the store</li>
            <li>I appreciate a smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>They give me a smooth comfortable shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>These blades are fantastic.</li>
            <li>but they work good in some older super speed razors etc.</li>
            <li>Gonna stick with the Astra superior platinums for a nice drag</li>
            <li>The Shark Stainless Steel seems like an ideal compromise with decent sharpness and good smoothness, while staying low priced.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time to shave with Dorco and so far they have been great.</li>
            <li>A great choice for a newbie&#x27;s first blade, and the head-shaver set gives them high praise for never cutting their scalp.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the adjustable I set it to 9, not knowing that this is the most aggressive setting, and got the closest shave of my life with no cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li>Cremo is unique as I shave once with and once against the grain.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this blade in an aggressive razor if you still want a mild irritation free shave.</li>
            <li>I like them and the price is right !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it four stars primarily because it is cheap and consistent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still good advise for anyone starting with a safety razor to buy one of those variety bundles of blades.</li>
            <li>good to shave at a low cost again.</li>
            <li>Not as good as a  silver blue.</li>
            <li>I would say these are similar to the Derbys but not quite as good.  </li>
            <li>but so far I have gotten a very good shave every time and at a cost of only .06 cents per blade and about a penny per shave.</li>
            <li>They are a good combination of strong and sharp.</li>
            <li>Great value and super sharp blades.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with these and will be ordering more of the same when this supply runs down.</li>
            <li>for a even better shave i suggest you use American crew shaving oil instead of shaving cream it will protect and nourish you skin and provide better lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 300 almost never does this, using either my gold Gillette Aristocrat or my &#x27;72 Super Adjustable.</li>
            <li>The shipper was quick to ship also.</li>
            <li>Before I bought the Dorco blades I was using a 10 pack of Merkur, and then a 100 pack of Personna Super + Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fairly challenging grains, which I think makes it more likely to get nicked, trying to get the closest shave.</li>
            <li>got to me really quickly</li>
            <li>Of course, there is always a period of adjustment to your beard, but overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty cheap price for 100 blades.  </li>
            <li>They are consistently good from the first shave to the last, and that counts a lot with me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to double edged shaving, but I have experimented with several brands of blade and this is easily the best.</li>
            <li>As close and safe a shave as Gillette at one fiftieth the cost!</li>
            <li>free yet gentle shave all around.</li>
            <li>As close and safe a shave as Gillette at one fiftieth the cost!ing with a safety razor to buy one of those variety bundles of blades.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dorco is another golden example.</li>
            <li>I finally managed to snag a pack of them some months back, figuring, hey, if the 300s are so good, these could be better, which of course would be amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my father&#x27;s old adjustable safety razor leave my face smooth and comfortable without a blood sacrifice to the shaving gods.</li>
            <li>Blades do not work universally well on different people&#x27;s faces, but this blade works incredibly well on mine.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as good for the third or fourth shave, but that&#x27;s OK given the price and how I use them.</li>
            <li>First, I used this in a Gillette Super Speed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving with the Dorcos every other day, I&#x27;ve noticed that I get a really good shave without it being &#x27;too close&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Over the course of many blades, I can&#x27;t tell that there is any trade off of closeness for the comfort that these provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line for me is that these blades give me a close, comfortable shave - consistently - with every blade I open.  </li>
            <li>Good Quality Sharp Blades</li>
            <li>I hope whoever stole the other 20 blades get some good use out of them.</li>
            <li>These razor blades are inexpensive and strike the right balance of sharpness.  </li>
            <li>but these seem to be just right.  </li>
            <li>Dorco is perfect for daily use, and I can use a fresh blade every day for the price of a typical 5-blade cartridge.</li>
            <li>I usually have great consistancy with this seller.</li>
            <li>The dorco blades are sharp for 2-3 shaves but do not give as many shaves as some others However with the price being so low, I can afford to use more blades I would recommend them, Just remember ,you may not get as many shaves as with Lord  or Sharps</li>
            <li>Having said that, these blades have been as good or better than the other I have tried in the &amp;#34;sample packs&amp;#34; that I have gotten to try out various brands.  </li>
            <li>passes I took out just as much stubble as 3 passes (WTG,XTG,ATG) in the Super Speed, the mildest of the bunch, with an Israeli.</li>
            <li>Not Super, but pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly and with a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>AND at a very reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a week or two, I tried these blades and I was only able to shave once.</li>
            <li>The Wilkinson&#x27;s seemed scratchy from the first shave.</li>
            <li>how well I&#x27;ve done with the first pass and whether I have a meeting with the boss that day)  </li>
            <li>first blades i tried were given by my father Wilkinson Swords.</li>
            <li>While the blades are supposed to be \\&quot;identical\\&quot;, I really do not believe that to be the case, from my own experience.  </li>
            <li>Many of those trashing the 300 point to the 301 as the better blade, and not by a small margin.</li>
            <li>(My silver &amp;#34;Brit-ocrat&amp;#34; is a tad rougher, which I chalk up to a more aggressive blade gap than the American &#x27;crat.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tried my first Dorco 301 blade today -</li>
            <li>I use  these blades in my most aggressive razors (4 open combs and a slant).</li>
            <li>surprise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found each blade was consistent, so if you like one, you will like them all.  </li>
            <li>As long as you know what you are buying, these are a great value for the money, especially when bought on sale in bulk.  </li>
            <li>It was fast and I got what I want it!</li>
            <li>A must buy it never fails.</li>
            <li>They seem to work pretty good for the first few shaves.  </li>
            <li>I travel a lot and generally use a blade only once because I haven&#x27;t found a good way to temporarily store a used blade in my toiletries bag.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor was very prompt with the delivery also, all around a very positive experience for me.</li>
            <li>the Dorco blades are very sharp and give a smooth shave for many shaves with and against the grain.</li>
            <li>but then, I had to adjust my technique to get a smooth shave (which I got, but only with some effort--and some mild abrasion on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ill buy more when i run out!!!  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good blade for someone starting out in double edge shaving.</li>
            <li>In comparison, these do just as good if not better.  </li>
            <li>Good everyday blades and a bargain to boot!</li>
            <li>The best part is that as good as they are, they are also among the least expensive.  </li>
            <li>Service was great, and I got my order 3days earlier than expected!!</li>
            <li>OK  when you get using single blade.</li>
            <li>while I don&#x27;t have a particularly heavy beard, these work exceptionally well for me along with glycerin soap, a shaving brush, and decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Smooth and reasonably clearing the whiskers - but not in the same league with</li>
            <li>Same price basically, but much much smoother shave, razor burn free.  </li>
            <li>A great everyday razor that won&#x27;t tear me up in my daily shower/shave.</li>
            <li>simply, very please with product and price.  </li>
            <li>Try until you find one you really like.</li>
            <li>Too short to fit in my safety razor.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t prepared to expect much from them as I figured they would be the cheapest of blades.  </li>
            <li>and it grows fast</li>
            <li>the st 300 are packaged in cardboard no plastic, so from now on i will get the 300 so as to minimize how much plastic i am putting in the landfill.</li>
            <li>blades are very depending on skin and beard type.</li>
            <li>for me, these do not work very well.</li>
            <li>It felt like an Israeli Personna after it was ready to go in the blade bank.</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s a horses-for-courses thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see it working for others, and indeed others here have said as much, and I believe them.</li>
            <li>my* face, and that&#x27;s really all that counts here.</li>
            <li>a friend of mine has a much lighter beard and loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you need to go over problem areas, you can do so without much irritation or fear of being cut.  </li>
            <li>Much smoother and no pain.</li>
            <li>and im going to continue to buy these, much cheaper here</li>
            <li>I really like these blades.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a much smaller frame of reference, user wise, to ask opinions of and to get advise, other than online blogs.</li>
            <li>I flip the blade over after 3 shaves, and get 3 more shaves on the other edge.  </li>
            <li>They  don&#x27;t work for me as well as other brands like Wilkinson Sword, but they may work better for some people.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands and so fat</li>
            <li>The kindest thing I can say about the 301 is that it&#x27;s pretty good WTG, just okay XTG, but extremely dodgy ATG, pulling and nicking worse than I recall Feathers doing.</li>
            <li>I think these are better for those with lighter facial hair (matching the Dorcos&#x27; primary target -- East Asia), less than two days growth, or for beginners.  </li>
            <li>With Cremo, once I made the first pass all I had to do was re-wet and rub for the second pass and the second pass proved as smooth and effortless as the first.  </li>
            <li>When you order it, they send you the ST-300, their old stainless steel model!</li>
            <li>your blades 2nd shave no drag on the blade Much better New rate of 3 stars plus</li>
            <li>The Feathers were good, but did seem to lose the edge fairly quick, and not good enough to command a price triple of the Dorcos.....  </li>
            <li>I followed the advise on one web site, to opt for one of the blade variety packs sold to expose you to different manufacturers and to experience which blades were most comparable to my individual skin, beard and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>When I went back to safety razors a couple of years ago, I tried MANY different blades.  </li>
            <li>For comparison my favorite blades are Derby&#x27;s, then the red IP&#x27;s, and finally if I&#x27;m feeling froggy...</li>
            <li>I am not as particular about my blades as others that write reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These Dorco blades give me a consistently good shave, time after time, and last about as long as I think they should:  4 - 5 days, shaving daily.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>get smooth shaves with these, and no irritation, and i get just as much hair shaved as any other blade ive tried.</li>
            <li>I tried platinum-coated blades, numerous other brandname blades, but these have provided the easiest and most consistent shave.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>not the top of the line but the&#x27;re still sharp!!</li>
            <li>this is so much cheaper and as far as the way they shave I haven&#x27;t used yet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of different types of blades since getting into double edged shaving, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>For what it is worth I have only used Feather blades and the Merkeur that came with my razor.</li>
            <li>I love Dorco blades and have been using the ST-301&#x27;s for a few years now, but beware if purchasing this item.  </li>
            <li>it was a good shave - not a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I found them amazing blades, but for me they were actually too sharp!  </li>
            <li>As a person with a long history of skin issues due to shaving I can honestly say that the Dorcos don&#x27;t cause me any problems whatsoever in terms of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gave a new meaning to the word &amp;#34;face scraper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Still using the blades that came with his new razor.</li>
            <li>Good razor, but does&#x27;t last quite as long as other brands.</li>
            <li>I,m new to DE shaving so over my first three months I tried several blades.  </li>
            <li>consistently gave me 2-3 extra shaves per blade.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m just as ready to admit that I can give myself a great shave using a mediocre blade with proper prep, technique, and quality shave cream.  </li>
            <li>And their durability means I am willing to pay double what these Dorcos cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product is awesome...super sharp and clean...</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t shave as cleanly as some other DE blades.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy spending so much less with these blades than spending a fortune on the disposable types.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Understand that I have a heavy dark beard and it demands a really good blade -</li>
            <li>I was shocked (in a good way) at how mild it was--</li>
            <li>Perhaps like me, you finally threw up your hands in disgust one day and said paying Gillette $40 or more for 12 blade cartridges was getting a little out of hand.</li>
            <li>I use these for hair cutting and they hold their edge and work great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m into my second blade now and so far I really like them.</li>
            <li>These work very well for me, no need to double pass.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that is prone to being ingrown, as well as sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For the first time in a long while, my neck actually looks really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin and/or ingrown hairs, do yourself a favor and give these a try.</li>
            <li>I had to finish shaving with an old Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>The blades worked very well in both situations, especially with the Cremo shave cream.  </li>
            <li>But you will want a blade that is the same each time you load one in your razor (or you will get that very unwelcome poison:</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Even when my stubble is one day old.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only real way to know.</li>
            <li>The luxury of the old fashioned shave is not to be underestimated.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes newer and more are not better!</li>
            <li>not bad getting used too single edge razors,after a week no big deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d call this a decent, middle of the road blade.  </li>
            <li>These South Korean blades are a tremendous value, terrifically consistent and known to be quite sharp (not Feather sharp) but also forgiving.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, close blade, lasts two to three shaves, which is solid for me, and at less than $.10 per blade, it&#x27;s a bargain</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something super sharp, then I might recommend looking elsewhere, such as the Feather series.</li>
            <li>SUPER SHARP!!</li>
            <li>Not shaving 3 times, but using 3 new blades at different times, and kept notes on the performance.  </li>
            <li>They also were not sharp.</li>
            <li>Now, shaving is such a subjective thing, and two people can - and do - have totally different experiences with the exact same blade.  </li>
            <li>does not seem to be as sharp and smooth as some other brands I use.</li>
            <li>Going back to old &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; priced blades.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to go old school, using old timey double edged razor blades with a safety razor and using a shaving brush with a shaving mug of proper shaving</li>
            <li>The reviewers who liked these blades aren&#x27;t wrong: these blades work for them.</li>
            <li>A bit sharper (so a bit more dangerous), but still forgiving enough for me, and always consistent.  </li>
            <li>They seem roughly comparable to Derbys -- noticeably less sharp than Feathers or (more affordably)</li>
            <li>When I was a young man and joined the military, back in the stone age; during boot training I developed the habit of shaving without lotion and at times without water in order to save time or to touch up before an inspection.</li>
            <li>I also shave my head (full head of  thick hair) and wouldn&#x27;t even dare to try it at that.</li>
            <li>Among double-edge blades, Dorco has a reputation for being mild and forgiving (by those who like them) and dull (by those who</li>
            <li>I am relatively new to wet shaving and have been dutifully going through my sampler pack.</li>
            <li>Anyone new to DE wet shaving should start with these blades and I recommend anyone learning to use a shavette start with the Dorcos.  </li>
            <li>I recently switched back to double edge shaving because I was sick of paying $2 to $4 for a cartridge and not getting a great shave.</li>
            <li>It may take 4-6 weeks of using these blades exclusively for your skin to heal from your past shaving choices, but afterward you WILL see the difference in a positive way!</li>
            <li>The number of stars a particular reviewer awards doesn&#x27;t really mean much with razor blades since they&#x27;re such an individual thing.</li>
            <li>Changed back to old school single edged blade after shopping disposables for years trying to save $$.</li>

            <li> these are the best for me.</li>
            <li> perfect-- thx to all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great deal for the money!!!  </li>
            <li> Best barber razors ever!!!</li>
            <li> Always works perfect.</li>
            <li> Also, the price for 100 from this seller is very good.</li>
            <li> These blades are an incredibly value at about 8Â¢ a piece.</li>
            <li> Great price -- Great Service !!!</li>
            <li> awesome price great deal</li>
            <li> Likewise, I can cut myself to pieces with an excellent blade - even with good technique - if I&#x27;m in a hurry, haven&#x27;t soaked my beard sufficiently, or am being poked by my toddler as I am trying to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is now a happy camper:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy R.</li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great price and got them on time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, if you prefer not having to re-learn to shave after years with a multi-blade system, or if you are happy with Dorco&#x27;s sharpness/smoothness/durability/price tradeoffs, this blade will serve you well.  </li>
            <li> My husband thought it a great idea as he use to have one.  </li>
            <li> And didn&#x27;t do so great against the thicker parts of my beard either.  </li>
            <li> It is a great blade for my face and razor.</li>
            <li> Great Price.</li>

            <li> great value, works as good as blades 10 times the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dorcos are the best blades I&#x27;ve found for my face and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t go by my word - buy a sampler pack of many brands, and experiment.</li>
            <li> I love these blades they are the best, when I received my package</li>
            <li> The Dorco blades are very nice and not too aggressive, which suits me fairly well.</li>
            <li> Best way to shave, very cheap and does a good job.</li>
            <li> They proved to be the sweet spot between the ideal sharpness, good longevity and durability, and excellent pricing.</li>
            <li> Good quality, nice edge for the money very good.</li>
            <li> Great blades at an unreal price, very satisfied</li>
            <li> These blades have impressed this reviewer, though, and because of their consistency and value, I find it easy to give them five</li>
            <li> These blades have impressed this reviewer, though, and because of their consistency and value, I find it easy to give them five stars.    </li>
            <li> They make a fine product that gives a wonderful shave, of course.</li>
            <li> Good razors.</li>
            <li> but the price on these is good</li>
            <li> This razor are good</li>
            <li> I started with Feather because of all the hype and had good shaves.</li>
            <li> Both 300T and 301T are good.</li>
            <li> it is good price and good quality.</li>
            <li> I get one good shave out of these blades.</li>
            <li> still rate them 4 stars, since they are still good blades, but upset that they are not what I ordered, and that I wasn&#x27;t given an opportunity to provide vendor feedback.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully close nick free shaves.</li>
            <li> Comes boxed and each 10 blades are wrapped in paper inside a plastic case good for disposal of the used blades.</li>
            <li> This blade is sold all over the place; check for good deals.</li>
            <li> A good inexpensive blade.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, these blades weren&#x27;t a good value.  </li>
            <li> But these blades still give me a good shave.</li>
            <li> Either way the Dorcos are a good training blade.</li>
            <li> Good for people that cant use the sharpest blades.</li>
            <li> A good close shave.</li>
            <li> Very nice  not the best that I have used but pretty good</li>
            <li> This brand works great for me, better than the all famed Feather blades.  </li>
            <li> Good price, as good most others.</li>
            <li> These are the best I have found, and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Tried the blades for a month...not satisfied at all!  </li>
            <li> These are excellent razor blades, consistent in sharpness and providing an effective shave.  </li>
            <li> These blades are excellent and very smooth, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great and cheap.  </li>
            <li> Ordered them many times before and they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> The plastic holder with 10 blades that accepts your used ones is a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Razor blades all have their own tradeoffs between sharpness, smoothness, durability, consistency and price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any nicks except for my own negligence.</li>
            <li> Good &amp; cheap!  </li>
            <li> However, if you want something mild, then this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> Great blades fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I had good results with the ST-300s that came as free samples with my razor and</li>
            <li> So good, so cheap, so durable.</li>
            <li> Cheap price, good blades.</li>
            <li> Good cheap blades.  </li>
            <li> Then i decided to try the free Dorco blades that came with my Weishi butterfly safety razor (great razor holder and CHEAP).</li>
            <li> After giving all blades a fair trial I found these blades to be the most consistent, which helped me learn better technique for my medium beard and fair skin.  </li>
            <li> These are great for the first shave.  </li>
            <li> My razor bumps have for all intents and purposes disappeared, and my skin feels better for it.</li>
            <li> im satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I hope it gets better  </li>
            <li> So many things come into account:  type of razor used, technique, beard type, skin type, etc., etc.  </li>
            <li> So many things come into account:  type of razor used, technique, beard type, skin type, etc., etc.  </li>
            <li> Astras, which work better for me.</li>
            <li> i get more cuts and irritation with these blades vs others.</li>
            <li> Yep better not like those others</li>
            <li> So many guys swear by Feather blades, but try as I might, they don&#x27;t do it for me -</li>
            <li> I just tried a 301 in the SA one more time (about the 7th time now) to see if there was some way to make the blades behave, but no dice -</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, but grab a sample-pack to be sure.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, but grab a sample-pack to be sure.</li>
            <li> glad I switched from Mach 3</li>
            <li> These blades perfect but would only use 4x before tossing out.</li>
            <li> One of the better blades.</li>
            <li> Much better than the dorco 300.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> my husband love it</li>
            <li> I have always ordered these blades and I love them</li>
            <li> say Derby is a better value than these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just use them until they are gone and buy a better blade like Feather.</li>
            <li> These blades never leave my skin with razor burn like most others.</li>
            <li> But for me, the Derbys are better when I want forgiving blades, and the Astras and Rapiras are sharper and more efficient.  </li>
            <li> Man-up, get in the grove, and you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I just purchased 400 more.</li>
            <li> I was worry it will take more time to arrived</li>
            <li> Way better then any multi blade shaving systems</li>
            <li> and you keep more money in your pocket.</li>
            <li> Safer and a better shave.</li>
            <li> But then I tried the Astra SP&#x27;s which are leaps and bounds better than the Dorcos...</li>
            <li> at school, they said these were WAY better than the derby ones that came with my blade.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more as needed........</li>
            <li> buy again when I run out in about 10 years :)</li>
            <li> Then I tried these in an Edwin Jagger a more aggressive razor and they gave me a pretty good shave in two WTG</li>
            <li> Pretty good blade.</li>
            <li> my shave was closer and much more comfortable with no nicks, tug, or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While these don&#x27;t strike me as the sharpest blades I have used, I&#x27;ve never used more comfortable blades.  </li>
            <li> Save money while keeping a smooth face. :-)</li>
            <li> I did not know they even made these for shaving (I have used them to scrape paint off windows) and am pleased to find these still available.  </li>
            <li> but I got right on time!!</li>
            <li> Return was easy with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This brand could easily warrant five stars from plenty of people.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when they not only gave me a great, close shave, but also turned out to be one of the most comfortable, forgiving blades</li>
            <li> I find this to be a very satisfying way to shave, thanks to the comments from all of you.</li>
            <li> in my modern razors not so well so like most brands, they may work differently depending on the razor, trial and error til you find a match that works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These blades were exactly as described, great price, extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The Dorco blades give me a quick shave because I am confident that I won&#x27;t get cut</li>
            <li> The combination of this mild forgiving blade with an aggressive razor is like magic.</li>
            <li> They are a very mild blade, and give a nice gentle shave</li>
            <li> They cut just fine, but leave a razor burn that reminds me of a cheap disposable.  </li>
            <li> These are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used, sharp &amp; smooth for a super close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> If you are in the camp that&#x27;s looking for the type of shave that looks and feels baby smooth 18 hours after shaving, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pairing these Dorco blades with my Edwin Jagger razor and Aveeno Positively Smooth shave gel</li>
            <li> Now I get a fantastic, close, comfortable shave for .08 cents a blade!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit my razor.  </li>
            <li> Therefore the shave is not as smooth..</li>
            <li> And the fact that these blades are so cheap?  </li>
            <li> After using Personna blades for a while, I decided to switch it up and see what else is available.</li>
            <li> I find them aggressive as Hades, no matter my prep nor light touch in use.</li>
            <li> the Gillette Silver Blue, Wilkinson and Feather blades all of which give great shaves-eh!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great deal this will last a longtime for me and compared to cost for these at the store</li>
            <li> I appreciate a smooth and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> They give me a smooth comfortable shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> These blades are fantastic.</li>
            <li> but they work good in some older super speed razors etc.</li>
            <li> Gonna stick with the Astra superior platinums for a nice drag</li>
            <li> The Shark Stainless Steel seems like an ideal compromise with decent sharpness and good smoothness, while staying low priced.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time to shave with Dorco and so far they have been great.</li>
            <li> A great choice for a newbie&#x27;s first blade, and the head-shaver set gives them high praise for never cutting their scalp.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the adjustable I set it to 9, not knowing that this is the most aggressive setting, and got the closest shave of my life with no cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li> Cremo is unique as I shave once with and once against the grain.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this blade in an aggressive razor if you still want a mild irritation free shave.</li>
            <li> I like them and the price is right !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it four stars primarily because it is cheap and consistent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still good advise for anyone starting with a safety razor to buy one of those variety bundles of blades.</li>
            <li> good to shave at a low cost again.</li>
            <li> Not as good as a  silver blue.</li>
            <li> I would say these are similar to the Derbys but not quite as good.  </li>
            <li> but so far I have gotten a very good shave every time and at a cost of only .06 cents per blade and about a penny per shave.</li>
            <li> They are a good combination of strong and sharp.</li>
            <li> Great value and super sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these and will be ordering more of the same when this supply runs down.</li>
            <li> for a even better shave i suggest you use American crew shaving oil instead of shaving cream it will protect and nourish you skin and provide better lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 300 almost never does this, using either my gold Gillette Aristocrat or my &#x27;72 Super Adjustable.</li>
            <li> The shipper was quick to ship also.</li>
            <li> Before I bought the Dorco blades I was using a 10 pack of Merkur, and then a 100 pack of Personna Super + Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fairly challenging grains, which I think makes it more likely to get nicked, trying to get the closest shave.</li>
            <li> got to me really quickly</li>
            <li> Of course, there is always a period of adjustment to your beard, but overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty cheap price for 100 blades.  </li>
            <li> They are consistently good from the first shave to the last, and that counts a lot with me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to double edged shaving, but I have experimented with several brands of blade and this is easily the best.</li>
            <li> As close and safe a shave as Gillette at one fiftieth the cost!</li>
            <li> free yet gentle shave all around.</li>
            <li> As close and safe a shave as Gillette at one fiftieth the cost!ing with a safety razor to buy one of those variety bundles of blades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dorco is another golden example.</li>
            <li> I finally managed to snag a pack of them some months back, figuring, hey, if the 300s are so good, these could be better, which of course would be amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my father&#x27;s old adjustable safety razor leave my face smooth and comfortable without a blood sacrifice to the shaving gods.</li>
            <li> Blades do not work universally well on different people&#x27;s faces, but this blade works incredibly well on mine.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as good for the third or fourth shave, but that&#x27;s OK given the price and how I use them.</li>
            <li> First, I used this in a Gillette Super Speed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving with the Dorcos every other day, I&#x27;ve noticed that I get a really good shave without it being &#x27;too close&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Over the course of many blades, I can&#x27;t tell that there is any trade off of closeness for the comfort that these provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line for me is that these blades give me a close, comfortable shave - consistently - with every blade I open.  </li>
            <li> Good Quality Sharp Blades</li>
            <li> I hope whoever stole the other 20 blades get some good use out of them.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are inexpensive and strike the right balance of sharpness.  </li>
            <li> but these seem to be just right.  </li>
            <li> Dorco is perfect for daily use, and I can use a fresh blade every day for the price of a typical 5-blade cartridge.</li>
            <li> I usually have great consistancy with this seller.</li>
            <li> The dorco blades are sharp for 2-3 shaves but do not give as many shaves as some others However with the price being so low, I can afford to use more blades I would recommend them, Just remember ,you may not get as many shaves as with Lord  or Sharps</li>
            <li> Having said that, these blades have been as good or better than the other I have tried in the &amp;#34;sample packs&amp;#34; that I have gotten to try out various brands.  </li>
            <li> passes I took out just as much stubble as 3 passes (WTG,XTG,ATG) in the Super Speed, the mildest of the bunch, with an Israeli.</li>
            <li> Not Super, but pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and with a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> AND at a very reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a week or two, I tried these blades and I was only able to shave once.</li>
            <li> The Wilkinson&#x27;s seemed scratchy from the first shave.</li>
            <li> how well I&#x27;ve done with the first pass and whether I have a meeting with the boss that day)  </li>
            <li> first blades i tried were given by my father Wilkinson Swords.</li>
            <li> While the blades are supposed to be \\&quot;identical\\&quot;, I really do not believe that to be the case, from my own experience.  </li>
            <li> Many of those trashing the 300 point to the 301 as the better blade, and not by a small margin.</li>
            <li> (My silver &amp;#34;Brit-ocrat&amp;#34; is a tad rougher, which I chalk up to a more aggressive blade gap than the American &#x27;crat.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried my first Dorco 301 blade today -</li>
            <li> I use  these blades in my most aggressive razors (4 open combs and a slant).</li>
            <li> surprise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found each blade was consistent, so if you like one, you will like them all.  </li>
            <li> As long as you know what you are buying, these are a great value for the money, especially when bought on sale in bulk.  </li>
            <li> It was fast and I got what I want it!</li>
            <li> A must buy it never fails.</li>
            <li> They seem to work pretty good for the first few shaves.  </li>
            <li> I travel a lot and generally use a blade only once because I haven&#x27;t found a good way to temporarily store a used blade in my toiletries bag.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor was very prompt with the delivery also, all around a very positive experience for me.</li>
            <li> the Dorco blades are very sharp and give a smooth shave for many shaves with and against the grain.</li>
            <li> but then, I had to adjust my technique to get a smooth shave (which I got, but only with some effort--and some mild abrasion on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ill buy more when i run out!!!  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good blade for someone starting out in double edge shaving.</li>
            <li> In comparison, these do just as good if not better.  </li>
            <li> Good everyday blades and a bargain to boot!</li>
            <li> The best part is that as good as they are, they are also among the least expensive.  </li>
            <li> Service was great, and I got my order 3days earlier than expected!!</li>
            <li> OK  when you get using single blade.</li>
            <li> while I don&#x27;t have a particularly heavy beard, these work exceptionally well for me along with glycerin soap, a shaving brush, and decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Smooth and reasonably clearing the whiskers - but not in the same league with</li>
            <li> Same price basically, but much much smoother shave, razor burn free.  </li>
            <li> A great everyday razor that won&#x27;t tear me up in my daily shower/shave.</li>
            <li> simply, very please with product and price.  </li>
            <li> Try until you find one you really like.</li>
            <li> Too short to fit in my safety razor.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t prepared to expect much from them as I figured they would be the cheapest of blades.  </li>
            <li> and it grows fast</li>
            <li> the st 300 are packaged in cardboard no plastic, so from now on i will get the 300 so as to minimize how much plastic i am putting in the landfill.</li>
            <li> blades are very depending on skin and beard type.</li>
            <li> for me, these do not work very well.</li>
            <li> It felt like an Israeli Personna after it was ready to go in the blade bank.</li>
            <li> Really, it&#x27;s a horses-for-courses thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see it working for others, and indeed others here have said as much, and I believe them.</li>
            <li> my* face, and that&#x27;s really all that counts here.</li>
            <li> a friend of mine has a much lighter beard and loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you need to go over problem areas, you can do so without much irritation or fear of being cut.  </li>
            <li> Much smoother and no pain.</li>
            <li> and im going to continue to buy these, much cheaper here</li>
            <li> I really like these blades.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a much smaller frame of reference, user wise, to ask opinions of and to get advise, other than online blogs.</li>
            <li> I flip the blade over after 3 shaves, and get 3 more shaves on the other edge.  </li>
            <li> They  don&#x27;t work for me as well as other brands like Wilkinson Sword, but they may work better for some people.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands and so fat</li>
            <li> The kindest thing I can say about the 301 is that it&#x27;s pretty good WTG, just okay XTG, but extremely dodgy ATG, pulling and nicking worse than I recall Feathers doing.</li>
            <li> I think these are better for those with lighter facial hair (matching the Dorcos&#x27; primary target -- East Asia), less than two days growth, or for beginners.  </li>
            <li> With Cremo, once I made the first pass all I had to do was re-wet and rub for the second pass and the second pass proved as smooth and effortless as the first.  </li>
            <li> When you order it, they send you the ST-300, their old stainless steel model!</li>
            <li> your blades 2nd shave no drag on the blade Much better New rate of 3 stars plus</li>
            <li> The Feathers were good, but did seem to lose the edge fairly quick, and not good enough to command a price triple of the Dorcos.....  </li>
            <li> I followed the advise on one web site, to opt for one of the blade variety packs sold to expose you to different manufacturers and to experience which blades were most comparable to my individual skin, beard and sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> When I went back to safety razors a couple of years ago, I tried MANY different blades.  </li>
            <li> For comparison my favorite blades are Derby&#x27;s, then the red IP&#x27;s, and finally if I&#x27;m feeling froggy...</li>
            <li> I am not as particular about my blades as others that write reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These Dorco blades give me a consistently good shave, time after time, and last about as long as I think they should:  4 - 5 days, shaving daily.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> get smooth shaves with these, and no irritation, and i get just as much hair shaved as any other blade ive tried.</li>
            <li> I tried platinum-coated blades, numerous other brandname blades, but these have provided the easiest and most consistent shave.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> not the top of the line but the&#x27;re still sharp!!</li>
            <li> this is so much cheaper and as far as the way they shave I haven&#x27;t used yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different types of blades since getting into double edged shaving, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> For what it is worth I have only used Feather blades and the Merkeur that came with my razor.</li>
            <li> I love Dorco blades and have been using the ST-301&#x27;s for a few years now, but beware if purchasing this item.  </li>
            <li> it was a good shave - not a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I found them amazing blades, but for me they were actually too sharp!  </li>
            <li> As a person with a long history of skin issues due to shaving I can honestly say that the Dorcos don&#x27;t cause me any problems whatsoever in terms of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gave a new meaning to the word &amp;#34;face scraper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Still using the blades that came with his new razor.</li>
            <li> Good razor, but does&#x27;t last quite as long as other brands.</li>
            <li> I,m new to DE shaving so over my first three months I tried several blades.  </li>
            <li> consistently gave me 2-3 extra shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m just as ready to admit that I can give myself a great shave using a mediocre blade with proper prep, technique, and quality shave cream.  </li>
            <li> And their durability means I am willing to pay double what these Dorcos cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product is awesome...super sharp and clean...</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t shave as cleanly as some other DE blades.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy spending so much less with these blades than spending a fortune on the disposable types.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Understand that I have a heavy dark beard and it demands a really good blade -</li>
            <li> I was shocked (in a good way) at how mild it was--</li>
            <li> Perhaps like me, you finally threw up your hands in disgust one day and said paying Gillette $40 or more for 12 blade cartridges was getting a little out of hand.</li>
            <li> I use these for hair cutting and they hold their edge and work great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into my second blade now and so far I really like them.</li>
            <li> These work very well for me, no need to double pass.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that is prone to being ingrown, as well as sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For the first time in a long while, my neck actually looks really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin and/or ingrown hairs, do yourself a favor and give these a try.</li>
            <li> I had to finish shaving with an old Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> The blades worked very well in both situations, especially with the Cremo shave cream.  </li>
            <li> But you will want a blade that is the same each time you load one in your razor (or you will get that very unwelcome poison:</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Even when my stubble is one day old.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only real way to know.</li>
            <li> The luxury of the old fashioned shave is not to be underestimated.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes newer and more are not better!</li>
            <li> not bad getting used too single edge razors,after a week no big deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d call this a decent, middle of the road blade.  </li>
            <li> These South Korean blades are a tremendous value, terrifically consistent and known to be quite sharp (not Feather sharp) but also forgiving.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, close blade, lasts two to three shaves, which is solid for me, and at less than $.10 per blade, it&#x27;s a bargain</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something super sharp, then I might recommend looking elsewhere, such as the Feather series.</li>
            <li> SUPER SHARP!!</li>
            <li> Not shaving 3 times, but using 3 new blades at different times, and kept notes on the performance.  </li>
            <li> They also were not sharp.</li>
            <li> Now, shaving is such a subjective thing, and two people can - and do - have totally different experiences with the exact same blade.  </li>
            <li> does not seem to be as sharp and smooth as some other brands I use.</li>
            <li> Going back to old &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; priced blades.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to go old school, using old timey double edged razor blades with a safety razor and using a shaving brush with a shaving mug of proper shaving</li>
            <li> The reviewers who liked these blades aren&#x27;t wrong: these blades work for them.</li>
            <li> A bit sharper (so a bit more dangerous), but still forgiving enough for me, and always consistent.  </li>
            <li> They seem roughly comparable to Derbys -- noticeably less sharp than Feathers or (more affordably)</li>
            <li> When I was a young man and joined the military, back in the stone age; during boot training I developed the habit of shaving without lotion and at times without water in order to save time or to touch up before an inspection.</li>
            <li> I also shave my head (full head of  thick hair) and wouldn&#x27;t even dare to try it at that.</li>
            <li> Among double-edge blades, Dorco has a reputation for being mild and forgiving (by those who like them) and dull (by those who</li>
            <li> I am relatively new to wet shaving and have been dutifully going through my sampler pack.</li>
            <li> Anyone new to DE wet shaving should start with these blades and I recommend anyone learning to use a shavette start with the Dorcos.  </li>
            <li> I recently switched back to double edge shaving because I was sick of paying $2 to $4 for a cartridge and not getting a great shave.</li>
            <li> It may take 4-6 weeks of using these blades exclusively for your skin to heal from your past shaving choices, but afterward you WILL see the difference in a positive way!</li>
            <li> The number of stars a particular reviewer awards doesn&#x27;t really mean much with razor blades since they&#x27;re such an individual thing.</li>
            <li> Changed back to old school single edged blade after shopping disposables for years trying to save $$.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are suitable for people with heavy beard growth and very hard to cut hair, although some have found they can make them work.  </li>
            <li> I have tried probably a dozen other blades over the years and for the price, and my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my adult sons swears by these, since he sliced himself to ribbons with the other blades he tried.  </li>
            <li> Spent a year testing a broad sampler blade pack and settled on these Dorco blades for my several razors and these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long argued that choosing a DE blade is extremely personal - to the point that I take the gaggle of reviews I read, here and elsewhere, with a necessary pinch of salt.</li>
            <li> First shave today with DE Dorco razor and blades Felt like shaving with a dull pocket knife.</li>
            <li> The ST-300&#x27;s are available for a few bucks less from other vendors if that IS what you are looking</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about as long as I&#x27;d expect any blade to last, and for pennies per blade, I&#x27;m not going to gripe over a day or even two.  </li>
            <li> Second shave was the same, razor burn feeling with only 1 pass done, and didn&#x27;t even atttempt to shave the rough parts since it was a weekend shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a few shaves with the ST-301s, I noticed I was getting nicked when I hadn&#x27;t normally.</li>
            <li> and I have a pretty thick beard...</li>
            <li> Recently I ordered 6 packs of these razors, when I received them in the mail there was loose cartridges all in the box all dismembered and was actually short one...</li>
            <li> beard is tough and full and my skin is sensitive; the right blades do wonders for my shaving experience, and the wrong blades tend to cut me up, every time.  </li>
            <li> Obvious knockoffs, packaging and model number not right, not very sharp</li>
            <li> according to Dorco -- is the packaging (ST-300s are individually wrapped in plain paper w/ soft outer packaging).</li>
            <li> Pretty forgiving and not super harsh.</li>
            <li> If you are coming to double-edge blades from a multi-blade system, this blade will allow you to shave in much the same fashion as you are used to--pressing against the face without too much worry of cutting yourself.  </li>
            <li> The first pass dragged a lot and it only got worse from there.</li>
            <li> and this just wasn&#x27;t sharp enough.</li>
            <li> I agree with Adam who wrote the only other one star review of this blade.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll warrant that this is due to the overall quality of the blade.  </li>
            <li> But for me, these blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Theyre sharp enough, but not like Feather and Kai.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use Feather blades when I have some growth to remove, but they&#x27;re too sharp -- on only a day of beard, they cut me up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money to send these back since I would have to pay to ship them back.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like any of these, you might try a Personna Blue before going up to the premium priced blades like Feathers or 7 O&#x27;Clock Black.</li>
            <li> I tried these in a &#x27;70 Gillette Super Speed and a Lord Tech (L5) and they were absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> I typically change the blade out after 3 or 4 shaves since they tend to get dull fast.  </li>
            <li> Not a clean shave, multiple nicks.  </li>
            <li> These blades come cased in a box of 100, unlike others that have little 10-blade cases individually wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li> For me I end up with a lot of weepers and a shave that is not very close.</li>
            <li> I wet shave with soap and brush, by the way.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut as well as Astras or Rapiras, and of course, much worse than Feathers, but they are also very forgiving.  </li>
            <li> (um, this isn&#x27;t the space shuttle here), but then added only half joking that also it was to pay for his bonuses!  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> In my frugalness, I continued using these blades until the last 10 pack, when I decided &amp;#34;F it&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s not worth the savings of a few dollars.</li>
            <li> Other brands of razors have given me razor burn which has led to irritation on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs have also been an issue with other razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; blade in the bunch (which has happened with some other brands).  </li>
            <li> The Dorcos were medium sharp and seemed to get smoother after 1-2 shaves.</li>
            <li> This review is for the ST300 platinum blades that come 10 per small cardboard pack; the only difference I can tell between the ST300 and ST301 blades is that the ST301 blades come packaged in plastic containers rather than cardboard.</li>
            <li> I have used other blades that were too sharp--</li>
            <li> Well-priced, sharp.  </li>
            <li> ,I accepted other reviews for buying this brand also it is what came with my razor handle</li>
            <li> They are &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; blades and not as sharp as those from Feather or others.  </li>
            <li> but they gave me a very harsh shave, red bumps, cuts the works.</li>
            <li> The razor is sharp and cuts extremely well compared to some of the other brands that I have tried in the past, so be careful when using them.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin but a very thick beard.</li>
            <li> Not worth</li>
            <li> Much less bloodshed when I use these.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not entirely true.</li>
            <li> I did not pay 70 some odd dollars in blades for them to be battered in shipping and for some to be missing.</li>
            <li> The critical test for me is 1) very light growth when doing a late afternoon refresher, before a date night and 2) with about two days growth when my stubble gets nasty.</li>
            <li> so i have very thick facial hair</li>
            <li> They keep their edge through quite a few shaves.  </li>
            <li> I had 2 packs missing.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a safety razor to save money and minimize waste in my shaving practices (and because of the aesthetics).</li>
            <li> After having my disposable schick razor change the stupid cartridge shape again trying to force me to fork over 20.00 for a new differently shaped plastic handle</li>
            <li> this is my first bad experience with amazon since I created my account years ago...</li>
            <li> ... but for me these were a little too dull.  </li>
            <li> hypothesis is that these blades are either extremely dull or the edge is uneven.</li>
            <li> Now I usually use it at a 3-5 setting just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But on a business trip I happened to sit next to a Gillette executive and asked him why their blades had become so expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also read rave reviews of Japanese, Feather brand blades and their infamous surgical sharpness.</li>
            <li> I can usually get about 15 shaves per blade</li>
            <li> I know in the store these usually cost about $10.00 for about 7 blades, so you can not beat the price at all.</li>
            <li> Just try this as the price is much better than even the terrible blades at Walmart.</li>
            <li> and if I do it&#x27;s usually do to carelessness on my behalf while shaving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong ordering these blades from an American shipper.</li>
            <li> no more nicks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This blade is extremely dull.</li>
            <li> At this price point, it&#x27;s hard to justify trying to extend the life of a blade when I can just switch them out for about $.08.</li>
            <li> I do have a course beard and usually hard to cut without dulling the blade.</li>
            <li> this is hard to find thank you</li>
            <li> I hardly every experience irritation with these</li>
            <li> Sucks when you expect one thing and get another</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting at least 4 shaves with this 301, which means about 7-8 face shaves.</li>
            <li> I used each type of blade at least 3 separate times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So...does this mean the ST-301 outright bites?</li>
            <li> (I won&#x27;t admit to elderly yet) and my face is still like leather, but that doesn&#x27;t mean i am impervious to pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li> What else can I say, just some very thin sharp blades for the money.</li>
            <li> I tore the hair out of part of my face before changing to a 2nd blade which was every bit as bad.</li>
            <li> After not having used a safety razor for some 40 years I got sick of the multiple blade nonsense not providing that close a shave</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> Indeed, they are one of the least expensive out there.  </li>
            <li> I had to try Feather blades because I read the reviews, but they left me with nasty razor burn and lots of cuts.</li>
            <li> you can never go wrong with those.</li>
            <li> The image and description are both wrong.  </li>
            <li> Horrible shave spend the time and research other blades.</li>
            <li> Dorco blades are made in Korea, a country distinguishing itself for cutting edge products and manufacturing; forgive the pun.</li>
            <li> Nothing crazy,  Just a 1-5 star rating, and a couple of notes jotted on the box about what I thought.  </li>
            <li> the nicks were so bad I had to finish up with the gold Aristocrat with an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; 300 loaded in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades are painful to use.</li>
            <li> Worst blades ever!</li>

            <li> I like them and the price is right !</li>
            <li> These work very well for me, no need to double pass. And 100 should last quite some time. Good razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different types of blades since getting into double edged shaving, and this is by far my favorite. I have curly hair that is prone to being ingrown, as well as sensitive skin. Other brands of razors have given me razor burn which has led to irritation on my face and neck. Ingrown hairs have also been an issue with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dorcos are not the closest shave out there. If you are in the camp that&#x27;s looking for the type of shave that looks and feels baby smooth 18 hours after shaving, this is not the product for you. The strength of this product is the smoothness of this blade against your skin. As a person with a long history of skin issues due to shaving I can honestly say that the Dorcos don&#x27;t cause me any problems whatsoever in terms of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving with the Dorcos every other day, I&#x27;ve noticed that I get a really good shave without it being &#x27;too close&#x27;. If you have sensitive skin, you know what I mean. My razor bumps have for all intents and purposes disappeared, and my skin feels better for it. The irritation has also vanished. I&#x27;ve noticed that my neck which is a big problem area for me has cleared up. For the first time in a long while, my neck actually looks really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pairing these Dorco blades with my Edwin Jagger razor and Aveeno Positively Smooth shave gel, I&#x27;m getting some of the best shaves of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin and/or ingrown hairs, do yourself a favor and give these a try. It may take 4-6 weeks of using these blades exclusively for your skin to heal from your past shaving choices, but afterward you WILL see the difference in a positive way!</li>
            <li> My husband scoured all stores within  30 miles and couldn&#x27;t find them.  Then we finally remembered Amazon and the rest is history. He is now a happy camper:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy R.</li>
            <li> This blade is extremely dull. The first pass dragged a lot and it only got worse from there. I have very thick curly hair and this just wasn&#x27;t sharp enough. Gave a new meaning to the word &amp;#34;face scraper&amp;#34;. I also shave my head (full head of  thick hair) and wouldn&#x27;t even dare to try it at that. Gonna stick with the Astra superior platinums for a nice drag free yet gentle shave all around. If you have hair like mine then this blade is not for you. Would give it 1 star but the price on these is good</li>
            <li> simply, very please with product and price.  Have purchased these blades for years...</li>
            <li> I have used a number of different brands of double edge blades.  These are the best. The quality control is a step above...I have yet to find a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; blade in the bunch (which has happened with some other brands).  They keep their edge through quite a few shaves.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> This razor are good im satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> the only reason I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars is because it only had 80 blades instead of the advertised 100.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because I had good results with the ST-300s that came as free samples with my razor and the price just couldn&#x27;t be beat. So far, they are performing as expected.</li>
            <li> Been working on this pack for over a year. I use one blade per week. sometimes I can get two weeks. They are a good combination of strong and sharp.</li>
            <li> I agree with Adam who wrote the only other one star review of this blade. I am relatively new to wet shaving and have been dutifully going through my sampler pack. I started with Feather because of all the hype and had good shaves. I tried another brand I can&#x27;t recall for my second. My third was Astra and I think I found my \\&quot;perfect blade.\\&quot; After a week or two, I tried these blades and I was only able to shave once. I never went back. The moral of the story is: try lots of blades. The reviewers who liked these blades aren&#x27;t wrong: these blades work for them. Try until you find one you really like. Even though I think Astra is my blade, I&#x27;ll try others because you never know.</li>
            <li> Got these and used them this morning for the 1st time, these things wouldn&#x27;t cut through my beard. I tore the hair out of part of my face before changing to a 2nd blade which was every bit as bad. For what it is worth I have only used Feather blades and the Merkeur that came with my razor. I had to finish shaving with an old Gillette razor. Face has been burning all day.</li>
            <li> I recently switched back to double edge shaving because I was sick of paying $2 to $4 for a cartridge and not getting a great shave. Now I get a fantastic, close, comfortable shave for .08 cents a blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Colonel Conk (sp?) double edge safety razor From Amazon for about $18. The shaver included 5 Dorco blades but I had also ordered a 100 pack of Derby blades so I used the Derby blades for a while before trying the Dorco. What a difference! When I finally tried the Dorco my shave was closer and much more comfortable with no nicks, tug, or razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since purchased a vintage Gillette adjustable razor From Ebay for about $30 and get an even closer shave! The first time I used the adjustable I set it to 9, not knowing that this is the most aggressive setting, and got the closest shave of my life with no cuts or razor burn. Now I usually use it at a 3-5 setting just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these blades. I had to try Feather blades because I read the reviews, but they left me with nasty razor burn and lots of cuts. The Dorco blades give me a quick shave because I am confident that I won&#x27;t get cut so I shave faster.</li>
            <li> Ordered them many times before and they&#x27;re good. If you&#x27;re a barber I recommend these also personna you can never go wrong with those. Both 300T and 301T are good. They say there isn&#x27;t a difference between them but that&#x27;s not entirely true. I went to a store where they had the blue ones which i believe is the 300T and they were in one pack in that pack was 10 carton boxes but each double edge razor was double wrapped with wax paper then regular paper. Now when you get ahold of those they ARE the SHARPEST. No doubt about it. SUPER SHARP!!</li>
            <li> So good, so cheap, so durable. Spent a year testing a broad sampler blade pack and settled on these Dorco blades for my several razors and these consistently gave me 2-3 extra shaves per blade. These South Korean blades are a tremendous value, terrifically consistent and known to be quite sharp (not Feather sharp) but also forgiving. A great choice for a newbie&#x27;s first blade, and the head-shaver set gives them high praise for never cutting their scalp. ST-301s come in plastic packs of 10, each blade wrapped in wax paper and a space for used blades. The only difference in Dorco ST-300 and ST-301 -- according to Dorco -- is the packaging (ST-300s are individually wrapped in plain paper w/ soft outer packaging).</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit my razor.  Therefore the shave is not as smooth..</li>
            <li> Too short to fit in my safety razor. This has never happened before. Return was easy with Amazon.</li>
            <li> These blades come cased in a box of 100, unlike others that have little 10-blade cases individually wrapped in plastic. They shave well, though I must question whether anyone truly needs 100 blades ordered at a time.</li>
            <li> The razors were not the brand shown in photo they were some shark brand. Sucks when you expect one thing and get another</li>
            <li> 5 stars. I tried Feather, Wilkinson Sword and these Dorcos. The Feathers were good, but did seem to lose the edge fairly quick, and not good enough to command a price triple of the Dorcos.....  The Wilkinson&#x27;s seemed scratchy from the first shave. They also were not sharp.The Dorcos were medium sharp and seemed to get smoother after 1-2 shaves. I flip the blade over after 3 shaves, and get 3 more shaves on the other edge.  Excellent blade. I shave with a Feather &amp;#34;Popular&amp;#34; razor.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome...super sharp and clean...</li>
            <li> First shave today with DE Dorco razor and blades Felt like shaving with a dull pocket knife. I still have 129 blades I hope it gets better  Followup review I just read about hand strop your blades 2nd shave no drag on the blade Much better New rate of 3 stars plus</li>
            <li> Good razor, but does&#x27;t last quite as long as other brands.</li>
            <li> i am always use this brand. it is good price and good quality.</li>
            <li> These blades came included with my DE safety razor.  As an included &#x27;freebie&#x27; I wasn&#x27;t prepared to expect much from them as I figured they would be the cheapest of blades.  Indeed, they are one of the least expensive out there.  Imagine my surprise when they not only gave me a great, close shave, but also turned out to be one of the most comfortable, forgiving blades I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is tough and full and my skin is sensitive; the right blades do wonders for my shaving experience, and the wrong blades tend to cut me up, every time.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll warrant that this is due to the overall quality of the blade.  But I&#x27;m just as ready to admit that I can give myself a great shave using a mediocre blade with proper prep, technique, and quality shave cream.  Likewise, I can cut myself to pieces with an excellent blade - even with good technique - if I&#x27;m in a hurry, haven&#x27;t soaked my beard sufficiently, or am being poked by my toddler as I am trying to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Dorco blades give me a consistently good shave, time after time, and last about as long as I think they should:  4 - 5 days, shaving daily.  (1 to 2 passes, depending on how well I&#x27;ve done with the first pass and whether I have a meeting with the boss that day)  That&#x27;s about as long as I&#x27;d expect any blade to last, and for pennies per blade, I&#x27;m not going to gripe over a day or even two.  While these don&#x27;t strike me as the sharpest blades I have used, I&#x27;ve never used more comfortable blades.  They are consistently good from the first shave to the last, and that counts a lot with me.  And closeness?  Accounting for technique and the aggressiveness of my razor, these get as close as any.  Over the course of many blades, I can&#x27;t tell that there is any trade off of closeness for the comfort that these provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line for me is that these blades give me a close, comfortable shave - consistently - with every blade I open.  And the fact that these blades are so cheap?  Bonus!!  Now, shaving is such a subjective thing, and two people can - and do - have totally different experiences with the exact same blade.  So many things come into account:  type of razor used, technique, beard type, skin type, etc., etc.  These blades have impressed this reviewer, though, and because of their consistency and value, I find it easy to give them five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  This review is for the ST300 platinum blades that come 10 per small cardboard pack; the only difference I can tell between the ST300 and ST301 blades is that the ST301 blades come packaged in plastic containers rather than cardboard.a subjective thing, and two people can - and do - have totally different experiences with the exact same blade.

            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to double edged shaving, but I have experimented with several brands of blade and this is easily the best. Much less bloodshed when I use these. Also, the price for 100 from this seller is very good. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great blades at an unreal price, very satisfied</li>
            <li> The number of stars a particular reviewer awards doesn&#x27;t really mean much with razor blades since they&#x27;re such an individual thing. This brand could easily warrant five stars from plenty of people. But for me, these blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough. They seem roughly comparable to Derbys -- noticeably less sharp than Feathers or (more affordably) Astras, which work better for me.</li>
            <li> Great price fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> I have tried probably a dozen other blades over the years and for the price, and my sensitive skin these are what I am sticking with from now on. These are a non aggressive blade that does the job and at a great price. I change my blade every week but know I can go longer if I wanted to.</li>
            <li> After having my disposable schick razor change the stupid cartridge shape again trying to force me to fork over 20.00 for a new differently shaped plastic handle i moved to DE shaving, And I could not be happier! first blades i tried were given by my father Wilkinson Swords. tried them for a while but they gave me a very harsh shave, red bumps, cuts the works. Then i decided to try the free Dorco blades that came with my Weishi butterfly safety razor (great razor holder and CHEAP). the Dorco blades are very sharp and give a smooth shave for many shaves with and against the grain. Im northern european so i have very thick facial hair and it grows fast, Ive never had a closer shave in my life, as i write this i have just gotten off an 8 hour work day and i still look and feel like ive just shaved. I had my father try the dorcos and he agreed. for a even better shave i suggest you use American crew shaving oil instead of shaving cream it will protect and nourish you skin and provide better lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;apparently their is no difference between the ST 300 and ST 301 they are the same blade different packaging. the st 300 are packaged in cardboard no plastic, so from now on i will get the 300 so as to minimize how much plastic i am putting in the landfill.</li>
            <li> After using Personna blades for a while, I decided to switch it up and see what else is available. The Dorco blades are very nice and not too aggressive, which suits me fairly well. If you are looking for something super sharp, then I might recommend looking elsewhere, such as the Feather series. However, if you want something mild, then this is a great choice. I get about 3 quality shaves from each blade, but I don&#x27;t rotate or strop or anything. At this price point, it&#x27;s hard to justify trying to extend the life of a blade when I can just switch them out for about $.08.</li>
            <li> Razor blades are always a definite YMMV. For me I end up with a lot of weepers and a shave that is not very close. I&#x27;ve tried different razors, soaps and brushed.</li>
            <li> blades are very depending on skin and beard type. for me, these do not work very well. does not seem to be as sharp and smooth as some other brands I use. i get more cuts and irritation with these blades vs others. been trying these with different razors and with my Gilette fat boy and slim they do not work well at all but they work good in some older super speed razors etc. in my modern razors not so well so like most brands, they may work differently depending on the razor, trial and error til you find a match that works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin but a very thick beard.</li>
            <li> I tried these in a &#x27;70 Gillette Super Speed and a Lord Tech (L5) and they were absolutely useless. It felt like an Israeli Personna after it was ready to go in the blade bank. Then I tried these in an Edwin Jagger a more aggressive razor and they gave me a pretty good shave in two WTG passes I took out just as much stubble as 3 passes (WTG,XTG,ATG) in the Super Speed, the mildest of the bunch, with an Israeli. I would recommend this blade in an aggressive razor if you still want a mild irritation free shave.</li>
            <li> Yep better not like those others</li>
            <li> Perhaps like me, you finally threw up your hands in disgust one day and said paying Gillette $40 or more for 12 blade cartridges was getting a little out of hand. I see some stores actually have those blade cartridges locked up and need to be retrieved by a clerk! They make a fine product that gives a wonderful shave, of course. But on a business trip I happened to sit next to a Gillette executive and asked him why their blades had become so expensive. He said their product had cost a billion dollars to develop (um, this isn&#x27;t the space shuttle here), but then added only half joking that also it was to pay for his bonuses!  That conversation is what finally pushed me over the edge to explore using a safety razor as my father had done along with the rest of the male shaving world a generation ago.  There&#x27;s a much smaller frame of reference, user wise, to ask opinions of and to get advise, other than online blogs. I followed the advise on one web site, to opt for one of the blade variety packs sold to expose you to different manufacturers and to experience which blades were most comparable to my individual skin, beard and sensitivity.  I&#x27;d also read rave reviews of Japanese, Feather brand blades and their infamous surgical sharpness. I found them amazing blades, but for me they were actually too sharp!  Dorco blades are made in Korea, a country distinguishing itself for cutting edge products and manufacturing; forgive the pun. They proved to be the sweet spot between the ideal sharpness, good longevity and durability, and excellent pricing. They cost about $ .06 a blade as opposed to Gillette&#x27;s $3 plus each! The correct formula of which handle, which shave cream etc. still took some experimentation. But these Dorco blades are the cornerstone for me. I occasionally pop in a Feather blade to reaffirm my commitment to Dorco and inevitably my face looks like I&#x27;d been in some unsavory back alley knife fight with a gang of assailants. It&#x27;s still good advise for anyone starting with a safety razor to buy one of those variety bundles of blades. For me though, I cannot recommend these blades highly enough. As close and safe a shave as Gillette at one fiftieth the cost!ing with a safety razor to buy one of those variety bundles of blades. For me though, I cannot recommend these blades highly enough. As close and safe a shave as Gillette at one fiftieth the cost!</li>
            <li> I get one good shave out of these blades. At about 7 cents a piece they are still cheaper than using a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> I love Dorco blades and have been using the ST-301&#x27;s for a few years now, but beware if purchasing this item.  What I received from the vendor TotalElements was not the dispenser packs of ST-301 blades, but cardboard boxes of ST-300 blades.  The image and description are both wrong.  While the blades are supposed to be \\&quot;identical\\&quot;, I really do not believe that to be the case, from my own experience.  Also, I chose these to get the dispenser packs, so that I can use them to put used blades in.  The ST-300&#x27;s are available for a few bucks less from other vendors if that IS what you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still rate them 4 stars, since they are still good blades, but upset that they are not what I ordered, and that I wasn&#x27;t given an opportunity to provide vendor feedback.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are inexpensive and strike the right balance of sharpness.  I have used other blades that were too sharp--the Feather Razor Blades comes to mind--and others that were too dull--Astra Blades here--but these seem to be just right.  Of course, there is always a period of adjustment to your beard, but overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long argued that choosing a DE blade is extremely personal - to the point that I take the gaggle of reviews I read, here and elsewhere, with a necessary pinch of salt. So many guys swear by Feather blades, but try as I might, they don&#x27;t do it for me - I find them aggressive as Hades, no matter my prep nor light touch in use. Really, it&#x27;s a horses-for-courses thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorco is another golden example. Lots of people here slag the ST-300 almost six ways to Sunday. Me? They&#x27;ve been my go-to blade going on a decade, with only the no-longer-available (AFAIK) Israeli &amp;#34;no-name&amp;#34; Personnas for an alternate. Many of those trashing the 300 point to the 301 as the better blade, and not by a small margin. I finally managed to snag a pack of them some months back, figuring, hey, if the 300s are so good, these could be better, which of course would be amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, no. As I mentioned in my review of the ST-300, my shave routine is what I call 2-1/2-pass (WTG/ATG for face/neck/chin, XTG for neck only). The kindest thing I can say about the 301 is that it&#x27;s pretty good WTG, just okay XTG, but extremely dodgy ATG, pulling and nicking worse than I recall Feathers doing. The 300 almost never does this, using either my gold Gillette Aristocrat or my &#x27;72 Super Adjustable. (My silver &amp;#34;Brit-ocrat&amp;#34; is a tad rougher, which I chalk up to a more aggressive blade gap than the American &#x27;crat.) I just tried a 301 in the SA one more time (about the 7th time now) to see if there was some way to make the blades behave, but no dice - the nicks were so bad I had to finish up with the gold Aristocrat with an &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; 300 loaded in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...does this mean the ST-301 outright bites? No. I can see it working for others, and indeed others here have said as much, and I believe them. But the 300 is light-years ahead when it comes to pampering *my* face, and that&#x27;s really all that counts here. And I&#x27;m now just into my second box of of ten-packs, so it&#x27;ll be a while before I have to stock up again. Read the reviews, but grab a sample-pack to be sure. Aloha.l be a while before I have to stock up again. Read the reviews, but grab a sample-pack to be sure. Aloha.</li>
            <li> Yo-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried my first Dorco 301 blade today - it was a good shave - not a great shave.  Smooth and reasonably clearing the whiskers - but not in the same league with the Gillette Silver Blue, Wilkinson and Feather blades all of which give great shaves-eh!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understand that I have a heavy dark beard and it demands a really good blade - a friend of mine has a much lighter beard and loves them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price for this quality of blade.</li>
            <li> good to shave at a low cost again. not bad getting used too single edge razors,after a week no big deal.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used, sharp &amp; smooth for a super close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Great razors....glad I switched from Mach 3</li>
            <li> These blades are excellent and very smooth, well worth the money. Great blades for a price.</li>
            <li> The package shown is for the ST-301, their newest platinum blade which is terrific. When you order it, they send you the ST-300, their old stainless steel model! Order the blades, but from someone else!</li>
            <li> Great value and super sharp blades. What else can I say, just some very thin sharp blades for the money.</li>
            <li> Great blades.  Nice and sharp.  I now have enough blades to shave for two or three years.  Each blade lasts about two or three weeks.</li>
            <li> Good price, as good most others.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better price and the quality is perfect oft for me. I do have a course beard and usually hard to cut without dulling the blade. I have no problem with these blades. I can usually get about 15 shaves per blade and I bought 2 boxes of them so do the math. I know in the store these usually cost about $10.00 for about 7 blades, so you can not beat the price at all.</li>
            <li> This brand works great for me, better than the all famed Feather blades.  Different brands work different for everyone.  Just try this as the price is much better than even the terrible blades at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and with a very reasonable price.  I use these for hair cutting and they hold their edge and work great.</li>
            <li> The price, quality, and shipping speed can not be beat. I have used Feather blades, Darby, 7 Oclock, wilkerson. These are the best I have found, and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> These blades perfect but would only use 4x before tossing out.</li>
            <li> I,m new to DE shaving so over my first three months I tried several blades.  After giving all blades a fair trial I found these blades to be the most consistent, which helped me learn better technique for my medium beard and fair skin.  Once I switched to Cremo shave cream I found the best combination for my face.  The critical test for me is 1) very light growth when doing a late afternoon refresher, before a date night and 2) with about two days growth when my stubble gets nasty. The blades worked very well in both situations, especially with the Cremo shave cream.  Cremo is unique as I shave once with and once against the grain.  With Cremo, once I made the first pass all I had to do was re-wet and rub for the second pass and the second pass proved as smooth and effortless as the first.  Best of luck to all DE shavers!  I find this to be a very satisfying way to shave, thanks to the comments from all of you.</li>
            <li> I use  these blades in my most aggressive razors (4 open combs and a slant). The combination of this mild forgiving blade with an aggressive razor is like magic. Wonderfully close nick free shaves.</li>
            <li> Missid 10 cases of blade!</li>
            <li> Great blades fast shipping!! A+</li>
            <li> Good quality, nice edge for the money very good. The edge holds well after several uses.  Comes boxed and each 10 blades are wrapped in paper inside a plastic case good for disposal of the used blades.</li>
            <li> Good Quality Sharp Blades it served its purpose you can not find these blades in a lot of stores maybe in hardware stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good blade for someone starting out in double edge shaving. I got 12 blades included in the Micro Touch razor kit that that my wife gave to me as a gift.They are a very mild blade, and give a nice gentle shave They  don&#x27;t work for me as well as other brands like Wilkinson Sword, but they may work better for some people. I shaved a short while ago with one, and found that it left some stubble that I just could not pick up, even after repeated strokes. I wet shave with soap and brush, by the way. I put a CVS brand blade, which was made in Israel, into the same razor, and with one stroke, I had picked up the leftover stubble. Dorco blades may work well for some types of beards, but I guess that I need a sharper brand.</li>
            <li> I just used one these yesterday. Vision 2000.  One of the better blades. Close to a Wilkinson. Not as good as a  silver blue. Much better than the dorco 300.</li>
            <li> I have used the same blade for one month now, and I have no complaints. These things work so well!</li>
            <li> My background: I&#x27;m a shaver of head and face for about 5 years. I&#x27;ve used Astra SP, Shark, Gillette Silver Blue, and others. First, I used this in a Gillette Super Speed. It shaved well. Then I tried it in a Gillette Fat Boy on a 5 or 6 setting and found it to be even smoother. I&#x27;m getting at least 4 shaves with this 301, which means about 7-8 face shaves. Your mileage may vary, of course. I&#x27;ve read the mixed reviews for the ST300 and perhaps it is because they don&#x27;t have the platinum. The plastic holder with 10 blades that accepts your used ones is a nice touch, too. This blade is sold all over the place; check for good deals.</li>
            <li> Cheap price, good blades. Get about 3 shaves a blade. At 10 cents a blade Im not complaining. Nice packaging. A good inexpensive blade. I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
            <li> OK  when you get using single blade.</li>
            <li> I love it my husband love it this is hard to find thank you now I know where to buy it from</li>
            <li> great value, works as good as blades 10 times the price.</li>
            <li> I have always ordered these blades and I love them</li>
            <li> When I went back to safety razors a couple of years ago, I tried MANY different blades.  By my count, 18 different kinds of blades.  I used each type of blade at least 3 separate times.  Not shaving 3 times, but using 3 new blades at different times, and kept notes on the performance.  Nothing crazy,  Just a 1-5 star rating, and a couple of notes jotted on the box about what I thought.  And these are the ones I kept going back to.  Well-priced, sharp.  No pulling or tugging.  I tried platinum-coated blades, numerous other brandname blades, but these have provided the easiest and most consistent shave.  I tend to only shave about every 3 or 4 days, and while I don&#x27;t have a particularly heavy beard, these work exceptionally well for me along with glycerin soap, a shaving brush, and decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I usually have great consistancy with this seller. This package is advertised with 100 razors. I recieved 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. A money saver. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great and cheap.  Def the way to go.</li>
            <li> great deal this will last a longtime for me and compared to cost for these at the store this is so much cheaper and as far as the way they shave I haven&#x27;t used yet,I accepted other reviews for buying this brand also it is what came with my razor handle</li>
            <li> Great price and got them on time.</li>
            <li> If you are coming to double-edge blades from a multi-blade system, this blade will allow you to shave in much the same fashion as you are used to--pressing against the face without too much worry of cutting yourself.  Among double-edge blades, Dorco has a reputation for being mild and forgiving (by those who like them) and dull (by those who don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my adult sons swears by these, since he sliced himself to ribbons with the other blades he tried.  So I tried them.  I was shocked (in a good way) at how mild it was--but then, I had to adjust my technique to get a smooth shave (which I got, but only with some effort--and some mild abrasion on my face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razor blades all have their own tradeoffs between sharpness, smoothness, durability, consistency and price.  Pick your poison:  cuts, razor burn, time, money.  You will have to assess your technique, your beard, your skin, and your pocketbook.  But you will want a blade that is the same each time you load one in your razor (or you will get that very unwelcome poison: surprise).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found each blade was consistent, so if you like one, you will like them all.  But I prefer the balance struck by Wilkinson.  A bit sharper (so a bit more dangerous), but still forgiving enough for me, and always consistent.  And their durability means I am willing to pay double what these Dorcos cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, if you prefer not having to re-learn to shave after years with a multi-blade system, or if you are happy with Dorco&#x27;s sharpness/smoothness/durability/price tradeoffs, this blade will serve you well.  You will get the mildness it promises, blade after blade, at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> My husband thought it a great idea as he use to have one.  Not worth the money- cut everything but the whiskers.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, these blades weren&#x27;t a good value.  They cut just fine, but leave a razor burn that reminds me of a cheap disposable.  And didn&#x27;t do so great against the thicker parts of my beard either.  Second shave was the same, razor burn feeling with only 1 pass done, and didn&#x27;t even atttempt to shave the rough parts since it was a weekend shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say Derby is a better value than these.  Same price basically, but much much smoother shave, razor burn free.  I got these for comparison sake, and just didn&#x27;t like.  You may like them.  Me, I&#x27;ll try them from time to time, but going to stick with Derby.</li>
            <li> Worst blades ever! Horrible shave spend the time and research other blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money to send these back since I would have to pay to ship them back.  I&#x27;ll just use them until they are gone and buy a better blade like Feather.</li>
            <li> These are not the Dorco 301 pictured. I received a dispenser pack of Dorco 300. These are not the same blades but because these are an Add On Item they ca not be returned!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> these razors work perfect for my face.  I have tried many other brands and so fat these are the best for me.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Use these Dorco Blades at the Shop..only ones I use!! Service was great, and I got my order 3days earlier than expected!! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> They are sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> These blades never leave my skin with razor burn like most others. I hardly every experience irritation with these and if I do it&#x27;s usually do to carelessness on my behalf while shaving.</li>
            <li> Blades are a personal choice.  I like these.  They are &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; blades and not as sharp as those from Feather or others.  The sharper blades cut me up.  I also like that the plastic containers have a slot for used blades.  Very handy.</li>
            <li> When I was a young man and joined the military, back in the stone age; during boot training I developed the habit of shaving without lotion and at times without water in order to save time or to touch up before an inspection. I&#x27;m middle age now (I won&#x27;t admit to elderly yet) and my face is still like leather, but that doesn&#x27;t mean i am impervious to pain or discomfort. I appreciate a smooth and comfortable shave. These blades were chosen after trying out an assortment of 10 manufacturers and keeping notes on comfort and longevity. Dorco blades combined with my father&#x27;s old adjustable safety razor leave my face smooth and comfortable without a blood sacrifice to the shaving gods.</li>
            <li> I use these to shave in the shower. It is a great blade for my face and razor. I have converted from the blue 300 to these 301&#x27;s.  A great everyday razor that won&#x27;t tear me up in my daily shower/shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d call this a decent, middle of the road blade.  I&#x27;m giving it four stars primarily because it is cheap and consistent.  I would say these are similar to the Derbys but not quite as good.  They don&#x27;t cut as well as Astras or Rapiras, and of course, much worse than Feathers, but they are also very forgiving.  If you need to go over problem areas, you can do so without much irritation or fear of being cut.  I don&#x27;t think these are suitable for people with heavy beard growth and very hard to cut hair, although some have found they can make them work.  I think these are better for those with lighter facial hair (matching the Dorcos&#x27; primary target -- East Asia), less than two days growth, or for beginners.  As long as you know what you are buying, these are a great value for the money, especially when bought on sale in bulk.  But for me, the Derbys are better when I want forgiving blades, and the Astras and Rapiras are sharper and more efficient.  The Shark Stainless Steel seems like an ideal compromise with decent sharpness and good smoothness, while staying low priced.  If you don&#x27;t like any of these, you might try a Personna Blue before going up to the premium priced blades like Feathers or 7 O&#x27;Clock Black.</li>
            <li> ... but for me these were a little too dull.  They didn&#x27;t shave as cleanly as some other DE blades.  For comparison my favorite blades are Derby&#x27;s, then the red IP&#x27;s, and finally if I&#x27;m feeling froggy... Feathers.  Dorcos are inexpensive but they just don&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> perfect-- thx to all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-22-17  I still have 2 packs left 2 1/2 years later. Money saved over $500. I will not go back to the 3,4,5 blade razors. Man-up, get in the grove, and you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> These blades are an incredibly value at about 8Â¢ a piece. Blades do not work universally well on different people&#x27;s faces, but this blade works incredibly well on mine. They give me a smooth comfortable shave with no irritation. I would recommend that people who shave with a safety razor give these a try because if they work well for you you can shave inexpensively for the rest of your life!</li>
            <li> I have a hair salon with several stylist and none of them have give me a complain about the razor blade. I just purchased 400 more.</li>
            <li> It was fast and I got what I want it! I was worry it will take more time to arrived but I got right on time!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong ordering these blades from an American shipper. This was the first time to shave with Dorco and so far they have been great. I don&#x27;t know if consistency  will be there but so far I have gotten a very good shave every time and at a cost of only .06 cents per blade and about a penny per shave. WOW. The shipper was quick to ship also.</li>
            <li> not the top of the line but the&#x27;re still sharp!!</li>
            <li> Changed back to old school single edged blade after shopping disposables for years trying to save $$. These blades are fantastic. Smoothest, closest shave in years. Sometimes newer and more are not better!</li>
            <li> Good price and quality!!</li>
            <li> Obvious knockoffs, packaging and model number not right, not very sharp</li>
            <li> Comfortable, close blade, lasts two to three shaves, which is solid for me, and at less than $.10 per blade, it&#x27;s a bargain</li>
            <li> These blades are painful to use. Even when my stubble is one day old.  It tugs at my hairs pulling them, even with brand newblade.  I&#x27;m throwing them away and going with feather. Much smoother and no pain.</li>
            <li> Best way to shave, very cheap and does a good job. Way better then any multi blade shaving systems and you keep more money in your pocket.</li>
            <li> Of course, all blades will depend on one&#x27;s skin, technique, and beard. What works for one person will carve another guy&#x27;s face to shreds (Merkur does that to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorcos are the best blades I&#x27;ve found for my face and beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t go by my word - buy a sampler pack of many brands, and experiment. It&#x27;s the only real way to know.</li>
            <li> Great Price. Great Product. Would buy again and tell others about them. A lot cheaper than if you buy them in a retail store.&lt;br /&gt;Chuck Lacey Vancouver WA.</li>
            <li> My brother is a barber and he uses these razors exclusively. I personally use these at home to sharpen up my beard. The razor is sharp and cuts extremely well compared to some of the other brands that I have tried in the past, so be careful when using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into my second blade now and so far I really like them. I&#x27;ve not had any nicks except for my own negligence. They cut well and I prefer them to the dorco ST300.</li>
            <li> Tried the blades for a month...not satisfied at all!  Not a clean shave, multiple nicks.  Going back to old &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; priced blades.  Safer and a better shave.</li>
            <li> I enjoy spending so much less with these blades than spending a fortune on the disposable types. In comparison, these do just as good if not better.  Save money while keeping a smooth face. :-)</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a great shave with these razors... But then I tried the Astra SP&#x27;s which are leaps and bounds better than the Dorcos... But these blades still give me a good shave. On a scale of 1-10 10 being the best. The Dorcos are a solid 6.5 the Astra&#x27;s are a 9.5 - 10. Either way the Dorcos are a good training blade. Pretty forgiving and not super harsh.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest I&#x27;ve found anywhere.  at school, they said these were WAY better than the derby ones that came with my blade.  Nyce!</li>
            <li> I love these blades they are the best, when I received my package I had 2 packs missing. Smh this is my first bad experience with amazon since I created my account years ago...</li>
            <li> After not having used a safety razor for some 40 years I got sick of the multiple blade nonsense not providing that close a shave so I decided to go old school, using old timey double edged razor blades with a safety razor and using a shaving brush with a shaving mug of proper shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUCCESS.  These are excellent razor blades, consistent in sharpness and providing an effective shave.  (And I have not yet nicked myself.)  The luxury of the old fashioned shave is not to be underestimated.  I did not know they even made these for shaving (I have used them to scrape paint off windows) and am pleased to find these still available.  AND at a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor was very prompt with the delivery also, all around a very positive experience for me.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t used these yet.  Still using the blades that came with his new razor.</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a safety razor to save money and minimize waste in my shaving practices (and because of the aesthetics). The 100 pack of Dorco ST-301 blades had one of the lowest cost price points. Before I bought the Dorco blades I was using a 10 pack of Merkur, and then a 100 pack of Personna Super + Platinum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few shaves with the ST-301s, I noticed I was getting nicked when I hadn&#x27;t normally. I have fairly challenging grains, which I think makes it more likely to get nicked, trying to get the closest shave. In my frugalness, I continued using these blades until the last 10 pack, when I decided &amp;#34;F it&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s not worth the savings of a few dollars. Plus the name is emasculate. I ordered a 100 pack of the Astra and I&#x27;m back in business - no more nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hypothesis is that these blades are either extremely dull or the edge is uneven. Either way, I think this is another case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very nice  not the best that I have used but pretty good</li>
            <li> Great deal for the money!!!  Ill buy more when i run out!!!  Good cheap blades.  Good for people that cant use the sharpest blades. Theyre sharp enough, but not like Feather and Kai.&lt;br /&gt;I get smooth shaves with these, and no irritation, and i get just as much hair shaved as any other blade ive tried.</li>
            <li> Pretty good blade. Not Super, but pretty darn good. Great price, too.</li>
            <li> Great price -- Great Service !!!</li>
            <li> Yes I received all my Razor Blades and they did meet my exceptations</li>
            <li> These blades were exactly as described, great price, extremely fast shipping. Despite what you may read, if you &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t&amp;#34; shave with a double edge razor/blade, you&#x27;re wasting your money!!!</li>
            <li> Best barber razors ever!!!</li>
            <li> Good everyday blades and a bargain to boot! Will buy more as needed........</li>
            <li> The dorco blades are sharp for 2-3 shaves but do not give as many shaves as some others However with the price being so low, I can afford to use more blades I would recommend them, Just remember ,you may not get as many shaves as with Lord  or Sharps</li>
            <li> I got cheated out of 20 blades.  I only got 80 of the 100 I paid for!!!!  I hope whoever stole the other 20 blades get some good use out of them.</li>
            <li> Great blade for beginners.  Anyone new to DE wet shaving should start with these blades and I recommend anyone learning to use a shavette start with the Dorcos.  It&#x27;s forgiving where others like Feather are not when using a shavette.</li>
            <li> A must buy it never fails. Always works perfect.</li>
            <li> I am not as particular about my blades as others that write reviews.  Having said that, these blades have been as good or better than the other I have tried in the &amp;#34;sample packs&amp;#34; that I have gotten to try out various brands.  The best part is that as good as they are, they are also among the least expensive.  I am very happy with these and will be ordering more of the same when this supply runs down.</li>
            <li> Had these for a while and still haven&#x27;t went through the fist box of 10 and I have a pretty thick beard...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again when I run out in about 10 years :)</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to any babar .... got to me really quickly and im going to continue to buy these, much cheaper here</li>
            <li> I decided to try these blades out just because, why not?  It&#x27;s a pretty cheap price for 100 blades.  They seem to work pretty good for the first few shaves.  They aren&#x27;t the sharpest blades.  I typically change the blade out after 3 or 4 shaves since they tend to get dull fast.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy these again, but I&#x27;m still using them because I have plenty left.</li>
            <li> awesome price great deal</li>
            <li> Good &amp; cheap!  I use Feather blades when I have some growth to remove, but they&#x27;re too sharp -- on only a day of beard, they cut me up.  Dorco is perfect for daily use, and I can use a fresh blade every day for the price of a typical 5-blade cartridge.</li>
            <li> A good close shave. Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Recently I ordered 6 packs of these razors, when I received them in the mail there was loose cartridges all in the box all dismembered and was actually short one... I did not pay 70 some odd dollars in blades for them to be battered in shipping and for some to be missing.</li>
            <li> I really like these blades.  I travel a lot and generally use a blade only once because I haven&#x27;t found a good way to temporarily store a used blade in my toiletries bag.  These are great for the first shave.  They aren&#x27;t as good for the third or fourth shave, but that&#x27;s OK given the price and how I use them.</li>
