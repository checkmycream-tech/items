            <li>I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>I got amazing results and for a great price!  </li>
            <li>Now I know why they put that note in the package begging me to give them a good review</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased by the product&#x27;s performance at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just put my feet up and enjoyed.  </li>
            <li>My feet were the perfect specimen to use for something like this, and I was looking forward to ordering more packs and keeping them on hand for future use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad  </li>
            <li>I probably could use another to make them perfect, but I only bought two packages.  </li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with how this product works and will purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>but I tried not to (okay, just a couple</li>
            <li>The effect was amazing - though it took ~2weeks, but my feet were so smooth.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to fit into these booties.</li>
            <li>honestly, what a great excuse to watch a 90 minute Netflix movie, read, or take a nap.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Came as promised with good clear directions - worked as promised!</li>
            <li>The plastic booties feel cool and comfortable on my feet and they do the job</li>
            <li>I wanted this for a while and glad to find it cheap that really works.</li>
            <li>It was kind of funny really....</li>
            <li>It took a full five days for things to happen for me.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to soak your feet every night, it really helps.</li>
            <li>This gave a nice tight fit and I was able to walk around.  </li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone who wants to try out for cheap price.</li>
            <li>My feet were in OK shape for early Spring.  </li>
            <li>My feet feel much better; some really stubborn callouses will probably take another treatment, but I&#x27;d rather err on the side of too gentle.  </li>
            <li>The peeling process is unsightly, but it is oddly satisfying to look down and see that more peeling has occurred throughout the day.</li>
            <li>After shower my feet were showing more of new red-pink skin that is soft as baby!</li>
            <li>First time I used Purederm Exfoliation Foot Mask</li>
            <li>I just ordered several more packs to get me through the summer, using once a month.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work...</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like nail polish remover but not too strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing, even after I did everything exactly right.</li>
            <li>and I saw my skin on feet started to look whiter and more dry.</li>
            <li>That product was a bit pricey for an experiment, so I purchased this one, figuring I wasn&#x27;t out too much if nothing happened.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t cost me much, but I feel as if I was scammed.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very alcohol-ish but my skin worked well with it.</li>
            <li>The product did cause the skin to peal but not as much as I was hoping.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t pick too much, you might pull off healthy skin that hasnt had a chance to detach from the dead skin.</li>
            <li>The little plastic booties are cute, with feet stamped all over them.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you do not plan to wear your feet out, because dead skin peels off for about a week.  </li>
            <li>Then, on Thursday night, WOW!  </li>
            <li>I let my feet soak in a hot shower prior to application, applied the foot mask and slipped some bootie type slippers over.  </li>
            <li>Wow, did it ever work.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will choose the real deal and buy Baby Foot.</li>
            <li>I found it strange that in my package, there was a typed note practically begging me to give them  a high rating.</li>
            <li>I could have spent the 90 minutes soaking my feet in pure rubbing alcohol,and gotten the same non results.   </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready to wear sandals, in other words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have hard skin on my heels and when it cracks in winter it really hurts to peel.</li>
            <li> If  something happens over the next few days, I will  come back and tell my tale....</li>
            <li> does not live up to promise</li>
            <li> My toenails turned white, but not in a scary way, and my feet felt smoother, but there was no dramatic shedding or flaking.  </li>
            <li> I did not get the results I expected or wanted.  </li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of my time, money, and it was uncomfortable to have such dry feet for so long.   </li>
            <li> Well..... I did everything  according to the directions, along with the  ideas of other reviewers, and nothing has happened....</li>
            <li> Waste of time and, thankfully, only  little money.</li>
            <li> This worked on the slightly hard spots on my feet, but only helped on the heels when they where wet and</li>
            <li> The skin on the soles of my feet looked a little weird, but exactly like the picture on the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I sat down with it on a Saturday.  </li>
            <li> Then the next day when I was taking shower, I felt squishy crumble on under my feet, they were my dead skin!!</li>
            <li> My feet started peeling in less than a week.</li>
            <li> one size fits all not true</li>
            <li> I  washed and soaked my feet for a little while before putting the booties on, then put them on and kept them on for 1 1/2 hours, then washed my feet.</li>
            <li> It helped a little when I started soaking my feet every night.</li>
            <li> There were limited English instructions, so I may have done something wrong.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the time, I rinsed and dried.  </li>
            <li> Just give it a few days.  </li>
            <li> All my dead skin came off after a week or so.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wet but not drippy, and though the booties were a bit awkward to maneuver, there&#x27;s no possibility of anything splashing outside the booties.</li>
            <li> After about four days my feet were shedding skin like crazy and are now baby soft!  </li>
            <li> I rubbed them hard with the towel.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t sting at all--just felt cold the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered another set after a corn on my small toe painlessly peeled off!  </li>
            <li> but right now, I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My feet were not in really bad shape because I don&#x27;t walk barefoot often and I wear socks daily.</li>
            <li> that my feet are extremely dry, and uncomfortable my callouses are rough and awful, and nothing has happened.</li>
            <li> scary.</li>
            <li> I had some callouses and rough places on my heels, and several of those nasty flakey places you don&#x27;t feel, but look awful.  </li>
            <li> The stuff felt a bit cold, but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> My heels are really bad with cracks in them.  </li>
            <li> So, I had to use it twice to get rid of my really bad calloused heels.  </li>

            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work well for you, give it another try.  First time I used Purederm Exfoliation Foot Mask it did a so-so job.  I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, after all my feet didn&#x27;t get callused overnight.  I waited about 6 weeks and gave it another go.  Wow, did it ever work.  My kids were totally grossed-out by my molting skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of foot masques until I was looking for something else and came across reviews for Baby Feet.  That product was a bit pricey for an experiment, so I purchased this one, figuring I wasn&#x27;t out too much if nothing happened.  My feet were in OK shape for early Spring.  I had some callouses and rough places on my heels, and several of those nasty flakey places you don&#x27;t feel, but look awful.  I wasn&#x27;t ready to wear sandals, in other words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat down with it on a Saturday.  The little plastic booties are cute, with feet stamped all over them.  There&#x27;s a fabric/paper insert that&#x27;s soaked in the product.  It&#x27;s wet but not drippy, and though the booties were a bit awkward to maneuver, there&#x27;s no possibility of anything splashing outside the booties. The stuff felt a bit cold, but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant.  It didn&#x27;t sting at all--just felt cold the entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and wore the booties for 90 minutes.  I suppose you could rig something up so you could walk around, but honestly, what a great excuse to watch a 90 minute Netflix movie, read, or take a nap.  I just put my feet up and enjoyed.  At the end of the time, I rinsed and dried.  The skin on the soles of my feet looked a little weird, but exactly like the picture on the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing much happened over the next few days.  My toenails turned white, but not in a scary way, and my feet felt smoother, but there was no dramatic shedding or flaking.  Then, on Thursday night, WOW!  Without going into the TMI realm, let&#x27;s just say this product works!  I just ordered several more packs to get me through the summer, using once a month.  My feet feel much better; some really stubborn callouses will probably take another treatment, but I&#x27;d rather err on the side of too gentle.  I&#x27;m very pleased by the product&#x27;s performance at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be patient.  It took a full five days for things to happen for me.  YMMV.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed! The plastic booties feel cool and comfortable on my feet and they do the job well! I kept them on for 1.5 hours and then soaked my feet on a daily basis afterward. My feet started peeling in less than a week. I plan on using this foot mask on a regular basis. NOTE: My shoe size is women&#x27;s 12 US and I&#x27;m able to fit into these booties.</li>
            <li> Well..... I did everything  according to the directions, along with the  ideas of other reviewers, and nothing has happened.... except  that my feet are extremely dry, and uncomfortable my callouses are rough and awful, and nothing has happened. I  washed and soaked my feet for a little while before putting the booties on, then put them on and kept them on for 1 1/2 hours, then washed my feet. I have soaked my feet every night, nothing. I found it strange that in my package, there was a typed note practically begging me to give them  a high rating. It was kind of funny really....now why would they do that???  Anyways, its been 5 days and nothing.  My feet were the perfect specimen to use for something like this, and I was looking forward to ordering more packs and keeping them on hand for future use. I&#x27;m just glad  it didn&#x27;t cost me much, but I feel as if I was scammed. If  something happens over the next few days, I will  come back and tell my tale.... but right now, I&#x27;m very disappointed.  Update... 7 days and still nothing  This did absolutely nothing, even after I did everything exactly right. Now I know why they put that note in the package begging me to give them a good review, they know it doesn&#x27;t work.  Well, that&#x27;s what I get for choosing to save money by buying a knock off brand. Next time I will choose the real deal and buy Baby Foot. The ingredients are not the same at all, which is why it probably didn&#x27;t work. This was a complete waste of my time, money, and it was uncomfortable to have such dry feet for so long.   I could have spent the 90 minutes soaking my feet in pure rubbing alcohol,and gotten the same non results.   I would never tell anyone to buy this.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Just give it a few days.  Works even on hyperkeratosis.</li>
            <li> This product works as descriped.  I ordered another set after a corn on my small toe painlessly peeled off!  Make sure you do not plan to wear your feet out, because dead skin peels off for about a week.  My feet were not in really bad shape because I don&#x27;t walk barefoot often and I wear socks daily.</li>
            <li> Loved it. All my dead skin came off after a week or so. The smell is very alcohol-ish but my skin worked well with it.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work...just give it time!  I got amazing results and for a great price!  I let my feet soak in a hot shower prior to application, applied the foot mask and slipped some bootie type slippers over.  This gave a nice tight fit and I was able to walk around.  After about four days my feet were shedding skin like crazy and are now baby soft!  Iwill be ordering agian!</li>
            <li> Waste of time and, thankfully, only  little money.</li>
            <li> It works, guys. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying it, I say go for it. Just be sure to soak your feet every night, it really helps. And don&#x27;t pick too much, you might pull off healthy skin that hasnt had a chance to detach from the dead skin.</li>
            <li> The product did cause the skin to peal but not as much as I was hoping.  Perhaps additional applications will be necessary.</li>
            <li> My heels are really bad with cracks in them.  So, I had to use it twice to get rid of my really bad calloused heels.  I probably could use another to make them perfect, but I only bought two packages.  I am totally pleased with how this product works and will purchase it again.  The peeling process is unsightly, but it is oddly satisfying to look down and see that more peeling has occurred throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It works. I have hard skin on my heels and when it cracks in winter it really hurts to peel. I wanted this for a while and glad to find it cheap that really works. Fast shipping too. It was easy to apply. Smells exactly like nail polish remover but not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;So! A week later I noticed white stuff on my shoes and I saw my skin on feet started to look whiter and more dry. I could peel if I wanted to at that time but I tried not to (okay, just a couple but that&#x27;s it). Then the next day when I was taking shower, I felt squishy crumble on under my feet, they were my dead skin!! scary. After shower my feet were showing more of new red-pink skin that is soft as baby! I recommend to anyone who wants to try out for cheap price.</li>
            <li> I read a review and decided to try it. The effect was amazing - though it took ~2weeks, but my feet were so smooth.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to spend the money, buy the Baby Foot.  This worked on the slightly hard spots on my feet, but only helped on the heels when they where wet and I rubbed them hard with the towel.</li>
            <li> I were size 12....one size fits all not true</li>
            <li> This did exfoliate my feet, but it has taken about a month for the peeling to be completed.  There were limited English instructions, so I may have done something wrong.  It helped a little when I started soaking my feet every night.</li>
            <li> I did not get the results I expected or wanted.  does not live up to promise</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> Came as promised with good clear directions - worked as promised!</li>
    </ol>
