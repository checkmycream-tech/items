            <li>Speedy delivery product was perfect-</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Good ole fashion soap good moisture too.</li>
            <li>Favorite smelling soap!</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of this body wash!</li>
            <li>I grew up with Ivory bar soap and it&#x27;s nice to have a convenient shower gel form.</li>
            <li>Whoever in this company that got the great idea of messing with this wonderful product blew it big time!!  </li>
            <li>, I really liked the way it lathered.</li>
            <li>My wife has used this for many years and we purchased this JUST IN CASE they stop making Ivory products.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite soap</li>
            <li>glad I can find it here.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>but I thought it would be better.  </li>
            <li>This is the OLD bodywash that was light and smelt great.  </li>
            <li>but they are full to the top.</li>
            <li>I am not sure why they had to change a best seller that I loved but now after 50 years I am looking for a new company.</li>
            <li>The scent is not the original Ivory bar soap scent, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, but it is very fresh.</li>
            <li>I prefer clean, soapy, or even fresh perfume type of fragrances.</li>
            <li>Not the real product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the ripoff.</li>
            <li>and I managed to wash my whole body.</li>
            <li>Being a cancer survivor has significantly increased my awareness of the massive amounts of chemicals we are exposed to continually.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super lathery (is that even a word?) and gentle enough on my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is not the same soft clean scent.  </li>
            <li>If you like the NEW &amp;#34;Pure and Simple&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>I wanted the old formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve moved away from body wash in recent years because all the affordable washes on the market have become very food-scented.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find in stores,</li>
            <li>Has a fresh, clean scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm and the bottles last a long time because you only need a small amount to lather.  </li>

            <li> I wish I looked closer at the size of the bottles.. they are half the size I normally get.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ivory is the only brand which is gentle to my skin without making me feel slick with moisture after my shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not into smelling like vanilla or coconut or berries or for crying out loud, now there&#x27;s a yogurt one?</li>
            <li> Ivory has ruined my trust with their new &#x27;Original&#x27;, which stinks and has some harsh chemical in it.  </li>
            <li> Smaller bottles than I had previously purchased</li>
            <li> The new bodywash is very thick, comes out like toothpaste and has a chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> I used slightly less than an ounce</li>
            <li> I never get sick of this scent or how clean it makes me feel.</li>
            <li> The only reason i&#x27;m not using it again and leaving it for my mom to use, is that just like Irish Spring, something in this body wash makes me sneeze and snot up like crazy.</li>
            <li> Fake.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this doesn&#x27;t smell like the Ivory bar soap I remember as a kid.</li>
            <li> It is instead a terrible chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it leaves your skin with an awful residue.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I wish I looked closer at the size of the bottles.. they are half the size I normally get.&lt;br /&gt;24oz is the standard for this product. These are 12 oz.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery product was perfect-</li>
            <li> Fake.  Not the real product.  Thanks for the ripoff.</li>
            <li> Ivory has ruined my trust with their new &#x27;Original&#x27;, which stinks and has some harsh chemical in it.  I am not sure why they had to change a best seller that I loved but now after 50 years I am looking for a new company.</li>
            <li> IVORY changed the &amp;#34;Pure and Simple&amp;#34; bodywash.  The new bodywash is very thick, comes out like toothpaste and has a chemical smell.  This is the OLD bodywash that was light and smelt great.  If you like the NEW &amp;#34;Pure and Simple&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> Favorite smelling soap!</li>
            <li> Lots of lather without a lot of additives. Being a cancer survivor has significantly increased my awareness of the massive amounts of chemicals we are exposed to continually. So I am always searching for products that are as non-toxic as possible. I grew up with Ivory bar soap and it&#x27;s nice to have a convenient shower gel form.</li>
            <li> This is not what I got.I wanted the old formula.That&#x27;s in the picture.ðŸ˜¢</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this body wash! I&#x27;ve moved away from body wash in recent years because all the affordable washes on the market have become very food-scented. I&#x27;m really not into smelling like vanilla or coconut or berries or for crying out loud, now there&#x27;s a yogurt one? Good lord.&lt;br /&gt; I prefer clean, soapy, or even fresh perfume type of fragrances. I had a coupon and tried it. It&#x27;s super lathery (is that even a word?) and gentle enough on my somewhat sensitive skin. The scent is not the original Ivory bar soap scent, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, but it is very fresh.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for many years and we purchased this JUST IN CASE they stop making Ivory products.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT the same as it used to be.  It is not the same soft clean scent.  It is instead a terrible chemical smell.  Not to mention it leaves your skin with an awful residue.  Whoever in this company that got the great idea of messing with this wonderful product blew it big time!!  I will NOT be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I found the 12 oz container for 93 CENTS at walmart!!! Go, you might find it at your local one that cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, I really liked the way it lathered. I used slightly less than an ounce and I managed to wash my whole body. The only reason i&#x27;m not using it again and leaving it for my mom to use, is that just like Irish Spring, something in this body wash makes me sneeze and snot up like crazy. WAAAAHHHH! such a shame! But I do recommend it as it does function but idk what ingredient is the culprit. *sniff*</li>
            <li> My all time favorite soap and it&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find in stores, glad I can find it here.  Has a fresh, clean scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm and the bottles last a long time because you only need a small amount to lather.  I never get sick of this scent or how clean it makes me feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but I thought it would be better.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> Good ole fashion soap good moisture too.</li>
            <li> used for cleaning molds - work well for this process - no film</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this doesn&#x27;t smell like the Ivory bar soap I remember as a kid.</li>
            <li> Smaller bottles than I had previously purchased but they are full to the top. Ivory is the only brand which is gentle to my skin without making me feel slick with moisture after my shower.</li>
