    <ol>
            <li>Perfect eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good vegan purple/plum eyeshadow, and this is it!</li>
            <li>Great color, beautiful shimmer, great fixation.</li>
            <li>The color, feel, and texture of this pencil is great.</li>
            <li>Truly a great product.</li>
            <li>Loved the creamstick eye liner.  </li>
            <li>Lovely color!  </li>
            <li>Love the blush and mascara though!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>The color is lovely and the clean ingredients are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural, feels good, smells good and looks good.</li>
            <li>great eyeliner - glides on smooth &amp; easy to use</li>
            <li>I love that it does not irritate my eyes, but it is very light.</li>
            <li>Worked better as a kohl liner.</li>
            <li>Color is more of a brownish.  </li>
            <li>There are many articles on the dermatis, blisters and problems with tocopheral-a.    </li>
            <li>I ALMOST love this product.</li>
            <li>Still, I am going to be buying more of these pencils.  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner is okay</li>
            <li>It is a lovely product, but I wish they had made the pencil thinner.  </li>
            <li>This size is better for eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I also should note that I&#x27;m sure having wiped my eyes a lot during the day, it had to have got into my eyes somewhat, but I didn&#x27;t have any discomfort from it</li>
            <li>I do love this brand, I have purchased so many of their products and they are all fantastic!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, though, it is juts the right consistency</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful eye liner and with no reaction and fresh product, I&#x27;m changing to 5 stars, especially after the company was so helpful.</li>
            <li>Glides on easily.</li>
            <li>It stays strong all day without fading.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner itself goes on smooth and easy, and stays put.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m sure some of the product had wiped off during the day, there was still adequate color on my face and it wasn&#x27;t smudged or anywhere it shouldn&#x27;t have been.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and soft, and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I like using natural products around my eyes and this bold color was nice.</li>
            <li>Love this line but not this particular item.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see all natural products, as I have contact dermatitis to many chemicals.  </li>
            <li>so when sharpened it can still be used for pretty detailed work while lining your eyes.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is a rich purple color (but goes on light); I love using it on my inner rims.</li>
            <li>I feel good about a company that chooses its ingredients so carefully.</li>
            <li>It is a cleaner, organic based product, so I store mine in the fridge between used to cut down on any bacteria, and because I like to keep using it for longer than I probably should :-p  </li>
            <li>It goes on quickly and smooth and is a beautiful color that complements any eyeshade, but definitely highlights the green in my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is good for a soft color, and you WILL need to reapply several times during the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important for me to use non-toxic, natural products, so this liner gets a thumbs-up!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a really pretty color.</li>
            <li>It is a very rich deep plum.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural option that looks and feels nice on.</li>
            <li>The color does fade on the upper lid, but I am happy with the overall look and after one week, no irritation which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>Very recommended.</li>
            <li>and I expected it to hold up/perform better.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients makes it exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is so soft, gentle and creamy, it doesn&#x27;t tug or pull.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to wash off though either.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it stayed on!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color, but NOT intense, and if you apply too much trying to darken it, it tends to slide off and give you raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that it smears pretty easily and can look icky after a few hours, especially on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this when my previous brand eyeliner ran out.</li>
            <li>I did some research and found that tocopheral-a is natural vitamin E with acetic acid added to it aka carboxylic acid, which I am allergic to.  </li>
            <li>The company checked the lot numbers on my make-up and found that this was old make-up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of 100% Pure products in general, but I had never tried their eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, within an hour my eyes were watering, bright red, itching and throbbing.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t wake up in the middle of the night with burning eyes like I&#x27;ve come to expect with my old brand.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes, and before switching to this brand, I could not line my rims without my eyes looking like I had been binge drinking for several days.  </li>
            <li>Out of the other 100% Pure products this is the only one I have not been too fond of.</li>

            <li> I also tap a little bit of powder under my eye, to try and keep my eyeliner from drifting down.  </li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve had in the past from other brands.</li>
            <li> I like the Gabriel line and have used a few of their products.</li>
            <li> I like the color a lot, esp for those with hazel or green eyes.</li>
            <li> I have green eyes and the purple/black of this color</li>
            <li> I also have seasonal allergies and was extra tired</li>
            <li> I also was lazy and slept in it</li>
            <li> The tip is wide, so it would need to be sharpened if you wanted to apply a thin line.  </li>
            <li> but I think it should be less expensive than it is.</li>
            <li> This is a thick crayon, which was a bit disappointing to me, as it gives less control.</li>
            <li> I like the color but not a great fan of how it looked on my skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have really bad allergies to makeup.  </li>
            <li> (Even my husband commented that I needed to do something about my crazy bloodshot eyes!)</li>

The color does fade on the upper lid, but I am happy with the overall look and after one week, no irritation which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have really bad allergies to makeup.  This does not bother either of us at all.  Goes on smooth and it&#x27;s a really pretty color.</li>
            <li> Great color, beautiful shimmer, great fixation. Stays the entire day!!! Does not irritate my eyes, doesn&#x27;t smudge/run but creamy at the same time.</li>
            <li> Goes on well but is way too dark for my skin tone. Color is more of a brownish.  Easier to keep than return</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see all natural products, as I have contact dermatitis to many chemicals.  I ordered mascara, lip gloss, eye shadow and eye liner.  Loved the creamstick eye liner.  Unfortunately, within an hour my eyes were watering, bright red, itching and throbbing.  This lasted almost 24 hours.  I did some research and found that tocopheral-a is natural vitamin E with acetic acid added to it aka carboxylic acid, which I am allergic to.  There are many articles on the dermatis, blisters and problems with tocopheral-a.    I wrote to the manufacturer, Purity Cosmetics, asking for the MSDS/label, materials safety data sheet.  It&#x27;s been over three days and I have received no response to them.    Update:  Purity Cosmetics uses tocopheral alpha and not tocopheral acetate.  The company checked the lot numbers on my make-up and found that this was old make-up.  They replaced all make-up and I have had no issues.  This is a wonderful eye liner and with no reaction and fresh product, I&#x27;m changing to 5 stars, especially after the company was so helpful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of 100% Pure products in general, but I had never tried their eyeliner. This one is just what I was looking for. I feel good about a company that chooses its ingredients so carefully. The eyeliner itself goes on smooth and easy, and stays put. It&#x27;s not hard to wash off though either. I like the color a lot, esp for those with hazel or green eyes.</li>
            <li> I ALMOST love this product. The color is lovely and the clean ingredients are wonderful.  It&#x27;s nice and soft, and goes on smoothly.  The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that it smears pretty easily and can look icky after a few hours, especially on a hot day.  Still, I am going to be buying more of these pencils.  This is a daily-wear item for me.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is okay but I think it should be less expensive than it is. I love that it does not irritate my eyes, but it is very light. I cannot achieve the look I want with it because it is so sheer. Out of the other 100% Pure products this is the only one I have not been too fond of.</li>
            <li> It is really too thick of a pencil to be eyeliner.  It is a lovely product, but I wish they had made the pencil thinner.  This size is better for eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Love this line but not this particular item. It wouldn&#x27;t stay on at all. Was gone before I walked out the door. Love the blush and mascara though!</li>
            <li> Perfect eyeliner. I have green eyes and the purple/black of this color makes them pop. It&#x27;s natural, feels good, smells good and looks good. Very recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I had previously tried several items from this brand so I was excited to try this when my previous brand eyeliner ran out. Even though I had liked the other 100% Pure products I had, I was skeptical because I had read some negative reviews about it wiping off and or smudging. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it stayed on! I wore it on a regular day and was out and about in the weather. I also have seasonal allergies and was extra tired so I was rubbing my eyes a lot and I fully expected to look like a raccoon when I looked in the mirror, but I didn&#x27;t! Even though I&#x27;m sure some of the product had wiped off during the day, there was still adequate color on my face and it wasn&#x27;t smudged or anywhere it shouldn&#x27;t have been. I also should note that I&#x27;m sure having wiped my eyes a lot during the day, it had to have got into my eyes somewhat, but I didn&#x27;t have any discomfort from it like I&#x27;ve had in the past from other brands.

I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural option that looks and feels nice on.</li>
            <li> The line goes on thicker than I like.</li>
            <li> great eyeliner - glides on smooth &amp; easy to use</li>
            <li> The color, feel, and texture of this pencil is great. The fact that it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients makes it exactly what I needed. However, do note that it will run and come off if you sweat or are in the heat. I have to apply it after I arrive at work because I find it&#x27;s often already gone after the lengthy public transit commute.</li>
            <li> I do love this brand, I have purchased so many of their products and they are all fantastic! This eyeliner is a rich purple color (but goes on light); I love using it on my inner rims. I have sensitive eyes, and before switching to this brand, I could not line my rims without my eyes looking like I had been binge drinking for several days.  (Even my husband commented that I needed to do something about my crazy bloodshot eyes!) So, I switch to this brand for both eyeliner and mascara.  This eyeliner is so soft, gentle and creamy, it doesn&#x27;t tug or pull.  The tip is wide, so it would need to be sharpened if you wanted to apply a thin line.  It lasts a very long time, I have used it for over a month and still not needed to sharpen it.  It is a cleaner, organic based product, so I store mine in the fridge between used to cut down on any bacteria, and because I like to keep using it for longer than I probably should :-p  It&#x27;s a pretty color, but NOT intense, and if you apply too much trying to darken it, it tends to slide off and give you raccoon eyes. It is good for a soft color, and you WILL need to reapply several times during the day.  I also tap a little bit of powder under my eye, to try and keep my eyeliner from drifting down.  I took off a star, because it&#x27;s costly and I expected it to hold up/perform better.</li>
            <li> This is a thick crayon, which was a bit disappointing to me, as it gives less control. Surprisingly, though, it is juts the right consistency so when sharpened it can still be used for pretty detailed work while lining your eyes. It&#x27;s important for me to use non-toxic, natural products, so this liner gets a thumbs-up!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good vegan purple/plum eyeshadow, and this is it! It doesn&#x27;t run. It stays strong all day without fading. Glides on easily. Truly a great product.</li>
            <li> I just wish they would a slim version of this pencil. It is a very rich deep plum.</li>
