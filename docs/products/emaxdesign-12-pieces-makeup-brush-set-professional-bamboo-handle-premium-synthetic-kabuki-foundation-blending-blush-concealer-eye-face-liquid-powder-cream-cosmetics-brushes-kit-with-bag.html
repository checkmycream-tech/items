            <li>Really, for the price, these are an excellent value.</li>

            <li>The handles are nice and chunky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really bummed because that was one of the best brushes in the set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup brush aficionado, but I thought these were really nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, these were shipped from Kentucky, not China, in case you were worried about that kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the hair is nice</li>
            <li>The kabuki brush is good and I love the blush brushes.</li>
            <li>but they are really nicely made and sturdy.</li>

            <li>nice set, chemical smell though</li>

            <li>Nice weight.</li>
            <li>but I like these - nice selection - bristles</li>
            <li>I love it great price I love it</li>

            <li>These brushes are the absolutely the best that I have.</li>
            <li>They seem to be really good quality, and they&#x27;re even better because of the price.</li>
            <li>best brushes I&#x27;ve bought so far!!!</li>
            <li>these are great for a beginner with makeup, i don&#x27;t love the eye brushes but they&#x27;re great for other things like my face paintings, great for the price!</li>
            <li>eyeshadow brushes blend beautifully and quickly...</li>
            <li>Great makeup brushes, Soft and good quality!</li>
            <li>Worth it!!!</li>
            <li>They are worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>First off I love these brushes, they are absolutely perfect for the price!!</li>
            <li>Very good brushes and they perform as well as my higher end brushes.  </li>
            <li>#2 seems best for liquid foundation, or highlighter (that you would dab ontop of your high cheekbones).</li>
            <li>I can now get a flawless application without paying the high price.  </li>
            <li>The reviews kind of made me think they were super great quality, which they&#x27;re not</li>
            <li>The brush is very soft, great price, great quality.</li>
            <li>Great brushes at a very good price, especially when compared to MAC brushes that go at like $50 a brush.</li>
            <li>I have to say ALL these brushes are awesome better than some of my very spendy ones.</li>
            <li>But they are great; I&#x27;d give them six stars if I could even despite the extraordinary delivery time.</li>
            <li>Super happy I purchased them.</li>
            <li>Paying more money just does NOT make sense when you can apply your makeup with these very affordable brushes and get a flawless finish!</li>
            <li>They are wonderful, very soft, easy to wash and good quality.</li>
            <li>They pick up my make-up wonderfully, and are very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and make my make-up look flawless.</li>
            <li>Very soft, apply foundation and powders flawlessly.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft to the skin and the bamboo handles are simply beautiful!  </li>
            <li>Brushes ate awesome,  very soft and sturdy...</li>
            <li>The hairs come off very easily.</li>
            <li>I like the brushes, but they had a VERY strong odor when I opened them.</li>
            <li>I use the angled one most for my brows and love it!</li>
            <li>pretty good for the price!</li>
            <li>They look nice but they are very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>they come in a nice bag and aren&#x27;t a wallet breaker, if somebody needs a gift and likes make up, this is a safe bet</li>
            <li>The all-over eyeshadow brush, crease blender brush and angled brush are better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used, and the foundation brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Love the brushes their affordable and nice</li>
            <li>Soft and beautiful brushes!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how wonderful these brushes are.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with them.  </li>
            <li>Wow the best brushes I have!!!</li>
            <li>I chucked the bag they came in because it wasn&#x27;t worth keeping - but the brushes work great with my makeup.  </li>
            <li>But I am so impressed I threw out all my old brushes after trying these.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent buy so far.</li>
            <li>These are soft and great!</li>
            <li>but this brush are by far the best brush I have bought.</li>
            <li>these brushes are soft and yummy and perfect.</li>
            <li>Make up looks nice for many hours after applying.</li>
            <li>Okay... gets the job done but nothing spectacular.  </li>

            <li>Allows for smooth application.  </li>
            <li>so you could have a really light finishing brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really sturdy, but is effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are really smooth and apply makeup just like my Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>but it does fit all the brushes.</li>
            <li>Brush hairs just were not as secure as I thought.</li>

            <li>Even the rounder brushes are curved on the top, but have a kind of &amp;#34;corner&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s not a smooth transition to the side of the bristles.</li>

            <li>Love these brushes so far.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for good brushes at a much cheaper price than what you&#x27;ll find at Ulta or Clinique.</li>
            <li>worth its money.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and of good quality so far.</li>
            <li>Omg I am so in love with these brushes , so soft</li>
            <li>I bough them, however for the amount it cost purchase still worth it.</li>
            <li>and I love the different sizes they offer, although I didn&#x27;t receive the free eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li>I love how soft they are and how well they pick up the pigments in my eye shadows.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush alone was worth the price.</li>
            <li>These brushes not only work great but look professional.</li>
            <li>Are worth the money if you can figure out which brush is used for what.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely soft and have many uses.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll be worth your while.  </li>
            <li>had them for about a week arrived sooner than expected these brushes are good quality would defenetly recomend</li>
            <li>And omg they were worth the wait(2 weeks and 3 days)</li>
            <li>Really nice, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It was worth the price, I would recommend</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it just  for the face ones..</li>
            <li>These brushes are really nice, so soft and you get so many for a low price.</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>really good product for what you are paying for, the only problem i had is that i took over a month to receive them, but overall really satisfied with the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just starting to get more into makeup and good brushes definitely make a difference.</li>
            <li>They are soft and easy to clean</li>
            <li>The brushes are really nice especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>And there is a wide variety of brushes so good bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>The brushes do have a strong chemical smell at first, but I aired them out and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>far as the smell goes, I didn&#x27;t find it overwhelming unless I practically stuck the brush up my nose-which I don&#x27;t suggest you do.</li>
            <li>They came with a tiny manual that suggested soaking the brushes in warm water and shampoo for ~30 minutes to get rid of any lingering smells from the factory, which I did.</li>
            <li>Love the brushes, supper soft</li>
            <li>and I love how soft they are.</li>
            <li>They are soooo soft :)</li>
            <li>I love how soft they are.</li>
            <li>Even the foundation brush that most of us don&#x27;t use is extremely soft and packed densely.</li>
            <li>They are soft durable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased at the quality and quantity of these brushes.</li>
            <li>That being said, I was just cleaning the brushes gently with some brush cleaner (good quality stuff) and the bristles came right out of the pencil tip brush in a big chunk.</li>
            <li>But I mean for the price I don&#x27;t even mind, I loved them more than my MAC brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushed are soft and feel very nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure a simple bit of super glue or a glue gun would be a fast, easy fix.</li>
            <li>but these are amazing not Like other brushes that feel cheap ,</li>
            <li>Love way better then all my other brushes does not break me out or make my skin itchy</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This is a minor issue since they work fine and are lovely.</li>
            <li>I choose these kit over the others because it seemed like it was a good mix of brushes, not too much of small brushes or bigger brushes, and it was good quality - so the handles wouldn&#x27;t be coming off.</li>
            <li>so I think they should put instructions for which brush is for what, other than that they&#x27;re good..</li>
            <li>A good set to accompany other brushes</li>
            <li>The eye brushes seem to not pick up product as good as my other brushes</li>
            <li>I gave it a four because it had some loss briesels other than that good</li>
            <li>They of course aren&#x27;t as good as the $45 brushes you get from high end makeup brands, but I wanted a set that actually matches and</li>
            <li>One of the brushes started shedding right away but not a hair from the others.</li>
            <li>Hugs the cheek and deposits the right amount of product.</li>
            <li>they were all right.</li>
            <li>There was shedding almost RIGHT away.</li>
            <li>Every size brush for the right price.</li>
            <li>It was the right amount of face brushes and blending brushes for my needs.</li>
            <li>but the brushes are not glued right to the stick</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and travel friendly!</li>
            <li>I was worried because these were so cheap that they would not be decent.</li>
            <li>The main reason why i purchased this one was because they are cheap and they are additional to my growing makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes pick up plenty of powder and pigment and actually clean up really well too.</li>
            <li>Good for price , soft, easy to wash , minimal shedding</li>
            <li>They have a piece of paper that shows you the name of the brushes and how to clean which is very helpful.</li>
            <li>In addition to makeup brushes are very soft and easy to use.</li>

            <li>I am a 13 year old girl that is starting to get into makeup and these are perfect, they&#x27;re so soft and they pick up the product really well.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush was bent when it got in and the dome shaped face brush (don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re called there are no labels on the brushes) fell apart from the stick (however I was able to stick it back in with the help of super glue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are very soft and seem to be good quality, but one of the brush heads is already starting to come off.</li>
            <li>Kabuki brushes are lovely in general.  </li>
            <li>A thousand times softer and more hearty than my bare minerals brushes.</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;ve washed the brushes a few times I&#x27;ll give an updated review but so far so good :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m by no means an experienced make-up artist, in fact I hardly wear makeup day to day, but the handles seem nice, brushes glued firmly on and the bristles very soft, all in a nice bag.</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping too, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting them to come that quick!</li>
            <li>They are beautiful, and soft to the touch like high quality brushes, but people said that the tips fell off easily so I will just do as previous reviews said and hot glue</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know what most of these brushes are used for but with a little research i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll figure it out.  </li>
            <li>Very few fallout and great quality.</li>
            <li>super soft brushes defiantly worth the price!</li>
            <li>There is no bad smell and they are super soft!</li>

            <li>they were so cheap and they&#x27;re so soft and they work so well!</li>
            <li>I would be willing to pay a few dollars more if they added more eye brushes and concealer brushes.</li>
            <li>I have to say my favorite one is the 3rd from right</li>
            <li>and it bristled are too loose which kind of defeats</li>
            <li>The handles are super sturdy, well made and the bristles are full and soft with no fall out.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft they are amazing for doing my makeup the reason I only put four is because I would have liked to know what each brush was specifically used for and why the brush set came with wo regular size kabuki brush and a mini brush</li>

            <li>First time writing a review on amazon.best brushes ever.</li>
            <li>But I was incredibly happy how long it did last though.</li>
            <li>I washed them before I used them because they did smell like plastic at first, but that did not affect the quality at all.</li>

            <li>Very thankful for the price!</li>
            <li>Overall love the product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>This is my first set  </li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;m just starting out this who make up thing .</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing another set very soon!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly know what EVERY brush is for.</li>
            <li>I was way overdue on getting some makeup brushes and I am so glad I finally did.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i need for mobile device repair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to caring about makeup enough to own a brush set.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft!!</li>
            <li>SUPER SOFT!!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re super duper soft, totally worth for the price.</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes that had a wide aray of sizes, quality made , washed well, no shedding for a good price .</li>
            <li>They came right away, there was an intense odor of paint or Lacquer coming from the box.</li>
            <li>Soft brushes, easy to use, only downside is some of the hairs come out easily.</li>
            <li>Brushes are great for the price but the handles fell off of one them the same day and loose on another.</li>
            <li>dense enough to blend foundation, great for buffing in loose powder, foundation, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this set, I am actually thinking of buying another.. the brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li>Love that they blend make up to my face so nice, without removing extra conceiler from dark spots I got..</li>
            <li>Super soft brush, not smell wird, good quality for a little price.</li>
            <li>Super excited except when I was lookin at them they gave me two of the same ones I didn&#x27;t receive the eyebrow brush</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect as far as quality when I bought these, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge loss since the price was so reasonable.</li>
            <li>Great product for someone who is just getting into serious makeup.</li>
            <li>I think that the bristles are so soft which makes application so much better than my old set.</li>
            <li>Good simple brushes...recommend to anyone just starting out with make up</li>
            <li>I would recommend this set for beginners , just for the simple fact that it comes with a good selection of brushes for a full face, not like other inexpensive sets I have seen or even bought.</li>
            <li>I just received this brush set, very quickly I might add, and am pleasantly surprised by the high quality -- particuarly for the price.  </li>
            <li>Again super soft and picks up product!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not flimsy and super soft!</li>

            <li>and they are super soft!</li>
            <li>They are SUPER soft brushes for being synthetic and apply makeup very well!</li>
            <li>Anyway, the brushes came faster than anticipated , they are super soft and I&#x27;m so ready to use them .!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason for the overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li>The brushes look exactly the way that they are shown - no false or misleading advertisement there.  </li>
            <li>This set has pretty much a brush for every need.</li>
            <li>The shipping was wonderfully fast and the brushes are exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>There were a couple of lose hairs on the brushed but other than that everything seems great.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted without the need to spend too much.</li>
            <li>They can be easily cleaned and dry super fast.</li>
            <li>Full complete 11 brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall I liked the versatility of this set, very much comparable if not better than ecotools, and most of all the price.</li>
            <li>Comes with great soft brushes and a little carrying pouch!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they will come in good handy when I&#x27;ll need a clean kabuki brush when the other two are dirty other than that great quality brushes and recommend them other people as well.</li>
            <li>Of course they also can in with the little baggy to put them in which is a huge plus!!</li>
            <li>I honestly figured the quality would be poor due to the great price.</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>They are holding up well and are super soft.</li>
            <li>There was a slight smell to the package, but I honestly think it&#x27;s just the plastic</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and I didn&#x27;t see any hairs fall out</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>

            <li>They don&#x27;t shed and are super soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are also SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>everyone has said, the bristles are SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles .</li>
            <li>Its so strong, I have washed them a couple times and only a couple have started to not smell.  </li>
            <li>I received the set, it had strong smell which went away after leaving it open for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>The products fibers/hairs are very soft to the touch, well worth the price</li>
            <li>Love every single things about this brushesüëçüëç</li>
            <li>hair fibers sometimes fall out on certain ones when washing.</li>
            <li>They are so soft, even on sensitive skin and the angled liner brush is pretty precise.</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave  it 4 stars is because they are soft and fluffy and for the price they are pretty good brushes</li>
            <li>I got this brushes a few weeks ago and so far they are pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>Seller was very helpful when I asked about the tracking number and got back to me very quickly.</li>
            <li>They do not shed, even after washing a few times and the bamboo handles are super cute.</li>
            <li>The smaller brush are holding up just fine with washing.  </li>
            <li>Pretty decent brushes I guess.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, they look and feel very high quality</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft (my two year old likes to steal the short handled brush to swirl on her own face), and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a really strong smell to it which I was kind of expecting from the previous reviews, but as long as you don&#x27;t actually smell the brushes, It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Very nice set, gets dirty easily though.</li>
            <li>Good brushes for the price, but they are a little too soft.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used them, bristles fell out right and left.</li>
            <li>I suggest if you are buying your first brush set by these high quality brushes don&#x27;t wear out delivery was fast</li>
            <li>Really really soft brushes, they are really good quality also not very many hairs came out, they&#x27;re dense but smelly</li>
            <li>The fluffy brushes are equally dense and great for powder or blush application.</li>
            <li>These have lasted me a few months now and are still in great condition after being used on a daily basis!</li>
            <li>Got these for my daughter and she loves them so much she quit stealing mine.</li>
            <li>Very commanded ,will buy from this seller again</li>

            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price for this type of quality.</li>
            <li>They work really really well with liquid foundations.</li>
            <li>They are of much better quality than I expected for the price.</li>

            <li>so it&#x27;s very flexible.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore them.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>Recommend them and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I really like this set.</li>
            <li>They came really fast, faster than I thought.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really have a whole lot to complain about at this price point.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy brushes..</li>
            <li>Too soft, just a few that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and love the wooden color of the handles.</li>
            <li>Most days, my makeup is very neutral and natural, but I also do heavier, darker looks occasionally.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes they are soft and come in different sizes.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li>The price is crazy good for how many brushes you get.  </li>
            <li>Really soft, I love these brushed.</li>
            <li>Brushes in a good assortment of shapes, with a range of soft to firm brushes for every purpose.  </li>
            <li>Super soft high quality brushes.</li>
            <li>I loved all these brushes and at such a good price you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right for any beginner or professional.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes, soft bristles, the brush sheds a little at first, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>There is some shedding from all of the brushes and the flat top kabuki shed out completely when I was washing it.</li>
            <li>My only other gripe about this set is that it lacks a good eye shadow brush to pack color on the lid.</li>
            <li>They have just the right amount of firmness and density - the flat top brush works well for powder foundations/mineral veils and is dense enough to blend liquid/cream foundation.  </li>
            <li>no loose hairs, came very quickly and packaged in a cute, plain canvas bag.</li>
            <li>They wash out easy and dry fast.</li>
            <li>Why?&lt;br /&gt;- Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;- very new products</li>
            <li>My favorite purchase on amazon were these for the price they are an extreme deal</li>
            <li>I like the wooden handle as it adds a unique touch to my brush collection.</li>
            <li>Other than that these are ok and does the job</li>
            <li>My makeup went on incredibly smoothly- better than with other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I honestly have never purchased cheaper brushes before, being a makeup artist I always bought more expensive, I live by the term &amp;#34;you</li>
            <li>They are so soft and there is a large variety inside the eco bag they were sent in!</li>
            <li>so I use my brushes daily as well as clean them after every use.</li>
            <li>but I have 9 other fantastic super soft brushes to make up for it!</li>
            <li>Just as good if not better than some of my professional brush kits.</li>
            <li>So I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations as one of my colleagues was telling me about these $100 brushes (yikes).</li>
            <li>So many brushes that I am not sure what to do with half of them, but I love them all!  </li>
            <li>The small stippling brush works amazing for blending in concealer under your eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pencil brush: round and pointy, great for bottom lash line, highlight on inner corners, other detailed areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat</li>
            <li>I just receive it in the mail and it pretty soft</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and really pack on color!</li>
            <li>Really nice and fluffy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and these are by far my favorite brushes especially for the amount I paid!!!!</li>
            <li>Overall good product, the only thing I would change is actually having a label on the sides of the brushes like &amp;#34;foundation brush, eyebrow brush, ect.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Oh and they are really pretty and soft too.</li>
            <li>Brushes are really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed to much!</li>
            <li>First impression is that they&#x27;re really soft.</li>
            <li>Brushes are completely falling apart after the first use.</li>
            <li>Was sent with prime so it was fast like normal.</li>
            <li>But so far they&#x27;re exactly as the picture and description.</li>
            <li>i can say for certain they are very soft.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the large round kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>They were well packages and came in a cute little bag.. fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>These may be my go to brushes from now on when I need new ones!</li>
            <li>so I decided to purchase some new ones, but didn&#x27;t want to fork over that much cash.</li>
            <li>They really just smell like brand new plastic.</li>
            <li>Seriously, no shedding.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if you already have a decent set or collection of brushes you can skip these.</li>
            <li>of the set: love the smaller eyeshadow brushes, especially the angled blender.</li>
            <li>Foundation brush broke after 3 uses, and I had to super glue it back on.</li>
            <li>I guess this is a classic case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Particularly because of the travel sized brushes.</li>
            <li>love the bamboo wood,makes them look even more expensive.</li>
            <li>I was only able to find 1 in the bunch that I could actually use.</li>
            <li>One of the main ones I wanted this set for came unglued from the handle after 1 use.</li>
            <li>I really like that the brushes are nice and thick and the hairs don&#x27;t fall out when used.  </li>
            <li>decent brushes.</li>
            <li>only wish the names/type of brush was written on the handle to make it easier to quickly grap from drawer</li>
            <li>i mainly use the skinny angle brush and maybe one of the skinnier brushes for contour on my nose.</li>
            <li>Since then, they are holding up okay, only shedding a bristle here or there (just the larger brushes).</li>
            <li>wow these are better quality than i expected.</li>
            <li>Love them and the entire set is about a third of the price of the one brush I tried at the makeup counter.</li>
            <li>The brushes look ok and didn&#x27;t shed so far.&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because I didn&#x27;t receive 2 brushes ( angled brush and the third from the left( don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The brushes are good quality for the price only problem is that I received duplicates of two brushes and did not receive either small or large angled brush.</li>
            <li>These brushes do not shade much and they are very soft.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and work really well.</li>
            <li>very well packaged very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, inexpensive, and get the job done!</li>
            <li>Very soft and does its job well!</li>
            <li>Very soft to touch and work wonders!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very surprised with these set of brushes!</li>
            <li>Bristles were very soft!</li>
            <li>Very soft!</li>

            <li>Very soft and sturdy!</li>
            <li>These brushes really are SOFT!</li>
            <li>I have been using for 3 weeks and so far they have held up very well and are pretty soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>very soft and holding up well after 3 months of use!</li>
            <li>Other than that, though, they&#x27;re super super soft and densely packed</li>

            <li>These are much better than any other brushes I&#x27;ve bought and completely compete with my step daughters high end pro brushes.</li>
            <li>I use the bigger flat top kabuki one to stipple on foundation.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t tested all brushes, I tried the flat top kabuki and it was CONSTANT shedding.</li>
            <li>and you receive a cute little bag to carry them in)</li>
            <li>Only reason why this didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the kubuki brush had minor shading, but other than that there are great...</li>
            <li>This set is so soft!!</li>
            <li>They even came in a cute little bag.</li>

            <li>and I love the little bag they come in.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Decent soft brushes, no one wants to spend $30 on one make up brush if you&#x27;re frugle and want to save money</li>
            <li>Took off two stars because the main reason I bought this over many of the bargain sets was strictly for the angled brush that was missing.</li>
            <li>I love the flat top brush for foundation and the big fluffy one for powder.  </li>
            <li>Very veryyyy soft brushes.</li>

            <li>I really like these brushes, they are so soft.</li>

            <li>more brushes than i kno what to do with...gave a few to my mom.&lt;br /&gt;bristles</li>
            <li>Normally, I use the makeup applicator given with products.  </li>
            <li>-the are normal sized</li>
            <li>I normally use IT,MAC,Jane iredale and Lancome brushes.</li>
            <li>Normally one brush will cost what all of these do.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THEM, BUT IVE MISPLACED A COUPLE OF THEM.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money would definitely recommend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m obsessed with, beautiful and soft ...</li>
            <li>but if you could get past that the brush will really impress you and you&#x27;ll be glad you got them</li>
            <li>There were a few strands sticking out here in there on a brush or two, but I was able to pluck them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Came really early tha Brushes are really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed to much!</li>
            <li>I use it everyday when I&#x27;m going out love it...</li>
            <li>but it has pretty much everything you need if you are starting out like me.</li>
            <li>Not great quality, but really good for price.</li>
            <li>They do not have any strong odor whatsoever straight out of the little baggie.</li>
            <li>The brushes are new with high quality bristles.</li>
            <li>The down fall is that these brushes are too soft, but if you&#x27;re on a budget and this is all you can afford, like me, then buy them until you can afford better...</li>
            <li>I love the bristles on these brushes very soft yet firm.</li>
            <li>They are just right, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it is understandable that some of the brushes aren&#x27;t super useful, and there is a very slight amount of shedding (hence the 4 stars.)</li>
            <li>there was a slight chemical smell when I first got it, but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li>The face brushes could be a little fuller, but so far no fallout, and the eye brushes are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I ended up going to the store and purchasing a new foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I needed some new makeup brushes but didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li>I got these within 5 days while I live in salida california.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m intermediate and I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>I am new to the make-up world</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t mind the cheaper quality since I rotate my brushes often and am always repurchasing new ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Kabuki brush is too soft and kind of hard to apply powder.</li>
            <li>So disappointing because I really need one of those lol</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the quality of these brushes for the price, they are so soft and not cheap like most of the cheaper brush sets on here.</li>
            <li>The quality is actually better than I expected and I like that they hold makeup just enough with being practically stained with it.</li>
            <li>Came in a cute, little bag!</li>
            <li>I love the little eco bag they came in, too!  </li>

            <li>and so far it looks and feels durable!</li>
            <li>BlacChyna sells these EXACT same brushes for $60..</li>
            <li>SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>The are so soft!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a while and my first impression totally changed.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE SO SOFT THEH DONT SHED !</li>
            <li>I was actually pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re better than more expensive brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased from beauty supply stores!</li>
            <li>The hairs aren&#x27;t left all over my face or falling into my cleavage ;)</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft !</li>
            <li>The lacquer was a little strong when removed from the packaging but it faded away.</li>
            <li>Before I thought them I thought they&#x27;d just be poor quality brushes, but when I got them they came in a cute little canvas bag, they are Sooo soft and amazing.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is a decent set for beginners who are just starting to do makeup and aren&#x27;t ready to spend a lot on brushes.</li>
            <li>I have only had shedding from the second to smallest flat top brush</li>
            <li>Brushes are decent, they do have a &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; smell upon open but after a few washes they seemed to be okay.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, and product was what I expected.</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft, maybe alittle to soft.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft, they haven&#x27;t shed so far and they don&#x27;t smell chemically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a full set without the typical high price</li>
            <li>So soft so professional !</li>
            <li>Different &amp;#34;stiffness&amp;#34; in the brushes (not sure on good wording there) Just like the different types of brushes should have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for good quality brushes (especially for my eyes) for months, but it doesn&#x27;t take long for you to realize that brushes are NOT cheap anywhere - regardless of quality.</li>
            <li>These are dutiable Super soft absolutely NO shedding.</li>
            <li>(since the large flat brush looks exactly the same)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try them out :) The ultimate touch would be to add a little booklet on which brushes or for what.</li>
            <li>Very very nice just for that little price!!!!!</li>

            <li>The wooden handles weren&#x27;t very appearing in picture and almost decided against them</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and durable.</li>
            <li>Its a hit and miss with the brushes while they&#x27;re soft, some of the bristles don&#x27;t pick up product well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They stay soft and intact after cleaning too.</li>
            <li>they are so soft and for the price you can&#x27;t bet them.</li>

            <li>These are so soft.</li>
            <li>but I washed them as directed and the smell is completely gone.</li>
            <li>I am surprised.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and she loves it so far.</li>

            <li>Arrived early on the projected day of arrival.</li>
            <li>They are so soft.</li>
            <li>The reason why I gave them 4/5 stars are because their brushes are to soft.</li>
            <li>Washed them and no shedding so far</li>
            <li>Although, the fibers on these brushes are so soft and make up glides on with ease.</li>
            <li>I like the big brushes but not so much of the skinny ones..</li>
            <li>In fact, I got these to go in my professional kit</li>
            <li>It looks very authentically wooden.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>So soft.</li>
            <li>Soft</li>
            <li>Took a couple weeks for shipping but completely understandable since it&#x27;s coming all the way from China.</li>
            <li>I was positively surprised by the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li>soft ..</li>
            <li>the brushes are really soft and distrubute even color.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and the brush hairs dont fall out, they blend my foundation and eyeshadows</li>
            <li>No shedding so far.</li>
            <li>Only giving two stars because of the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how soft the makeup brush set was</li>
            <li>Amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li>I like how soft and durable they are.</li>
            <li>soft, no animal hair</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and hold up well.</li>
            <li>They are soft, but not flimsy as some brushes can be.  </li>
            <li>The foundation brushes are soft and work well, yet the eyeshadow brushes do not blend and pick up color well.</li>
            <li>Really soft.</li>
            <li>These brushes are INCREDIBLY SOFT.</li>
            <li>Soft brushes.</li>
            <li>Not makeup artist or professional quality but</li>
            <li>So soft on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>nicer than expected and deff worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>There is probably a few more than I will actually use, but I can keep to replace the ones i use.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and have a decent amount of density to them, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional, just having fun with my face, and wanted to try new styling with different types.</li>
            <li>I slightly pulled on the bristles and there was no shedding, all of the brushes are full and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many other brushes before these and these are way softer than more expensive brushes that I have bought.</li>
            <li>the only problems I had was how long it took to ship, and after about 4 or 5 uses of one of the brushes, the glue came loose and the top fell off.</li>
            <li>I wish there was 1 very large blush brush / powder brush but the larger of the selection will suffice, especially at the price!</li>
            <li>I washed them with hot water and soap, let dry overnight and used in the morning -this morning.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that this brushes have a very strong chemical smell that won&#x27;t go away even when you wash them.</li>
            <li>One of the smaller brushes broke all in all they feel so soft on my skin my first brushes were the elf brushes they were only a dollar at Walgreen&#x27;s (go figure) and they made my skin itch</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how short they are at first, but that was only because I was used to my tall Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft but they are also way too big for the eye area and because the brushes are really soft it makes it harder to pick up color.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re also new to makeup and don&#x27;t want to spend so much on the actual brand ones</li>
            <li>The smaller &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; style brushes were the main issues for me.</li>
            <li>They did exactly what I expected and felt really soft.</li>
            <li>or they were decent quality, but overpriced (think individual brushes at $25-50+).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty rough on brushes and so far the brushes have been holding up.  </li>
            <li>There was a slight smell but one quick cleaning</li>
            <li>They have a little bit of a smell to them, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed these a few times now and they are still super soft.</li>
            <li>The metal parts of the handle look real and are pretty thick - not super cheap aluminum foil-looking junk.</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve purchased brushes and either the set was cheaply made and the bristles shed all over</li>
            <li>But, for the price I really didn&#x27;t expect it to hold long.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure why the ends of all the brushes are like a light purple color</li>
            <li>The brushes work ok, but not good quality.</li>
            <li>These brushes are exactly what I expected them to be.</li>
            <li>Higher quality and softer than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re individually wrapped, soft and so far no hairs have fallen out.. can&#x27;t to use them!</li>
            <li>They washed fine without any shedding, although the cuts are uneven, especially around the edges.</li>
            <li>I got the brushed early and they are really soft and apply makeup well.</li>
            <li>The other brushes applied the makeup very well and soft without hurting your face!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used these a couple of times, but I really like them and they seem built to last.</li>
            <li>I like that the bristles is very soft but it had a very very short handle.</li>
            <li>The small kabuki is basically useless to me, but I have been able to find good uses for the other brushes.</li>
            <li>Better than some of the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>All of my other paddle brushes leave streaks, even my Real Techniques one!</li>
            <li>Super soft and fluffy!</li>
            <li>A few of the bigger brushes were nice but some of the shadow brushes were a little too &amp;#34;flingy&amp;#34; for powder.</li>
            <li>Mac bare minersls....</li>
            <li>Only downside is some of the brushes are too soft for my preference but that in no way takes away from the quality for this price point</li>
            <li>only problem is that they may be too soft for some of the brush needs</li>
            <li>I used the blush brush and it was soft but durable enough to apply my blues.  </li>
            <li>I left them out on the table to air out for a day or two and the smell was completely gone.</li>
            <li>I bought them as a second set I could use while I travel (frequently for work), so I don&#x27;t have to pack and unpack my home set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brushes are extra soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li>However, some of the bigger brushes were too soft for me to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>Wished the brushes were made from natural bristles, low grade quality.</li>
            <li>I would even go as far to say I would spend double what I did</li>
            <li>No regrets in purchasing this.</li>
            <li>but they won&#x27;t last in a professional setting.</li>
            <li>They are soft and durable with the bristles withstanding even daily cleaning.  </li>
            <li>They definitely match up to many of the more expensive makeup brushes I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft compared to my last set of Shany brushes.</li>
            <li>So far I use 3 or 4 of them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>i thought initially too soft but they do the job just fine.no stray bristles.</li>
            <li>Firstly they arrived a few days before scheduled delivery date, and they are ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li>You can not go wrong with a set of nice make up brushes.  </li>
            <li>Two of the brushes are bent kind of weirdly and one of them, when I started washing it, started losing a lot of bristles.</li>
            <li>The smell others have reported goes away within a half an hour of opening it and is gone completely after you have washed the brushes with a gentle shampoo.</li>
            <li>They had a tad chemical smell to them, but they are super soft and thick.</li>
            <li>Very soft, bristles don&#x27;t fall out, and they&#x27;re definitely built to last</li>
            <li>They did have a slightly plastic odor when they first arrived</li>
            <li>The bamboo handle is sturdy, has a clear grain, and is coated in a nice, thick, hard, clear varnish.</li>
            <li>And they had NO loose hairs.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to make a clean line.</li>
            <li>The other brushes do not seem to shed quite as much.</li>
            <li>I now have some other brushes from Sonia Kashuk, Real Techniques and Elf.  </li>
            <li>Arrived much sooner than expected !</li>
            <li>The small Kabuki isn&#x27;t very dense, but the big Kabuki really is.</li>
            <li>Received about 3 of the same brushes, came in a little drawstring bag which is useful, but not to carry the brushes in.  </li>
            <li>Although these brushes are not that expensive, I can say that the quality is good, and it can last a long time.</li>
            <li>To give you an idea of my makeup ability level, I am not (by any means) a professional makeup artist, but my daily makeup regime consists of primer, foundation, concealer, powder, bronzer, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, and tinted lip balm‚Äîso, pretty heavy makeup.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect professional quality similar to MAC or other high end products when you are paying a tenth of the price.</li>
            <li>I go through brushes like crazy and at least 2-4 sets on any job depending, and I am so happy to have this option now!</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend both for professional use or if you&#x27;re just starting out wit makeup like myself!</li>
            <li>It takes a little long time to get to you, but they are definitely worthy to wait.</li>
            <li>The little bag it comes in is really convenient too!</li>
            <li>No fall out, they do smell a little funny</li>
            <li>Love the wooden base, also the brushes are super soft...</li>
            <li>Great brushes but didint get the plus brush:(</li>
            <li>Only complain would be that they don&#x27;t grab on as much product as other brushes.</li>
            <li>They no long smell.</li>
            <li>Love the brushed but just realized there were a few missing from my order.</li>
            <li>And even a fluffy brush I&#x27;ve heard so much about!</li>
            <li>I like this set in particular because it has all the brushed I need‚Äîas opposed to other sets that have too many big brushes, unnecessary detailing brushes, etc.</li>
            <li>and they be super hard that when you use them on your face you feel nothing but bristles scraping you?</li>
            <li>But over all very soft every single one of them!</li>
            <li>They are all really amazing and soft my only complaint is that the brushes that you use presumably use as eyeshadow blending ones are far too big for such, that was a bit of a let down, but not enough to mark it down any stars.</li>
            <li>They feel like decent quality brushes in your hand, and are very minimal in respect to shedding.</li>
            <li>Not a single brush is left unused.</li>
            <li>but i have not expected this quality for such low price.</li>
            <li>These have bamboo handles, so soft and long lasting.</li>
            <li>but apparently it&#x27;s considered different because one has a really short handle...</li>
            <li>Good brushes for the price!:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, unfortunately this brush set didn&#x27;t last long, as hairs became loose and kept falling out in bulk on face.</li>
            <li>I havent expierenced much sheeding, the only negative is when the brushes first arrived they had a really strong weird scent.</li>
            <li>It arrived way earlier than the expected delivery date and they are very soft.</li>
            <li>Works really well and comes in a little pouch.</li>
            <li>Only thing is make up will stick too much, and when I go to wash it, its not completely clean.</li>
            <li>It is very soft on the face unlike some other brushes that feel like my husband&#x27;s beard stubble.</li>
            <li>One of the brushes bristles is starting to fall out but other than that they are very soft.</li>

            <li> This one is best used for contouring, or highlighting or blending eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Best uses would be for smudging eyeliner or used for lower eye lid smudging eyeshadow.</li>

            <li> I have to be honest...</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really bummed because that was one of the best brushes in the set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup brush aficionado, but I thought these were really nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, these were shipped from Kentucky, not China, in case you were worried about that kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the hair is nice</li>
            <li> The kabuki brush is good and I love the blush brushes.</li>
            <li> but they are really nicely made and sturdy.</li>

            <li> nice set, chemical smell though</li>

            <li> These brushes are the absolutely the best that I have.</li>
            <li> They seem to be really good quality, and they&#x27;re even better because of the price.</li>
            <li> best brushes I&#x27;ve bought so far!!!</li>
            <li> these are great for a beginner with makeup, i don&#x27;t love the eye brushes but they&#x27;re great for other things like my face paintings, great for the price!</li>
            <li> eyeshadow brushes blend beautifully and quickly...</li>
            <li> Great makeup brushes, Soft and good quality!</li>
            <li> Worth it!!!</li>
            <li> They are worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> First off I love these brushes, they are absolutely perfect for the price!!</li>
            <li> Very good brushes and they perform as well as my higher end brushes.  </li>
            <li> #2 seems best for liquid foundation, or highlighter (that you would dab ontop of your high cheekbones).</li>
            <li> I can now get a flawless application without paying the high price.  </li>
            <li> The reviews kind of made me think they were super great quality, which they&#x27;re not</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft, great price, great quality.</li>
            <li> Great brushes at a very good price, especially when compared to MAC brushes that go at like $50 a brush.</li>
            <li> I have to say ALL these brushes are awesome better than some of my very spendy ones.</li>
            <li> But they are great; I&#x27;d give them six stars if I could even despite the extraordinary delivery time.</li>
            <li> Super happy I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Paying more money just does NOT make sense when you can apply your makeup with these very affordable brushes and get a flawless finish!</li>
            <li> They are wonderful, very soft, easy to wash and good quality.</li>
            <li> They pick up my make-up wonderfully, and are very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and make my make-up look flawless.</li>
            <li> Very soft, apply foundation and powders flawlessly.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft to the skin and the bamboo handles are simply beautiful!  </li>
            <li> Brushes ate awesome,  very soft and sturdy...</li>
            <li> The hairs come off very easily.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes, but they had a VERY strong odor when I opened them.</li>
            <li> I use the angled one most for my brows and love it!</li>
            <li> pretty good for the price!</li>
            <li> They look nice but they are very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> they come in a nice bag and aren&#x27;t a wallet breaker, if somebody needs a gift and likes make up, this is a safe bet</li>
            <li> The all-over eyeshadow brush, crease blender brush and angled brush are better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used, and the foundation brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes their affordable and nice</li>
            <li> Soft and beautiful brushes!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how wonderful these brushes are.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with them.  </li>
            <li> Wow the best brushes I have!!!</li>
            <li> I chucked the bag they came in because it wasn&#x27;t worth keeping - but the brushes work great with my makeup.  </li>
            <li> But I am so impressed I threw out all my old brushes after trying these.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent buy so far.</li>
            <li> These are soft and great!</li>

            <li> It isn&#x27;t really sturdy, but is effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are really smooth and apply makeup just like my Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> but it does fit all the brushes.</li>
            <li> Brush hairs just were not as secure as I thought.</li>

            <li> at top Kabuki: dense enough to blend foundation, great for buffing in loose powder, foundation, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> great brushes a little smaller than expected but works wonderful!!</li>
            <li> These are amazing especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Even the rounder brushes are curved on the top, but have a kind of &amp;#34;corner&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s not a smooth transition to the side of the bristles.</li>
            <li> for the price of these brushes they are absolutely amazing definitely money</li>

            <li> worth its money.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and of good quality so far.</li>
            <li> Omg I am so in love with these brushes , so soft</li>
            <li> I bough them, however for the amount it cost purchase still worth it.</li>
            <li> and I love the different sizes they offer, although I didn&#x27;t receive the free eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li> I love how soft they are and how well they pick up the pigments in my eye shadows.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush alone was worth the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes not only work great but look professional.</li>
            <li> Are worth the money if you can figure out which brush is used for what.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re extremely soft and have many uses.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll be worth your while.  </li>

            <li> And omg they were worth the wait(2 weeks and 3 days)</li>
            <li> Really nice, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It was worth the price, I would recommend</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it just  for the face ones..</li>
            <li> These brushes are really nice, so soft and you get so many for a low price.</li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> really good product for what you are paying for, the only problem i had is that i took over a month to receive them, but overall really satisfied with the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting to get more into makeup and good brushes definitely make a difference.</li>
            <li> They are soft and easy to clean</li>
            <li> The brushes are really nice especially for the price!  </li>
            <li> And there is a wide variety of brushes so good bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> The brushes do have a strong chemical smell at first, but I aired them out and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> far as the smell goes, I didn&#x27;t find it overwhelming unless I practically stuck the brush up my nose-which I don&#x27;t suggest you do.</li>
            <li> They came with a tiny manual that suggested soaking the brushes in warm water and shampoo for ~30 minutes to get rid of any lingering smells from the factory, which I did.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes, supper soft</li>
            <li> and I love how soft they are.</li>
            <li> They are soooo soft :)</li>
            <li> I love how soft they are.</li>
            <li> Even the foundation brush that most of us don&#x27;t use is extremely soft and packed densely.</li>
            <li> They are soft durable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased at the quality and quantity of these brushes.</li>
            <li> That being said, I was just cleaning the brushes gently with some brush cleaner (good quality stuff) and the bristles came right out of the pencil tip brush in a big chunk.</li>
            <li> But I mean for the price I don&#x27;t even mind, I loved them more than my MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushed are soft and feel very nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure a simple bit of super glue or a glue gun would be a fast, easy fix.</li>
            <li> but these are amazing not Like other brushes that feel cheap ,</li>
            <li> Love way better then all my other brushes does not break me out or make my skin itchy</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is a minor issue since they work fine and are lovely.</li>
            <li> I choose these kit over the others because it seemed like it was a good mix of brushes, not too much of small brushes or bigger brushes, and it was good quality - so the handles wouldn&#x27;t be coming off.</li>
            <li> so I think they should put instructions for which brush is for what, other than that they&#x27;re good..</li>
            <li> A good set to accompany other brushes</li>
            <li> The eye brushes seem to not pick up product as good as my other brushes</li>
            <li> I gave it a four because it had some loss briesels other than that good</li>
            <li> They of course aren&#x27;t as good as the $45 brushes you get from high end makeup brands, but I wanted a set that actually matches and</li>
            <li> One of the brushes started shedding right away but not a hair from the others.</li>
            <li> Hugs the cheek and deposits the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> they were all right.</li>
            <li> There was shedding almost RIGHT away.</li>
            <li> Every size brush for the right price.</li>
            <li> It was the right amount of face brushes and blending brushes for my needs.</li>
            <li> but the brushes are not glued right to the stick</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and travel friendly!</li>
            <li> I was worried because these were so cheap that they would not be decent.</li>
            <li> The main reason why i purchased this one was because they are cheap and they are additional to my growing makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes pick up plenty of powder and pigment and actually clean up really well too.</li>
            <li> Good for price , soft, easy to wash , minimal shedding</li>
            <li> They have a piece of paper that shows you the name of the brushes and how to clean which is very helpful.</li>
            <li> In addition to makeup brushes are very soft and easy to use.</li>

            <li> I am a 13 year old girl that is starting to get into makeup and these are perfect, they&#x27;re so soft and they pick up the product really well.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush was bent when it got in and the dome shaped face brush (don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re called there are no labels on the brushes) fell apart from the stick (however I was able to stick it back in with the help of super glue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are very soft and seem to be good quality, but one of the brush heads is already starting to come off.</li>
            <li> Kabuki brushes are lovely in general.  </li>
            <li> A thousand times softer and more hearty than my bare minerals brushes.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve washed the brushes a few times I&#x27;ll give an updated review but so far so good :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m by no means an experienced make-up artist, in fact I hardly wear makeup day to day, but the handles seem nice, brushes glued firmly on and the bristles very soft, all in a nice bag.</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping too, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting them to come that quick!</li>
            <li> They are beautiful, and soft to the touch like high quality brushes, but people said that the tips fell off easily so I will just do as previous reviews said and hot glue</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what most of these brushes are used for but with a little research i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll figure it out.  </li>
            <li> Very few fallout and great quality.</li>
            <li> super soft brushes defiantly worth the price!</li>
            <li> There is no bad smell and they are super soft!</li>

            <li> I would be willing to pay a few dollars more if they added more eye brushes and concealer brushes.</li>
            <li> I have to say my favorite one is the 3rd from right</li>
            <li> and it bristled are too loose which kind of defeats</li>

            <li> These brushes are so soft they are amazing for doing my makeup the reason I only put four is because I would have liked to know what each brush was specifically used for and why the brush set came with wo regular size kabuki brush and a mini brush</li>

            <li> They had minimal shading and they apply makeup nicely.</li>
            <li> Not expensive</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> it wash it Because of its smell when i first got it.</li>
            <li> But you get enough for what you have to pay for. :)</li>
            <li> For the price they compare very well to brand name brushes!</li>
            <li> I also wish there were one or 2 more small blending brushes or shader brushes instead of so many face brushes.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, these brushes are exactly what I hope them to be.</li>
            <li> And fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid makeup user.</li>
            <li> and I would most definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Brushes broke off the handle first day when used..</li>
            <li> My daughters love them &amp; my sons girlfriend actually went online &amp; bought herself a set after seeing them.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I like how there is a variety in the brushes because they were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> They are okay if you&#x27;re starting out with makeup brushes and if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> These are well crafted and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely 100% recommend this to all of my fellow makeup lovers!</li>
            <li> cause it seems to work pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re all so pretty</li>

            <li> These brushes were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I recommend washing them first before using them (as you should with any makeup brushes) but it will prevent them from shedding.</li>

            <li> First time writing a review on amazon.best brushes ever.</li>
            <li> But I was incredibly happy how long it did last though.</li>
            <li> I washed them before I used them because they did smell like plastic at first, but that did not affect the quality at all.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Very thankful for the price!</li>
            <li> Overall love the product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> This is my first set  </li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;m just starting out this who make up thing .</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing another set very soon!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly know what EVERY brush is for.</li>
            <li> I was way overdue on getting some makeup brushes and I am so glad I finally did.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i need for mobile device repair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to caring about makeup enough to own a brush set.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft!!</li>
            <li> SUPER SOFT!!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re super duper soft, totally worth for the price.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes that had a wide aray of sizes, quality made , washed well, no shedding for a good price .</li>
            <li> They came right away, there was an intense odor of paint or Lacquer coming from the box.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes, easy to use, only downside is some of the hairs come out easily.</li>
            <li> Brushes are great for the price but the handles fell off of one them the same day and loose on another.</li>
            <li> dense enough to blend foundation, great for buffing in loose powder, foundation, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this set, I am actually thinking of buying another.. the brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li> Love that they blend make up to my face so nice, without removing extra conceiler from dark spots I got..</li>
            <li> Super soft brush, not smell wird, good quality for a little price.</li>
            <li> Super excited except when I was lookin at them they gave me two of the same ones I didn&#x27;t receive the eyebrow brush</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect as far as quality when I bought these, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge loss since the price was so reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great product for someone who is just getting into serious makeup.</li>
            <li> I think that the bristles are so soft which makes application so much better than my old set.</li>
            <li> Good simple brushes...recommend to anyone just starting out with make up</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set for beginners , just for the simple fact that it comes with a good selection of brushes for a full face, not like other inexpensive sets I have seen or even bought.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush set, very quickly I might add, and am pleasantly surprised by the high quality -- particuarly for the price.  </li>
            <li> Again super soft and picks up product!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not flimsy and super soft!</li>

            <li> They are SUPER soft brushes for being synthetic and apply makeup very well!</li>
            <li> Anyway, the brushes came faster than anticipated , they are super soft and I&#x27;m so ready to use them .!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason for the overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li> The brushes look exactly the way that they are shown - no false or misleading advertisement there.  </li>
            <li> This set has pretty much a brush for every need.</li>
            <li> The shipping was wonderfully fast and the brushes are exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> There were a couple of lose hairs on the brushed but other than that everything seems great.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted without the need to spend too much.</li>
            <li> They can be easily cleaned and dry super fast.</li>
            <li> Full complete 11 brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked the versatility of this set, very much comparable if not better than ecotools, and most of all the price.</li>
            <li> Comes with great soft brushes and a little carrying pouch!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure they will come in good handy when I&#x27;ll need a clean kabuki brush when the other two are dirty other than that great quality brushes and recommend them other people as well.</li>
            <li> Of course they also can in with the little baggy to put them in which is a huge plus!!</li>
            <li> I honestly figured the quality would be poor due to the great price.</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> They are holding up well and are super soft.</li>
            <li> There was a slight smell to the package, but I honestly think it&#x27;s just the plastic</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and I didn&#x27;t see any hairs fall out</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>

            <li> super soft</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed and are super soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are also SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> everyone has said, the bristles are SUPER soft.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles .</li>
            <li> Its so strong, I have washed them a couple times and only a couple have started to not smell.  </li>
            <li> I received the set, it had strong smell which went away after leaving it open for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> The products fibers/hairs are very soft to the touch, well worth the price</li>
            <li> Love every single things about this brushesüëçüëç</li>
            <li> hair fibers sometimes fall out on certain ones when washing.</li>
            <li> They are so soft, even on sensitive skin and the angled liner brush is pretty precise.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave  it 4 stars is because they are soft and fluffy and for the price they are pretty good brushes</li>
            <li> I got this brushes a few weeks ago and so far they are pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> Seller was very helpful when I asked about the tracking number and got back to me very quickly.</li>
            <li> They do not shed, even after washing a few times and the bamboo handles are super cute.</li>
            <li> The smaller brush are holding up just fine with washing.  </li>
            <li> Pretty decent brushes I guess.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, they look and feel very high quality</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft (my two year old likes to steal the short handled brush to swirl on her own face), and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a really strong smell to it which I was kind of expecting from the previous reviews, but as long as you don&#x27;t actually smell the brushes, It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Very nice set, gets dirty easily though.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price, but they are a little too soft.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used them, bristles fell out right and left.</li>
            <li> I suggest if you are buying your first brush set by these high quality brushes don&#x27;t wear out delivery was fast</li>
            <li> Really really soft brushes, they are really good quality also not very many hairs came out, they&#x27;re dense but smelly</li>
            <li> The fluffy brushes are equally dense and great for powder or blush application.</li>
            <li> These have lasted me a few months now and are still in great condition after being used on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughter and she loves them so much she quit stealing mine.</li>
            <li> Very commanded ,will buy from this seller again</li>

            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> Recommend them and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really like this set.</li>
            <li> They came really fast, faster than I thought.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really have a whole lot to complain about at this price point.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy brushes..</li>
            <li> Too soft, just a few that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and love the wooden color of the handles.</li>
            <li> Most days, my makeup is very neutral and natural, but I also do heavier, darker looks occasionally.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are soft and come in different sizes.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li> The price is crazy good for how many brushes you get.  </li>
            <li> Really soft, I love these brushed.</li>
            <li> Brushes in a good assortment of shapes, with a range of soft to firm brushes for every purpose.  </li>
            <li> Super soft high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I loved all these brushes and at such a good price you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right for any beginner or professional.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, soft bristles, the brush sheds a little at first, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> There is some shedding from all of the brushes and the flat top kabuki shed out completely when I was washing it.</li>
            <li> My only other gripe about this set is that it lacks a good eye shadow brush to pack color on the lid.</li>
            <li> They have just the right amount of firmness and density - the flat top brush works well for powder foundations/mineral veils and is dense enough to blend liquid/cream foundation.  </li>
            <li> no loose hairs, came very quickly and packaged in a cute, plain canvas bag.</li>
            <li> They wash out easy and dry fast.</li>
            <li> Why?&lt;br /&gt;- Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;- very new products</li>
            <li> My favorite purchase on amazon were these for the price they are an extreme deal</li>
            <li> I like the wooden handle as it adds a unique touch to my brush collection.</li>
            <li> Other than that these are ok and does the job</li>
            <li> My makeup went on incredibly smoothly- better than with other brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I honestly have never purchased cheaper brushes before, being a makeup artist I always bought more expensive, I live by the term &amp;#34;you</li>
            <li> They are so soft and there is a large variety inside the eco bag they were sent in!</li>
            <li> so I use my brushes daily as well as clean them after every use.</li>
            <li> but I have 9 other fantastic super soft brushes to make up for it!</li>
            <li> Just as good if not better than some of my professional brush kits.</li>
            <li> So I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations as one of my colleagues was telling me about these $100 brushes (yikes).</li>
            <li> So many brushes that I am not sure what to do with half of them, but I love them all!  </li>
            <li> The small stippling brush works amazing for blending in concealer under your eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pencil brush: round and pointy, great for bottom lash line, highlight on inner corners, other detailed areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat</li>
            <li> I just receive it in the mail and it pretty soft</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and really pack on color!</li>
            <li> Really nice and fluffy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and these are by far my favorite brushes especially for the amount I paid!!!!</li>
            <li> Overall good product, the only thing I would change is actually having a label on the sides of the brushes like &amp;#34;foundation brush, eyebrow brush, ect.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Oh and they are really pretty and soft too.</li>
            <li> Brushes are really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed to much!</li>
            <li> First impression is that they&#x27;re really soft.</li>
            <li> Brushes are completely falling apart after the first use.</li>
            <li> Was sent with prime so it was fast like normal.</li>
            <li> But so far they&#x27;re exactly as the picture and description.</li>
            <li> i can say for certain they are very soft.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the large round kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> They were well packages and came in a cute little bag.. fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> These may be my go to brushes from now on when I need new ones!</li>
            <li> so I decided to purchase some new ones, but didn&#x27;t want to fork over that much cash.</li>
            <li> They really just smell like brand new plastic.</li>
            <li> Seriously, no shedding.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if you already have a decent set or collection of brushes you can skip these.</li>
            <li> of the set: love the smaller eyeshadow brushes, especially the angled blender.</li>
            <li> Foundation brush broke after 3 uses, and I had to super glue it back on.</li>
            <li> I guess this is a classic case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Particularly because of the travel sized brushes.</li>
            <li> love the bamboo wood,makes them look even more expensive.</li>
            <li> I was only able to find 1 in the bunch that I could actually use.</li>
            <li> One of the main ones I wanted this set for came unglued from the handle after 1 use.</li>
            <li> I really like that the brushes are nice and thick and the hairs don&#x27;t fall out when used.  </li>
            <li> decent brushes.</li>
            <li> only wish the names/type of brush was written on the handle to make it easier to quickly grap from drawer</li>
            <li> i mainly use the skinny angle brush and maybe one of the skinnier brushes for contour on my nose.</li>
            <li> Since then, they are holding up okay, only shedding a bristle here or there (just the larger brushes).</li>
            <li> wow these are better quality than i expected.</li>
            <li> Love them and the entire set is about a third of the price of the one brush I tried at the makeup counter.</li>
            <li> The brushes look ok and didn&#x27;t shed so far.&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because I didn&#x27;t receive 2 brushes ( angled brush and the third from the left( don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality for the price only problem is that I received duplicates of two brushes and did not receive either small or large angled brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes do not shade much and they are very soft.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and work really well.</li>
            <li> very well packaged very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, inexpensive, and get the job done!</li>
            <li> Very soft and does its job well!</li>

            <li> I have been using for 3 weeks and so far they have held up very well and are pretty soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> very soft and holding up well after 3 months of use!</li>
            <li> Other than that, though, they&#x27;re super super soft and densely packed</li>

            <li> These are much better than any other brushes I&#x27;ve bought and completely compete with my step daughters high end pro brushes.</li>
            <li> I use the bigger flat top kabuki one to stipple on foundation.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t tested all brushes, I tried the flat top kabuki and it was CONSTANT shedding.</li>
            <li> and you receive a cute little bag to carry them in)</li>
            <li> Only reason why this didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the kubuki brush had minor shading, but other than that there are great...</li>

            <li> They even came in a cute little bag.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re Decent soft brushes, no one wants to spend $30 on one make up brush if you&#x27;re frugle and want to save money</li>
            <li> Took off two stars because the main reason I bought this over many of the bargain sets was strictly for the angled brush that was missing.</li>
            <li> I love the flat top brush for foundation and the big fluffy one for powder.  </li>
            <li> Very veryyyy soft brushes.</li>

            <li> more brushes than i kno what to do with...gave a few to my mom.&lt;br /&gt;bristles</li>
            <li> Normally, I use the makeup applicator given with products.  </li>
            <li> -the are normal sized</li>
            <li> I normally use IT,MAC,Jane iredale and Lancome brushes.</li>
            <li> Normally one brush will cost what all of these do.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM, BUT IVE MISPLACED A COUPLE OF THEM.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with, beautiful and soft ...</li>
            <li> but if you could get past that the brush will really impress you and you&#x27;ll be glad you got them</li>
            <li> There were a few strands sticking out here in there on a brush or two, but I was able to pluck them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Came really early tha Brushes are really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed to much!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday when I&#x27;m going out love it...</li>
            <li> but it has pretty much everything you need if you are starting out like me.</li>
            <li> Not great quality, but really good for price.</li>
            <li> They do not have any strong odor whatsoever straight out of the little baggie.</li>
            <li> The brushes are new with high quality bristles.</li>
            <li> The down fall is that these brushes are too soft, but if you&#x27;re on a budget and this is all you can afford, like me, then buy them until you can afford better...</li>
            <li> I love the bristles on these brushes very soft yet firm.</li>
            <li> They are just right, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it is understandable that some of the brushes aren&#x27;t super useful, and there is a very slight amount of shedding (hence the 4 stars.)</li>
            <li> there was a slight chemical smell when I first got it, but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li> The face brushes could be a little fuller, but so far no fallout, and the eye brushes are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I ended up going to the store and purchasing a new foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I needed some new makeup brushes but didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li> I got these within 5 days while I live in salida california.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m intermediate and I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> I am new to the make-up world</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mind the cheaper quality since I rotate my brushes often and am always repurchasing new ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Kabuki brush is too soft and kind of hard to apply powder.</li>
            <li> So disappointing because I really need one of those lol</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the quality of these brushes for the price, they are so soft and not cheap like most of the cheaper brush sets on here.</li>
            <li> The quality is actually better than I expected and I like that they hold makeup just enough with being practically stained with it.</li>
            <li> Came in a cute, little bag!</li>

            <li> I feel like this is a decent set for beginners who are just starting to do makeup and aren&#x27;t ready to spend a lot on brushes.</li>
            <li> I have only had shedding from the second to smallest flat top brush</li>
            <li> Brushes are decent, they do have a &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; smell upon open but after a few washes they seemed to be okay.</li>

            <li> Different &amp;#34;stiffness&amp;#34; in the brushes (not sure on good wording there) Just like the different types of brushes should have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for good quality brushes (especially for my eyes) for months, but it doesn&#x27;t take long for you to realize that brushes are NOT cheap anywhere - regardless of quality.</li>
            <li> These are dutiable Super soft absolutely NO shedding.</li>
            <li> (since the large flat brush looks exactly the same)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try them out :) The ultimate touch would be to add a little booklet on which brushes or for what.</li>
            <li> Very very nice just for that little price!!!!!</li>
            <li> The ones I use most frequently are beginning to separate a little after only about a month.</li>

            <li> The wooden handles weren&#x27;t very appearing in picture and almost decided against them</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and durable.</li>
            <li> Its a hit and miss with the brushes while they&#x27;re soft, some of the bristles don&#x27;t pick up product well.</li>

            <li> They are so soft.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave them 4/5 stars are because their brushes are to soft.</li>
            <li> Washed them and no shedding so far</li>
            <li> Although, the fibers on these brushes are so soft and make up glides on with ease.</li>
            <li> I like the big brushes but not so much of the skinny ones..</li>
            <li> In fact, I got these to go in my professional kit</li>
            <li> It looks very authentically wooden.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> So soft.</li>
            <li> Soft</li>
            <li> Took a couple weeks for shipping but completely understandable since it&#x27;s coming all the way from China.</li>
            <li> I was positively surprised by the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li> soft ..</li>
            <li> the brushes are really soft and distrubute even color.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and the brush hairs dont fall out, they blend my foundation and eyeshadows</li>
            <li> No shedding so far.</li>
            <li> Only giving two stars because of the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how soft the makeup brush set was</li>
            <li> Amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li> I like how soft and durable they are.</li>
            <li> soft, no animal hair</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and hold up well.</li>
            <li> They are soft, but not flimsy as some brushes can be.  </li>
            <li> The foundation brushes are soft and work well, yet the eyeshadow brushes do not blend and pick up color well.</li>
            <li> Really soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are INCREDIBLY SOFT.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes.</li>
            <li> Not makeup artist or professional quality but</li>
            <li> So soft on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> nicer than expected and deff worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> There is probably a few more than I will actually use, but I can keep to replace the ones i use.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and have a decent amount of density to them, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, just having fun with my face, and wanted to try new styling with different types.</li>
            <li> I slightly pulled on the bristles and there was no shedding, all of the brushes are full and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many other brushes before these and these are way softer than more expensive brushes that I have bought.</li>
            <li> the only problems I had was how long it took to ship, and after about 4 or 5 uses of one of the brushes, the glue came loose and the top fell off.</li>
            <li> I wish there was 1 very large blush brush / powder brush but the larger of the selection will suffice, especially at the price!</li>
            <li> I washed them with hot water and soap, let dry overnight and used in the morning -this morning.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this brushes have a very strong chemical smell that won&#x27;t go away even when you wash them.</li>
            <li> One of the smaller brushes broke all in all they feel so soft on my skin my first brushes were the elf brushes they were only a dollar at Walgreen&#x27;s (go figure) and they made my skin itch</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how short they are at first, but that was only because I was used to my tall Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft but they are also way too big for the eye area and because the brushes are really soft it makes it harder to pick up color.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re also new to makeup and don&#x27;t want to spend so much on the actual brand ones</li>
            <li> The smaller &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; style brushes were the main issues for me.</li>
            <li> They did exactly what I expected and felt really soft.</li>
            <li> or they were decent quality, but overpriced (think individual brushes at $25-50+).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty rough on brushes and so far the brushes have been holding up.  </li>
            <li> There was a slight smell but one quick cleaning</li>
            <li> They have a little bit of a smell to them, but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed these a few times now and they are still super soft.</li>
            <li> The metal parts of the handle look real and are pretty thick - not super cheap aluminum foil-looking junk.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased brushes and either the set was cheaply made and the bristles shed all over</li>
            <li> But, for the price I really didn&#x27;t expect it to hold long.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why the ends of all the brushes are like a light purple color</li>
            <li> The brushes work ok, but not good quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I expected them to be.</li>
            <li> Higher quality and softer than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re individually wrapped, soft and so far no hairs have fallen out.. can&#x27;t to use them!</li>
            <li> They washed fine without any shedding, although the cuts are uneven, especially around the edges.</li>
            <li> I got the brushed early and they are really soft and apply makeup well.</li>
            <li> The other brushes applied the makeup very well and soft without hurting your face!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used these a couple of times, but I really like them and they seem built to last.</li>
            <li> I like that the bristles is very soft but it had a very very short handle.</li>
            <li> The small kabuki is basically useless to me, but I have been able to find good uses for the other brushes.</li>
            <li> Better than some of the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> All of my other paddle brushes leave streaks, even my Real Techniques one!</li>
            <li> Super soft and fluffy!</li>
            <li> A few of the bigger brushes were nice but some of the shadow brushes were a little too &amp;#34;flingy&amp;#34; for powder.</li>
            <li> Mac bare minersls....</li>
            <li> Only downside is some of the brushes are too soft for my preference but that in no way takes away from the quality for this price point</li>
            <li> only problem is that they may be too soft for some of the brush needs</li>
            <li> I used the blush brush and it was soft but durable enough to apply my blues.  </li>
            <li> I left them out on the table to air out for a day or two and the smell was completely gone.</li>
            <li> I bought them as a second set I could use while I travel (frequently for work), so I don&#x27;t have to pack and unpack my home set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brushes are extra soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li> However, some of the bigger brushes were too soft for me to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> Wished the brushes were made from natural bristles, low grade quality.</li>
            <li> I would even go as far to say I would spend double what I did</li>
            <li> No regrets in purchasing this.</li>
            <li> but they won&#x27;t last in a professional setting.</li>
            <li> They are soft and durable with the bristles withstanding even daily cleaning.  </li>
            <li> They definitely match up to many of the more expensive makeup brushes I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft compared to my last set of Shany brushes.</li>
            <li> So far I use 3 or 4 of them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> i thought initially too soft but they do the job just fine.no stray bristles.</li>
            <li> Firstly they arrived a few days before scheduled delivery date, and they are ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with a set of nice make up brushes.  </li>
            <li> Two of the brushes are bent kind of weirdly and one of them, when I started washing it, started losing a lot of bristles.</li>
            <li> The smell others have reported goes away within a half an hour of opening it and is gone completely after you have washed the brushes with a gentle shampoo.</li>
            <li> They had a tad chemical smell to them, but they are super soft and thick.</li>
            <li> Very soft, bristles don&#x27;t fall out, and they&#x27;re definitely built to last</li>
            <li> They did have a slightly plastic odor when they first arrived</li>
            <li> The bamboo handle is sturdy, has a clear grain, and is coated in a nice, thick, hard, clear varnish.</li>
            <li> And they had NO loose hairs.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to make a clean line.</li>
            <li> The other brushes do not seem to shed quite as much.</li>
            <li> I now have some other brushes from Sonia Kashuk, Real Techniques and Elf.  </li>
            <li> Arrived much sooner than expected !</li>
            <li> The small Kabuki isn&#x27;t very dense, but the big Kabuki really is.</li>
            <li> Received about 3 of the same brushes, came in a little drawstring bag which is useful, but not to carry the brushes in.  </li>
            <li> Although these brushes are not that expensive, I can say that the quality is good, and it can last a long time.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea of my makeup ability level, I am not (by any means) a professional makeup artist, but my daily makeup regime consists of primer, foundation, concealer, powder, bronzer, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, and tinted lip balm‚Äîso, pretty heavy makeup.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect professional quality similar to MAC or other high end products when you are paying a tenth of the price.</li>
            <li> I go through brushes like crazy and at least 2-4 sets on any job depending, and I am so happy to have this option now!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend both for professional use or if you&#x27;re just starting out wit makeup like myself!</li>
            <li> It takes a little long time to get to you, but they are definitely worthy to wait.</li>
            <li> The little bag it comes in is really convenient too!</li>
            <li> No fall out, they do smell a little funny</li>
            <li> Love the wooden base, also the brushes are super soft...</li>
            <li> Great brushes but didint get the plus brush:(</li>
            <li> Only complain would be that they don&#x27;t grab on as much product as other brushes.</li>
            <li> They no long smell.</li>
            <li> Love the brushed but just realized there were a few missing from my order.</li>
            <li> And even a fluffy brush I&#x27;ve heard so much about!</li>
            <li> I like this set in particular because it has all the brushed I need‚Äîas opposed to other sets that have too many big brushes, unnecessary detailing brushes, etc.</li>
            <li> and they be super hard that when you use them on your face you feel nothing but bristles scraping you?</li>
            <li> But over all very soft every single one of them!</li>
            <li> They are all really amazing and soft my only complaint is that the brushes that you use presumably use as eyeshadow blending ones are far too big for such, that was a bit of a let down, but not enough to mark it down any stars.</li>
            <li> They feel like decent quality brushes in your hand, and are very minimal in respect to shedding.</li>
            <li> Not a single brush is left unused.</li>
            <li> but i have not expected this quality for such low price.</li>
            <li> These have bamboo handles, so soft and long lasting.</li>
            <li> but apparently it&#x27;s considered different because one has a really short handle...</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price!:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, unfortunately this brush set didn&#x27;t last long, as hairs became loose and kept falling out in bulk on face.</li>
            <li> I havent expierenced much sheeding, the only negative is when the brushes first arrived they had a really strong weird scent.</li>
            <li> It arrived way earlier than the expected delivery date and they are very soft.</li>
            <li> Works really well and comes in a little pouch.</li>
            <li> Only thing is make up will stick too much, and when I go to wash it, its not completely clean.</li>
            <li> It is very soft on the face unlike some other brushes that feel like my husband&#x27;s beard stubble.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes bristles is starting to fall out but other than that they are very soft.</li>
            <li> I had to order some new ones because my bare minerals brushes were leaving little strands all over my face-</li>
            <li> Nice set of brushes, very soft but disappointed they don&#x27;t have written on them what they are used for.</li>
            <li> They are very durable but the hair fibers are really stiff and synthetic.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it shipped 3 days early</li>
            <li> So soft and extremely well made.</li>
            <li> but you can always go back with the flat kabuki to blend it out!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very very FLIMSY which makes hard to blend any product (foundation, cream blush, etc) into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality is on par with expensive brushes and it pretty much cover all of my needs.  </li>
            <li> They are not marked if you are just starting out with makeup brushes,  and when taking out of package mine shed quiet abit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this four stars only because I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to truly judge.</li>
            <li> It kind of has an awkward length, it has long bristles</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a large brush to come with the set, but they are all really small.</li>
            <li> decent brushes, some are a bit stiff</li>
            <li> Seriously, for the price like this, I jumped right for it.</li>
            <li> , it has a flat end</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stare&#x27;s because I did not care for the shortest brush which was very weak and did not perform well, because the bristles aren&#x27;t strong.</li>
            <li> Very soft little to no shedding still breaking them in n</li>
            <li> They are like my toys (if that doesn&#x27;t sound weird enough.)</li>
            <li> They recently started getting dry and shed</li>
            <li> I mainly use the little kabuki brush and the eyeliner brush (though I use it for my eyebrows-best brush I&#x27;ve had for them!).</li>
            <li> I use these daily for my brows, eye shadow, blush, loose powders, etc.  </li>
            <li> They do smell weird but air them out and toss all the packaging material and they should be fine.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier because for some reason these are actually holding up better than the expensive brushes that I had been buying previously.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that the glue rubbed off and one of the handles feel off and it&#x27;s starting to do that for other brushes too.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, but the cut of the brushes is a little too blunt.</li>
            <li> Wash them, smell is gone and they are amazingly soft and well made, little shedding.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the eyeshadow brushes tend to be a little too far apart to blend eyeshadow well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve survived the initial &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; test (shampoo, condition, air dry and pull at the fibers with your nails) without shedding a single hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re crazy cheap too!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I am not a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> but they do they long to deliver.</li>
            <li> Brushes were smaller than expected</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and firm.</li>
            <li> But if your not a professional and are not picky with your brushes for the price I say go for it.</li>
            <li> They dried and still feel so so soft ...</li>
            <li> Minimal to no shedding, I have washed them multiple times without any problems.</li>
            <li> no wow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional make up artist</li>
            <li> complete waste</li>
            <li> This brushes have laste a long time now.</li>
            <li> Really soft but firm.</li>
            <li> well spent they came earlier than the estimated date and</li>
            <li> Last week, I was at a super-center and spent a lot on ELF products.</li>

            <li> Wish I could go gaga the way others have, but all the fluffy brushes are way too soft and a chunk of bristles from the blush brush fell out immediately.  </li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t last as long as some of my other brushes would</li>
            <li> I have always been horrible at applying foundation but thanks to youtube tutorials and these brushes, I&#x27;m getting better!</li>
            <li> I literally only used two brushes, one for eyes and the other for bronzer.</li>
            <li> Better than any expensive brushes I&#x27;ve owned and the travel bag is so convenient!</li>
            <li> other big name retail</li>
            <li> Two years later, all my brushes are holding up extremely well.</li>
            <li> and I can tell they will hold up for a long time!</li>
            <li> but I figured they&#x27;d at least last the first few applications.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little more difficult to work with</li>
            <li> A very minor thing to me.  </li>
            <li> (the face brushes took a while to dry after being washed)</li>
            <li> Both the larger blush/powder brushes and smaller eyeshadow/liner brushes have firm bristles.  </li>
            <li> I use them every single day, wash them like once a week, and they aren&#x27;t showing any signs of falling apart.</li>
            <li> but after a single cleaning they all smell like makeup now.  </li>
            <li> I use the blending brush in this set every single day.  </li>
            <li> Very little shedding on my friend&#x27;s set of brushes and none with mine so far.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I expected and the small kabuki and flat one are basically the same in terms of the brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes were certainly a good investment for me in particular, because I don&#x27;t have any other brushes (other than my E.L.F. ones that cost a dollar and are horrible quality).</li>
            <li> Have not had any problems with losing any bristles or with loose brush heads.  </li>
            <li> but I find that it works well with loose powder.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought some makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> The product shipped earlier than expected and meets my expectations!!</li>
            <li> This entire package cost less than the single brush I needed from Sephora.</li>
            <li> not high end brushes but work</li>
            <li> I wish it came with some other (useful) brush rather than the small sized brush ( i have not used the small one yet )</li>
            <li> So, now my makeup goes further with less.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a really weird smell when you first open it</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;d definitely recommend these, especially due to the low price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had one brush loose a few strands, but for price you pay its still a deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for a little over a month now and finally decided it was review</li>
            <li> These brushes were a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have not had any negative reactions at all.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is the Kabuki brushes(handles) are very short</li>
            <li> However, I used the stippling brush daily for my fundation and after being washed a few times, it started shedding.  </li>
            <li> but didnt arrive till a week after the expected delivery.</li>
            <li> Came in sooner than expected</li>
            <li> The angled brush for brows is quite wide</li>
            <li> This is a neat set with a wide range of brushes, and they seem well made.  </li>
            <li> I really like these brushes...except the pencil brush was broken when they arrived...</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no complaints with them.  </li>
            <li> The foundation brushes aren&#x27;t firm enough for blending in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom, knowing she would only need a few and would offer me the rest.  </li>
            <li> No smell, a bit of shedding, but only a few hairs every now and then.</li>
            <li> They arrived a week before expected</li>
            <li> it was to be expected just not so soon.</li>
            <li> Colors are not very pigmented and even with a MAC primer they did not show or stay well.</li>
            <li> I use a few of them daily.</li>
            <li> They have some shedding, but not much.</li>
            <li> Came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> These brushes came in sooner then expected s well.</li>
            <li> Looking into the brush head, there was just a dab of dried glue which wasn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> These came and work as expected.  </li>
            <li> She uses them everyday, since she is just starting out to wear makeup and learn about brushes.</li>
            <li> It took longer to arrive than I expected but I understand that&#x27;s not their fault</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really to be expected with all</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re soft but thick.....</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed, are reasonably priced, and just varied enough for the casual make-up-wear-er.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and subtle on my face, and no bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would say is wrong is that they should label the brushes for new beginners to the make up world.</li>
            <li> Only thing I would say is wrong is that they should label the brushes for new beginners to the make up world.</li>
            <li> I thought the brushes would be bigger but there small.</li>
            <li> But, other than that I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> The other brushes don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even try them because they triggered a skin reaction just from opening the bag; my son ended up with an asthma attack due to the stench.</li>
            <li> Wide variety of sizes and shapes!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I am not sure how to tell some of them apart.</li>
            <li> The bag had a weird smell at first but the brushes didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to other people.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t have any wierd smell like some of the other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> The fluff brushes are fluffy and the angle brushes are sharp and firm and it is such.</li>
            <li> Came with my other order too</li>
            <li> They are sturdier than I expected!</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t smell like some of the other reviews I read and the bristles have not fallen out all over the place like other reviews have said.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t shed like other brushes.</li>
            <li> and I only received 11, missing the eyebrow comb/brush!</li>
            <li> It works for other things, just not packing color on the lid.</li>
            <li> I would really give this a 10/10 because there&#x27;s barely anything wrong with this kit!</li>
            <li> I would really give this a 10/10 because there&#x27;s barely anything wrong with this kit!</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes but I didn&#x27;t receive the angled eyeliner brush :(</li>
            <li> Holy cow, they smell like they just came out of gear oil or some other oil/gasoline/chemical smell.</li>
            <li> A little book that tells you what all the different brushes are for I&#x27;ve never seen a few of the types in this set</li>
            <li> The blending brush is a little thin if you ask me, and I&#x27;ve never cared much for concealer brushes.</li>
            <li> fluffy blending brush:&lt;br /&gt;Great for contour, concealer, maybe a little too big for the eyes</li>
            <li> because once I took them out the smell was very minimal.</li>
            <li> Both of them had similar issues with shedding, the smallest was just poorly finished, and the slightly bigger one was trying to come off</li>
            <li> My set came without the eyebrow brush :(&lt;br /&gt;Other than that brushes are exactly as pictured, bristles are soft and pick up color</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft, have thick bristles, and do not shed at all!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a pointed one to get into the eye crease, the small angled for highlighting under your eyebrow, and the flat ones for lid.</li>
            <li> a few loose bristles came off, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I notice I&#x27;m using even less products due to the even distribution.</li>
            <li> The only things is the kabuki brush is a little way too small</li>
            <li> Very high quality and for the price you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> only downfall of the product was that it smelled incredibly bad when I first got them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to late to send them back, I used them before I counted them</li>
            <li> and I have been using them daily for the past few months.  </li>
            <li> Literally has every brush that the average woman needs every day...</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that you have no idea what brush is used for what.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is I wish they came with</li>
            <li> The other eyeshadow brushes leave a little to be desired.</li>
            <li> Not even close to makeup brushes, EXTREME MISSHIP!</li>
            <li> And I mean a chunk, not one, two, ten, but the brush is ruined even though I never used it.  </li>
            <li> Using them i saw very minimal fall out, even my tarte brushes have a little fall out so that doesnt matter to me.</li>
            <li> Definitely guarantee for anybody, no matter if you obsessed with make up or just do something simple.</li>
            <li> Also they got here in less then a week</li>
            <li> I would have reviewed these product with a five star if it wasn&#x27;t for one of the brushes that broke a month and a half after purchase.</li>
            <li> What else would you expect for less than 15.00?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just mad at myself for not counting the bushes right away.</li>
            <li> but I think some of the eyeshadow brushes are too big and not good quality</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bristles are very tight.</li>
            <li> Only down fall was they seemed almost dusty and had a odd smell .</li>
            <li> Can be an easy fix, just annoying.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes but they &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; really really bad!</li>
            <li> The one that comes in this kit still works but my Mac one is a little fluffier</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift and was a little hesitant</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the little mini brushes</li>
            <li> and I was a little weary about ordering them.</li>
            <li> I researched for a couple of days before ordering these, and I was still a little nervous.</li>
            <li> And I also didn&#x27;t get the little bag to put them in</li>
            <li> They look just how they look in the pictures and they came in a little bag as featured in the pictures as well.</li>
            <li> It took a little while for shipping but the quality has exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li> Just the one short brush showed weak performance.</li>
            <li> Hoping that with some use and washing it&#x27;ll spread out a little.</li>
            <li> My heart melted when I saw the little kabuki brush...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smelled a little bit like plastic and glue</li>
            <li> handle:&lt;br /&gt;-some are a little bit bulkier</li>
            <li> Has a little smell to it.</li>
            <li> Comparable to the expensive brushes I&#x27;ve - they all get the same treatment wash disinfect and let over night to dry then blow dried for fluffiness -</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product 5 stars is the exact rating it deserves!</li>
            <li> The bush hairs are very soft although very thin in density.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not comfortable wearing make up</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed or waste make up.</li>
            <li> Missing pieces.</li>
            <li> A few brushes I would never use but for the price a paid can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> Noticed the heavy chemical smell that others have stated.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Sigma brushes, MAC brushes and found a lot of fall out after a few months.</li>
            <li> I have used them everyday now for over a month</li>
            <li> so fluffy???????</li>
            <li> It took a few washes after using makeup for the smell to go away.</li>
            <li> Few brushes broke as soon a</li>
            <li> Can handle everyday use.</li>
            <li> They have everything needed for everyday looks.</li>
            <li> It Was A Waste Of My Money.</li>
            <li> They are not cheap looking at all.</li>
            <li> I bought the set because I needed a few of the brushes</li>
            <li> Not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I have used the brush for liquid foundation everyday</li>
            <li> the smell goes away in a few days.</li>
            <li> I keep quite a few brush sets on hand to make my life easier.</li>
            <li> No cheap paint or chemical smell.</li>
            <li> It has been a few strands out of place</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer to have to swipe a few times rather than swipe once but waste lots of my makeup.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> A few of mine were cut unevenly, but I can still find uses for them.</li>
            <li> (I washed them as soon as I got them) and there has been no fallout that I have noticed, and I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a few months and washed them quite a few times.</li>
            <li> Four stars for the missing brush, would have been 5.</li>
            <li> A few days before I had make another order and some of that stuff still isn&#x27;t in.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s some false advertising here because they definitely didn&#x27;t come with the added bonus brush....</li>
            <li> I was very upset and mad about this</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find them stiff at all.</li>
            <li> The dense brushes are dense without being too stiff.  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed at the short kabuki one its not full enough like it should be</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy these brushes at first because of some of the bad reviews, but I decided to give then a try anyway.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, my package was missing the small angled brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like how firm the bristles are.  </li>
            <li> i needed just something small until I could get my sigma brushes and this was a waste of money to me .</li>
            <li> The kabuki brushes are not ideal for liquid or cream foundations however, as the bristles are not dense enough.</li>
            <li> I needed new brushes, but think it&#x27;s crazy to spend a lot on them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an &#x27;all things makeup &amp; makeup related&#x27; fanatic!!  </li>
            <li> that was disappointing and they got here pretty late!</li>
            <li> Very little shedding that I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> Very little shedding</li>
            <li> Same quantity as some of the expensive brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> Instead I got another small shadow brush with a darker handle.</li>
            <li> The brushes come with a small list of what the brushes are called which is helpful.</li>
            <li> i never wash them because im lazy</li>
            <li> I use them everyday &amp; they are not shedding!</li>
            <li> and I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought more expensive brushes in the past and been disappointed.</li>
            <li> came in a small burlap type material bag.&lt;br /&gt;Seemed</li>
            <li> Wish I got that instead of pointless bag.</li>
            <li> I can already tell that the pencil brush is going to be one of my favorites as it is dense and small.</li>
            <li> Now I have to look for a replacement, but I&#x27;m not sure I want to order another set in case</li>
            <li> This kit doesn&#x27;t have a small shadow brush for</li>
            <li> Too small for my liking</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this purchase, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> so I usually just apply the shadow on my lid with my finger</li>
            <li> Order this if you are a casual or moderate brush user.</li>
            <li> they are very fluffy...</li>
            <li> VERY few hairs come out, maybe i have pulled 3 off my face in a month and thats using 4-6 brushes every day.</li>
            <li> For the money, I&#x27;d recommend the set, but just be prepared to lose a brush or two due to poor quality control.</li>
            <li> Some shedding on the small thick brushes...</li>
            <li> But these are definitely high quality brushes I&#x27;m obsessed with the powder brush foundation brush and blush/ broken brush!</li>
            <li> In comparison to the ELF brushes, the ELF brushes were hard and gave streaks....</li>
            <li> These brushes do not leave any little hairs behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought make up brushes in the mall and lately it hasn&#x27;t been in the budget.</li>
            <li> I ordered them late August.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Negative:</li>
            <li> Broken brush and others missing.</li>
            <li> Hope that will slow with continued use.</li>
            <li> Very little to no shedding!</li>
            <li> Sad to say the brushes immediately started to shed so they were not very useful.</li>
            <li> if you do not hear from me again, that will mean that these brushes washed well.</li>
            <li> Sephora sells ONE brush for 35$. This set less than 15$!!!</li>
            <li> unfortunately I just noticed which is a little to late to return</li>
            <li> I seriously cant believe I got them for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> Not a good quality.</li>
            <li> The bag is ugly and your basic drawstring</li>
            <li> After playing with them and feeling the bristles, I can&#x27;t believe I paid so little for them!!!  </li>
            <li> Store bought makeup brushes (of the same quality) are crazy expensive</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m veryyyyy skeptical when it comes to ordering online.</li>
            <li> I mean, $11 for all of them is a dollar per brush!</li>
            <li> I got tired of the eye showdown applicator tip coming off</li>
            <li> The others are too thin for my use and standards.</li>
            <li> but i got tired of paying $30 per brush.</li>
            <li> And seriously for the price these brushes have exceeded my expectations 10 fold!</li>
            <li> And seriously for the price these brushes have exceeded my expectations 10 fold!</li>
            <li> No shedding or weird smell.</li>
            <li> but i have this weird obsession of collecting make up brushes</li>
            <li> They feel like the expensive ones in the store without the price tag.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t receive my order.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes are poor!</li>
            <li> These brushes have a terrible smell to them, its a cross between glue and nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d Recommend these to anyone who loves make up brushes or is obsessed with makeup.</li>
            <li> For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> Got tired of picking them off of my face!</li>
            <li> I found it a bit difficult to match the brush with the picture</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price of these as well..  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the pouch though, which was sad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t return the items because seller has a 3 day policy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for quality brushes that werent expensive.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the powder brush because it is so small</li>
            <li> Bronzer, blush and eye shadow tend to all come off of the brush in one area and is difficult to then blend.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I tried to use a foundation brush it shed on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with these.</li>
            <li> and it was just a horrible mess.</li>
            <li> Had a crazy nail polish remover smell when opened up.  </li>
            <li> They look do expensive !</li>
            <li> they have a really bad smell to them.</li>
            <li> I do not have anything bad to say about these.</li>
            <li> bad smell.</li>
            <li> SO So SO bad.</li>
            <li> those who gave these brushes a bad review because they aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> As someone else posted, they do smell bad</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying them because of the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;d really bad when I wash them.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> think I hate</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> it was horrible</li>
            <li> They smell terrible even after washing them</li>
            <li> 3 stars because the packaging the brushes came in smelt disgusting along with the brushes.</li>
            <li> There was a horrible odor in the the orange fabric bag</li>
            <li> Worst makeup brushes you can buy!</li>
            <li> They are horrible and smell like gasoline.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes were absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have a horrible odor, smell comes out after washing them.</li>
            <li> Do I think they are horrible?  </li>

            <li> Nice brushes and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for a great price.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with them when I first got them about 2 months ago. They are very nice!  However, I used the stippling brush daily for my fundation and after being washed a few times, it started shedding.  The smaller brush are holding up just fine with washing.  The powder brush is doing good too, but it has only been washed twice.  These are great for the money, but do not expect this to be your main brush set.  I will continue using them for lighter use that do not require deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> Got these for my daughter and she loves them so much she quit stealing mine.</li>
            <li> Brushes feel amazing!! They are so soft and there is a large variety inside the eco bag they were sent in! Just ordered another set as a gift!</li>
            <li> They are good brushes just wish it had the names in which they use it for. But great otherwise</li>
            <li> Very veryyyy soft brushes. I recommend to everyone. The downside it takes almost three weeks to received inside USA...</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved that I surprised her with this , she said it&#x27;s pretty good product considering the price , very soft bristles</li>
            <li> I just receive it in the mail and it pretty soft but it is shedding and I ain&#x27;t even use it yet</li>
            <li> Great set for the price!!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I am not a professional makeup artist. With that being said, I love these brushes! I think that the bristles are so soft which makes application so much better than my old set. I really liked all the different types of brushes and now have started to use them all. Before I had this set I literally only used two brushes, one for eyes and the other for bronzer. I am impressed and happy with the quality!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, so soft bristles</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes and work well didn&#x27;t have any problems with them but they do they long to deliver.</li>
            <li> Love it.  They are very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> great value for the price. i bought it primarily for the kabuki brush, but the other brushes are great. comes in a cute canvas carrying pouch as well.&lt;br /&gt;certainly more brushes than i kno what to do with...gave a few to my mom.&lt;br /&gt;bristles are VERY soft and the bamboo handle is comfortable to grip.</li>
            <li> I love it! These brushes are soft and really nice. They pick up product quite nicely as well. For the price and quality you can&#x27;t beat them!</li>
            <li> these are so perfect for starting out, it has so many little useful brushes like the kabuki brush and the angled brush for your eyebrows. the wooden handle wasn&#x27;t cheep and the bristles don&#x27;t shed even though I have washed them. so great starting set, definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Very soft and tender on the face</li>
            <li> It took forever to get it but I love these brushes! They are so soft and make my makeup look 100% better. They are worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Brushes were smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Well I think is a really good product</li>
            <li> These shed quite a bit!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about a week and love them! Very soft and hasn&#x27;t shed at all, great quality and the little bag they come in is great for traveling. Very impressed and worth the cost!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about two months and I still love them. Seriously, no shedding. They wash out easy and dry fast. I don&#x27;t have any sigma brushes to compare them to, however, they work like a charm. I use them every single day, wash them like once a week, and they aren&#x27;t showing any signs of falling apart. Honestly when the do I will buy another set of these exact brushes.</li>
            <li> AMAZINNGGGG! FAST SHIPPING! OBBSESSED!</li>
            <li> In love with these brushes absolutely fabulous. Great quality no shedding</li>
            <li> My brushes came in today! Super excited except when I was lookin at them they gave me two of the same ones I didn&#x27;t receive the eyebrow brush and that&#x27;s the one I was mostly excited to use other then that I really like these brushes great quality</li>
            <li> These are extremely soft brushes, really good quality for the price</li>
            <li> Okay so let me start with saying I am just EXTREMELY happy that I made this purchase!!! If you are looking for quality brushes and just can&#x27;t seem to bring yourself to paying $100+ you need to buy these ones! Everything is as promised and I love the bamboo handles (very sturdy) They are SUPER soft brushes for being synthetic and apply makeup very well! I have nothing bad to say about this product 5 stars is the exact rating it deserves!</li>
            <li> decent brushes, some are a bit stiff but once they are washed and used they tend to work good.</li>
            <li> I thought the brushes would be bigger but there small. But they are well made.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes a pretty good bit. The glue on the handle part is not the greatest (on two of my brushes, the handles have come off). But, other than that I can&#x27;t complain. What you have to realize is they are clearly cheap, these are not $20-$30 a piece brushes!! I think the quality is perfectly acceptable and they serve the purpose.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price, but they are a little too soft.</li>
            <li> Very commanded ,will buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> These brushes came quickly and look and work lovely. I am not too knowledgeable on brushes but these seem to be great and they come with a threaded satchel bag- but that honestly looks like it is falling apart. I choose these kit over the others because it seemed like it was a good mix of brushes, not too much of small brushes or bigger brushes, and it was good quality - so the handles wouldn&#x27;t be coming off. overall pleased with purchase. and oh yea includes small angle brush for liner - which some cases leave out :)</li>
            <li> Amazing price, for brushes this good! Love them!</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes! Can&#x27;t wait to try them!</li>
            <li> Best make up brushes you can get.  Great price too.  They never been shed.  I love the wood look</li>
            <li> I have to be honest... The first time I used these brushes, they came apart... brush from handle. Also, they smelled STRONGLY of chemicals upon arrival and opening. However, that being said, I still like them. They are SO soft, and pick up and deposit my make-up without any issues. If the chemical smell bothers you, wash them with baby shampoo or a brush cleaner before use. And if they happen to fall apart, it&#x27;s nothing that Krazy glue can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> Must haves!! Beautiful  brush  set very well made</li>
            <li> Super soft. Would have been better if they were labeled for beginners.</li>
            <li> OMG! I&#x27;m surprised with quality-price. I really loved this brush set. I truly recommend.</li>
            <li> havent use the brush yet and its falling apart already and they smell like chemical</li>
            <li> Really cute brushes! Good quality. The hair is very soft and in good shape. No shedding or weird smell. Feels good when used on face. The only problem I had is that the eye brush eats eyeshadow. The other brushes don&#x27;t have that problem. Overall very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Received a couple days ago. They are ok... they serve the purpose. Brushes are very soft, maybe alittle to soft. They are not marked if you are just starting out with makeup brushes,  and when taking out of package mine shed quiet abit.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. I have not noticed any shedding. Love them!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft i adore them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a lot of comments about it falling apart and what not, mine are perfect.  The hair is so soft and grabs the powders nicely.  For the price they are it is so worth it</li>
            <li> Great set up makeup brushes! This set includes just about every brush you would need for basic makeup application. The brushes are soft and durable. I wash mine after every use with MAC&#x27;s makeup brush cleaner and they are holding up really well. Great value for the price!!</li>
            <li> Smell funny, but works just fine. Great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I only got three brushes I was very upset and mad about this I do not recommend</li>
            <li> Love this brush set so much that I just bought 2 more sets to add to them!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these.</li>
            <li> LOVE!  Very good brushes and they perform as well as my higher end brushes.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I was worried because these were so cheap that they would not be decent. They work pretty well! The foundation brush is awesome and applies my face makeup better than any product I have tried so far. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because I find that I still reach for my MAC eye shadow brush. The one that comes in this kit still works but my Mac one is a little fluffier and I feel as though it picks up better pigment on the shadows. Still a great buy! I use all of the brushes :0)</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to be a great quality. They are sturdy and don&#x27;t shed like a lot of cheap brushes do. I think for the price this is a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.  Great product. Thanks</li>
            <li> These brushes reek of noxious chemicals. I couldn&#x27;t even try them because they triggered a skin reaction just from opening the bag; my son ended up with an asthma attack due to the stench. If you are even the slightest bit sensitive, skip this product.</li>
            <li> Love every single things about this brushesüëçüëç</li>
            <li> Took a while to get but i love these brushes. I would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Great quality! Love them&amp;szlig;</li>
            <li> Super soft are just as good as any I&#x27;ve tried. Mac bare minersls.... There is a brush in this set just like my fave mac brush. The mac one was $27 alone.</li>
            <li> These rushes are amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> Great variety of brushes for all different types of blending</li>
            <li> I could go on and on about how amazing these are! The packaging was nice and and they work phenomenally well! I would buy these again, but I won&#x27;t need to!</li>
            <li> I have to say ALL these brushes are awesome better than some of my very spendy ones. I&#x27;m a makeup artist so I use my brushes daily as well as clean them after every use. These are dutiable Super soft absolutely NO shedding. I have purchased multiple sets!!</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for or expecting</li>
            <li> These brushes are beyond amazing just ordered another I love them and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not comfortable wearing make up but i have this weird obsession of collecting make up brushes lol. Well any make up products actually. They are like my toys (if that doesn&#x27;t sound weird enough.) The main reason why i purchased this one was because they are cheap and they are additional to my growing makeup brushes. Honestly, I never expected these brushes to be great but it turns out, they are. I like them a lot. It arrived way earlier than the expected delivery date and they are very soft. I think it&#x27;s definitely worth  the money if you are just starting out with make up.</li>
            <li> L O V E! this word describe it!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast! The brushes are super soft!! Love and recommend especially for the Price!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!! They are extremely soft, have thick bristles, and do not shed at all! Very high quality and for the price you cannot go wrong. I highly recommend these. They only place this lost a point is the smell of the brushes. When I opened the package they smelled like paint, and it felt like I was inhaling toxins or something. I hoping for it to go away, but all in all these are the best!</li>
            <li> Most wonderful brushes for such a great price! So soft!</li>
            <li> Took a little longer to receive, but very good quality and drawstring bag included which I monogramed with a pen.</li>
            <li> The brushes were perfect and much softer than I expected. They also arrived weeks earlier than the given date. I would order again and again.</li>
            <li> Cannot beat the price! Great quality for little money. I use all different kinds of brushes and I use them on a daily basis. These brushes hold up use and cleaning! I love them.</li>
            <li> incredibly soft. love them</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice looking but a little too soft to work with, especially the kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li> they have a really bad smell to them. like strong chemicals</li>
            <li> good set to start off with and for self</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to buy these after reading all the negative feedback, but of the price I took a chance. They came very quickly (under a week) &amp; they were just as described. They work amazing! Brushes were in perfect condition. Same quantity as some of the expensive brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> These are amazing especially for the price! They are just as good quality as MAC, Bobbi Brown, Sephora, Ect. if you are looking for a good set of brushes for a fraction of the price of high end brushes, this is the buy for you!</li>
            <li> I love this set!! Ordered it, came in pretty fast and the quality is perfect! Seriously, for the price like this, I jumped right for it.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I was kind of iffy about buying brushes on Amazon but I was like it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try something different &amp; turns out I freaking love these brushes, they&#x27;re so soft on the face &amp; very easy to work with! Highly recommend if you&#x27;re just looking for some brushes but are on a budget! Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes for the price. They work better than some name brand brushes I have.</li>
            <li> great product for the price!</li>
            <li> The review title says it all these brushes are wonderful. Ive had them for a couple weeks now and I love them. They are holding up well and are super soft. Only downside is some of the brushes are too soft for my preference but that in no way takes away from the quality for this price point</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and glad that I got them for such an affordable price. They are so soft and precise. I haven&#x27;t used all of them but I&#x27;m really liking the ones that I did use so far.</li>
            <li> super soft brushes defiantly worth the price! only problem is that they may be too soft for some of the brush needs</li>
            <li> They are very soft, inexpensive, and get the job done!</li>
            <li> I just got them and the &amp;#34;chemical smell&amp;#34; only lasted for about three minutes after taking them out of the package. They are the softest brushes I have ever used! My shipment didn&#x27;t come with the bag but that&#x27;s alright since I wouldn&#x27;t have used it anyway.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes that had a wide aray of sizes, quality made , washed well, no shedding for a good price . I repurchased .</li>
            <li> Wide variety of sizes and shapes! I wish there was 1 very large blush brush / powder brush but the larger of the selection will suffice, especially at the price! These are very soft as well.</li>
            <li> High quality brushes. Highly recommend them. Great price.</li>
            <li> good for the price I suppose</li>
            <li> If you are an absulute beginner with no basic brushes then these are good. Otherwise, if you already have a decent set or collection of brushes you can skip these. I suppose for the price it is ok. However I was expecting more give the rave reviews. But for someone like me with mid-range brush sets these are just alright. This is a set I would give perhaps to a teenager who is just beginning to learn applying makeup and still experimenting as to which brush shapes she prefers working with.</li>
            <li> Great quality but didnt arrive till a week after the expected delivery.</li>
            <li> Great quality &amp; the price cannot be beat!!!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but good brushes, I didn&#x27;t really know what was for what so I think they should put instructions for which brush is for what, other than that they&#x27;re good..m if I knew what they were for</li>
            <li> great brushes a little smaller than expected but works wonderful!!</li>
            <li> Very nice. Soft but functional.</li>
            <li> Omg I LOVE these brushes. They pick up my make-up wonderfully, and are very soft.</li>
            <li> Thank you...fast shipping, soft brushes, really nice.</li>
            <li> Christmas Gift, good value, very well made</li>
            <li> There was a slight smell to the package, but I honestly think it&#x27;s just the plastic because once I took them out the smell was very minimal. The brushes are super soft and I didn&#x27;t see any hairs fall out so they&#x27;re pretty good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> these brushes are very soft and nice. They don&#x27;t shed or waste make up. I took off a star because I wish they were labeled or come with a card describing which each brush should be used for.</li>
            <li> Very good product and good value. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice and pretty set. The brushes pick up plenty of powder and pigment and actually clean up really well too. All of the bristles have been staying put. so if you&#x27;re looking for a set of brushes to start with these would be good ones to play with.</li>
            <li> REALLY love these brushes!  For the price you can&#x27;t beat them!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes.  Lots of bristles and they&#x27;re holding up nicely.  Better than I expected for the price..  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Love them, soft and work great</li>
            <li> Great brushes and came sooner than I expected</li>
            <li> Nice make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> Super soft and good quality!</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought some makeup brushes.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  Normally, I use the makeup applicator given with products.  I got tired of the eye showdown applicator tip coming off so I thought I would try this brand.  I used the blush brush and it was soft but durable enough to apply my blues.  The eyeliner brush was amazing.  I&#x27;ve never had makeup apply so nicely.  The eyeshadow brush worked nicely,as,well.  I rated it 4 star because The brushes are not labeled.  It would make life easier had each brush had its purpose labeled.  Who wants to take the time to figure out what brush is for what?</li>
            <li> I love this brushes, They are great for doing makeup. They don&#x27;t have the hairs fall out or anything, They look really nice.</li>
            <li> I love these makeup brushes! They feel like the expensive ones in the store without the price tag. They are soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I wish I have this brushes, I really love it! Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t receive my order.</li>
            <li> Initially couldn&#x27;t pass up these brushes because of the price, and i&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.  The quality is great, and the brushes are so soft on your face!</li>

            <li> i gave these as a gift, i don&#x27;t know much about make up brushes but she loved these and said they are really great quality. they come in a nice bag and aren&#x27;t a wallet breaker, if somebody needs a gift and likes make up, this is a safe bet</li>

            <li> Perfect brushes all shape sizes! I love these and they are super soft! You can contour and blend like a professional. Con- Took forever to recieve but well worth the wait! (Looks just like photo and you receive a cute little bag to carry them in) -the are normal sized</li>

            <li> Amazing! All the brushes I will ever need!</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic! I&#x27;ve been searching for good quality brushes (especially for my eyes) for months, but it doesn&#x27;t take long for you to realize that brushes are NOT cheap anywhere - regardless of quality. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect as far as quality when I bought these, but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be a huge loss since the price was so reasonable. WOW! I&#x27;m so glad I chose these. The brushes are incredibly soft but they do not shed. The all-over eyeshadow brush, crease blender brush and angled brush are better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used, and the foundation brush is amazing. Definitely worth buying if you&#x27;re on a budget, or if you just don&#x27;t feel like spending $10 on one makeup brush.</li>
            <li> Super soft high quality brushes. Shipping was fast too. Definitely a great buy</li>
            <li> I loved :) good quality</li>
            <li> Just got the brushes today! They are soooo soft, and look great. They have a little bit of a smell to them, but not bad at all. I&#x27;ve messed with them by tugging and brush them against my hand and NO SHEDDING. For $11 they are a steal. Can&#x27;t wait to use them!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush set for the price. If you need a brush set, go for this one.</li>
            <li> Love these soooo soft super early too a great quality</li>
            <li> Absolutely hands down the best buy ever. I saw that they were really cheap online and was hesitant to buy until I saw the rating. So I tried them! I have never gotten a more finished, flawless look from any other makeup brushes.  In addition to makeup brushes are very soft and easy to use. Love them!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and firm. I love them!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Missing pieces. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost. Love them</li>
            <li> Great quality! Great Price! Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> GREAT, BRUSHES, NO SHEDDING YET . PERFECT FOR MAKE UP, I RECEIVED ALL 11 PCS.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes their affordable and nice</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the quality of these brushes for the price, they are so soft and not cheap like most of the cheaper brush sets on here. I love them!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes so soft and well put together</li>
            <li> Lol but she is still fining out what all the brushes are used for</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet but they are so soft!</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes. Great quality!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for a little over a month now and finally decided it was review ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of the set: love the smaller eyeshadow brushes, especially the angled blender. They are very soft, easy to clean, great price, and nice assortment for someone trying to expand on their PERSONAL make-up techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons of the set: you do get what you pay for. The smaller &amp;#34;kabuki&amp;#34; style brushes were the main issues for me. Both of them had similar issues with shedding, the smallest was just poorly finished, and the slightly bigger one was trying to come off it&#x27;s handle first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend them for a customer like myself. I&#x27;m not a professional, just having fun with my face, and wanted to try new styling with different types. They have definitely impacted my application and have helped me in identifying what types of brushes I&#x27;d like to invest in for the future.</li>
            <li> Soft and beautiful brushes! Just what I was looking for(:</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how wonderful these brushes are. The price was amazing and the bristles are so soft. The quality is great. I would definitely purchase these brushes again.</li>
            <li> These look and feel great! Although they sent me a duplicate of one of the brushes, so make sure you check your order when it comes!</li>
            <li> I returned this as soon as I opened the package because the bristles on the brushes started coming out immediately! It is a nice variety of brushes, with really soft bristles, but what&#x27;s the good in that when they all fall apart on you?</li>
            <li> Have been holding up great! Love them</li>
            <li> Very nice. Very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I got the brushed early and they are really soft and apply makeup well. I use mouse foundation and the stippler brush applies it very well</li>
            <li> One of the smaller brushes broke all in all they feel so soft on my skin my first brushes were the elf brushes they were only a dollar at Walgreen&#x27;s (go figure) and they made my skin itch it was horrible so these were a relief from them</li>
            <li> The brushes are good quality for the price only problem is that I received duplicates of two brushes and did not receive either small or large angled brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and I enjoy using them. Only thing I would say is wrong is that they should label the brushes for new beginners to the make up world.</li>
            <li> Nice set of brushes, very soft but disappointed they don&#x27;t have written on them what they are used for. That would help with newbies to makeup !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the work it does</li>
            <li> I got this a while ago and it&#x27;s really soft and there&#x27;s no shedding. Works really well and comes in a little pouch.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, my package was missing the small angled brush. Instead I got another small shadow brush with a darker handle. They washed fine without any shedding, although the cuts are uneven, especially around the edges. Nothing a trim can&#x27;t fix. I do like the handles, their clear coat is thick and very shiny. Took off two stars because the main reason I bought this over many of the bargain sets was strictly for the angled brush that was missing.</li>
            <li> Love them very soft and great quality. Came in sooner than expected</li>
            <li> Bought this kit to be used with a makeup artist for my upcoming wedding. Used it once so far during my makeup trial. Although it sheds a bit, even the makeup artist commented on how soft the bristles were. I don&#x27;t know much about makeup, but this seems to get the job done. Good price for all the brushes you get!</li>
            <li> The quality of the brushes are poor! For the price I may have over look their flimsy density. But I purchase another set from another seller for the same price and the brushes were well made and not bendable. Also the handles were all different shades of brown!</li>
            <li> I like these brushes. They are very soft and have a decent amount of density to them, especially considering the price. They could stand to be a bit fuller, but I will overlook that because so far, they have worked quite well for me. The did have a bit of a smell to them when I first opened them, but it has faded with time. I really love the look of the wood; they are beautiful to look at on top of being useful. Worth the price, for sure.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast - looks just as pictured here - love it!</li>
            <li> Received brushes really fast! Great quality, super soft but angle brush has firmness but still soft. Well definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> They are so soft but when I got them I only had 11 not 12</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and not just for the price, they are amazing in general!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these</li>
            <li> Gahh üòç best brushes I hv ever owned. Very soft, bristles don&#x27;t fall out, and they&#x27;re definitely built to last</li>
            <li> These are pretty good brushes, the quality is very good for the price. I havent expierenced much sheeding, the only negative is when the brushes first arrived they had a really strong weird scent.</li>
            <li> Well I just got the brush set today..... They arrived SUPER QUICK they are very fluffy... I gave four stars because I have not yet used them and don&#x27;t know yet if they will perform..&lt;br /&gt;P.s: am so excitedüì¶üéâüòÅ</li>
            <li> Great quality and feels great on face! No complaints here!</li>
            <li> I did not receive all the brushes shown in the picture. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Really nice brushes! They came really quickly! I don&#x27;t like the little mini brushes but I knew they were included when I purchased this, overall very happy!</li>
            <li> Great price . Good set of brushes.  Big verity .&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Ok so the quality is according to the price so expect that. I have them for 2 days so far but:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- They&#x27;re very very FLIMSY which makes hard to blend any product (foundation, cream blush, etc) into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- They do the job, it just takes longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- They&#x27;re very soft, they haven&#x27;t shed so far and they don&#x27;t smell chemically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The angled brush for brows is quite wide so it&#x27;s hard to make a clean line.</li>
            <li> Love my brushes.  Good for the price</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrive on time and the quality is okay for the price. There is some shedding from all of the brushes and the flat top kabuki shed out completely when I was washing it. I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really great quality! And they come with a helpful guide. Definitely recommend for anyone who needs a basic set of brushes.</li>
            <li> They are ok ... A few brushes I would never use but for the price a paid can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> Nice makeup brushes for the price. Better than some of the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried in the past. So far they are holding up nicely. I wash them in soap and water once a week and all is well with them.</li>
            <li> I love these! They are absolutely perfect for the price. I read a lot of reviews about a chemical smell and I was a little weary about ordering them. They arrived and indeed did have a strong chemical odor. I left them out on the table to air out for a day or two and the smell was completely gone. I highly recommend this product. You really can&#x27;t beat the price for this type of quality.</li>
            <li> Love it and they didn&#x27;t shed, Really soft and good price</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are very soft and make my make-up look flawless. Great price!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes--arrived quickly. They&#x27;re holding up great--I use them daily.</li>
            <li> I love the flat top brushes. They work really really well with liquid foundations. I use the bigger flat top kabuki one to stipple on foundation. The little one works good for blush.</li>
            <li> Came in within a week and in wonderful condition. Super soft and applys beautiful. Made of synthetic and wood. I use the angled one most for my brows and love it! Also the blending one is wonderful as well and the flat brush. Again super soft and picks up product! Would definitely recommend too a makeup lover and a beginner.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice but I never received the bag that it&#x27;s supposed to come with üòî</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and really pack on color! They do have a stange smell when i opened them at 1st but once i let them air out it dissapeared. Would totally buy again.</li>
            <li> There was only 8 brushes. The brushes are soft so that&#x27;s a plus. I&#x27;m just mad at myself for not counting the bushes right away. It&#x27;s to late to send them back, I used them before I counted them and I threw away all the packaging.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I like the set. Still trying to decide if it actually picks up the powder well enough. Good purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality brushes.</li>
            <li> They smell terrible even after washing them</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic! And there are so many options provided in the pack that I can&#x27;t believe I got all of that for the price. The fibers don&#x27;t fall out of the brushes, and they aren&#x27;t SUPER dense, but they blend well and get the job done. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great product and i have many choices.of.brushes to choose from.great quality as well.</li>
            <li> Ok, what can I not say about these brushes. They are amazing, soft duo fibbers. I would recommend this set for beginners , just for the simple fact that it comes with a good selection of brushes for a full face, not like other inexpensive sets I have seen or even bought. Only reason why this didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because the kubuki brush had minor shading, but other than that there are great... and this is just my initial impression without washing or applying products. I fell in love at first site.... or should I say first touch.</li>
            <li> Foundation brush broke after 3 uses, and I had to super glue it back on. I would have just tossed it, but I need to buy another one first. I guess this is a classic case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Love these SOFT brushes!!</li>
            <li> Brushes are alot smaller than they appear in the photo. The bush hairs are very soft although very thin in density. As a makeup artist who already owns quite alot of makeup brushes I&#x27;ll only be able to use about 3 of these brushes. The others are too thin for my use and standards. But if your not a professional and are not picky with your brushes for the price I say go for it.</li>
            <li> Love them!!! I didnt recieve the angle brush though.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely so happy with these brushes. Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Perfect brushes. They don&#x27;t shed, are reasonably priced, and just varied enough for the casual make-up-wear-er.</li>
            <li> In love. Super soft. No hair falls out! Amazing!</li>
            <li> Great buy for a great product.</li>
            <li> Gift, but love Kabuki brushes</li>
            <li> Super soft brush, not smell wird, good quality for a little price.</li>
            <li> Love these. Great for the price</li>
            <li> This is a neat set with a wide range of brushes, and they seem well made.  I bought them as a second set I could use while I travel (frequently for work), so I don&#x27;t have to pack and unpack my home set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are longer-handled brushes and shorter-handled brushes for travel.  I&#x27;m not sure I like how firm the bristles are.  Both the larger blush/powder brushes and smaller eyeshadow/liner brushes have firm bristles.  Maybe it will take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft they are amazing for doing my makeup the reason I only put four is because I would have liked to know what each brush was specifically used for and why the brush set came with wo regular size kabuki brush and a mini brush I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use them all but I&#x27;m sure they will come in good handy when I&#x27;ll need a clean kabuki brush when the other two are dirty other than that great quality brushes and recommend them other people as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed these a few times now and they are still super soft. I&#x27;ve only had one brush loose a few strands, but for price you pay its still a deal. My makeup goes on super easy and these brushes hold makeup. So, now my makeup goes further with less.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really nice and now I only use these to apply my makeup. What a difference they have made!</li>
            <li> These brushes have a terrible smell to them, its a cross between glue and nail polish remover. Its so strong, I have washed them a couple times and only a couple have started to not smell.  They are very soft and seem to be good quality, but one of the brush heads is already starting to come off. Bought because of the reviews... Should have chose a different set. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. So many to choose form. Great quality.</li>
            <li> Love them! They came on fast and work great. They feel like really good quality as well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. I like them</li>
            <li> DragonPad 11 Pcs Makeup Brush Set Kabuki Powder...I love these brushes, the best part is how easy to clean they are and how smooth makeup goes onto your face.  I have to say my favorite one is the 3rd from right, it has a flat end and when I use my powder makeup this brush covers all the areas on my face and keeps it looking even.  I am amazed at the quality for the low price and I&#x27;d Recommend these to anyone who loves make up brushes or is obsessed with makeup.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 the texture of the brushes. The  brown cotton bag in which they are in is kinda crappy though.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!</li>
            <li> Good for price , soft, easy to wash , minimal shedding and I was my brushes after each use .</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes...except the pencil brush was broken when they arrived...boo. Will try to glue it together again but still, boo.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because they could have been a bit fuller. But good brushes overall! I recommend them! :)</li>
            <li> Everything I needed! Great price!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, you will gonna love this. Very helpful to me :)</li>
            <li> The packaging of the brushes were very simple and handy. The bag is soft and so are the brushes. They have a piece of paper that shows you the name of the brushes and how to clean which is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I love them they are so great and blend well (:</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and don&#x27;t shed. They are of much better quality than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Got them for extra ones for my handbag and I love them</li>
            <li> Like the feel of the handles and the bristles are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Got this delivered on a Sunday,  I ordered it that Friday. Brushes are really soft. Great deal</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with a set of nice make up brushes.  I use just about all of them. www.being40plus.com</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These are good brushes for the price. I am a makeup artist and got into a pinch where I needed a set of brushes in a hurry. Overall, these brushes did their job. They work well with blending and contouring. I think you get a good selection of brushes as well. I feel like this is a decent set for beginners who are just starting to do makeup and aren&#x27;t ready to spend a lot on brushes.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> SUPER SOFT!! no loose hairs, came very quickly and packaged in a cute, plain canvas bag. Will defiantly buy from seller again!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SET!!! Comes with great soft brushes and a little carrying pouch! I wanted to upgrade from my E.L.F set and this is perfect</li>
            <li> Great for beginners or as a travel set. The brushes are really soft and hold the product really well. Loved the fact that there was a good variety of both face and detail brushes. For the price, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing ! So soft , and amazing price.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Would buy again. Great quality for the price. The blending brushes are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love it, works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes! Super soft and super good quality</li>
            <li> Not a good quality. I would not recommend them even though they are very affordable. The hairs come off very easily. It is better two buy one quality brush instead.</li>
            <li> Quite possibly the best set of make-up brushes I bought on amazon. They did not &#x27;smell&#x27; like others that I have bought here on amazon. They came very fast and it is am amazing starter set! Particularly because of the travel sized brushes. They are very soft as well. If you are a make-up beginner and always tempted to buy ELF brushes DON&#x27;T! Get this one instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my bareminerals foundation and use one of the brushes to spread my moisturizer as well. Fantastic collection. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> Love all the brushes! Came in a cute, little bag!</li>
            <li> There strong and soft good quality</li>
            <li> I am in love with these brushes.  No shedding--even after cleansing!</li>
            <li> Loveeeee  these I feel so artsy using them. they look like paint brushes to me. I love the way the brushes feel on my face and my hands. Ready good fitfor the price  I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding yet and im hoping that it doesn&#x27;t but great set of brushes</li>
            <li> For the price you pay- these are awesome brushes! They&#x27;re not flimsy and super soft!</li>
            <li> These are so soft and I LOVE them. I&#x27;ve bought make up brushes in the mall and lately it hasn&#x27;t been in the budget. Imagine my excitement finding this unbeatable price I would spend that on one brush - these are so soft and super cute.</li>
            <li> Love em! Would so buy em again</li>
            <li> Great product, super soft and super Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> So these brushes are amazing!! I absolutely love them. The small stippling brush works amazing for blending in concealer under your eyes. And the blending eyeshadow brush is just fantastic! There is no shedding and the quality is really impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was the smell. Holy cow, they smell like they just came out of gear oil or some other oil/gasoline/chemical smell. I had to wash all my brushes because who knows where that smell is coming from. Also the beauty blender is nice and good size but it had the same smell. I washed it but it still stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall these are very nice and will be in my arsenal for a very long time. I did receive these at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest review. These are my experiences with this product and in no way did receiving a discount effect my rating.</li>
            <li> Great product for someone who is just getting into serious makeup. I do not know if they hold up the the standards of a pro, but perfectly suited my needs. Brushes are extra soft and do not shed. Great purchase</li>
            <li> Love these such good product</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!!!! They are so soft and my makeup goes on without streaking.</li>
            <li> This set is so soft!! I fell in love with this brush set!  The price is def worth it for these brushes! Would def buy again.</li>
            <li> Great brushes.  So far I&#x27;m very happy with them.  They&#x27;re soft and do not shed on my face.</li>
            <li> Sad to say the brushes immediately started to shed so they were not very useful. I ended up going to the store and purchasing a new foundation brush. The other brushes do not seem to shed quite as much.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great and shipped fast ! I am having a Christmas Eve party with my family and they came the morning of and I cannot wait to use them. They are soft and came in a cute baggy and greatly packaged ! Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> These 11 brushes are so so so pretty ... I washed them the first day I got them no shedding ... They dried and still feel so so soft ... I love the bamboo handles ... I&#x27;m so excited to use them ... I don&#x27;t even want to use them yet cause I love them ...</li>
            <li> Liked the brushes. However, one of them fell off the stick. Wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft, easy to use. I do wish the handles were labeled, but overall they do a great job and are priced well.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a while and they have held up.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Noticed the heavy chemical smell that others have stated. But, really it&#x27;s being shipped from halfway around the world and the quality is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Brushes are super soft. Good brushes for the money. Definitely compare to sigma</li>
            <li> Love the wooden base, also the brushes are super soft...big problem,  the brushes &amp;#34;SHED&amp;#34;! Got tired of picking them off of my face!</li>
            <li> Bought these to do dusting for product photography, working well for that. Had a crazy nail polish remover smell when opened up.  Left after a day of hanging the bag up while open.</li>
            <li> Great for beginners like me!</li>
            <li> Best. Brushes. Ever. So damn soft, absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> I like them a lot! They work really good and the brushes are very soft! Haven&#x27;t had any problem with these brushes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and totally worth it. Shipping was fast too. Only thing is that on one of the short brushes there was like a small chunk of glue but other than that it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of brushes. Very well made, no shedding w/use or washing.</li>
            <li> The kabuki brushes shed but the eye brushes are okay.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They wash nicely and there are so many different sizes to choose from. I really can&#x27;t believe they are priced so low. I have purchased Sigma brushes, MAC brushes and found a lot of fall out after a few months. I worried because of the price they would have a lot of fallout and issues would arise when washing them---but, so far so good!</li>
            <li> Clients love it for the price .bamboo nice</li>
            <li> Great set the wife loves them</li>
            <li> Very soft, which was what I was looking for when it comes to make up brushes. Applies makeup well. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason for the overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li> My new favorite brushes.  Soft bristles evenly distributes makeup.</li>
            <li> great brushes, very soft, better then expected.</li>
            <li> The brushes work great! What more could you ask for!</li>
            <li> Very pleased, Well made, came quickly. Different &amp;#34;stiffness&amp;#34; in the brushes (not sure on good wording there) Just like the different types of brushes should have. I have used them everyday now for over a month and they have held up wonderfully.  VERY few hairs come out, maybe i have pulled 3 off my face in a month and thats using 4-6 brushes every day.</li>
            <li> These are great quality and bristles don&#x27;t fall out</li>
            <li> The lacquer was a little strong when removed from the packaging but it faded away. The brushes are great, at a great price.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles. A good set to accompany other brushes</li>
            <li> These brushes are OK. There was a  smell to  them when I got them but I think it&#x27;s the bag that smelled cause I put the brushes  out over night and they no longer smell. Some of  the brushes  have a lot bristles and theywork well but  others don&#x27;t  so it&#x27;s worth  the money  but I wasn&#x27;t AMAZED.  I would still recommend these to someone who is a beginner with makeup</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush set. I purchased this set for the foundation brush and it&#x27;s nice and soft and grabs the mineral powder well.</li>
            <li> I love it ! Very soft , don&#x27;t shred . The bamboo material feels so great.  I got an item within a week, so I was so excited to not wait months to get an item. I think it is a great quality for such an affordable price. Definitely guarantee for anybody, no matter if you obsessed with make up or just do something simple.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Don&#x27;t leave behind any brush hair, very smooth good buy for the price!</li>
            <li> This brushes are awesome!!! Wow the best brushes I have!!!</li>
            <li> This are Amazing I love the feel of it against my face very soft.</li>
            <li> these brushes are fantastic!</li>
            <li> great brushes, soft and blend very well</li>
            <li> So soft! Great quality.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these make-up brushes, and I love them.  For a reasonable price, I have some quality brushes.  I splurged and bought some MAC products but could not afford to purchase all of the necessary brushes.  These brushes apply my make-up very well, and so far, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft</li>
            <li> I will start by saying I am no makeup expert, but I was very happy with my purchase. I have not had any shedding or problems.</li>
            <li> They came very quickly. Arrived in perfect condition. Have yet to use all the brushes because I am still leanring. The brushes come with a small list of what the brushes are called which is helpful. They are soft and the brushes I have used hold powder well. For the price I think they are pretty great!</li>
            <li> Just received my brushes. Feels really soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a risk purchasing generic brushes like these but I&#x27;m very very pleased with the quality. One of the brushes started shedding right away but not a hair from the others. The small kabuki is so perfect for blush it&#x27;s uncanny. Hugs the cheek and deposits the right amount of product. Even better is that it washes clean easily. What a relief.</li>
            <li> These are high quality brushes! Super soft!</li>
            <li> nicer than expected and deff worth the purchase. use them daily.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes but they &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; really really bad!</li>
            <li> These brushes were everything they said they would be.  They are great to use.  The brushes came in a pouch, which can be put in any overnight case or make up bag and not take up much space at all.  They are very classy and there is a brush for every need.  I got a set of of these for each of my daughters--- they love them.</li>
            <li> Overall, pretty good brushes. The reviews kind of made me think they were super great quality, which they&#x27;re not--they&#x27;re still really good for the price, but not as amazing as I was expecting. There&#x27;s a really weird smell when you first open it but I think it comes from the bag and it goes away after you wash it once. Two of the brushes are bent kind of weirdly and one of them, when I started washing it, started losing a lot of bristles. Other than that, though, they&#x27;re super super soft and densely packed and I&#x27;m so excited to use them!</li>
            <li> Good variety, excellent price, soft bristles. I needed new brushes, but think it&#x27;s crazy to spend a lot on them.  This kit is perfect.  The quality is on par with expensive brushes and it pretty much cover all of my needs.  Some of the smaller brushes are even perfect for foundation blending.</li>
            <li> Great price, quality brushes! Threw out my old ones when these came in. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great brushes that are holding up well - and quite a value for the size of the set.</li>
            <li> This set has pretty much a brush for every need. Almost too many. The quality is actually better than I expected and I like that they hold makeup just enough with being practically stained with it. Just wish the actual bag they came in was a bit higher quality.</li>
            <li> I just received these nice Soft Posh brushes,they remind me of my It cosmetic brushes.&lt;br /&gt;They did have a chemical smell but not too potent. I washed them and no fall out or shedding. I used them and they feel great on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;So far a Great investment for a Fabulous price. I normally use IT,MAC,Jane iredale and Lancome brushes. These are just as good.&lt;br /&gt;I love the bamboo wood,makes them look even more expensive.</li>
            <li> Honestly, best brushes ever!!! Great quality!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes! Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> A great product! I&#x27;m happy with the quality. The smell others have reported goes away within a half an hour of opening it and is gone completely after you have washed the brushes with a gentle shampoo. I set them to dry for 24 hours after washing and they worked perfectly afterwards.</li>
            <li> One of the handles removed. Too soft, just a few that&#x27;s good. Not the best to get.</li>
            <li> Wow i didnt think they were going to be that good and they are super soft love doing my make-up with this brushes :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome. Esp for the price. You get a good variety of face and eye brushes. And no bristle flake off. These brushes do not leave any little hairs behind. I&#x27;ve washed them a few times with mild soap and they are holding up great.</li>
            <li> Love them ! Very soft and does its job well!</li>
            <li> Great. Mine didn&#x27;t come with the eyebrow comb as advertised.</li>
            <li> Good quality for a great price!</li>
            <li> Love this brush set!  Very soft, good quality bristles and sturdy design.  Have not had any problems with losing any bristles or with loose brush heads.  These are very well made cosmetic brushes and the price is a steal.  I use these daily for my brows, eye shadow, blush, loose powders, etc.  They have been truly awesome to work with and I have absolutely no complaints with them.  They also come with a nice bag to keep them all in.  5 Star Product!</li>
            <li> Love em! I have had one fall apart tho but great brushes</li>
            <li> Love this brush set they are soft and they do not shed when you wash the brushes. They have a brush to apply to any area of the face</li>
            <li> I LOVE these!!!! I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive this set was. Normally one brush will cost what all of these do. I&#x27;m upset I didn&#x27;t know about them sooner. The quality is supreme. Very durable, but nice and light. Great size for me. (5&#x27;4&amp;#34; smallish hands). They apply my mineral powder or liquid foundations smoothly. I notice I&#x27;m using even less products due to the even distribution. Very happy!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are exactly what I expected them to be. They are extremely soft. While they did come in with a distinctive smell, I did have to wash them and no hairs fell out as I did this! Definitely recommend both for professional use or if you&#x27;re just starting out wit makeup like myself!</li>
            <li> These brushes have a wonderful feel to them! They are so soft and subtle on my face, and no bristles have fallen out. The quality for the price was phenomenal...These may be my go to brushes from now on when I need new ones!</li>
            <li> This is the first brush set that I have owned and used to apply makeup.  It is a great set for beginners. It works great with multiple types of brushes for face and eyes.  I love the flat top brush for foundation and the big fluffy one for powder.  These brushes do not shade much and they are very soft.  I now have some other brushes from Sonia Kashuk, Real Techniques and Elf.  Compare to them, this set does not look all that good, but for the price, it&#x27;s a great starting set for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the set, it had strong smell which went away after leaving it open for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> These are the softest brushes I&#x27;ve ever touched. They feel like cat paws booping your face.</li>
            <li> These feel really awesome and they worked for what I needed them. No bristles (as of yet) have come off at all, so they seem like good quality. They did exactly what I expected and felt really soft. What else could you ask for.</li>
            <li> I bought this set under my husband&#x27;s account. I been having this brush set for about two months now and have used them almost daily. I really like them. Minimal to no shedding, I have washed them multiple times without any problems. The eye brushes seem to not pick up product as good as my other brushes but I dont mind. They are cheap after all.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes so far. Very soft and seem  to be put together well. Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Really nice and fluffy!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. They are soft and spread my makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> Great variety of brushed. Holds the color of your powder well and are very soft.</li>
            <li> OMG these are fantastic.  Just bought as a stocking stuffer for myself and ended up with best product ever!</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is I am not sure how to tell some of them apart.</li>
            <li> BEST BRUSHES EVER POINT BLANK! Very soft to touch and work wonders!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THEM, BUT IVE MISPLACED A COUPLE OF THEM. I JUST REORDER ANOTHER SET..</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and blend makeup in really well, I love them! Great quality expecially for the price</li>
            <li> much better qualtiy than expected. would buy again...beats out many of the &#x27;pricier&#x27; selections</li>
            <li> The foundation brushes aren&#x27;t firm enough for blending in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely  love these bruses nothing happened to them at all.. they work like magic!! great buyüòÅ</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes! I&#x27;m not by any means a make-up pro, but the brushes are really soft and they don&#x27;t shed. I wish the foundation brush was a bit firmer, but I especially like the angled brush. The little bag it comes in is really convenient too!</li>
            <li> these are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. I am so happy with these. they&#x27;re just so soft??????? so fluffy??????? so great??&amp;iquest;?!&amp;iquest;&amp;iquest;?</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the quality of these brushes for such a low price. I use almost all of them every day, and I love them. They&#x27;re so soft, and the bristles have never fallen out.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This entire package cost less than the single brush I needed from Sephora. I couldn&#x27;t be happier because for some reason these are actually holding up better than the expensive brushes that I had been buying previously.  I chucked the bag they came in because it wasn&#x27;t worth keeping - but the brushes work great with my makeup.  They did have a slightly plastic odor when they first arrived but after a single cleaning they all smell like makeup now.  I would buy these again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so much that I ordered another set. Great quality!!</li>
            <li> Brush came on time and were in great condition. Very good quality for their price. I can&#x27;t wait to play in my makeup now.</li>
            <li> Love I would purchase again !!</li>
            <li> Love these Brushes... I&#x27;m a total MAC girl but i got tired of paying $30 per brush. I completely recommend them if your looking for something affordable this is definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> Really great soft blending brushes. Especially for the price. Shipping was quick and they wash nice.</li>
            <li> Even if you didnt like one the set is fantastic. Great product for a fraction of the price I&#x27;ve paid for other make up brushes.</li>
            <li> Soft and sturdy. I&#x27;ve used the foundation and lip brush from the set so far and I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase. No bad odor for me as I&#x27;ve heard some mention. Pretty for the price.</li>
            <li> holy shitsack these brushes are the best things i have ever bought in my life, the tender hairs of the brushes feel like kisses from angels wings and the hairs never fall out and stick to my moisturized face. i never wash them because im lazy and yet they are still amazing.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the brushes are so nice . I love them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and gentle brushes!  Very Happy with my order! And Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> These are great!  They came in a nice pouch too.  I especially like the Kabuki blending brush and foundation brushes.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!! Great price for what you are getting.</li>
            <li> Good quality... as described</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with these brushes.  I was only able to find 1 in the bunch that I could actually use.</li>
            <li> The kabuki brushes weren&#x27;t as dense as i thought they would be for applying liquid foundation but theres really so many great brushes at really good price</li>
            <li> They are amazing!! Great price too! I love them!!! Must buy!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> PERFECT set!!!!! And amazing price</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Better than my sephora and mac brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing soon for my friend.</li>
            <li> They are ok. Not bad. Soft and nice. Just OK no wow</li>
            <li> I like the brushes, but they had a VERY strong odor when I opened them. I am guessing it was the glue? One of the main ones I wanted this set for came unglued from the handle after 1 use.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom, knowing she would only need a few and would offer me the rest.  LOL.  That&#x27;s exactly what happened!  Very good soft brush set convenient to store in its velveteen drawstring pouch.  Blends my foundation, eye shadow, powder, and bronzer evenly.  The only gripe I have is that the larger brushes have very short handles.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome. I needed some new makeup brushes but didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune. I honestly figured the quality would be poor due to the great price. But I am so impressed I threw out all my old brushes after trying these. Love love love.</li>
            <li> For the price these are super good brushes! Very good quality!! Would definitely recommend them!!!</li>
            <li> Great arrival time, nice quality brushes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very surprised with these set of brushes! So far they haven&#x27;t shed (had them close to a month) and they&#x27;re very dense which I love. For the price, they are amazing, super soft!&lt;br /&gt;All give amazing color payoff, I will say that the flat foundation brush does streak but you can always go back with the flat kabuki to blend it out!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these brushes 100 percent if you&#x27;re on a budget!</li>
            <li> Gave these brushes as a gift-- the recipient says she loves them.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great time!! I am so pleased with this purchase! I researched for a couple of days before ordering these, and I was still a little nervous. I had no need to be though! There is a brush for everything I need!! For the price, it is understandable that some of the brushes aren&#x27;t super useful, and there is a very slight amount of shedding (hence the 4 stars.) I am still very happy with my purchase, and would recommend these brushes to anyone looking to get good brushes at a decent price!!</li>
            <li> Bought them for Christmas for my wife, she loves them. I only buy quality products, an if they arnt what they seem than I don&#x27;t buy, these are great quality, each brush was inspected for defects and none whee found!</li>
            <li> The brushes are quite soft, but I still love them! I would definitely gift these to my friends!</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes and nicely packaged as well</li>
            <li> They are very durable but the hair fibers are really stiff and synthetic. So your blending will not look as good.</li>
            <li> Really love these brushes, they are super soft, and so far none of them have shed bristles, even during washing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great as well, I just wish there were one or two more of the small brushes instead of so many large ones.</li>
            <li> So I really didn&#x27;t have high expectations as one of my colleagues was telling me about these $100 brushes (yikes). I was pleasantly surprised when they arrive. Each was in it&#x27;s own plastic in the drawstring bag. Great for travel. I have used almost all the brushes and they are fantastic when applying my liquid foundation as well as my eye shadow or powder. They can be easily cleaned and dry super fast. So far I haven&#x27;t lost any bristles which is surprising! Great buy if you ask me!</li>
            <li> Absolutely hands down the best buy ever. I saw that they were really cheap online and was hesitant to buy until I saw the rating. So I tried them! I have never gotten a more finished, flawless look from any other makeup brushes. In addition to makeup brushes are very soft and easy to use. Love them!</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased brushes and either the set was cheaply made and the bristles shed all over or they were decent quality, but overpriced (think individual brushes at $25-50+).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at this set and reading the reviews I opted to purchase two - one for my daughter and one for myself and I&#x27;m very happy I did. The quality of these brushes are on par with another more expensive set I have. They don&#x27;t shed and are very nice looking. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for good brushes at a much cheaper price than what you&#x27;ll find at Ulta or Clinique.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I expected and the small kabuki and flat one are basically the same in terms of the brush. The reason why I gave  it 4 stars is because they are soft and fluffy and for the price they are pretty good brushes I think they will work well with pigmented makeup like applying blush, bronzer, highlight ,applying setting powder, or blending the makeup together but I dont personally think theyll work for foundation application since I like sturdier brushes for that. They may also work for concealer but I havent tried that yet.</li>
            <li> I just got mine and I am satisfied with this as it is very high quality.</li>
            <li> Great value for the amount of brushes you get. This pack has everything you need for basic makeup application. 3 stars because the packaging the brushes came in smelt disgusting along with the brushes. There was a horrible odor in the the orange fabric bag so I threw it away. I cleaned all the my brushes with lukewarm water and my daily face wash. They no long smell.</li>
            <li> This set is perfect, i love it, i&#x27;m so happy because my makeup is better with this product</li>
            <li> I actually love these brushes. They are so soft and I find that they blend the makeup very well. They did not have any smell when I received them. I find them to be an all around good set.</li>
            <li> These are great! So soft so professional ! Love them</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price! The bag had a weird smell at first but the brushes didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Smelled funny when they got here but it faded and they haven&#x27;t fallen apart or began shedding. So a win for me</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any fall out and they are dense enough to use for foundation.  Good simple brushes...recommend to anyone just starting out with make up</li>
            <li> These are fantastic brushes! I honestly have never purchased cheaper brushes before, being a makeup artist I always bought more expensive, I live by the term &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34;, but now I&#x27;m totally rethinking that! I go through brushes like crazy and at least 2-4 sets on any job depending, and I am so happy to have this option now! Really fast shipping too, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting them to come that quick! Highly recommend!!! And will def buy again!</li>
            <li> Very good! Super soft! Might smell like paint but that&#x27;s just the bag not the brushes. But over all very soft every single one of them! Please believe me! I recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I love them they are amazing !!!</li>
            <li> The brushes hold well enough. The ones I use most frequently are beginning to separate a little after only about a month. But, for the price I really didn&#x27;t expect it to hold long.</li>
            <li> My favorite purchase on amazon were these for the price they are an extreme deal</li>
            <li> These are great brushes! Especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I use these over my MAC brushes</li>
            <li> There to soft for my taste, i feel like its not putting my foundation on at all.&lt;br /&gt;its so sparse.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes.the quality is awesome. There durable wooden Handel&#x27;s are perfect and the delivery was met as promised.</li>
            <li> Just got my order today and it only took 7 days!! Packaging was perfect no issues what so ever! They&#x27;re beautiful brushes &amp; seem to be perfect so far haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet but I have no doubt they&#x27;ll be everything I hoped for. NO SMELL, NO falling apart or strands falling out (I&#x27;ve messed around with each one) Very very satisfied!!! And seriously for the price these brushes have exceeded my expectations 10 fold!</li>
            <li> If you like brushes that fall apart this is the product for you!! If like to not get a refund or have the option of returning this item this is the product for you!! Worst makeup brushes you can buy! Get yours today!</li>
            <li> These have been working great! They apply makeup just fine. No streaks! Wash well! Be sure to wash as soon as you receive them. They have an odor when you first get them but one wash does the trick to remove the odor!</li>
            <li> These brushes work just as good as my Mac brushes. I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes at a very good price, especially when compared to MAC brushes that go at like $50 a brush.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes, they are very soft, but the smell very strong of some chemical. So i only used them once.</li>
            <li> I have been using these brushes for a month now and they are amazing. They are so soft, easy to handle and perfect pigmentation pickers. They run so softly on my face and applying foundation with little kabuki brush is perfect. I bought these coz they look cute but i have not expected this quality for such low price. They blend colors evenly which is amazing. Im so happy with these and dumped all my old brushes.</li>
            <li> One of my brushes broke when I was putting my make up on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional makeup artist and these are by far my favorite brushes especially for the amount I paid!!!! I bought these for a gift for my nieces and ended up loving them so much that I bought myself a set and recommend them to clients!</li>
            <li> Great brushes especially when you consider the cost...got here super fast too...thank you!!!!!</li>
            <li> I lovvvve these brushes thet are very soft but get the job done. I like how they come with a pouch very nice little gift , the handles are nice and hard and sturdy and the delivery was on time and perfect. Great product and i must buy</li>
            <li> These are so beautiful and soft!! They do not shed , it did take a while to get here but these are amazing not Like other brushes that feel cheap , can&#x27;t wait to start using them !!(:</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes and unbeatible price, I can not argue with that simple LOVE THEM :)</li>
            <li> My set came without the eyebrow brush :(&lt;br /&gt;Other than that brushes are exactly as pictured, bristles are soft and pick up color well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve washed them twice, no shedding thus far, I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Got it in two days... love it!!!!</li>
            <li> love this set of brushes! So soft. I wish it had one more really large kabuki brush in it.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves these brushes.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Cheap!! Jus like China!</li>
            <li> I like these brushes for everything but mineral foundation. They don&#x27;t seem to deposit much color with that, but they work great for blending liquid foundation. No smell, a bit of shedding, but only a few hairs every now and then.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new set of makeup brushes! These have bamboo handles, so soft and long lasting. I&#x27;ve washed these several times now without any of the bristles falling out and they are still just as soft as the day I got them. They are a good size and come exactly as the picture shows. They even came in a cute little bag. Great purchase and good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Update:2 years later and these brushes are still my favorite an d i recommend them to all of my friends!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what else to say other than AMAZING! They are soft but hold their shape (so far). I even was able to use them as eye liner style it was AWESOME! LOVE THESE BRUSHES!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice the brushes all came in a timely manner and are a great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> These are cute make-up brushes but the size difference of the brush handles make storing them upright in a jar rather difficult. Nonetheless, they look and feel very high quality and it&#x27;s a lot of brushes for your money! Just take care of them and they&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty nice. I&#x27;m not a makeup person all the time but to me they did they job well and didn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> I loved it! So beautiful and soft</li>
            <li> The shipping was wonderfully fast and the brushes are exactly what I needed.  I love the little eco bag they came in, too!  Very happy with these brushes!</li>
            <li> Got some of the brushes I needed.  Not great quality, but really good for price.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes even though I have no idea what some of them are for.</li>
            <li> I got this brushes a few weeks ago and so far they are pretty good for the price. They had minimal shading and they apply makeup nicely. My only complaint is that this brushes have a very strong chemical smell that won&#x27;t go away even when you wash them. It took a few washes after using makeup for the smell to go away.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes! So much softer than I thought. They work so well! Only thing I would recommend is putting the brush label on the handle. I found it a bit difficult to match the brush with the picture Guide I was given. As a beginner in the makeup world, I just felt it would have been a lot better for me with the labeled handles.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife and she is happy with the product. Package arrived neat and intact.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday &amp; they work great! My favorite brush is the foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Great starter kit for people who don&#x27;t know what they are doing with makeup like me. I am a total noob at makeup but I want to wear it, so I bought this kit and it&#x27;s amazing. Brushes and amazingly soft when I went through them and a few loose bristles came off, but that&#x27;s it. No complaints about this product. Great quality for price.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent buy so far. Brushes are very soft on my face. A little disappointed at the short kabuki one its not full enough like it should be and it bristled are too loose which kind of defeats what kabuki brush really is...and I&#x27;m not sure why the ends of all the brushes are like a light purple color no big deal just different. A little book that tells you what all the different brushes are for I&#x27;ve never seen a few of the types in this set</li>
            <li> Variety of brushes that can be used for any make up need. Strong handles and soft brush that work perfectly! Not expensive and yet they work better than some of the name brand brushes!</li>
            <li> Great high quality brushes.  Bristles were very soft!</li>
            <li> Love the, the material is incredible.</li>
            <li> I liked and recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes, better than I expected</li>
            <li> Super soft. Excellent brushes. Love them.</li>
            <li> I bought 5 sets for myself and family members.  We all love it.  The brushes are soft and I have yet to see any of the hairs come off and I have been using them daily for the past few months.  They work just as good as my more expensive brushes and they make a great gift.  I have recommended to my friends and now they are buying. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> they were all right. you get what you pay for. Honestly some of the hairs on the brush were sticking out and most were loose. would not buy it again..</li>
            <li> These things manage to make me beautiful so no qualms over here! Relatively affordable as well!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much! My brushes came fast and they are just AMAZING!</li>
            <li> thesis brushes are awesome they are very soft and they work like the high quality brushes I will be buying again when its time to replace them I fell in love :) lol</li>
            <li> I just got my brushes and I love them. The only things is the kabuki brush is a little way too small but I still love them!</li>
            <li> Great brush&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li> Its soft n feels good on the skin but i had to was it wash it Because of its smell when i first got it. worth its money.</li>
            <li> For ladies who cant go out at home without putting their make ups, I highly recommend these brushes to you. They are your basic tool of transforming yourselves to even more beautiful you! When I first opened it, i fell in love with it! :) Although these brushes are not that expensive, I can say that the quality is good, and it can last a long time. It&#x27;s how you take care and clean your brushes that does the trick! :)</li>
            <li> Very nice set, gets dirty easily though. But you get enough for what you have to pay for. :)</li>
            <li> pretty good for the price! the only problems I had was how long it took to ship, and after about 4 or 5 uses of one of the brushes, the glue came loose and the top fell off. but, it&#x27;s still usable! there was a slight chemical smell when I first got it, but it quickly went away.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, great quality as well as great price</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and of good quality so far. They blend well my power and concealer/foundation. For the price I thought I would be getting a lesser quality but no, these brushes are nice so far!! I&#x27;m just bummed out there was no eyeliner brush. I totally recommend this product. Better than my chanel ones.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, and product was what I expected.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great bargain.</li>
            <li> These are well made brushes. Definitely worth the money would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes.  I&#x27;ve used them for two weeks and no bristle loss.</li>
            <li> Good brushes and nice variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> These brushes came very well package with soft and beautiful brissles. However, some of the bigger brushes were too soft for me to apply my foundation. The other brushes applied the makeup very well and soft without hurting your face! I highly recommend this product though! It worked really well</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but they are very nice, the handles feel great in my hand and for the price this is a steal. They do have a funky smell but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me. Can&#x27;t wait to try them out :) The ultimate touch would be to add a little booklet on which brushes or for what. Also they got here in less then a week so that was nice too.</li>
            <li> Love them I got 3diffent sets I&#x27;m happy with</li>
            <li> AMAZING BRUSHES! THey don&#x27;t leave tiny hairs on your face from using these brushes. These are soft and great!</li>
            <li> Wished the brushes were made from natural bristles, low grade quality. But for the price I guess they were okay</li>
            <li> Omg I am so in love with these brushes , so soft</li>
            <li> Everything I needed to take my makeup to the next level!</li>
            <li> Great product! I love the brushes and will order from you again!</li>
            <li> Very good quality. I&#x27;m not a professional make up artist but this brush are by far the best brush I have bought.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for the value. I use them everyday &amp; they are not shedding!</li>
            <li> Received brushes in less than a week which was great ! They are super soft I love the quality of them &amp; can&#x27;t complain about the price either :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with, beautiful and soft ...</li>
            <li> Great product, soft and works well!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and I enjoy using them. Only thing I would say is wrong is that they should label the brushes for new beginners to the make up world.</li>
            <li> Love the brushed but just realized there were a few missing from my order.</li>
            <li> I honestly can say that these are GREAT brushes!! Especially for the price. I got mine a couple days ago.. And I&#x27;m not one to write reviews on stuff, but I got to admit how great these are. GET SOME. (A super professional review) üòù</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter think I am a hero!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s good enough for me!</li>
            <li> SO happy with this purchase. Brushes work wonderfully and are excellent quality.</li>
            <li> low quality. bad smell. u got what u paid.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are soft and the bamboo bases feel sturdy. The bag for the brushes is &amp;#34;Caution&amp;#34; orange and not the most aesthetically pleasing. Plus, the bag smells like paint fumes.</li>
            <li> these are great for a beginner with makeup, i don&#x27;t love the eye brushes but they&#x27;re great for other things like my face paintings, great for the price!</li>
            <li> Very nice and super soft. It would be nice if they were to be labeled, but other than that, they are great.</li>
            <li> Of great quality! They arrived a week before expected and I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> Got it on time. Love the brushes. Super soft. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll hold up (knock on wood üòú) I really like this set. I see myself using all of them, not like some brush sets where you only use a couple. I&#x27;m happy and I would buy again!</li>
            <li> sheds a lil more than i&#x27;d like but still great for price</li>
            <li> Love this product. . It WORKS!</li>
            <li> What the heck is the point?! They brushes don&#x27;t hold the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an &#x27;all things makeup &amp; makeup related&#x27; fanatic!!  These brushes are amazing...especially for the price.  The brushes can compete with the name brand ones easily.</li>
            <li> Few brushes broke as soon a I bough them, however for the amount it cost purchase still worth it.</li>
            <li> All these brushes were really soft and I love using them! Great product</li>
            <li> Great makeup brushes! I love them!</li>
            <li> LOVE.. these brushes are soft and yummy and perfect. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li> Brushes are great! Very soft and I love the different sizes they offer, although I didn&#x27;t receive the free eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! They are very well made. Can handle everyday use. For the price they compare very well to brand name brushes! Love them!</li>
            <li> Seems my batch missed quality control. Broken brush and others missing. Can&#x27;t speak to use quality.</li>
            <li> Good deal, Good price.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great!</li>
            <li> These brushes are of great quality, haven&#x27;t shed at all n delivered in 3 days! NO complaints!</li>
            <li> The brushes are wonderful! I love how soft they are and how well they pick up the pigments in my eye shadows. Definitely a keeper üòä</li>
            <li> Super soft. Easy to clean. Spreads makeup flawlessly.</li>
            <li> love love love thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This brush set is just amazing! Literally has every brush that the average woman needs every day...eyeshadow brushes blend beautifully and quickly...if ur only as good as ur tools then this is the brush set u need! Works just as good as mac brushes or better!</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic!  Very well made and so far, no shedding.  I&#x27;ve bought more expensive brushes in the past and been disappointed. These are so nice that I will be buying sets for my Mom and Sister for Christmas.  So many brushes that I am not sure what to do with half of them, but I love them all!  Super fast shipping.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes at a great price!</li>
            <li> The brushes, compared to some ,where ok. There was shedding almost RIGHT away. But I guess at that price point it was to be expected just not so soon.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m veryyyyy skeptical when it comes to ordering online. This was my first time and these brushes are great. Very soft, apply foundation and powders flawlessly. They have everything needed for everyday looks. I&#x27;m thinking of buying more sets as gifts.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush set, very quickly I might add, and am pleasantly surprised by the high quality -- particuarly for the price.  The brushes are very soft to the skin and the bamboo handles are simply beautiful!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Super nice and work really well. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Soft,complete great quality bruches set</li>
            <li> Great set for the price. Bristles are soft and liked the travel bag it came with.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are super soft and seem to be pretty good quality for the price. When I received the set I washed them first as instructed and so far so good. After several weeks of use I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I forgot to mention I did not receive the eyebrow/eyelash brush shown in the picture next to the plus sign.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with these brushes. I received them early and they are good quality. I slightly pulled on the bristles and there was no shedding, all of the brushes are full and soft. The eyebrow brush is more angled than it appears in the picture as well which I&#x27;m glad because that was my biggest concern when ordering these. Overall good product, the only thing I would change is actually having a label on the sides of the brushes like &amp;#34;foundation brush, eyebrow brush, ect.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> One of my brushes lost my tip</li>
            <li> These are amazing brushes, great quality. They are super soft and great for the price. Easy to clean</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, but the cut of the brushes is a little too blunt. Even the rounder brushes are curved on the top, but have a kind of &amp;#34;corner&amp;#34; so it&#x27;s not a smooth transition to the side of the bristles. I also wish there were one or 2 more small blending brushes or shader brushes instead of so many face brushes. If you have no brushes, this is a good kit to get started, but for better quality at a slightly higher, but still reasonable price, I prefer Sigma or Morphe.</li>
            <li> These are so great. Great buy</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome ! I used them everyday very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> The  price / quality is great! Great brushes, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! The foundation brush alone was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and love the wooden color of the handles. Like it a lot! Perfect for what I was needing. Every size brush for the right price. (Written by my wife)</li>
            <li> They came right away, there was an intense odor of paint or Lacquer coming from the box. It was the handles on the brushes. I recommend not getting bamboo handles.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing.  Firstly they arrived a few days before scheduled delivery date, and they are ridiculously soft. I have brushes from Sigma, Makeup Geek, MAC and Morphebrushes and more but I adore these brushes, because they are so soft and blend your makeup exceptionally well.  They can be used by both novices and professionals. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price of these as well..  I use the blending brush in this set every single day.  I would highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> So I was overly excited to receive my package today, but I was kind of bummed out to see that the 2 flat head brushes were shedding a lot. They were what I was mainly excited about getting but I have 9 other fantastic super soft brushes to make up for it! Oh! And I also didn&#x27;t get the little bag to put them in so I just have 11 brushes laying out.</li>
            <li> Very high quality for the price! Very little to no shedding! Great selection and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I love these! They are perfect - look and feel really high quality and professional. I didn&#x27;t receive the pouch though, which was sad. Nevertheless, these brushes are exactly what I hope them to be. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re better quality than I expected but there&#x27;s some false advertising here because they definitely didn&#x27;t come with the added bonus brush.... Kinda sketchy. But overall I really do like the brushes.</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are a great price for an excellent product!  I loved all these brushes and at such a good price you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! The foundation brush blends out really well. It doesn&#x27;t leave any brush streaks for me. My makeup just comes out so flawless. They&#x27;re perfect if you&#x27;re just starting off in makeup. The price is good and the quality is even better!</li>
            <li> They are horrible and smell like gasoline. When I finally got the smell out they were had cheap application. I gave them to my daughters to play with. I prefer Sigma makeup brushes, you buy them once and they really do there job.</li>
            <li> Very nice set. They are well made with soft bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Received them well packed.</li>
            <li> I like it for its value, is pretty good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed then about 5 times since I got them of course once when they arrived. But these are definitely high quality brushes I&#x27;m obsessed with the powder brush foundation brush and blush/ broken brush! They make my makeup look flawless ! Also they do not waste product what so ever! I got to admit the pouch it comes in is loosing threads. But I never planed on keeping it anyway. These brushes not only work great but look professional. They arrived early ! Idk what more I can say just buy them see for yourself ! I&#x27;ll be getting myself a second set as a gift .</li>
            <li> The only thing that was good about these brushes were the face brushes. The eye brushes were absolutely terrible. they sucked up all of my make up and would not apply to the skin. SO So SO bad. I do not recommend these to people are picky about how their makeup is applied. i needed just something small until I could get my sigma brushes and this was a waste of money to me . complete waste</li>
            <li> I already use it daily and i love this brush set. It is very soft, and it comes with varieties of brushes that is just what i need for my makeup routines. I use each and every brushes. Not a single brush is left unused. I appreciate this purchase. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and gorgeous. They feel like silk against the skin.</li>
            <li> Got the &amp;#34;chemical smell&amp;#34; everyone was talking about but for the price I think they are great. A brush for every need!</li>
            <li> They look just how they look in the pictures and they came in a little bag as featured in the pictures as well. Overall, good buy! No shedding so far! Very soft! And fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my mother&#x27;s make up business,  she was impressed with the quality.&lt;br /&gt;They came in a small burlap type material bag.&lt;br /&gt;Seemed like great quality,  but I am not a woman nor do I wear make up lol so what do I know.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ll take my mother&#x27;s word for it.&lt;br /&gt;She recommends it</li>
            <li> Great brushes.  Use them evdrydsy.</li>
            <li> Great product, very well made!</li>
            <li> Love these!!  Great quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> These brushes are the softest things i have ever felt. Very few fallout and great quality. Very worth it!!</li>
            <li> Not worth it. I regret this purchase. Flimsy. Just save up and buy quality brushes. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do</li>
            <li> Received about 3 of the same brushes, came in a little drawstring bag which is useful, but not to carry the brushes in.  Each brush comes individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> I love this set of brushes!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the 12th brush.. Wish I got that instead of pointless bag. The brushes are okay quality. None of them worked well with gel eyeliner, or liquid anything. I only use with powder now. I&#x27;m not 100% sure what each brush is designed for, a description of each one would have been helpful.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes, easy to use, only downside is some of the hairs come out easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this four stars only because I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to truly judge. However I&#x27;m so far very impressed, the brushes are really soft and don&#x27;t shed easily. Also, I especially love how the foundation brush flawlessly applies my revlon foundation. Product was delivered on time and in perfect condition. Good buy! Hopefully it&#x27;ll meet up to my expectations as time goes on.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes.  Comes with storage bag.  Shipment arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> What everyone else said. Wash them, smell is gone and they are amazingly soft and well made, little shedding. i replaced using my $25 foundation brush with the one in this set now.</li>
            <li> absolutely love brush set and so did my daughters now I need to buy a set for myself they took they all and left me with nothing...</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes. Loved the way it feels on my face. Tried liquid foundation with the foundation brush and it actually holds up. Hasn&#x27;t lost any hairs since use. Can&#x27;t wait to use it on my wedding makeup.</li>
            <li> Great brush set, lots of variety.</li>
            <li> SMELLED LIKE GASOLINE!! I Don&#x27;t Really Like This Product. When I Use Them, I Have To Go Back Over My Face With Another Brush, So It Was A Waste Of My Money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid makeup user. I am giving these four stars. They are VERY soft, every time I do someone&#x27;s makeup they comment on how soft they are! They of course aren&#x27;t as good as the $45 brushes you get from high end makeup brands, but I wanted a set that actually matches and I didn&#x27;t want to break bank. I would recommend these to other people. Another reason for not five stars is the lack of shape differences in the face brushes, I&#x27;d have prefered an angled brush being added.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality for the price I paid! I mean, $11 for all of them is a dollar per brush! It came in a canvas pouch and had that plastic packaging smell, but it went away in one day. They are so soft, even on sensitive skin and the angled liner brush is pretty precise. The fluffy brushes are equally dense and great for powder or blush application. I haven&#x27;t tried the eyeshadow blending brushes but they look great as well. Overall I liked the versatility of this set, very much comparable if not better than ecotools, and most of all the price. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> really soft I love the blush brush and the mini powder brush the best</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy these brushes at first because of some of the bad reviews, but I decided to give then a try anyway. I like this set in particular because it has all the brushed I need‚Äîas opposed to other sets that have too many big brushes, unnecessary detailing brushes, etc. To give you an idea of my makeup ability level, I am not (by any means) a professional makeup artist, but my daily makeup regime consists of primer, foundation, concealer, powder, bronzer, blush, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, and tinted lip balm‚Äîso, pretty heavy makeup. Most days, my makeup is very neutral and natural, but I also do heavier, darker looks occasionally. The brushes worked perfectly for me! It was the right amount of face brushes and blending brushes for my needs. After buying this set, I have not touched any of my old makeup brushes because I don&#x27;t have a need for them. The brushed are soft and feel very nice on my skin. All in all, it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> These brushed are the BEST. Better than any expensive brushes I&#x27;ve owned and the travel bag is so convenient! I actually left my brushes in a hotel room last weekend and so I will be purchasing these again!</li>
            <li> These brushes are beautiful, soft, and well packed, I have washed them and used them, no fall out, and they have great pick-up and coverage!! Very complete set, easy to say I love it, and will probably purchase more!</li>
            <li> Great quality brush set.</li>
            <li> Are worth the money if you can figure out which brush is used for what. there was no paperwork describing anything.</li>
            <li> Great brushes and good quality. I definitely recommend them. I use them for my cream cotouring by Anastaia Beverly Hills and for my brow shading.</li>
            <li> This brushes have laste a long time now. They are a good quality. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great value and quality</li>
            <li> I love it! I would even go as far to say I would spend double what I did they are they good. And the price, you can not beat for the quality.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t tested all brushes, I tried the flat top kabuki and it was CONSTANT shedding. All over my face and it was just a horrible mess.</li>
            <li> My brushes finally came in!!! I&#x27;m so happy. I couldn&#x27;t wait for them to come in. They came in good packaging. Full complete 11 brushes. Really soft but firm. No smell to it. I promise. I have not used them just yet but they look like really good quality. I&#x27;m really truly satisfied and I would most definitely purchase this again. No regrets in purchasing this. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it too if you purchase it as well. I can&#x27;t wait to use them. Of course they also can in with the little baggy to put them in which is a huge plus!!</li>
            <li> Love this!!!! Very soft received on time. Very happy with them</li>
            <li> Great deal for nice brushes...Definitely recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Got super quick and I love them. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great makeup brushes. The quality is great and there is absolutley NO fallout!! Love love love the quality and price paid for these brushes</li>
            <li> I got these brushes WAY before my expected delivery date and they are amazing! The quality is awesome for the price and I love them so much!!</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes especially for the price. It took a little while for shipping but the quality has exceeded my expectation. They are soft and apply makeup very evenly.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with this brush set. It&#x27;s a very good deal and the quality is pretty decent. I have a pair of brushes (only, like, five brushes) I bought for $50 and use them all interchangeably. I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding and they hold product very well.</li>
            <li> I have Amazon Prime so these got here really fast. I have not used them YET but just by taking them out of the package and messing around with the brushes I can tell that they will last. No bristles fell out and these were surprisingly extremely soft! After using I will update review but for the price and quality of these brushes I am certainly pleased.</li>
            <li> I got these within 5 days while I live in salida california. They are extremely soft Don&#x27;t &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; your product or wast it. I have only had shedding from the second to smallest flat top brush but it doesn&#x27;t come off on my face. Only when I pick it off. They are easy to wash. Don&#x27;t have a horrible odor, smell comes out after washing them. To conclude these are amazing brushes and if the are ever ruined I will&lt;br /&gt; &#x27;re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! I had to order some new ones because my bare minerals brushes were leaving little strands all over my face- these brushes haven&#x27;t done so yet- and the foundation one is perfect!</li>
            <li> Brushes broke off the handle first day when used..</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I really felt like I was taking a big risk buying makeup brushes from Amazon, but I am really impressed with them. They&#x27;re extremely soft and have many uses. I haven&#x27;t noticed any hairs falling out during use or after washing them. They&#x27;re crazy cheap too! Would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> Good timing and great product !</li>
            <li> I am giving this product a 3 star mostly because when I received them, I opened each and experienced shedding just waving my hand over the bristles.</li>
            <li> i was happy with almost all these brushes except the kabuki which was to small and to soft and the two face brushes which are also to soft other than that the other brushes were perfec t and very high qaulity for the price</li>
            <li> Great brushes, great price. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Like them but the brushes are not glued right to the stick</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush set! The handles are very good quality, the synthetic hair is very soft and great quality. Makeup application is smooth, I use them daily.</li>
            <li> Great product! The brushes are very soft and do not fall off when using. Very durable. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I loved these brushes</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!!!! They blend shadows and concealer a to perfection. I&#x27;m in love &amp;#60;3 they came in a cloth bag and I read it might have a chemical smell to them but the package I received had no smell at all so maybe it depends on where the package goes... Overall these brushes are awesome.</li>
            <li> Great for make-up beginners. Colors are not very pigmented and even with a MAC primer they did not show or stay well. I mostly use them for blending and not impact coloring.</li>
            <li> These brushes came in a drawstring pouch. They are not cheap looking at all. The bristles are very soft and the handles are finished nicely. These are a gift so I havent actually used them but they seem to be really good brushes</li>
            <li> When I ordered this brush set I really liked the two-toned brush color and there selling for a really good price.  The wooden handles weren&#x27;t very appearing in picture and almost decided against them but I&#x27;m glad I decided to order the brushes.  It did take a longer amount time to arrive since they do ship from China but they did come within the listed time frame and if you have the patience it&#x27;ll be worth your while.  When the brushed finally arrived I was really impressed!  The packaging was very good - the brushes come individually wrapped in plastic and are placed inside a clothe satchel which is additionally placed inside a clear plastic bag.  The quality of the brushes are super nice and plush!  I really like that the brushes are nice and thick and the hairs don&#x27;t fall out when used.  I&#x27;m pretty rough on brushes and so far the brushes have been holding up.  The brushes look exactly the way that they are shown - no false or misleading advertisement there.  I know the handles aren&#x27;t very glamorous looking but if you could get past that the brush will really impress you and you&#x27;ll be glad you got them - I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> So i just recieved them and i have to say i love them had them for about a week arrived sooner than expected these brushes are good quality would defenetly recomend</li>
            <li> They came earlier than expected.i love them and a great purchase</li>
            <li> These are realllllllllyyyyyy nice brushes. They did take FOREVER to get here. But they are great; I&#x27;d give them six stars if I could even despite the extraordinary delivery time.</li>
            <li> Arrived much sooner than expected ! They are great brushes I will be ordering another set .</li>
            <li> I loved them the brush was really soft and high quality</li>
            <li> It takes a little long time to get to you, but they are definitely worthy to wait. The brush is fine and soft, the type I like.</li>
            <li> for the price of these brushes they are absolutely amazing definitely money well spent they came earlier than the estimated date and the brushessi were very very soft and had a nice variety of brushes that I love to use I&#x27;ve already clean my brushes twice now and very minimum shedding</li>
            <li> These were Christmas gifts for my daughters, &amp; now I want a set of my own!  I love the wooden handles &amp; the bristles are perfect.  They hold their shape &amp; do their job well.  My daughters love them &amp; my sons girlfriend actually went online &amp; bought herself a set after seeing them.  They are just right, especially for the price.  ;-)</li>
            <li> The ones I have used are great. The bristles are super soft and don&#x27;t fall out. There is probably a few more than I will actually use, but I can keep to replace the ones i use.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of brushes, beautifully made and good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a couple of days now and I must say they are wonderful. They are extremely soft and durable. They seem like they will last a while and there is no shedding and I&#x27;ve washed my brushes twice already. I bought the set because I needed a few of the brushes but I found use for all of them. The smaller ones are great for eyeshadows and they make blending the eyeshadows very easy. I like how there is a variety in the brushes because they were exactly what I needed. Great products for the price!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my friend&#x27;s birthday so I don&#x27;t have any experience with the brushes but from what she told me they are awesome! She says the eye makeup brushes are durable and have shown no fallout, same goes for the face brushes. All I can say is she enjoyed the brushes very much and I&#x27;m inclined to believe her.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes, great value. No shedding and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Its a hit and miss with the brushes while they&#x27;re soft, some of the bristles don&#x27;t pick up product well. They are okay if you&#x27;re starting out with makeup brushes and if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. I wanted to pick up more brushes to add to my collection but they won&#x27;t last in a professional setting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup often but this set is pretty good. There were a few strands sticking out here in there on a brush or two, but I was able to pluck them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They stay soft and intact after cleaning too.</li>
            <li> I just received them in the mail yesterday! And omg they were worth the wait(2 weeks and 3 days) I&#x27;m so happy that I got them before the holidays starts. they are so soft and for the price you can&#x27;t bet them. I&#x27;m happy that I got this brush set. I always wanted kabuki brushes but I didn&#x27;t want to pay $25 only for one. I&#x27;m so happy that I found theses brushes. I will be buying again!!! I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> these are great and very much worth the low cost....I bought two more sets for stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> Great quality product for the price. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> They smell like paint, but once washed their good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes!  -Got a good deal!</li>
            <li> Some shedding on the small thick brushes... one of them completely shed out... had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them yet.but they look good and the brush is really soft.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because the brushes are too short...but the actual brush is good.  I was hoping for a large brush to come with the set, but they are all really small.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes. Not cheaply made. Better than drugstore purchase I&#x27;ve made in the past.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!! Every type I need in traveling size .</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are soft and come in different sizes.</li>
            <li> First I would like to say these brushes are good. Make up looks nice for many hours after applying. I would have reviewed these product with a five star if it wasn&#x27;t for one of the brushes that broke a month and a half after purchase. Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t return the items because seller has a 3 day policy. If you don&#x27;t get any defective brushes I recommend buying them.</li>
            <li> I like this brush set very much.  It is very soft on the face unlike some other brushes that feel like my husband&#x27;s beard stubble.</li>
            <li> Bruch it self is good but the metal piece that holds the tip started to come lose after a week of use.</li>
            <li> GREAT brushes, I recommend these for sure! They are great quality for an even better price. Super soft bristles and bamboo handles.</li>
            <li> The brushes are new with high quality bristles.</li>
            <li> Okay... gets the job done but nothing spectacular.  Good beginner brushes</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really soft, nice quality, but I don&#x27;t like that they don&#x27;t have a name on them</li>
            <li> They are a lot smaller than I was expecting... I honestly don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to use the smallest one for. They had a tad chemical smell to them, but they are super soft and thick.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful but they are smaller than I expect</li>
            <li> Lovvveee love very good brushes</li>
            <li> Great brush set for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. I didn&#x27;t find them stiff at all. There was a slight smell but one quick cleaning and I don&#x27;t smell it anymore. These are well crafted and exactly what I was looking for. I would purchase these again for sure</li>
            <li> These were actually pretty good quality,  especially for the price! I use a few of them daily. Very little shedding that I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> Great and professional!! Also soft!! Great for the money! Better than my mac and sigma</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared at how the quality would be for the cheap price. I must say, this is EXCELLENT quality!!! I really like that it has a bag for all of the brushes. I use it every day to keep them all organized. I would absolutely 100% recommend this to all of my fellow makeup lovers! Get it! Trust me!!</li>
            <li> much better than expected, love this set! was looking for something like this in the stores, way over priced. I would highly recommend to get these, very soft, and do not shed, all the tools I need for great make up application</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with these brushes.  Very soft. Thinking of buying another set. The price is just perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner when it&#x27;s comes to makeup so I&#x27;m not completely sure if these are the best brushes, but I do love them! For the price, it seems like such a steal. It&#x27;s super soft, it don&#x27;t shed, and it basically gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a really strong smell to it which I was kind of expecting from the previous reviews, but as long as you don&#x27;t actually smell the brushes, It&#x27;s fine. I would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re also new to makeup and don&#x27;t want to spend so much on the actual brand ones cause it seems to work pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing. I am a 13 year old girl that is starting to get into makeup and these are perfect, they&#x27;re so soft and they pick up the product really well. And they&#x27;re all so pretty and they are my favorite makeup brushes I own!</li>
            <li> The quality is not that good when you are using the brush the hair is falling out of the brush on your face i thought maybe By washing them with shampoo would help but even that didn&#x27;t help:( I gave it 3 stars for the quick shipping and the price</li>
            <li> The makeup picks up a great amount of powder, but it doesn&#x27;t release ANY on my skin... Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Love!!! Fantastic buy! These are exceptionally high quality brushes! You cannot beat the price. These are much better than any other brushes I&#x27;ve bought and completely compete with my step daughters high end pro brushes. Buy them you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! They have some shedding, but not much. They clean very well and comes in a nice pouch to store them in. It would be nice of the name of each brush was listed on the side of the brush.</li>
            <li> Granted I haven&#x27;t used these brushes yet but they are so soft! And they seem well made! They also arrived vvery quickly which is always a plus :)</li>
            <li> Very nice set of makeup brush. Good quality bristles, nice wooden handles, comes in its own pouch.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes. Never leave brush hairs on your face. Very soft.</li>
            <li> Love my new brushes! Haven&#x27;t had any issues with them!</li>
            <li> Really nice, especially for the price. Just take note that some are really short, so if you have a cup you are planning on putting them in or something like that, the short ones are going to be a pain in the butt.  I still really like them though.</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes for the price! I cleaned as recommended and the smell that was on it upon arrival dissipate once cleaned. I love that there is a little set of instructions for each brush. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very soft! I love them!</li>
            <li> You cant bat the price on these brushes.  They are soft and durable with the bristles withstanding even daily cleaning.  The handles are easy to hold and use.  Really, for the price, these are an excellent value.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are made well and super soft. I haven&#x27;t had any shedding. Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes...love!</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, good quality and affordable price.</li>
            <li> Very nice assortment of brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes! I have used the brush for liquid foundation everyday and I get a flawless application every time. I have always been horrible at applying foundation but thanks to youtube tutorials and these brushes, I&#x27;m getting better!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes. They are SO soft. I&#x27;ve been using them for two months and I love the way they work.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Picks up product and blends very well! I recommend these brushes to anyone! Great Price!</li>
            <li> It was worth the price, I would recommend</li>
            <li> I love the bristles on these brushes very soft yet firm. It&#x27;s just right for any beginner or professional. I&#x27;m intermediate and I can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! My favorite is the large round kabuki brush. Perfect for blending my mineral foundation. Amazingly great brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love with this brushes, the quality is unbelievable. So happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Super soft! Worked great! Used them to do my wedding makeup</li>
            <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had for an unbeatable price!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they&#x27;re so soft and work very well, especially with blending. The handles are solid and smooth as well. All in all they&#x27;re great brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are lovely- I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and my Tarte brushes (which are all between $30-$50 a piece). They&#x27;ve survived the initial &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; test (shampoo, condition, air dry and pull at the fibers with your nails) without shedding a single hair. I&#x27;d love to find these in a long handled set for my pro kit, but for now I&#x27;ll just spoil myself :)</li>
            <li> So far so good , they seem good quality and they&#x27;re really soft . Only down fall was they seemed almost dusty and had a odd smell . So I just washed them and they&#x27;re pretty much perfect now .</li>
            <li> I loooove the face brushes!!! They work AMAZINGLY with powders OR liquids.. the eye brushes don&#x27;t hold my eye shadow well , theyre too soft or something... so I don&#x27;t use them. . But it&#x27;s worth it just  for the face ones.. they&#x27;re soft but thick..... great quality!!! You can tell a difference when using these to apply makeup.... much better ..</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! My estimated delivery time was September 25th. To my surprise they came a week earlier! I ordered them late August.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely astounded with the results. The brushes have a very nice soft feel to them plus they came in a nice little bamboo baggy; application is a breeze! Mind you, brushes like these sell for a lot at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply or other big name retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re a definite buy and would suggest them as a beautiful birthday/Christmas gift. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Functional but brushes lose alot of hair. Hope that will slow with continued use. Otherwise nice assortment &amp; very soft.</li>
            <li> SOOOOO SOFT! DragonPad Basmboo Brush is amazing....I didn&#x27;t want to put makeup on them at first because I loved how new they were lol. They are soft and almost sponge-like. They are easy to clean but they hold the makeup well.</li>
            <li> Everything was packaged very nicely. One of the brushes bristles is starting to fall out but other than that they are very soft.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!!! The handles are super sturdy, well made and the bristles are full and soft with no fall out. Amazzzing price!!!!! Great deal!!!!!  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> some were okay others were a definite NO</li>
            <li> These brushes are really nice, so soft and you get so many for a low price. Great buy, I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on them.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup brush leaves no hair and leave you perfect makeup love it</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing, I have bought them for both myself and friends who all agree they are spectuar!!</li>
            <li> Pretty decent brushes I guess. My only problem is that the glue rubbed off and one of the handles feel off and it&#x27;s starting to do that for other brushes too. Can be an easy fix, just annoying.</li>
            <li> They are amazing and work great. Super soft bristles so they just glide across your skin.</li>
            <li> This was the first time buying these brushes and I&#x27;m in love with them and at such a great price! I definitely recommend then for foundation, loss powder makeup and eye shadow. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Im very impressed by what i received for the price i just received my brushes today and I love them i can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
            <li> Really nice brush set for such an incredible price! Came faster than expected. I&#x27;m happy. Oh and they are really pretty and soft too.</li>
            <li> These brushes are okay for  beginners that are testing out the make-up world and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money but honestly I would go with E.L.F to get a better quality and a cheap price.These didn&#x27;t seem to pick up or hold on to product very well, they are usable but not something I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Totally worth every penny. I read a lot of reviews before I bought and glad that I&#x27;ve made the purchase. Any one of those kabuki brushes would have cost 15-20 bucks at sephora. I got four kabuki brushes. Just those brushes would be a steal for the price. Not to mention there are eight more brushes to boot.</li>
            <li> Super soft and great quality!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter. The brushes were soft and well put together. The instructions were perfect since there are quite a few brushes and we didn&#x27;t know what each one was for. Love these brushes. I may get some for myself!!</li>
            <li> Great brushes but didint get the plus brush:(</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes for the price!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived as soon as i expected and the brushes are good looking, comfy to use, more than i expected for the price!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, soft bristles, the brush sheds a little at first, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My wife loved these brushes. Cheap and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> decent brushes. hair fibers sometimes fall out on certain ones when washing.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush set. Super soft bristles!</li>
            <li> i loooooove these brushes ,, they are so nice and soft .. the hairs of the brushes didn&#x27;t fall out!!&lt;br /&gt;and they are so cheap ! , but high quality !</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are great quality for a bargain price.</li>
            <li> These are very nice. Higher quality and softer than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this set, I am actually thinking of buying another.. the brushes are super soft! would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Brushes are amazing!!!! Beautifully blend the makeup.  I use them with my professional kits and they work so well.  Just as good if not better than some of my professional brush kits. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The brush hair fell out. Why?</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. I needed a full set without the typical high price and I found it with this set. Barely any bristle fallout and application is perfect. Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a must have!</li>
            <li> Came really early tha Brushes are really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed to much! I LOVE IT it&#x27;s my best gift from me to myself&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Nice set. My daughter loves this set. Doesn&#x27;t shed and seems well made.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the money spent. Brushes are really awesome, no shedding &amp; easy to wash. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great brushes but one was missing from my order.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes, I use them often and I can&#x27;t complain. I&#x27;ve also washed them and there was no shedding :)</li>
            <li> I love it!! neatly packaged and the bristles are SUPER SOFT. I do my makeup with ease with these brushes. I think I absolutely got a steal for the price. I will recommend this to others for sure !!</li>
            <li> These brushes were exactly as described. I think for the price they are lovely and they are very soft. I recommend washing them first before using them (as you should with any makeup brushes) but it will prevent them from shedding. Very pleased with my new brushes!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes. Very soft and work really well. Super happy I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Item delivered promptly and as described.</li>
            <li> nothing special about these. They dont seem to like to pick up power eye shadow very well</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!! They are sooo soft. And can&#x27;t be any happier. I was worried for the price being so low them not to be good but they&#x27;re great! I washed them and no bristles came out.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!!! So soft, great application, should have bought sooner</li>
            <li> These are so soft. I love them! They definitely match up to many of the more expensive makeup brushes I have bought in the past. These are great face brushes and the bristles are fairly dense. The face brushes are generally the best brushes. The set has a very good crease brush and angled liner brush. Both of them are great for eyeshadow and filling in my brows. The other eyeshadow brushes leave a little to be desired. The bristles of the eyeshadow brushes tend to be a little too far apart to blend eyeshadow well.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to apply makeup with the smaller brushes, but I did test them all out to see if they irritated my skin... and they  didn&#x27;t. They are very soft and fairly dense (the face brushes took a while to dry after being washed), I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the face brushes. I haven&#x27;t tried them all so I&#x27;ll give it four stars for now.</li>
            <li> Came on time and packed neatly. Bristle light and soft. May purchase another one for my friend very soon!</li>
            <li> They are wonderful, very soft, easy to wash and good quality.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes!! I&#x27;m not a makeup artist but I wanted to upload a photo that I took of them and added some text with what they would best be used for since the paper it came with shows what each one is used for. (These are based on the card it comes with only) In my opinion, #1 is best for blush as it could be used for foundation, but usually more dense brushes are best for blending liquid foundation or creams. The flat top dense brushes are best for foundations (liquid and or mineral). #2 seems best for liquid foundation, or highlighter (that you would dab ontop of your high cheekbones). It can also be used as a bigger concealer brush as well. #3 This one is best used for contouring, or highlighting or blending eye shadow. #4 Best uses would be for smudging eyeliner or used for lower eye lid smudging eyeshadow. It&#x27;s also very good for blending or adding more darker colors to the end creases of your eyelid. #5 Best used for angled eye shadow in the creases. #6 Eyebrow brush (using eye shadow only), and also to use for eyeliner (esp if using eye shadow for eyeliner). #7 This one is best for a small concealer brush OR using eye shadow to &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; on the eyelid. #8 Best for eye shadow in the crease and blending. #9 The bristle side is for eyebrows and the comb side is for combing and separating eye lashes #10 is best used for setting powder, or all over powder OR a light use of blending mineral powder. #11 is best for blending liquid or mineral foundation (the more dense the more it helps blend #12 Same uses as #11  Hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> only wish the names/type of brush was written on the handle to make it easier to quickly grap from drawer</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush set. I am new to the make-up world so this brush set seemed the perfect starting point for my new collection. The brushes are extremely soft and apply my mineral powder based make-up perfectly! They did have a chemical smell (which the buyer warns you of in the package) when it arrived but I washed them as directed and the smell is completely gone. I highly recommend this set!</li>
            <li> These brushes are very well made, not flimsy or cheap feeling. The bristles are very soft. Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Brush set is amazing for the price. I was kinda nervous about purchasing because the inexpensive brushes are alot of the time cheaply made. But i decided to go with it because of the great reviews. &amp; omg am i glad i did! These brushes are so soft &amp; very well made. Mine didn&#x27;t have any wierd smell like some of the other reviews stated. I would recommend these to any makeup lover out there..!!</li>
            <li> lovelovelove these brushes! this is my first set and they work beautifully, includes every brush I could ever need. my makeup has never looked so even and flawless! 10/10 would buy again. (I would give 5 stars but the kabuki brush isn&#x27;t as dense as I would like, but it still works)</li>
            <li> Very well made nice brush set! I was plesently surprised!</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft ! Love</li>
            <li> I am definitely happy with my product. It came on time. I would suggest maybe labeling each brush for new bees like me other than that the brushes are perfect.</li>
            <li> good quality and useful.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a great brush set and I love these!! They were so pretty when I got them and of course they still are. Highly recommend this! Such a great cost for a college student like me!</li>
            <li> great brushes and I&#x27;m very particular about the quality of my makeup brushes</li>
            <li> This is just amazingly great! Very soft to use and so far it looks and feels durable! I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I thought the kabuki brushes would be denser. The foundation brush is amazing. And I love the eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY AND PRICE WAS GREAT WORKS GREAT WITH MINERAL STYLE MAKE UP.</li>
            <li> great brushes! super soft</li>
            <li> Low price yet good quality. I am surprised.</li>
            <li> really good product for what you are paying for, the only problem i had is that i took over a month to receive them, but overall really satisfied with the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Quality seems very good.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with these brushes</li>
            <li> I was looking for quality brushes that werent expensive. These were those brunches. My favorites one is the blush brush, which as others have said they hold color well!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it so far. She&#x27;s very impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes. The only this is the eye shadow brush doesn&#x27;t really hold the color. Bits and pieces were falling off while applying to my eye lid.</li>
            <li> 5 stars. Well worth the price. I especially liked the kabuki brushes. All of the brushes work well for me.</li>
            <li> I loved these brushes. I&#x27;ve bought 3 more to give as gifts.  But how do I clean them?</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! Came really early too!! Brushes are really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed to much! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Great value...Great brushes</li>
            <li> *Second attempt at reviewing. first post did not get posted Im guessing cuz it was a 1 star*&lt;br /&gt;Im fairly happy with this product. The foundation brush was bent when it got in and the dome shaped face brush (don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re called there are no labels on the brushes) fell apart from the stick (however I was able to stick it back in with the help of super glue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the eye brushes. the liner brush is very good and smudging brush is good.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what the purpose of the tiny brush is (since the large flat brush looks exactly the same) I wish it came with some other (useful) brush rather than the small sized brush ( i have not used the small one yet )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its probably a good deal for the price. Store bought makeup brushes (of the same quality) are crazy expensive</li>
            <li> Came in the canvas bag in the mail and not a box which takes away the aesthetically pleasing part of wrapping. However they seem to be put together soundly. They were shipped from Tennessee rather than China</li>
            <li> These brushes are unexpectingly great quality! Extremely soft. So happy to have them in my collection!</li>
            <li> The brush is very soft, great price, great quality.</li>
            <li> BUY THIS IT WORKS GREAT IM BUYING FOR ALL MY FRIENDS SOON I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT check out my makeup pic</li>
            <li> They were good brushes</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes, they are so soft. I&#x27;m just starting to get more into makeup and good brushes definitely make a difference.</li>
            <li> I can now get a flawless application without paying the high price.  These brushes came in sooner then expected s well.</li>
            <li> The brushes work ok, but not good quality. Two of the brushes&#x27; top came off and I needed to glue them back.&lt;br /&gt;Kabuki brush is too soft and kind of hard to apply powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist the brushes are soft and work well. Some don&#x27;t hold products as well surprisingly the foundation brush doesn&#x27;t like full coverage products.  However the buffer and kabuki brushes  grab and buff  powder products  so lovely. worth the buy :)</li>
            <li> They are great for the price. I bought them because of the environmentally friendly hype it says on the page. They smell like factory. Hopefully there are no toxic chemicals on the,.</li>
            <li> They came way earlier and were so pretty and perfect and so soft i love them.</li>
            <li> These are very nice I have not used yet but very soft</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them and uses them all the time</li>
            <li> I got them about a week or so ago and have been using them ever since.&lt;br /&gt;I threw away my old ones as soon as I got these and washed the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;These are AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;So far no shedding because I tightened the metal part in order to keep them in place.&lt;br /&gt;They are very soft and help make my makeup look gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;Great price too!&lt;br /&gt;Must buy.</li>
            <li> Comparable to the expensive brushes I&#x27;ve - they all get the same treatment wash disinfect and let over night to dry then blow dried for fluffiness - I don&#x27;t use a brush more than once and wash after every use so having more of them allows that tedious but necessary step in my opinion.</li>
            <li> These brushes are EVERYTHING. They&#x27;re inexpensive and great quality. I&#x27;d definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> These are fabulous! Soft bristles and effective in use.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  They are wonderful for applying face/body paint.  They are soft and easy to clean and I love the little bag they come in.</li>
            <li> Love my brushes worth the money, and easy to clean</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush set for the price! Well worth the money and the quality is quite good.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really nice especially for the price!  I&#x27;ve had them for over a month now without loosing any of the hair on the brushes.  They are soft and I&#x27;ve gently cleaned them several times without any problems!  Only complaint I have is that you have no idea what brush is used for what. I just use them for what worked for me.</li>
            <li> They are beautiful, and soft to the touch like high quality brushes, but people said that the tips fell off easily so I will just do as previous reviews said and hot glue the ends for added durability</li>
            <li> Very soft and sturdy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price I think they may be a dupe off of Everyday Minerals brushes which are great brushes so I can&#x27;t really complain. All the brushes are soft and great Mineral Makeup. PS the smell goes away in a few days.</li>
            <li> softest best brushes ever. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to caring about makeup enough to own a brush set. I ordered these primarily because of the price, and I&#x27;m glad I did. They&#x27;re very soft (my two year old likes to steal the short handled brush to swirl on her own face), and I haven&#x27;t had any shedding.  They also just look nice. They don&#x27;t look cheap at all. No complaints.</li>
            <li> best brushes I&#x27;ve bought so far!!! they&#x27;re super duper soft, totally worth for the price. Love them!!!</li>
            <li> my only complaint is I wish they came with a label on each brush handle so I can remember and learn what ea is used for. did have funky smell but washed em, dried out and now they are great for use. no smell anymore.</li>
            <li> I must say as picky as I am about my makeup brushes my makeup goes on very well. Looks like I have an air brushed finish!! I am starting to like materials that are not made out of real animal hair... The only thing I did not like was the chemical smell that came out of the plastic wrapped brushes. The smell did go away and I am super thrilled for the price and the results!!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. Soft and durable.</li>
            <li> My order just came. First impression is that they&#x27;re really soft. A bit of a chemical fume but that&#x27;s okay. The only thing is they gave me 2 eyeshadow brushes instead of 1 eyeshadow and 1 angled liner brush.</li>
            <li> Love it. These are good quality brushes. I&#x27;ve used it with both liquid and powder products. So much so I put in another order.  BlacChyna sells these EXACT same brushes for $60.. The ONLY for thing is that kabuki brush. Its too soft... Its still manageable though.. Again great buy.</li>
            <li> I bought two sets for me &amp; my daughter. We both are in love with these great quality brushes, the sizes are perfect &amp; quality and finish is very nice for non-casual use. Love them!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are really well made. I haven&#x27;t had any of the bristles come out at all. They are super soft and I love the style of them. Seller was very helpful when I asked about the tracking number and got back to me very quickly. I would have liked for them to have arrived sooner but overall I love them and had a great experience with the seller. Also they come in a nice draw string bag!</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price</li>
            <li> I wish the brushes were longer. The amount of brushes you get for the price is excellent. I like to use a clean brush with each application and I don&#x27;t have time to wash my brushes every day, so I keep quite a few brush sets on hand to make my life easier. Can&#x27;t complain too much about this set. The blending brush is a little thin if you ask me, and I&#x27;ve never cared much for concealer brushes. I like the wooden handle as it adds a unique touch to my brush collection. I can already tell that the pencil brush is going to be one of my favorites as it is dense and small. I am disappointed in the powder brush because it is so small but I find that it works well with loose powder. The small kabuki is basically useless to me, but I have been able to find good uses for the other brushes. This product gets 4 stars for the price and I don&#x27;t mind the cheaper quality since I rotate my brushes often and am always repurchasing new ones.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my new brushes. Very soft. ‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> I really wanted to give this brush set 5 stars.  The handles are nice and chunky. The bristles are soft to the touch. And there is a wide variety of brushes so good bang for the buck. That being said, I was just cleaning the brushes gently with some brush cleaner (good quality stuff) and the bristles came right out of the pencil tip brush in a big chunk. Mind you, I had not gotten water or cleaner inside the metal piece so it is obvious they were not glued in well at all. I didn&#x27;t even see any glue on the ends of the bristles. I&#x27;m really bummed because that was one of the best brushes in the set. I used it for doing some costume makeup and used it for both contouring, eye makeup, and blending. Now I have to look for a replacement, but I&#x27;m not sure I want to order another set in case it is a manufacturing defect. For the money, I&#x27;d recommend the set, but just be prepared to lose a brush or two due to poor quality control.</li>
            <li> BEST brushes I&#x27;ve ordered so far. Bristles are SO soft (I couldn&#x27;t stop touching them lol)</li>
            <li> Very beautiful looking set of brushes, however, they do not evenly spread my makeup. Bronzer, blush and eye shadow tend to all come off of the brush in one area and is difficult to then blend. Out of these 11 pieces, I really only use 2 of the skinny ones.</li>
            <li> This is VERY upsetting. Not even close to makeup brushes, EXTREME MISSHIP!</li>
            <li> Love them! Great quality! So soft.</li>
            <li> Good price, good quality, would&#x27;ve liked more variety with the smaller brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a make up artists, but these are great. They don&#x27;t shed and are super soft.</li>
            <li> Arrived early on the projected day of arrival. The brushes do have a strong chemical smell at first, but I aired them out and it was fine. Absolutely no shedding, and the brushes pick up my powders brilliantly without holding too much on the brush. The brushes are also SUPER soft. Love the feel. :) Great product.</li>
            <li> They look nice but they are very cheaply made. Mine arrived with three brushes separated from the handles. Looking into the brush head, there was just a dab of dried glue which wasn&#x27;t enough. I like to wash my brushes with baby shampoo and these wouldn&#x27;t stand up to the water at all. Invest in better quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore these brushes.such great quality for an awesome price.does not come apart. I will be buying more as gifts for my loves.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived by the time they were needed(i got one day shipping) there was no smell to them, which was excellent. They are all really amazing and soft my only complaint is that the brushes that you use presumably use as eyeshadow blending ones are far too big for such, that was a bit of a let down, but not enough to mark it down any stars. I would most definitely order again!</li>
            <li> These are such good brushes, they are super soft &amp; blend make up very well for the price</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my brushes!!! They are super soft ! Exactly what I ordered. üëåüôå</li>
            <li> Great paintbrush set. Pre k children will love the unique sizes.</li>
            <li> Brushes in a good assortment of shapes, with a range of soft to firm brushes for every purpose.  Two years later, all my brushes are holding up extremely well.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes fast shipping I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> These brushes are good makeup brushes. There is no shedding or looseness of the handles where the metal adheres to the handles. I gave 4 stare&#x27;s because I did not care for the shortest brush which was very weak and did not perform well, because the bristles aren&#x27;t strong. Just the one short brush showed weak performance. Other than that these are ok and does the job well. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet, so if you do not hear from me again, that will mean that these brushes washed well.</li>
            <li> The overall look of the brushes are great. I&#x27;m not favorable of the hairs being so plastic looking but hey. The only other thing is the smell they smell really strong like nail polish but I&#x27;m sure it can be washed and will go away. Great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product.... i tiught at first price is too good to be true but as soon as they arrive i was so pleased with my products. this brushes are so soft and good for my sensitive skin.! i recommend this 100% you wont be dissapointed! :-)</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Before I thought them I thought they&#x27;d just be poor quality brushes, but when I got them they came in a cute little canvas bag, they are Sooo soft and amazing. I love them. Definitely buying some more!</li>
            <li> Nice and soft. My only complaint is that the bristles are very tight. Hoping that with some use and washing it&#x27;ll spread out a little. Otherwise, very nice for the price. Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Worth it!!! Paying more money just does NOT make sense when you can apply your makeup with these very affordable brushes and get a flawless finish! LOVE THEM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*side note....I had emailed customer service thinking I had not received my brushes, only to find out I had received them, they were just delivered to our mail box, not the porch as is what I&#x27;m used to...but the customer service was trying to help me with the issue and would have been willing to give me a refund had I not received them! Great customer service too! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Brushes are completely falling apart after the first use.</li>
            <li> thank you!! great product!!</li>
            <li> AMAZING! No cheap paint or chemical smell. SO SOFT! Im really actually amazed. Got here really fast too!!</li>
            <li> I took them out of the individual sleeves and fluffed them. And they had NO loose hairs. They are so soft. The fluff brushes are fluffy and the angle brushes are sharp and firm and it is such. Beautiful set. I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Just received these a day ago. Used them this morning and love them!! The bristles are so soft compared to my last set of Shany brushes. These are cheaper and much better quality. I recommend these to anyone who is applying makeup on a daily basis!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who gave these brushes a bad review because they aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;... Well, they are $12. You can&#x27;t expect professional quality similar to MAC or other high end products when you are paying a tenth of the price. That being said these brushes are still amazing and I can tell they will hold up for a long time!</li>
            <li> omg these are the makeup brushes of my DREAMS! LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM! For a great price, and its worth the wait since they don;t come from America, but let me tell you, they came here pretty fast for coming from china, and like i said, WELL WORTH THE WAIT! AMAZING PRODUCT FOR AN AMAZING PRICE! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT, THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE SELLER! XOXOXOXOXOXO I plan on buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li> The reason why I gave them 4/5 stars are because their brushes are to soft. You need a stiffer brush to apply foundation better.!</li>
            <li> Literally got It within a day and it&#x27;s just as described. Super soft thank you! Came with my other order too</li>
            <li> Love the brushes! Better quality than anticipated and super fast shipping</li>
            <li> Beautiful and recommended product</li>
            <li> Good quality and nice.. üòâ</li>
            <li> My new favorite brush set.  Love it love it love it!  easy to clean and soft on the face!</li>
            <li> Love love love. Great value and great bushes.</li>
            <li> Very high quality brushes! Can be compared to sigma or real techniques</li>
            <li> i love them! great quality i would definitely recommend them :)</li>
            <li> I really like the brushes they were soft and inexpensive.  They came before the estimated shipping time.  Bought them September 18 received them October 4. Washed them and no shedding so far</li>
            <li> Great brushes for a good price!</li>
            <li> These brushes were certainly a good investment for me in particular, because I don&#x27;t have any other brushes (other than my E.L.F. ones that cost a dollar and are horrible quality). However, I feel like a person who already has makeup brushes wouldn&#x27;t need to buy these. There are two of the same kabuki flat-head brush but apparently it&#x27;s considered different because one has a really short handle... Although, the fibers on these brushes are so soft and make up glides on with ease. I just wish that the kabuki brushes were more densely packed because that is what is important when buffing on products like foundation. The eyeliner and eye shadow brushes are just as sufficient. After my first use, I washed these brushes, and none of the hairs came out, which is pleasantly surprising. All in all, I&#x27;d definitely recommend these, especially due to the low price.</li>
            <li> Great. Worth every penny. It has been a few strands out of place but I cannot complain for the price. Shipping was fast! Blends very well.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used yet ..but looks like good quality..</li>
            <li> I like the big brushes but not so much of the skinny ones.. i mainly use the skinny angle brush and maybe one of the skinnier brushes for contour on my nose.</li>
            <li> My sweet daughter bought this for me for Christmas.  Love the brushes... very soft bristles and they hold makeup well.  Allows for smooth application.  My daughter did well. ;)</li>
            <li> I gave it a four because it had some loss briesels other than that good</li>
            <li> Would buy again and again! Amazing quality. The kabuki brushes are not ideal for liquid or cream foundations however, as the bristles are not dense enough. Definifely worth it for powder products!</li>
            <li> These brushes came individually wrapped in plastic in a drawstring pouch.  After playing with them and feeling the bristles, I can&#x27;t believe I paid so little for them!!!  I haven&#x27;t tried using them yet but have no doubt that they will perform just as well as my more expensive brushes.  In fact, I got these to go in my professional kit and I think I might buy an extra set for myself!</li>
            <li> I Absolutely Love These Brushes!</li>
            <li> These are great, soft brushes. They are sturdier than I expected!</li>
            <li> Just received my brushes .. love them, super soft !!! A great buy !</li>
            <li> the price is right and the brushes feel luxurious.you can&#x27;t go wrong.they make a great bridesmaid gift. will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a makeup brush aficionado, but I thought these were really nice. I was primarily concerned about quality, especially of appearance, when I bought these, but don&#x27;t worry. The bamboo handle is sturdy, has a clear grain, and is coated in a nice, thick, hard, clear varnish. It looks very authentically wooden. The metal parts of the handle look real and are pretty thick - not super cheap aluminum foil-looking junk. The bristles themselves are synthetic, so they have a shine similar to Barbie hair. They don&#x27;t feel like barbie hair, though. I was worried about this before I bought them, but in person it isn&#x27;t an issue. The shape and coloration of the bristles make up for any sheen-they don&#x27;t look cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like everyone has said, the bristles are SUPER soft. They aren&#x27;t the greatest with picking up product, but they&#x27;re magnificent at not wasting any. I&#x27;d prefer to have to swipe a few times rather than swipe once but waste lots of my makeup. My makeup went on incredibly smoothly- better than with other brushes I&#x27;ve used. The brushes are all pretty dense- I was pleasantly surprised. The small Kabuki isn&#x27;t very dense, but the big Kabuki really is. I think that was on purpose so you could have a really light finishing brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the smell goes, I didn&#x27;t find it overwhelming unless I practically stuck the brush up my nose-which I don&#x27;t suggest you do. They came with a tiny manual that suggested soaking the brushes in warm water and shampoo for ~30 minutes to get rid of any lingering smells from the factory, which I did. The baggie they come with is a simple cotton drawstring. It isn&#x27;t really sturdy, but is effective. Plus, you aren&#x27;t buying this set for the bag, you&#x27;re buying the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, these were shipped from Kentucky, not China, in case you were worried about that kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used these a couple of times, but I really like them and they seem built to last. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat this price!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!!</li>
            <li> So soft. Absolutely love these brushes. High quality for the price. Can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes no shedding so far</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They don&#x27;t shed and they work so well.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! is all I can say I just received these brushes today and I could no wait to use them. The are so soft!  each brush is full and applies makeup flawlessly. I am amazed and I will be buying more brushes from EMAX Design! 10 thumbs up</li>
            <li> oh my gosh - they brushes are awesome. there are so many that I don&#x27;t use all of them</li>
            <li> Shopping experience was great. Price was great. A few of the bigger brushes were nice but some of the shadow brushes were a little too &amp;#34;flingy&amp;#34; for powder. I do really like the brow brush for dipbrow. This kit doesn&#x27;t have a small shadow brush for</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these brushes they won&#x27;t shed and they blend your make up flawlessly. 5 star forsure</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes so soft and no loss of hairs handles are strong and they are really well made</li>
            <li> I like that the bristles is very soft but it had a very very short handle. Its more for a travel size or even for 12year olds. Too small for my liking but the hair is nice</li>
            <li> They ae soft and perfect</li>
            <li> Brushes are great for the price but the handles fell off of one them the same day and loose on another. I tried to exchange but I kept getting a prompt for a refund, so I just ended up keeping them. Still haven&#x27;t glued the handles on but I&#x27;m sure a simple bit of super glue or a glue gun would be a fast, easy fix.</li>
            <li> I loved the brushes the hairs don&#x27;t fall off Luke other brushes would it was shipped fast I really recommend others to get it if your looking for makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I honestly loved these brushes when they came. Why?&lt;br /&gt;- Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;- very new products&lt;br /&gt;- Incredibly soft&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall of the product was that it smelled incredibly bad when I first got them but there is no hurt in washing them, The smell will go away in time.</li>
            <li> They were a gift for my sister for Christmas and she absolutely LOVES them!!!!! Thanks Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft but they are also way too big for the eye area and because the brushes are really soft it makes it harder to pick up color.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes, supper soft</li>
            <li> Received my brushes very quickly. Give 4 stars bc they&#x27;re a lavender color not like what&#x27;s pictured. Soft and I don&#x27;t think they will shed</li>
            <li> Great brushes soft firm bristles very beautiful with snow white tip. It picks up make up really well and makes makeup look so professional when applied</li>
            <li> Brushes are in great condition and of good quality.</li>
            <li> These are high quality brushes. The bristles are very soft and application goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Really nice quality for the price! I&#x27;m by no means an experienced make-up artist, in fact I hardly wear makeup day to day, but the handles seem nice, brushes glued firmly on and the bristles very soft, all in a nice bag. Excited to try them all out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a while and my first impression totally changed. The kabuki brush is good and I love the blush brushes. Great starter set.</li>
            <li> The product shipped earlier than expected and meets my expectations!! There were a couple of lose hairs on the brushed but other than that everything seems great. I can&#x27;t wait to use them and see what everyone is talking about when they say they love them. Definitely worth the price and purchase!</li>
            <li> Fantastic brushes! When i ordered I wasn&#x27;t too sure how the quality would be, because of the price but let me tell you these brushes are awesome. I can&#x27;t believe what you get for the price. Great brushes, great price. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I recommend buying these!!! They are worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> My first set of nice brushes were Sigmas that I got for Christmas about 5 years ago. They recently started getting dry and shed so I decided to purchase some new ones, but didn&#x27;t want to fork over that much cash. I did some research on different brushes for a couple weeks and decided on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are really smooth and apply makeup just like my Sigma brushes. I have have no shedding whatsoever and I have been using them for over a month now. I have sensitive skin and have not had any negative reactions at all.  I was surprised at how short they are at first, but that was only because I was used to my tall Sigma brushes. I would definitely recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for the price but they are really nicely made and sturdy. They apply makeup really nicely and wash up great too with no shedding. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES THEY ARE SO SOFT THEH DONT SHED ! BUYING ANOTHER PACK AGAIN !!!!! PEOPLE PLEASSSSEEEEE BUYYYU THIS ITS PERFECT üëåüòç</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!! Took a couple weeks for shipping but completely understandable since it&#x27;s coming all the way from China.</li>
            <li> Negative: they smell.&lt;br /&gt;Positive: soft bristles, inexpensive,  great blending tools.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and she loves them.  Great brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> When these brushes arrived, I thought they were gorgeous and that they were super soft.  Unfortunately, when I tried to use a foundation brush it shed on my face.  I was not expecting something amazing for what I paid - but I figured they&#x27;d at least last the first few applications.  Since then, they are holding up okay, only shedding a bristle here or there (just the larger brushes). Do I think they are horrible?  No.  Would I buy them again?  Probably not.  I received an Elf brush for free with another order, and it has held up much better.</li>
            <li> they were so cheap and they&#x27;re so soft and they work so well!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and very soft. Came in a nice package. Was sent with prime so it was fast like normal.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes! The face brushes could be a little fuller, but so far no fallout, and the eye brushes are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love these so much. I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Great makeup brushes, Soft and good quality! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these brushes but one of the brushes has a chip in it.. Other than that, it shipped 3 days early and I love how soft they are.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted without the need to spend too much.</li>
            <li> Great brushes at amazing price</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes! Love them! They are so soft and they make my makeup  look flawless! They came earlier than I thought. Great brushes for the price!!!</li>
            <li> So I just got my brushes ! &amp; I love them . They look do expensive ! But guess what they are not.</li>
            <li> I got this set of brushes today they look good I still have to try them all but over all they look good it took like 3 weeks to come indefinitely good quality only one it&#x27;s not well made all of them look good I am happy thanks</li>
            <li> Really really soft brushes, they are really good quality also not very many hairs came out, they&#x27;re dense but smelly so I washed them with some baby shampoo and they work and smell great</li>
            <li> These brushes were a huge disappointment. The very first time I used them, bristles fell out right and left. Can&#x27;t use them for foundation at all.</li>
            <li> I used them this morning and I was very impressed, I also got them the next day which was amazing just when i needed it the most!! These are all the brushes you&#x27;ll need to get that Flawless look!</li>
            <li> I suggest if you are buying your first brush set by these high quality brushes don&#x27;t wear out delivery was fast a couple days after I ordered it was sent buy great price!!!</li>
            <li> I really love these! They just took awhile for me to get them like a month or two. But they&#x27;re so amazing!</li>
            <li> Great value! Beautiful brushes!</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE BRUSHES. These are the softest brushes I have owned. I bought one set for myself and one for my friend. We both love them. They come with a great variety of sizes and uses. Very nice, complete set. Very little shedding on my friend&#x27;s set of brushes and none with mine so far.</li>
            <li> I was positively surprised by the quality of these brushes. They do not shed, even after washing a few times and the bamboo handles are super cute. Some of the brushes are quite small and it makes it perfect for on the go. These are synthetic brushes so it&#x27;s a little more difficult to work with but overall this set is excellent value for money.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes, they are very soft and a really good quality in my opinion especially for the price. The shipment arrived quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled.  :)</li>
            <li> nice set, chemical smell though</li>
            <li> soft ..no shedding exactly as pic</li>
            <li> OH LORD WHAT CAN I SAY I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THESE BRUSHES</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for my daughter and she absolutely loves tthem!</li>
            <li> Did not receive the eyebrow brush :/ unfortunately I just noticed which is a little to late to return</li>
            <li> These have lasted me a few months now and are still in great condition after being used on a daily basis! Great brush set!</li>
            <li> I am on a budget so I cannot afford to spend a lot on makeup brushes. Last week, I was at a super-center and spent a lot on ELF products. Then I saw these and thought I would give it a try. The price is crazy good for how many brushes you get.  Order this and you will not regret this. These brushes are really nice, soft, delicate and smooth on your skin. In comparison to the ELF brushes, the ELF brushes were hard and gave streaks.... definitely did not give me a flawless look. These kabuki brushes make your makeup look much better.  I returned the ELF brushes. The item came fast and looks like the image.  I gave it 4 stars because I wish the shorter brushes were longer. This is a minor issue since they work fine and are lovely. Another reason for the 4 stars is that I wish they offered more brushes. I would be willing to pay a few dollars more if they added more eye brushes and concealer brushes. They give what you need and it is good but I like to have a specific brush for a specific use.  I would definitely buy again. In fact, after receiving these, I ordered another set of kabuki brushes...not this brand but another to mix it up a bit.  Kabuki brushes are lovely in general.  I highly recommend.  They came in plastic wrapper in a sack-like bag. The bag is ugly and your basic drawstring but it does fit all the brushes. You are buying for the brushes. This bag is an afterthought. Buy this. You will really like them.</li>
            <li> I love this set it is a great buy</li>
            <li> Really soft, I love these brushed. Only thing is make up will stick too much, and when I go to wash it, its not completely clean. But I mean for the price I don&#x27;t even mind, I loved them more than my MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes are smaller than I anticipated but for the price they are okay</li>
            <li> The brushes work well and are a good value for what they are</li>
            <li> they pick up color well and work great! fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My blending brush started falling apart as soon as I took it out of the packaging.  All the brushes were okay.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, work perfect in every way</li>
            <li> These are awesome make up brushes and you can&#x27;t beat the value. I thought I would take a chance on these based on the Reviews and I am so glad I did. As someone else posted, they do smell bad but once you take them out of the plastic wrapping, it goes away.  A very minor thing to me.  I am buying more as gifts.  Better quality than I expected.  You will be happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES, THEY&#x27;RE SUPER SOFT, NO SHEDDING SO FAR, AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> These brushes made my contour and highlight look come to life. Has the best coverage, and adds tone. The brushes are well concentrated brushes. I tell all my clients to try them.</li>
            <li> Love way better then all my other brushes does not break me out or make my skin itchy</li>
            <li> wow these are better quality than i expected. the bamboo seems strong and nice. not plasticy at all. the brushes are really soft and distrubute even color. no complaints on this one</li>
            <li> These came and work as expected.  I&#x27;ve had them for a few weeks now and they are still in good shape.</li>
            <li> I figured I would order these brushes and if they sucked it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal because they&#x27;re cheap... Well I was more than satisfied with what I got!! Great product for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying them because of the bad reviews. I have no problem with the bristles falling out. So far so good and very reasonable price. Will update after further use.</li>
            <li> Love just wish the brushes were mark</li>
            <li> First time writing a review on amazon.best brushes ever. Feels like butter On my face and it doesn&#x27;t fall off at all.I&#x27;m obsessed with these.</li>
            <li> Just got my order today and it only took 7 days!! Packaging was perfect no issues what so ever! They&#x27;re beautiful brushes &amp; seem to be perfect so far haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet but I have no doubt they&#x27;ll be everything I hoped for. NO SMELL, NO falling apart or strands falling out (I&#x27;ve messed around with each one) Very very satisfied!!! And seriously for the price these brushes have exceeded my expectations 10 fold!</li>
            <li> This 11 Piece bamboo brush set is beautiful, well made and has some weight to the brushes. The products fibers/hairs are very soft to the touch, well worth the price and that&#x27;s the second thing that&#x27;s so good the price is cheap just about 12 bucks and free 2 day shipping with prime perfect</li>
            <li> Love these! They are soooo soft :)</li>
            <li> Came in good time - very soft - very pretty bamboo handles. Had a bit of a chemically smell before washing. Also, they&#x27;re a bit shorter than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great quality and exactly what I needed. Haven&#x27;t washed them yet though, hoping they don&#x27;t fall apart... Really really great, just wish it came with eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li> Best makeup brushes I have ever tried</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price!:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, unfortunately this brush set didn&#x27;t last long, as hairs became loose and kept falling out in bulk on face. I ended up having to throw the set away. I took care and cleaned my brushes once a week.. Brush hairs just were not as secure as I thought. But I was incredibly happy how long it did last though. Just didn&#x27;t last as long as some of my other brushes would</li>
            <li> Very nice quality! I was actually pleasantly surprised! Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> BRUSHES ARE GREAT. LOOKS AND FEELS WONDERFUL ON MY FACE.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was too good to be true. I was happy to learn that These brushes are affordable AND great quality! Great buy.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing especially for the price . Very soft little to no shedding still breaking them in n very easy to clean</li>
            <li> These brushes are fabulous I am highly satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> Only some brushes came out good.Most didint work for me since they were bent !that was disappointing and they got here pretty late!</li>
            <li> Love them. They&#x27;re soft and the brush hairs dont fall out, they blend my foundation and eyeshadows really well. All around this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> For under $10 u get 11 brushes, similar quality to ecotools. Yes it comes from china so the shipping takes almost a month but i love these brushes. I washed them as soon as i got them and had no fall out. Using them i saw very minimal fall out, even my tarte brushes have a little fall out so that doesnt matter to me. I love these brushes for the price, i was gonna spend over $100 on some sigma brushes, glad i bought these cheap ones first. So happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Super soft and fluffy! I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> I just love this product! They are so smooth and pretty! My heart melted when I saw the little kabuki brush... awwww!</li>
            <li> I really love the makeup Brush.</li>
            <li> Nice looking set of brushes, and good quality.</li>
            <li> Shipped rather quickly. They are really beautiful and takes color great.</li>
            <li> So far so good. No shedding so far. Only complain would be that they don&#x27;t grab on as much product as other brushes. I find myself continuously going over blush.</li>
            <li> Very soft, work well. Only complaint is the Kabuki brushes(handles) are very short</li>
            <li> I could not have purchased a better makeup brush set!!! Perfect quality!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love...no shedding very soft n hold n blend excellently.</li>
            <li> Brushes are soft and luciouse, feels so nice on your face. Oxox</li>
            <li> I order these because I&#x27;m on a budget. I didn&#x27;t expect the quality.  I&#x27;m very impressed. One brush at Ulta or Sephora will cost you what the whole set cost.... I recommend this set!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. But the product is soo cheep, the brissles are falling apart! Only giving two stars because of the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great product given the amazing price..</li>
            <li> These brushes are really soft and come in beautiful packaging. They didn&#x27;t smell like some of the other reviews I read and the bristles have not fallen out all over the place like other reviews have said. The down fall is that these brushes are too soft, but if you&#x27;re on a budget and this is all you can afford, like me, then buy them until you can afford better...but you will have to definitely work (putting in elbow grease) them to achieve that flawless look.</li>
            <li> These are very high quality; the bristles don&#x27;t fall out and they are easy to clean.  great buy, but coming from China, delivery took several weeks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these! Super soft great quality of brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing for face products!  I&#x27;m using the blush, kabuki, face, and blending brush every day and they carry lots of pigment and help with precision application (like for contouring).  Plus, synthetic means happy animals.  That makes me happy!  They&#x27;re better than more expensive brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased from beauty supply stores!</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely loves this brush set so much she bought one for her sister as a gift.</li>
            <li> Brushes are decent, they do have a &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; smell upon open but after a few washes they seemed to be okay. What else would you expect for less than 15.00? A few of mine were cut unevenly, but I can still find uses for them.</li>
            <li> Wonderful set. Very complete and fabulous price!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully soft and high quality brushes. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The brushes are incredibly soft and do the job very well. The price was perfect and the quality is great. I washed them before I used them because they did smell like plastic at first, but that did not affect the quality at all. Love them!</li>
            <li> The bristles on these brushes are super soft and distribute makeup perfectly. They are also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how soft the makeup brush set was and it doesn&#x27;t shed like other brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are wonderful. So soft and extremely well made. Nice weight. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These brushes are well made, but smelled like strong chemicals when I received them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert with makeup brushes but I like these - nice selection - bristles are soft but resilient - good finish on handles</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Amazingly soft.  The foundation brush is a bit prickly when applying foundation, no biggie. I prefer to use the sponge.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t lie for the price it definitely does a great job for my foundation I love it great price I love it I use it everyday when I&#x27;m going out love it... definitely should get ittt</li>
            <li> I received my brushes today and they are awesome!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They are super soft and this set comes with a good variety</li>
            <li> great quality brushes for a low price. I like how soft and durable they are. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet so i hope they survive the washing but overall i would defiantly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> great brushes for the price! minimal shedding and great quality</li>
            <li> What an amazing deal for really good quality brushes! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> First off I love these brushes, they are absolutely perfect for the price!! The only issue is I purchased this with the free gift which meant 12 pieces and I only received 11, missing the eyebrow comb/brush! So disappointing because I really need one of those lol</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic for the price. A great selection and all work well.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush set buy they she&#x27;d really bad when I wash them. I try to be gentle and they still shed. They apply makeup well despite that and do not poke me while applying makeup. They are very very soft too. My only other gripe about this set is that it lacks a good eye shadow brush to pack color on the lid. The one they intended to be used for that purpose does not work well. It works for other things, just not packing color on the lid.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes!  You cannot go wrong with this purchase, especially for the price. They are plush, with great heads, of high quality with nice handles.  The dense brushes are dense without being too stiff.  I can&#x27;t believe I got them for such a great price!  Will be ordering this brand again.</li>
            <li> Love it. It looks great. It feels even better. Does a great job picking up product.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know what most of these brushes are used for but with a little research i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;ll figure it out.  i can say for certain they are very soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, love it! fast shipping. The brushes are of very good quality.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the brushes. Description was accurate and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. A thousand times softer and more hearty than my bare minerals brushes. There is a brush in this set for every application need. I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding and I have been using these brushes from several months now and they have gone through 4 or 5 washes.</li>
            <li> was it supposed to touch water?  because mine fell apart after</li>
            <li> Very thankful for the price! Although it doesn&#x27;t cost as much as high end brands, it absolutely love this set. Haven&#x27;t even used them all yet. So far I use 3 or 4 of them on a regular basis. No problems with them.</li>

All of my other paddle brushes leave streaks, even my Real Techniques one! But this one is very soft, flexible and great for blending!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluffy eye blending brush:&lt;br /&gt;Great for blending eyeshadow on the crease. It kind of has an awkward length, it has long bristles so it&#x27;s very flexible. So I would use this to create a wash of color and to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigger fluffy blending brush:&lt;br /&gt;Great for contour, concealer, maybe a little too big for the eyes but you can try :) perfect in between size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small flat brush: great for concealer, very flexible, great to pat eyeshadow onto lids...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short powder/blush/bronzer brush: very dense, perfect for loose makeup too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angled Shader brush: great for eyeshadow on the lid, crease, brow bone, conturing the nose, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat top Kabuki: dense enough to blend foundation, great for buffing in loose powder, foundation, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angled brush: great for eyebrows, gel eyeliner, eyeshadow on bottom lash line...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smallest flat top kabuki: less dense than flat top kabuki, great for blending, great for touchups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General rating: I would really give this a 10/10 because there&#x27;s barely anything wrong with this kit! My favorites are the angled eyeliner brush and the paddle foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this was a long review oups ^.^&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, have a great day :)at top Kabuki: dense enough to blend foundation, great for buffing in loose powder, foundation, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angled brush: great for eyebrows, gel eyeliner, eyeshadow on bottom lash line...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smallest flat top kabuki: less dense than flat top kabuki, great for blending, great for touchups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General rating: I would really give this a 10/10 because there&#x27;s barely anything wrong with this kit!

            <li> I bought these brushes after trying a more expensive version in a store. Love them and the entire set is about a third of the price of the one brush I tried at the makeup counter.</li>
            <li> These brushes arrived today. I love how soft they are. Great variety for all your makeup needs.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. They&#x27;re extremely soft and really easy to clean, affordable and has really nice quality.</li>
            <li> I seriously love these brushes! I use them every day. They are super soft and feel great on your face when applying makeup. I&#x27;ve bought many other brushes before these and these are way softer than more expensive brushes that I have bought. I did not notice any smell (I washed them as soon as I got them) and there has been no fallout that I have noticed, and I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a few months and washed them quite a few times. I would definitely buy these again if I needed to.</li>
            <li> The brushes look ok and didn&#x27;t shed so far.&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because I didn&#x27;t receive 2 brushes ( angled brush and the third from the left( don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called)&lt;br /&gt;Please send me the 2 brushes!&lt;br /&gt;Will update if the brushes will be send my way.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. Not a big make up wearer but the variety is awesome. I love how soft but sturdy the brushes are! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes, makes a big difference in my application. Looks smooth and well blended.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected! All peices were there. Came in an orange bag. There is no bad smell and they are super soft! The bristles are white but in different lighting are bluish purple. I haven&#x27;t officially used them but I will update when I do (:</li>
            <li> Plenty of options to choose from for every makeup need. The hairs aren&#x27;t left all over my face or falling into my cleavage ;) they feel nice and do a good job.</li>
            <li> For the price, these brushes are AMAZING. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Thank you. There are enough brushes in this set for me and my two daughters.</li>
            <li> These are excellent brushes. So soft and gentle on your skin. The carrying case is just an added bonus. Definitely recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got the wood handled set of brushes simply for the lack of stores in my area that sell makeup brushes. I absolutely adore them. They feel like decent quality brushes in your hand, and are very minimal in respect to shedding. They also come in a pouch which is nice for storing!</li>
            <li> I am by no means and expert, but these brushes seem good quality!</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping!!  Brushes ate awesome,  very soft and sturdy...well made.</li>
            <li> Quality all the way. I bought several sets to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> SOFT DURABLE AMAZING BRUSHES!!!!! hands down some some of the best brushes i have used. They clean up nicely and easily too</li>
            <li> Love them great quality</li>
            <li> The brushes are perfect and what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Overall love the product!!!&lt;br /&gt;Only think I hate is that the powder brush doesn&#x27;t apply the powder well..</li>
            <li> these are really great brushes extremely soft no shedding at all. picks up the product good the don&#x27;t eat any of the product</li>
            <li> the best, love the different options for different uses to smooth and contour love it does not leave those darn bristles anywhere mine had not shed at all!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes for a GREAT price!</li>
            <li> So happy to have these brushes! They won&#x27;t break the bank. They&#x27;re so soft. I used about 5 brushes already putting on my makeup lol. The little flat top brushes were great for foundation and the different angled brushes for eyeshadow worked great. There&#x27;s a pointed one to get into the eye crease, the small angled for highlighting under your eyebrow, and the flat ones for lid. And even a fluffy brush I&#x27;ve heard so much about! awesome for blending. This is my first set  but it has pretty much everything you need if you are starting out like me.</li>
            <li> Love the eye shadow brushes</li>
            <li> Love this set. Sooo soft and surprisingly good quality for the price!</li>
            <li> These are soft and easy to use</li>
            <li> These brushes really are SOFT! Amazing quality for the price! And shopping was speedy quick. I honestly kept in mind that I get what I pay for, but, damn. These brushes are great. Takes in color amazingly! Might buy another for my sister &amp; mother.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes but I didn&#x27;t receive the angled eyeliner brush :( instead I just received two of the same brush, and eyeshadow brush. Four stars for the missing brush, would have been 5.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes. Nice and soft and the bristles stay on. Great product.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! They are actually made the bamboo or wood or whatever! They are super soft and have worked wonderfully for me!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really soft and nice!</li>
            <li> They are soft im happy with them</li>
            <li> These brushes are simply amazing. They are so soft and hold up well. When I got them, they did not smell at all?!</li>
            <li> these brushes are incredible! i am completely satisfied and cannot believe the quality for the price!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing for the price and they came in much faster then said.</li>
            <li> These are the best makeup brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. They are extremely soft and very well made. Fast shipping too. I&#x27;ll have to purchase more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Their really soft and look very nice and I love the bag they come in. (:</li>
            <li> I really like these. They are just as good a Mac. You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted! Perfect amount of brushes for all my makeup needs!</li>
            <li> Love this item. Has a little smell to it.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. They do smell weird but air them out and toss all the packaging material and they should be fine. By the way, mine didn&#x27;t include an orange carrying pouch and the eyelash comb/brush.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my little sister as a gift, she absolutely loved them! She uses them everyday, since she is just starting out to wear makeup and learn about brushes. I figured I&#x27;d buy her these and they were perfect. I think I might just purchase a set for my self! No fall out, they do smell a little funny but once cleaned the smell goes away. They really just smell like brand new plastic. They were well packages and came in a cute little bag.. fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> not high end brushes but work</li>
            <li> I was iffy because of some reviews saying they smelled and shed,they do smell a bit but Really good brushes. Recommend them and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really like this set. The brushes apply make-up evenly. I have not had any issue with shedding at all. I use these daily.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> These brushes came so quick and theyre soooo softtt. I seriously cant believe I got them for 10 bucks. So happy</li>
            <li> Not the best but they work</li>
            <li> I love the brushes! I always used to buy Sigma. Not anymore!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. I mainly use the little kabuki brush and the eyeliner brush (though I use it for my eyebrows-best brush I&#x27;ve had for them!). Also the all over powder brush and smudging brush are some of my favs. The bristles are very soft. I would def buy again!</li>
            <li> Really really really happy with what I got!!! The brushes are really soft ! And everything for a really good deal</li>
            <li> Very very nice just for that little price!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great for the price ! Super soft bristles . Comes with nice linen carry bag. Came from China so it took some time but over all very satisfied .</li>
            <li> These brushes are excellent!  For the amount I pay for individual brushes I could&#x27;ve gotten 3 SETS of these!  They are soft, but not flimsy as some brushes can be.  They have just the right amount of firmness and density - the flat top brush works well for powder foundations/mineral veils and is dense enough to blend liquid/cream foundation.  I have worked with an array of makeup brushes and these have exceeded my expectations!  They pick up pigments well and make blending a breeze!  Love them!  They were going to be my backup/quick-makeup brushes, but they have now become my go-to makeup brushes for photo shoots.</li>
            <li> Okay brushes. The foundation brushes are soft and work well, yet the eyeshadow brushes do not blend and pick up color well. There are better options out there for this price.</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;m just starting out this who make up thing . I&#x27;ll be 30 next year ! Anyway, the brushes came faster than anticipated , they are super soft and I&#x27;m so ready to use them .! Once I&#x27;ve washed the brushes a few times I&#x27;ll give an updated review but so far so good :)</li>
            <li> Love them. So soft and are a great set.</li>
            <li> Really soft. Nice packaging.</li>
            <li> I purchased two sets of these brushes hoping they would be soft and of good quality. I&#x27;m SO happy I purchased two sets.  These brushes are INCREDIBLY SOFT. They do not have any strong odor whatsoever straight out of the little baggie. They come wrapped in plastic as well. They are such great quality for the price. The brushes are dense and they don&#x27;t shed. Even the foundation brush that most of us don&#x27;t use is extremely soft and packed densely. I literally might buy another two sets.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and travel friendly! They came really fast, faster than I thought. Definitely can&#x27;t beat the price, great quality for the price point.</li>
            <li> Cute and Convenient to be taken anywhere.</li>
            <li> It took longer to arrive than I expected but I understand that&#x27;s not their fault, It&#x27;s a very good product, I&#x27;m very happy with it! Really great quality, thank you.</li>
            <li> Wife likes them, but she hasn&#x27;t actually gotten to use any of them yet.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. I bought these for my wife and she&#x27;s extremely satisfied with the feel and results.</li>
            <li> I love some of these brushes but I think some of the eyeshadow brushes are too big and not good quality so I usually just apply the shadow on my lid with my finger</li>
            <li> super soft! really can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
            <li> enjoying .. good stuff :)</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! I wish the eyeliner brush was more angled but oh well. üòå</li>
            <li> After reading tons of reviews and spending. 3 days looking for brushes I finally decided on these ones! They came in quick! A few days before I had make another order and some of that stuff still isn&#x27;t in. I did go with these thinking there would be some sort of guidelines for what to use the larger brushes for but that&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ll be washing and using them today. The package that the brushes come in smells but that brushes don&#x27;t smell at all and even if they did that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re supposed to wash them! They&#x27;re individually wrapped, soft and so far no hairs have fallen out.. can&#x27;t to use them! If something changes I&#x27;ll update the post! But so far they&#x27;re exactly as the picture and description. Great price for great quality. I have a baby now so I will not pay 30 spars for ONE brush. That is just nonsense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my brushes! Very little shedding and they do a great job for each of their intended uses.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Brushes feel great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> very well packaged very soft. i thought initially too soft but they do the job just fine.no stray bristles. good purchase.</li>
            <li> Great brushed for the price. I would recommend for beginners. They are soft durable and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing another set very soon!</li>
            <li> All the brushes you&#x27;ll need to get the look desired.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with merchandise</li>
            <li> Great brushes!! 100% happy with this purchase. Just bought a second set for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes. Love it</li>
            <li> I use these all the time! I love them! I also used prime shipping, so I was blessed to receive my package for immediate use. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy. I&#x27;m a beginner with makeup, so I don&#x27;t exactly know what EVERY brush is for. But I play with them a lot to try out different looks. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I was way overdue on getting some makeup brushes and I am so glad I finally did. These are working great for me so far, and I am very happy with my selection :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are the absolutely the best that I have. I love them, great quality.</li>
            <li> I just got these. They seem to be really good quality, and they&#x27;re even better because of the price. Great for travel or for a gift. Can&#x27;t beat it. I don&#x27;t care for the bamboo handles but I don&#x27;t really have a whole lot to complain about at this price point.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal on makeup brushes. Order this if you are a casual or moderate brush user. Not makeup artist or professional quality but definitely exceptional for the price. Ordering some for my sister. I have been using for 3 weeks and so far they have held up very well and are pretty soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> Wish I could go gaga the way others have, but all the fluffy brushes are way too soft and a chunk of bristles from the blush brush fell out immediately.  And I mean a chunk, not one, two, ten, but the brush is ruined even though I never used it.  A couple of the shadow and contour brushes are great, but overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these or buy them again.</li>
            <li> I have ordered about 10 of these sets for Christmas/birthday gifts and everyone loves them.  Got myself a set and they are brilliant.  I would highly recommend this purchase and loved that it was included in prime.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Exactly what i need for mobile device repair.</li>
            <li> My order actually got here a day before it was suppose to, which made me very happy. Love the brushes! I am a beginner at using brushes and these have been great so far. Recommend getting for the price, quality and the amount of brushes you receive.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these! Just got them in yesterday 3/3/15 and they are super soft! You know how sometimes you can buy cheapy make up brushes from the drug/grocery store and they be super hard that when you use them on your face you feel nothing but bristles scraping you? Ugh!! Well these are NOTHING like that! As soon I got home I washed them with hot water and soap, let dry overnight and used in the morning -this morning. Yes some of the bristles did come off but that&#x27;s really to be expected with all make up brushes, come on, you won&#x27;t find a perfect brush, especially new that doesn&#x27;t shed a few. However, they did a great job and Im really happy about my purchase!</li>
            <li> very soft and holding up well after 3 months of use! great deal!</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! So worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy brushes..</li>
            <li> These brushes are great quality and so affordable. So soft on sensitive skin. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. :)</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Don&#x27;t shed. Good quality.</li>
            <li> buenas las brochas, me encantan</li>
            <li> Sephora sells ONE brush for 35$. This set less than 15$!!! I wasn&#x27;t expecting such great brushes!! Definitely professional style brushes, my makeup looks so much better now!! Worth it 100%!</li>
            <li> Amazing thank you Dragon pad</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Decent soft brushes, no one wants to spend $30 on one make up brush if you&#x27;re frugle and want to save money these are the way to go. Plus I feel if I ruin them or they get ruined it will be no big deal.</li>
            <li> I love them! I honestly can&#x27;t tell the diferent between this ones and a $70 set! They work perfectly and do not shed when applying make up or even then I am cleaning them.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased at the quality and quantity of these brushes. They&#x27;re soft and absorbent which allows a nice application. However, they did have an odor that resembled glue so I allowed them to air out.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE. I&#x27;ve been using them for months and months.</li>
            <li> The brushes work good the britsol do not come off with every wash</li>
            <li> so soft and just wonderfully made</li>
            <li> Very nice and soft brushes! Wooden sturdy handles</li>
            <li> these brushes feel and perform as cheap as they are</li>
    </ol>
