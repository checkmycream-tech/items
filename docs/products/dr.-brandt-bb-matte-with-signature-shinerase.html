    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Out of the 4 BB creams that I&#x27;ve tried, I like this one probably the best.  </li>
            <li>Perfectly matched my skin.</li>
            <li>dr. brandy&#x27;s BB cream is the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I felt this color was a very good match.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coverage wise, I thought this was very good.</li>
            <li>For evening out my skin tone and giving me a nice, matte finish, I thought this was wonderful.</li>
            <li>I think this would be great during the winter time, while I like to use the SK one during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It adds just a hint of coverage, and leave my face looking great.</li>
            <li>I greatly prefer my Tarte BB cream (the tinted primer version) or Jouer Matte Moisture Tint with a touch of setting powder.  </li>
            <li>medium was a good match for me- not too ashy and not too light.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have a tanned, olive complexion, and thought it a good match.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, don&#x27;t expect this to give as good a coverage as your foundation.</li>
            <li>but if you have skin like mine, and have oily or combination skin, and can afford a $40 dollar price tag, you will probably love this!</li>
            <li>And, if you tend towards sweaty or oily skin, you&#x27;re still going to want to dust your face with some kind of finishing powder.</li>
            <li>you have anything darker than the lightest of brown skin tones, you&#x27;re going to look like you&#x27;re wearing some kind of kabuki mask.</li>
            <li>Now, with that said, I have nice skin.</li>
            <li>For me, this qualifies as a nice foundation.</li>
            <li>While this is excellent as a light, almost invisible barrier against the sun, it&#x27;s got a mild tint to it, so that it also evens out your skin tone.</li>
            <li>tried it with light moisturizer and without, and found that it worked fairly well both ways.  </li>
            <li>Also, be sure to shake the tube before applying.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>In fact, the ONLY thing I like better about this product than the others I have tried is the fact that it has a flip top (rather than screw off) cap--that is great!  </li>
            <li>are going for a more dewy look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed this mostly non-oily sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I would describe myself as more of an Nc25-35 type of skin tone</li>
            <li>BB Matte with Signature SHINERASE by Dr. Brant is one of the better BB creams I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>, this one comes close as favorite.  </li>
            <li>I tried it with my fingers and with the Real Techniques buffing brush, but did not get great coverage.  </li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall:  This is just ok to me.  </li>
            <li>It has way better coverage, lasts all day, and does not require a ton of concealer to be wearable.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this works for people with perfect skin with no redness or hyperpigmentation, but I can&#x27;t see a use for a product with such light coverage on its own.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and rarely use makeup.</li>
            <li>I love the product and know that they are not making it anymore.</li>
            <li>I did get some shine, but I thought it was pretty good for oil control.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice, matte \\&quot;no-makeup\\&quot; finish, that&#x27;s perfect for those days when you want a bit of perfecting and oil control, but don&#x27;t want to bother with heavy foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It did have a stronger, chemical smell than I liked, but I was able to overlook it at first.  </li>
            <li>I first sampled it in a subscription box, and thought it was good but too light.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or slimy going on, and is easy to apply and blend.  </li>
            <li>Although the coverage was good, I just did not notice any particular mattifying</li>
            <li>The product went on fine and blended easily.  </li>
            <li>Maybe as my tan fades it could be too dark, but for now it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>When I first used this product, I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked it at first.  </li>
            <li>In addition, although it went on smoothly and evens out skin tone a bit, I didn&#x27;t like how it settled into the fine lines in my maturing face</li>
            <li>My skin is also very oily and I really liked the coverage and performance of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, my quest continues for something that will keep me shine free till quitting time.</li>
            <li>It probably would be too light for anyone darker than NC35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coverage:  Extremely light.  </li>
            <li>The texture of this BB cream doesn&#x27;t really smooth skin in the way that a primer does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing this product without foundation despite its tinted</li>
            <li>(something I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable doing with the Dr. Brandt product).</li>
            <li>I have olive skin and this color was too light.  </li>
            <li>This reminds me of my favorite Sonia Kashuk tinted moisturizer but with a much thicker, more matte appearance.</li>
            <li>did notice that it says right on the tube to make sure to mix well before using.  </li>
            <li>They were nice, but not too noteworthy -- a bit like a decent tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Once, when I opened the product, it had separated somewhat, and the first thing that came out was more oily--how can this product be matte if it is oil-based?  </li>
            <li>The mattifying  quality of this bb cream is what makes this so unique.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, but I felt that it went on smoother and felt more comfortable over a light</li>
            <li>I tried this product through the Vine program because I am looking for a natural-look makeup when I go out to special</li>
            <li>I found the color to be true to the sample on the box and tube.  </li>
            <li>so now I&#x27;m sure the whole formula is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The color covers evenly and is a true matte makeup.</li>
            <li>Using the product did give me a more finished look without appearing as though I had too much makeup on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian with usually a golden beige type skin and this shade was a good match for me.  </li>
            <li>The shade was on the pink side, I would have preferred something a bit more neutral to warm.  </li>
            <li>For me, the shade is a hair on the light side, but does blend quite readily with my skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that this product provided much moisture despite its claim to \\&quot;smooth and hydrate\\&quot; the skin.  </li>
            <li>It applied smoothly and pretty effortlessly with just fingers, and didn&#x27;t move through a day of working at a salon: that includes exposure to blowdryers and hot water.</li>
            <li>I do have brown skin, but I fall on the lighter side of brown (after living in New York city for all these years, and working in a basement, I haven&#x27;t really seen the sun in more years than I can count).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re lucky enough to fall within the limited range of skin tones, it blends beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I would actually love it even more if there was a slightly darker shade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Blendability:  This product seemed kind of dry to me.  </li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re paying this kind of money for a product, you want to ensure that every single drop gets used on your face, and not on the sink.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty good, but it only partially covered redness and did not cover hyperpigmentation at all.ness or hyperpigmentation, but I can&#x27;t see a use for a product with such light coverage on its own.  </li>
            <li>matte finished kept oil away for at least 6-8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Decent coverage and great SPF.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given that my skin does tend towards oily as noted above, I was especially interested in trying this product, which is labeled as being \\&quot;Matte.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>first issue with this product is that it did not match my skin tone at all.</li>
            <li>When you apply it with your hands and fingers, just be aware that you will have colored palms/fingers.  </li>
            <li>is my first time using BB Cream, and I&#x27;m deeply satisfied with the overall experience.</li>
            <li>Although I have fair skin, the fair/light BB cream was too pale.</li>
            <li>needed very little product to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>The medium to dark is perfect for my slightly tanned summer skin.</li>
            <li>It also washes clean off your hands - a major plus!  </li>
            <li>First, the \\&quot;Medium to Dark\\&quot; shade worked fine with my skin tone, which I would describe as medium (Italian background), but it would probably be too lighter for anyone darker than me.  </li>
            <li>B008C131AK Maybelline New York Dream Fresh BB Cream, Medium]]</li>
            <li>my usual primer (Estee Lauder Matte) works better in terms of providing a smooth canvas for applying foundation.  </li>
            <li>My skin is pretty good, but it only partially covered redness and did not cover hyperpigmentation at all.</li>
            <li>as much as it performed well</li>
            <li>because it really did work well otherwise.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day skin still looked much smoother, MATTE and didn&#x27;t look like it moved a budge.</li>
            <li>If you have medium skin, DO NOT use too much of this product, since you&#x27;ll have to put this product on your whole face to even out the color.  </li>
            <li>To the product&#x27;s credit, if you have oily skin, the this product will really matte out your skin.  </li>
            <li>My advice is to use the product very sparsely.  </li>
            <li>In fact, any sort of additional powders would be too much.</li>
            <li>It does control shine quite well, even on very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Really minimizes pores on application.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see myself ever wanting a product with such light coverage.  </li>
            <li>It looks, however, much lighter on the skin once</li>
            <li>however when applied, it gives a much \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; appearance.  </li>
            <li>is my first time using BB Cream, and I&#x27;m deeply satisfied with the overall experience.y on a lot better than foundation, and when you&#x27;re wearing it, the look is so subtle that it looks like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup (AND feels like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup,</li>
            <li>First of all, my skin is naturally medium-tinted, and this product goes on a bit more dark than I would like.  </li>
            <li>tried the product several more times with the same results.  </li>
            <li>True to the product description, it gives an instant makeover, that looks natural.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would only recommend this product for this who have more dry skin/</li>
            <li>nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to control oily shine is similar to Face Perfector by Avon (for those who have used that product and are interested in the comparison).  </li>
            <li>For such a lightweight formula it really held, so I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, they tended to either migrate and disappear completely off</li>
            <li>I notice that the shine on my face is completely gone</li>
            <li>the bottle REALLY well before you open it.</li>
            <li>I can get the same effect with primers, mattifying powders, and whatnot, but I really feel as if I can smear this into my face and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>and I have personally used similar products that were less expensive and produced results that were as good, or better, than the Dr. Brandt product.  </li>
            <li>That being said, it does stay on a lot better than foundation, and when you&#x27;re wearing it, the look is so subtle that it looks like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup (AND feels like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup,</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve used dr. brandt BB Matte with Signature SHINERASE, Medium to Dark on and off for a few months (mostly when my main tinted moisturizer has run out) and I have to say that this product just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>However, the less expensive Olay product (in my humble opinion) provided better tinted coverage and evened out my skin tone sufficiently enough that I felt more comfortable skipping foundation</li>
            <li>Shine is a major issue for me.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I only use this now when I&#x27;ve run out of my main moisturizer with tint (or if I have a tiny blemish).</li>
            <li>If they fixed these two issues, I would definitely try it again though</li>
            <li>It looks very dark right out of the tube</li>
            <li>I have never been big on foundation--I use it maybe 2-3 times per year, on a special occasion such as a holiday or a wedding--mainly because no matter what brand I have tried, it has always felt to heavy on my oily-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>No other BB creams, primers, foundations need to be mixed well before using so</li>
            <li>It looks dark, but it blends in very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have medium complexion, and the medium dark is a little light.</li>
            <li>, my other BB creams aren&#x27;t that high.  </li>
            <li>I found it a little too heavy to be comfortably worn all day.</li>

            <li> I do have brown skin, but I fall on the lighter side of brown (after living in New York city for all these years, and working in a basement, I haven&#x27;t really seen the sun in more years than I can count).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lucky enough to fall within the limited range of skin tones, it blends beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I would actually love it even more if there was a slightly darker shade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blendability:  This product seemed kind of dry to me.  </li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re paying this kind of money for a product, you want to ensure that every single drop gets used on your face, and not on the sink.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty good, but it only partially covered redness and did not cover hyperpigmentation at all.ness or hyperpigmentation, but I can&#x27;t see a use for a product with such light coverage on its own.  </li>
            <li> matte finished kept oil away for at least 6-8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Decent coverage and great SPF.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given that my skin does tend towards oily as noted above, I was especially interested in trying this product, which is labeled as being \\&quot;Matte.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> first issue with this product is that it did not match my skin tone at all.</li>
            <li> When you apply it with your hands and fingers, just be aware that you will have colored palms/fingers.  </li>
            <li> is my first time using BB Cream, and I&#x27;m deeply satisfied with the overall experience.</li>
            <li> Although I have fair skin, the fair/light BB cream was too pale.</li>
            <li> needed very little product to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> The medium to dark is perfect for my slightly tanned summer skin.</li>
            <li> It also washes clean off your hands - a major plus!  </li>
            <li> First, the \\&quot;Medium to Dark\\&quot; shade worked fine with my skin tone, which I would describe as medium (Italian background), but it would probably be too lighter for anyone darker than me.  </li>
            <li> B008C131AK Maybelline New York Dream Fresh BB Cream, Medium]]</li>
            <li> my usual primer (Estee Lauder Matte) works better in terms of providing a smooth canvas for applying foundation.  </li>
            <li> My skin is pretty good, but it only partially covered redness and did not cover hyperpigmentation at all.</li>
            <li> as much as it performed well</li>
            <li> because it really did work well otherwise.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day skin still looked much smoother, MATTE and didn&#x27;t look like it moved a budge.</li>
            <li> If you have medium skin, DO NOT use too much of this product, since you&#x27;ll have to put this product on your whole face to even out the color.  </li>
            <li> To the product&#x27;s credit, if you have oily skin, the this product will really matte out your skin.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to use the product very sparsely.  </li>
            <li> In fact, any sort of additional powders would be too much.</li>
            <li> It does control shine quite well, even on very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Really minimizes pores on application.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself ever wanting a product with such light coverage.  </li>
            <li> It looks, however, much lighter on the skin once</li>
            <li> however when applied, it gives a much \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; appearance.  </li>
            <li> is my first time using BB Cream, and I&#x27;m deeply satisfied with the overall experience.y on a lot better than foundation, and when you&#x27;re wearing it, the look is so subtle that it looks like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup (AND feels like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup,</li>
            <li> First of all, my skin is naturally medium-tinted, and this product goes on a bit more dark than I would like.  </li>
            <li> tried the product several more times with the same results.  </li>
            <li> True to the product description, it gives an instant makeover, that looks natural.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I would only recommend this product for this who have more dry skin/</li>
            <li> nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to control oily shine is similar to Face Perfector by Avon (for those who have used that product and are interested in the comparison).  </li>
            <li> For such a lightweight formula it really held, so I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, they tended to either migrate and disappear completely off</li>
            <li> I notice that the shine on my face is completely gone</li>
            <li> the bottle REALLY well before you open it.</li>
            <li> I can get the same effect with primers, mattifying powders, and whatnot, but I really feel as if I can smear this into my face and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> and I have personally used similar products that were less expensive and produced results that were as good, or better, than the Dr. Brandt product.  </li>
            <li> That being said, it does stay on a lot better than foundation, and when you&#x27;re wearing it, the look is so subtle that it looks like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup (AND feels like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup,</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve used dr. brandt BB Matte with Signature SHINERASE, Medium to Dark on and off for a few months (mostly when my main tinted moisturizer has run out) and I have to say that this product just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> However, the less expensive Olay product (in my humble opinion) provided better tinted coverage and evened out my skin tone sufficiently enough that I felt more comfortable skipping foundation</li>
            <li> Shine is a major issue for me.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I only use this now when I&#x27;ve run out of my main moisturizer with tint (or if I have a tiny blemish).</li>
            <li> If they fixed these two issues, I would definitely try it again though</li>
            <li> It looks very dark right out of the tube</li>
            <li> I have never been big on foundation--I use it maybe 2-3 times per year, on a special occasion such as a holiday or a wedding--mainly because no matter what brand I have tried, it has always felt to heavy on my oily-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> No other BB creams, primers, foundations need to be mixed well before using so</li>
            <li> It looks dark, but it blends in very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have medium complexion, and the medium dark is a little light.</li>
            <li> , my other BB creams aren&#x27;t that high.  </li>
            <li> I found it a little too heavy to be comfortably worn all day.</li>
            <li> In fact, this product offers the lightest coverage of any BB cream or Tinted Moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried other than Urban Decay Naked Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has the oily T-zone, but I&#x27;m also not exactly in my youth and fight wrinkles and age spots, so put a moisturizer down first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> and I have absolutely none of the oil slicks that I&#x27;d usually have on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Even then, I still was not satisfied and I topped it each time with BareMinerals Ready Foundation.</li>
            <li> I do not normally react to makeup or other skin care products, so this surprised me.</li>
            <li> While it managed to give me a clean look overall, it didn&#x27;t do anything for the dark circles under my eyes when I got poor sleep the night before.</li>
            <li> Even using a small amount will pose a challenge in blending to your natural skin color, especially if you are in the medium skin range.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the seal on the bottle, I had a few drops of clear liquid fall out before I got to the tinted cream underneath.</li>
            <li> But using too much will make your face look completely matted and fake</li>
            <li> BB creams usually are a bit lighter, which I prefer, although they are still something I only use occasionally, not on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only ever use concealer for highlighting and if I have the odd blemish.</li>
            <li> actual price point seems a little steep, for what this is.</li>
            <li> And stayed matte longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> For other people, this appears to be more of a base, or a primer.</li>
            <li> It says medium to Dark, but the tone was rather salmon colored.</li>
            <li> I received this product in the shade Medium Dark.  </li>
            <li> only negative against this product is that it did make my chin and jaw feel itchy.</li>
            <li> I received this product in the Medium to Dark shade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I found this product was merely average</li>
            <li> I did a test using one that I like on half my face and this on the other half.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is a little oilier than other BB creams, but it dries to a matte finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and the smell actually lasts for several hours while I&#x27;m wearing it, making me really hate it by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face, then looks a little shiny, but not so, after applying the BB Matte.  </li>
            <li> It can get a bit messy on your (hand) towels.  </li>
            <li> I learned the hard way, and ended up having a face that looked oddly synthetic.  </li>
            <li> I use a Mattifying, powder based foundation to help prevent the dreaded noontime oil slick.</li>
            <li> I am 33 with very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Initially, when I saw how dark the product appeared when it was squeezed from the tube I was fearful that it would be too dark for my medium skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s then just about impossible to get the goop back into the tube -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a base lotion with only the mildest coverage.</li>
            <li> The admixture is just wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking off another star because of the unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a very faint scent, almost undetectable.</li>
            <li> I did like this product as a base for the BareMinerals powder.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a horrible reaction, but it was something I noticed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am of Indian origin  with NC 40 skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;The medium was a good match for me- not too ashy and not too light.&lt;br /&gt;The matte finished kept oil away for at least 6-8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;Decent coverage and great SPF.&lt;br /&gt;However if you have combo skin and/or flaky spots, this may bee too drying for you.</li>
            <li> I found the color to be true to the sample on the box and tube.  I have a tanned, olive complexion, and thought it a good match. Maybe as my tan fades it could be too dark, but for now it&#x27;s perfect.  True to the product description, it gives an instant makeover, that looks natural. There&#x27;s a very faint scent, almost undetectable. Also, be sure to shake the tube before applying.&lt;br /&gt; My skin has the oily T-zone, but I&#x27;m also not exactly in my youth and fight wrinkles and age spots, so put a moisturizer down first thing in the morning.  My face, then looks a little shiny, but not so, after applying the BB Matte.  Even hours later, still no shine!  I like the SPF 30, my other BB creams aren&#x27;t that high.  Out of the 4 BB creams that I&#x27;ve tried, I like this one probably the best.  I did a test using one that I like on half my face and this on the other half.  Dr. Brandt&#x27;s won the test of no shine, so will have to give this one all 5 stars.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product, I really liked it.  It did have a stronger, chemical smell than I liked, but I was able to overlook it at first.  I&#x27;m Asian with usually a golden beige type skin and this shade was a good match for me.  My skin is also very oily and I really liked the coverage and performance of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that it says right on the tube to make sure to mix well before using.  This confuses me a bit because how are you supposed to &amp;#34;mix well&amp;#34; when it&#x27;s in a tube?  I&#x27;ve noticed that sometimes if it&#x27;s not mixed well enough, the makeup actually separates inside the tube and it&#x27;s really gross.  Well, it&#x27;s then just about impossible to get the goop back into the tube - so now I&#x27;m sure the whole formula is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  No other BB creams, primers, foundations need to be mixed well before using so I&#x27;m taking off a star for that.  I&#x27;m taking off another star because of the unpleasant smell.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and the smell actually lasts for several hours while I&#x27;m wearing it, making me really hate it by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as much as it performed well and I really liked it at first.  In the end, I cannot even finish using this product because of the cons.  Cannot recommend.  If they fixed these two issues, I would definitely try it again though because it really did work well otherwise.</li>
            <li> Before this product, I had only tried drugstore BB creams. They were nice, but not too noteworthy -- a bit like a decent tinted moisturizer. At the end of the day, they tended to either migrate and disappear completely off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dr. brandt SHINEERASE finally gave me the \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; factor with the BB trend. It applied smoothly and pretty effortlessly with just fingers, and didn&#x27;t move through a day of working at a salon: that includes exposure to blowdryers and hot water. At the end of the day skin still looked much smoother, MATTE and didn&#x27;t look like it moved a budge. For such a lightweight formula it really held, so I highly recommend this. Saving up my pennies for another dr. brandt product now!</li>
            <li> I have been using BB creams for several years now.  I have never been big on foundation--I use it maybe 2-3 times per year, on a special occasion such as a holiday or a wedding--mainly because no matter what brand I have tried, it has always felt to heavy on my oily-prone skin.  BB creams usually are a bit lighter, which I prefer, although they are still something I only use occasionally, not on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that my skin does tend towards oily as noted above, I was especially interested in trying this product, which is labeled as being \\&quot;Matte.\\&quot;  First, the \\&quot;Medium to Dark\\&quot; shade worked fine with my skin tone, which I would describe as medium (Italian background), but it would probably be too lighter for anyone darker than me.  The product went on fine and blended easily.  One thing I noticed immediately, however, was that my face looked shinier AFTER I applied this BB cream!  Although the coverage was good, I just did not notice any particular mattifying effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the product several more times with the same results.  Once, when I opened the product, it had separated somewhat, and the first thing that came out was more oily--how can this product be matte if it is oil-based?  I prefer the BB I have been using, which include [[ASIN:B008C131AK Maybelline New York Dream Fresh BB Cream, Medium]] and [[ASIN:B00D6EDGZI Pond&#x27;s Luminous Finish BB Plus Cream with SPF 15, Medium Shade]].  In fact, the ONLY thing I like better about this product than the others I have tried is the fact that it has a flip top (rather than screw off) cap--that is great!  Otherwise, I would only recommend this product for this who have more dry skin/are going for a more dewy look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed this mostly non-oily sunscreen. The color covers evenly and is a true matte makeup. I found it a little too heavy to be comfortably worn all day.</li>
            <li> I have oily, almond brown skin. Shine is a major issue for me. I use a Mattifying, powder based foundation to help prevent the dreaded noontime oil slick. Unfortunately, I need more than just a powder foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hoped Shinerase would solve my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first issue with this product is that it did not match my skin tone at all. It says medium to Dark, but the tone was rather salmon colored. It matched the palm of my hand, but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd, it did not get rid of the shine. By 12:20, by face was reflecting like foil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my quest continues for something that will keep me shine free till quitting time.</li>
            <li> Where do I begin?  So I&#x27;ve used dr. brandt BB Matte with Signature SHINERASE, Medium to Dark on and off for a few months (mostly when my main tinted moisturizer has run out) and I have to say that this product just doesn&#x27;t cut it. First of all, my skin is naturally medium-tinted, and this product goes on a bit more dark than I would like.  If you have medium skin, DO NOT use too much of this product, since you&#x27;ll have to put this product on your whole face to even out the color.  I learned the hard way, and ended up having a face that looked oddly synthetic.  I blame the Shinerase feature.  To the product&#x27;s credit, if you have oily skin, the this product will really matte out your skin.  But using too much will make your face look completely matted and fake ... like a mannequin.  My advice is to use the product very sparsely.  Even using a small amount will pose a challenge in blending to your natural skin color, especially if you are in the medium skin range.  When you apply it with your hands and fingers, just be aware that you will have colored palms/fingers.  It can get a bit messy on your (hand) towels.  Like I said, I only use this now when I&#x27;ve run out of my main moisturizer with tint (or if I have a tiny blemish). I  do not recommend this product.  The admixture is just wrong.</li>
            <li> BB cream is not quite lotion, and not quite makeup. It lives in that area somewhere between the two. While this is excellent as a light, almost invisible barrier against the sun, it&#x27;s got a mild tint to it, so that it also evens out your skin tone. I do have brown skin, but I fall on the lighter side of brown (after living in New York city for all these years, and working in a basement, I haven&#x27;t really seen the sun in more years than I can count). For me, the shade is a hair on the light side, but does blend quite readily with my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Again, don&#x27;t expect this to give as good a coverage as your foundation. While it managed to give me a clean look overall, it didn&#x27;t do anything for the dark circles under my eyes when I got poor sleep the night before. I&#x27;d still need to use a concealer for that. And, if you tend towards sweaty or oily skin, you&#x27;re still going to want to dust your face with some kind of finishing powder. Yes, the final look after applying the BB cream is definitely matte. I notice that the shine on my face is completely gone and I have absolutely none of the oil slicks that I&#x27;d usually have on my forehead. However, for the heavier duty days, you&#x27;ll still want either a pressed powder or something along those lines for insurance.&lt;br /&gt;Shake the bottle REALLY well before you open it. When you&#x27;re paying this kind of money for a product, you want to ensure that every single drop gets used on your face, and not on the sink. When I opened the seal on the bottle, I had a few drops of clear liquid fall out before I got to the tinted cream underneath. I wish that I did give it a thorough shaking before using it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have anything darker than the lightest of brown skin tones, you&#x27;re going to look like you&#x27;re wearing some kind of kabuki mask. Also, you want to use the smallest amount possible. Remember, this is not a foundation. It&#x27;s a base lotion with only the mildest coverage. This will not give you blemish hiding. That being said, it does stay on a lot better than foundation, and when you&#x27;re wearing it, the look is so subtle that it looks like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup (AND feels like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup, so when someone kisses you on the cheek, you&#x27;re not going to have it rub off).&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using BB Cream, and I&#x27;m deeply satisfied with the overall experience.y on a lot better than foundation, and when you&#x27;re wearing it, the look is so subtle that it looks like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup (AND feels like you&#x27;re not wearing makeup, so when someone kisses you on the cheek, you&#x27;re not going to have it rub off).&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using BB Cream, and I&#x27;m deeply satisfied with the overall experience.</li>
            <li> I would describe myself as more of an Nc25-35 type of skin tone and I felt this color was a very good match. It looks dark, but it blends in very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage wise, I thought this was very good. Now, with that said, I have nice skin. I am 33 with very few wrinkles. I only ever use concealer for highlighting and if I have the odd blemish. For evening out my skin tone and giving me a nice, matte finish, I thought this was wonderful. This reminds me of my favorite Sonia Kashuk tinted moisturizer but with a much thicker, more matte appearance. I think this would be great during the winter time, while I like to use the SK one during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual price point seems a little steep, for what this is. For me, this qualifies as a nice foundation. For other people, this appears to be more of a base, or a primer. So bear that in mind before you buy. The mattifying  quality of this bb cream is what makes this so unique. To me. I can get the same effect with primers, mattifying powders, and whatnot, but I really feel as if I can smear this into my face and that&#x27;s it. In fact, any sort of additional powders would be too much. For me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup is subjective for everyone but if you have skin like mine, and have oily or combination skin, and can afford a $40 dollar price tag, you will probably love this!</li>
            <li> BB Matte with Signature SHINERASE by Dr. Brant is one of the better BB creams I&#x27;ve tried.  The product doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or slimy going on, and is easy to apply and blend.  It also washes clean off your hands - a major plus!  If you&#x27;re lucky enough to fall within the limited range of skin tones, it blends beautifully.  It does control shine quite well, even on very oily skin.  It gives a nice, matte \\&quot;no-makeup\\&quot; finish, that&#x27;s perfect for those days when you want a bit of perfecting and oil control, but don&#x27;t want to bother with heavy foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it with light moisturizer and without, and found that it worked fairly well both ways.  I have very oily skin, but I felt that it went on smoother and felt more comfortable over a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the BB Creams I&#x27;ve tried, this one comes close as favorite.  I only wish it came in  a wider range of tones, for fairer and darker complexions.</li>
            <li> Really minimizes pores on application. Can also be used as foundation. I have medium complexion, and the medium dark is a little light. I would actually love it even more if there was a slightly darker shade.</li>
            <li> Perfectly matched my skin. And stayed matte longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> dr. brandy&#x27;s BB cream is the best one I&#x27;ve tried. I first sampled it in a subscription box, and thought it was good but too light. Although I have fair skin, the fair/light BB cream was too pale. The medium to dark is perfect for my slightly tanned summer skin. It adds just a hint of coverage, and leave my face looking great. The consistency is a little oilier than other BB creams, but it dries to a matte finish. I can&#x27;t rave enough about dr. brandt BB cream!</li>
            <li> Shade Match: I received this product in the shade Medium Dark.  The shade was on the pink side, I would have preferred something a bit more neutral to warm.  The depth of color worked for my NC30 skin.  It probably would be too light for anyone darker than NC35.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coverage:  Extremely light.  I found myself loading up on concealer after applying this product.  Even then, I still was not satisfied and I topped it each time with BareMinerals Ready Foundation. I tried it with my fingers and with the Real Techniques buffing brush, but did not get great coverage.  In fact, this product offers the lightest coverage of any BB cream or Tinted Moisturizer that I&#x27;ve tried other than Urban Decay Naked Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying Power/Oil Control:  It seems to last.  However, I did not wear this product alone.  I did get some shine, but I thought it was pretty good for oil control.  To test oil control, I also tried this as a primer under foundation (Lancome Teint Idole Ultra 24H) and found that it worked ok.  It did help with oil control but my usual primer (Estee Lauder Matte) works better in terms of providing a smooth canvas for applying foundation.  The texture of this BB cream doesn&#x27;t really smooth skin in the way that a primer does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blendability:  This product seemed kind of dry to me.  I prefer BB creams with creamier textures, like the Smashbox BB cream, the Smashbox CC cream, Jouer Matte Moisture Tint, Tarte BB Tinted Primer, and Tarte BB cream (formerly Tarte Smoother Operator Tinted Moisturizer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  This is just ok to me.  I can&#x27;t see myself ever wanting a product with such light coverage.  I greatly prefer my Tarte BB cream (the tinted primer version) or Jouer Matte Moisture Tint with a touch of setting powder.  It has way better coverage, lasts all day, and does not require a ton of concealer to be wearable.  I did like this product as a base for the BareMinerals powder.  Maybe this works for people with perfect skin with no redness or hyperpigmentation, but I can&#x27;t see a use for a product with such light coverage on its own.  My skin is pretty good, but it only partially covered redness and did not cover hyperpigmentation at all.ness or hyperpigmentation, but I can&#x27;t see a use for a product with such light coverage on its own.

            <li> I have fair skin and rarely use makeup. I tried this product through the Vine program because I am looking for a natural-look makeup when I go out to special events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed very little product to get good coverage. Using the product did give me a more finished look without appearing as though I had too much makeup on. It also definitely eliminated the shiny or oily look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative against this product is that it did make my chin and jaw feel itchy. I do not normally react to makeup or other skin care products, so this surprised me. It wasn&#x27;t a horrible reaction, but it was something I noticed.</li>
            <li> I received this product in the Medium to Dark shade.  Initially, when I saw how dark the product appeared when it was squeezed from the tube I was fearful that it would be too dark for my medium skin tone.  It looks, however, much lighter on the skin once applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found this product was merely average and I have personally used similar products that were less expensive and produced results that were as good, or better, than the Dr. Brandt product.  I didn&#x27;t find that this product provided much moisture despite its claim to \\&quot;smooth and hydrate\\&quot; the skin.  In addition, although it went on smoothly and evens out skin tone a bit, I didn&#x27;t like how it settled into the fine lines in my maturing face and I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable wearing this product without foundation despite its tinted nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to control oily shine is similar to Face Perfector by Avon (for those who have used that product and are interested in the comparison).  The tinted nature of this product is also similar to the color produced by Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer Plus touch of foundation.  It looks very dark right out of the tube however when applied, it gives a much \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; appearance.  However, the less expensive Olay product (in my humble opinion) provided better tinted coverage and evened out my skin tone sufficiently enough that I felt more comfortable skipping foundation (something I didn&#x27;t feel comfortable doing with the Dr. Brandt product).</li>
            <li> I love the product and know that they are not making it anymore. But they should have said that the product was expired .</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and this color was too light.  It looked like I was trying to be a Kabuki dancer.</li>
