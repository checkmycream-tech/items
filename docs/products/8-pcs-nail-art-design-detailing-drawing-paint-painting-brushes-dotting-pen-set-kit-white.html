            <li>I use a seche vite top coat to &amp;#34;rehydrate&amp;#34; the acrylic paint and leave you with a shiny finish.</li>

            <li>and they look quite sturdy :3</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>all the different sices are so perfect for all things i wanted to do / try with my acrylic nails!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t get remover on the handles if you don&#x27;t want the paint to be affected.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes...</li>
            <li>For the money, I can&#x27;t imagine a nicer brush set, and I plan to buy more of them.</li>
            <li>But be creative</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the perfect size for the tiny painting.</li>
            <li>These brushes are ok they are as shown in picture.</li>
            <li>it was an ok buy</li>
            <li>would have looked more into getting better ones though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are cute but you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>am quite pleased with these brushes.</li>
            <li>So I recommend these as a gift or if you just like being creative with your nails.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend them for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>If you are using these for more than just hobbies, I would buy a better quality set.</li>
            <li>Excellent to use for manicures and French manicures.</li>
            <li>Ok brushes.</li>
            <li>I love my nail art brush set from MASH.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great selection of sizes.</li>
            <li>I have two daughters and they love having their nails done.  </li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d try to learn more and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched several youtube videos and gotten some great ideas!  </li>
            <li>Stylish</li>
            <li>Plus, stylish.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought 2 pkgs at the price,</li>
            <li>this is a great brush set - have already had alot of fun using this product for creating fun nail art!</li>
            <li>Cute brushes nice for clean up</li>
            <li>bought these brushes to use them to clean up around my cuticles when I paint my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I loved that they have a cute design and do exactly what I bought them for.</li>
            <li>They work well and clean up nicely.</li>
            <li>, they haven&#x27;t fallen apart, and they clean up nicely with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>very nice it is easy and you really do  it your self and with the differ and sizes for many designs</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>The brushes work pretty good</li>
            <li>I like this brush set because, for the price, the quality of these brushes are pretty good.</li>
            <li>If you want better brushes, you might want to pay a bit more, but for beginners as my daughter is, they worked out fine...</li>
            <li>and since I stopped biting my nails and been painting them these work great to make new designs.</li>
            <li>If you do use acrylic paint be sure to use a 100% acetone polish remover for easy removal of the paint.</li>
            <li>My wife does not do nails professionally but have great interest in doing these stuff.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, strong brush, variety of sizes!</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you see in the picture!! :)</li>
            <li>Other then that they are great!</li>
            <li>Soooo easy to handle and work with.</li>
            <li>I received this item very quickly.</li>
            <li>These work really well and clean up good.  </li>
            <li>I learned from trial and error that I prefer the dotting tool over pretty much everything else, but this set is great and diverse.</li>
            <li>I have used these and they work just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I see no reason to attempt to force the buyer to write a certain amount of feedback in order for it to be posted and even then, they demand positive feedback, well what if the items are not that great?</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, and they arrived before my orders inside the state did, very impressed, waiting for one more to come in.</li>
            <li>easy to handle.. great set to buy.. especially if your a starter in nail art.</li>
            <li>I am defiantly pleased and these are going to help me soo much!!</li>
            <li>these brushes are as nice as anything I could buy in a local beauty or art store, but the price is amazing.  </li>
            <li>we&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do a great job with bigger mistakes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend them and the price is great.</li>
            <li>Great for use of gel application, nail art design or French tip perfecting tool!</li>
            <li>perfectly fit in hand</li>
            <li>but most are useful.  </li>
            <li>would recommend a fan brush, just because it would be great, its the only brush that I don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>Cheap, so I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t complain it was free shipping.</li>
            <li>These are a great set for just starting out in nail art.</li>
            <li>They seem to clean easily.  </li>
            <li>The quality seems cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great deal and nice to gift for young girls who love doing their nails.</li>
            <li>I know my daughter will enjoy this.</li>
            <li>and they are not, glides on smooth as it would with any brush and cleaned the polish with NON ACETONE polish remover</li>
            <li>So far so good, I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>I used another brush to try to paint a perfect design on my nail but the brush was so stiff.</li>
            <li>they are very useful tools</li>
            <li>Very cheap, fell apart upon first use.</li>
            <li>luckily they came earlier within the shipping days which was great</li>
            <li>I received these brushes and was excited to try them.</li>
            <li>Still worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional by any means; think these brushes are great for the &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; if nothing else.)</li>
            <li>DO NOT USE 100% Acetone or Acetone polish remover to clean these brushes it will degrade the integrity of the bristles.</li>
            <li>I used one to clean up nail polish on the skin around the nail</li>
            <li>Overall amazing deal :)</li>
            <li>Just clean brushes with Acrylic nail brush cleaner or acetone.</li>
            <li>nail polish remover doesn&#x27;t always get the brushes clean</li>
            <li>I use them for nails, paintings, every day make up, special effect make up.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>these were a whole lot better than I thought they would be...</li>
            <li>Simple truth, if it is a good product that should be sufficient to post.</li>
            <li>Worth buying them and so cheap.</li>
            <li>i fell in love with how straight the brush part was and that,when i washed it ONCE it did not come/fall off.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they were no help whatsoever and couldn&#x27;t even respond in full sentences.</li>
            <li>Really good brushes, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Easy to work with this, are not difficult.</li>
            <li>These are super helpful for nail art.</li>
            <li>Everything worked out well and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Super for sculpting detail works and oils.</li>
            <li>these were simple and so the brush part came apart on one occasion but for the most part they work okay</li>
            <li>I love these brushes, not only are they cute but they are practical too.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them that much, but the bristles are the right stiffness and they are securely attached and cut accurately.  </li>
            <li>I  am sure i will order them again if i need new.</li>
            <li>Using for the first time tonight!</li>
            <li>The next brushes will be better, but I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;ll pay more.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, handles could be a little longer but for the price can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>Great little brush set for a novice.  </li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with the brushes, exactly what I expected and it works perfectly fine</li>
            <li>amazing to used and not to big.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;ve gotten their worth.</li>
            <li>I cleaned it up and used white nail polish to repair the damage, but it would be nice if the handles were plastic.</li>
            <li>but to my surprise they were smaller than I imagined, but for the price I liked the item</li>
            <li>well worth it.  </li>
            <li>The flat rush is great for the clear coats</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and they look exactly like they do in the picture.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>I love these handy dandy little brushes!  </li>
            <li>it took a while  for this product to be delivered but they were right on it btw what dates i would be getting the product.</li>
            <li>These brushes seem to be the right size and shape for use on the nails (as opposed to brushes for painting).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to nail art and found it fairly easy to draw with them.</li>
            <li>Designs were a little worn off in some places but that&#x27;s fine, they are still cute!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and definitely met my expectations.</li>
            <li>great deal for the money for small detail brushes....</li>
            <li>Basically they are great for small and intricate areas.</li>
            <li>loved this little set of brushes for nail art, its just the right size.</li>
            <li>She is very much into nail artistry</li>
            <li>Good quality love the black and white on it..</li>
            <li>I actually got a set with more brushes, but I feel like they are cheaper quality than the ones in the photo.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I have been looking for and can&#x27;t wait to use them.  </li>
            <li>It only successfully cleaned off the tiny mistakes.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Seem to be pretty sturdy&lt;</li>
            <li>exactly what was pictured.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but i got exactly what i had order exactly like</li>
            <li>If you are looking for better and a larger set</li>
            <li>Overall, fabulous purchase!</li>
            <li>Said they were nicer quality than most of the regular brushes that come attached to the nail polish</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>The bristles are firm, yet flexible, allowing for good control and precision.  </li>
            <li>Mine come earlier than expected which was great.</li>
            <li>The may be cheap, but these are not cheaply made and are outstanding quality.</li>
            <li>and it was shipped pretty fast</li>
            <li>Exactly what was pictured and work very well</li>
            <li>All three have worked just fine, remained as stiff as they were pre-use, and were easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t become skinny enough to make the lines fine.</li>
            <li>These brushes are pretty decent.</li>
            <li>how well they work, but they seemed very high quality.</li>
            <li>Brushes are ok, but be careful Around nail polish  remover as it removes the paint.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted the ones pictured.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Was really looking forward to this also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving 4 stars for now as I haven&#x27;t used them TOO much</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>For the price I can&#x27;t really complain about anything.</li>
            <li>For me they work really well.</li>
            <li>And I was really looking forward to doing my nails with it.</li>
            <li>These nail brushes really do the job.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li>It will not work very well.</li>
            <li>Both packs of these that I ordered were package very well.</li>
            <li>They were better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>even my friends and family wants to get haha</li>
            <li>Bristles are nice and firm, which is what i want in a nail design brush.</li>
            <li>My young daughter is using her creativity in many different inspired nail designs for her self and her friends!</li>
            <li>The brush ends are a bit stiff, which I found handy for thinner lines and using my non-dominant hand.</li>
            <li>besides that they are not very expensive</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love the brushes and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>The quality of this brushes is good, I really enjoy using them and they are wood, in the past I ordered from other company some &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I should mention I&#x27;m not a professional, just someone too cheap to pay for manicures I can do at home.</li>
            <li>i not good drawing but for me who am learning to do it is really good</li>
            <li>A couple of the brushes broke after only one use, one I was able to glue back together</li>
            <li>Decent quality brushes.</li>
            <li>guess because the brushes are stiff and the strokes aren&#x27;t easily made because of this!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them if you&#x27;re looking for nail brushes.</li>
            <li>I love these little brushes.  </li>
            <li>this is much nicer then the picture, i will be using them once a week with my 10 year old.</li>
            <li>Have Had it for about 6 months and the only useful tool is the dotter when I decorate.</li>
            <li>some of the bristles are coming off.&lt;br /&gt;Its normal because the acetone is drying.</li>
            <li>But I am not too worried I have a few more brushes in this set that I can use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plastic handles with many different shaped brushes, not too long and for the price I like them.</li>
            <li>There are several different styles of brushes in this pack and its nice to have options when you are trying to do different designs with your nails.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re way more inexpensive than the ones i buy from the strange nail wholesale supply store but the same quality.</li>
            <li>Ok, but the brushes are a little to soft.</li>
            <li>(You know, when you swipe the color across in a straight line and then use a wide curved brush to lift out the color to make the smile line).</li>
            <li>I expected a little bit better brush, but for the money these are well worth it..</li>
            <li>They are lovely small sizes for creating designs.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last forever, but seem pretty well put together.</li>
            <li>I got these for less than $2 and free shipping.</li>
            <li>loved this set and the price is totally unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, these are a great little set for a small amount of $$$!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>who doesn&#x27;t do nail professionally or just for the at home nail artist</li>
            <li>3-4 brushes look very similar, and I don&#x27;t really know what the difference is, but I&#x27;m not going to complain about having extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the amount of brushes for the price.  </li>
            <li>The price is awesome just the only issue is that the brush part is a little stiff so if you are trying to draw things on your nails you need to be careful.</li>
            <li>Although, the silver part does come loose from the stick sometimes, it&#x27;s not a big problem as can easily be glued back.  </li>
            <li>But I mean, easy fix</li>
            <li>the handles are wooden not plastic, it even came with a clear plastic pouch to keep them in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them once so far</li>
            <li>Definitely not for the professional, but if you&#x27;re experimenting with nail design, these will do.</li>
            <li>I was surprised cause they are much bigger than they look</li>
            <li>I had to wait a few weeks for their arrival, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Its a good set, but the only thing it&#x27;s missing is a round edged flat brush for doing french manicures.</li>
            <li>These seem soo much sturdier and nicer than other nail brushes I have bought.</li>
            <li>they came much quicker than expected especially considering where they&#x27;re shipped from.</li>
            <li>but I just would say that unless you have a steady hand and are careful I may look else where.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste the little money it will cost to buy these, they aren&#x27;t worth even that much.</li>
            <li>Long enough to hold as close or far as you want</li>
            <li>Just as pictured, none of them are loose and I do plan on using them all in the near future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because of super short handles, they are a little harder to maneuver in my big hands.</li>
            <li>Just a little FYI to anyone whose brushes are falling apart: NEVER soak your whole brush.</li>

            <li> I have two daughters and they love having their nails done.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d try to learn more and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched several youtube videos and gotten some great ideas!  </li>
            <li> Stylish</li>
            <li> Plus, stylish.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought 2 pkgs at the price,</li>
            <li> this is a great brush set - have already had alot of fun using this product for creating fun nail art!</li>
            <li> Cute brushes nice for clean up</li>
            <li> bought these brushes to use them to clean up around my cuticles when I paint my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I loved that they have a cute design and do exactly what I bought them for.</li>
            <li> They work well and clean up nicely.</li>
            <li> , they haven&#x27;t fallen apart, and they clean up nicely with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> very nice it is easy and you really do  it your self and with the differ and sizes for many designs</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> The brushes work pretty good</li>
            <li> I like this brush set because, for the price, the quality of these brushes are pretty good.</li>
            <li> If you want better brushes, you might want to pay a bit more, but for beginners as my daughter is, they worked out fine...</li>
            <li> and since I stopped biting my nails and been painting them these work great to make new designs.</li>
            <li> If you do use acrylic paint be sure to use a 100% acetone polish remover for easy removal of the paint.</li>
            <li> My wife does not do nails professionally but have great interest in doing these stuff.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, strong brush, variety of sizes!</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you see in the picture!! :)</li>
            <li> Other then that they are great!</li>
            <li> Soooo easy to handle and work with.</li>
            <li> I received this item very quickly.</li>
            <li> These work really well and clean up good.  </li>
            <li> I learned from trial and error that I prefer the dotting tool over pretty much everything else, but this set is great and diverse.</li>
            <li> I have used these and they work just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> I see no reason to attempt to force the buyer to write a certain amount of feedback in order for it to be posted and even then, they demand positive feedback, well what if the items are not that great?</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, and they arrived before my orders inside the state did, very impressed, waiting for one more to come in.</li>
            <li> easy to handle.. great set to buy.. especially if your a starter in nail art.</li>
            <li> I am defiantly pleased and these are going to help me soo much!!</li>
            <li> these brushes are as nice as anything I could buy in a local beauty or art store, but the price is amazing.  </li>
            <li> we&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do a great job with bigger mistakes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend them and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Great for use of gel application, nail art design or French tip perfecting tool!</li>
            <li> perfectly fit in hand</li>
            <li> but most are useful.  </li>
            <li> would recommend a fan brush, just because it would be great, its the only brush that I don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> Cheap, so I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t complain it was free shipping.</li>
            <li> These are a great set for just starting out in nail art.</li>
            <li> They seem to clean easily.  </li>
            <li> The quality seems cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great deal and nice to gift for young girls who love doing their nails.</li>
            <li> I know my daughter will enjoy this.</li>
            <li> and they are not, glides on smooth as it would with any brush and cleaned the polish with NON ACETONE polish remover</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I used another brush to try to paint a perfect design on my nail but the brush was so stiff.</li>
            <li> they are very useful tools</li>
            <li> Very cheap, fell apart upon first use.</li>
            <li> luckily they came earlier within the shipping days which was great</li>
            <li> I received these brushes and was excited to try them.</li>
            <li> Still worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional by any means; think these brushes are great for the &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; if nothing else.)</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE 100% Acetone or Acetone polish remover to clean these brushes it will degrade the integrity of the bristles.</li>
            <li> I used one to clean up nail polish on the skin around the nail</li>
            <li> Overall amazing deal :)</li>
            <li> Just clean brushes with Acrylic nail brush cleaner or acetone.</li>
            <li> nail polish remover doesn&#x27;t always get the brushes clean</li>
            <li> I use them for nails, paintings, every day make up, special effect make up.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> these were a whole lot better than I thought they would be...</li>
            <li> Simple truth, if it is a good product that should be sufficient to post.</li>
            <li> Worth buying them and so cheap.</li>
            <li> i fell in love with how straight the brush part was and that,when i washed it ONCE it did not come/fall off.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and they were no help whatsoever and couldn&#x27;t even respond in full sentences.</li>
            <li> Really good brushes, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Easy to work with this, are not difficult.</li>
            <li> These are super helpful for nail art.</li>
            <li> Everything worked out well and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Super for sculpting detail works and oils.</li>
            <li> these were simple and so the brush part came apart on one occasion but for the most part they work okay</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, not only are they cute but they are practical too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them that much, but the bristles are the right stiffness and they are securely attached and cut accurately.  </li>
            <li> I  am sure i will order them again if i need new.</li>
            <li> Using for the first time tonight!</li>
            <li> The next brushes will be better, but I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;ll pay more.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, handles could be a little longer but for the price can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> Great little brush set for a novice.  </li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the brushes, exactly what I expected and it works perfectly fine</li>
            <li> amazing to used and not to big.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;ve gotten their worth.</li>
            <li> I cleaned it up and used white nail polish to repair the damage, but it would be nice if the handles were plastic.</li>
            <li> but to my surprise they were smaller than I imagined, but for the price I liked the item</li>
            <li> well worth it.  </li>
            <li> The flat rush is great for the clear coats</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and they look exactly like they do in the picture.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I love these handy dandy little brushes!  </li>
            <li> it took a while  for this product to be delivered but they were right on it btw what dates i would be getting the product.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to be the right size and shape for use on the nails (as opposed to brushes for painting).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to nail art and found it fairly easy to draw with them.</li>
            <li> Designs were a little worn off in some places but that&#x27;s fine, they are still cute!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and definitely met my expectations.</li>
            <li> great deal for the money for small detail brushes....</li>
            <li> Basically they are great for small and intricate areas.</li>
            <li> loved this little set of brushes for nail art, its just the right size.</li>
            <li> She is very much into nail artistry</li>
            <li> Good quality love the black and white on it..</li>
            <li> I actually got a set with more brushes, but I feel like they are cheaper quality than the ones in the photo.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I have been looking for and can&#x27;t wait to use them.  </li>
            <li> It only successfully cleaned off the tiny mistakes.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Seem to be pretty sturdy&lt;</li>
            <li> exactly what was pictured.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> but i got exactly what i had order exactly like</li>
            <li> If you are looking for better and a larger set</li>
            <li> Overall, fabulous purchase!</li>
            <li> Said they were nicer quality than most of the regular brushes that come attached to the nail polish</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> The bristles are firm, yet flexible, allowing for good control and precision.  </li>
            <li> Mine come earlier than expected which was great.</li>
            <li> The may be cheap, but these are not cheaply made and are outstanding quality.</li>
            <li> and it was shipped pretty fast</li>
            <li> Exactly what was pictured and work very well</li>
            <li> All three have worked just fine, remained as stiff as they were pre-use, and were easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t become skinny enough to make the lines fine.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty decent.</li>
            <li> how well they work, but they seemed very high quality.</li>
            <li> Brushes are ok, but be careful Around nail polish  remover as it removes the paint.</li>
            <li> but I really wanted the ones pictured.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Was really looking forward to this also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars for now as I haven&#x27;t used them TOO much</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> For the price I can&#x27;t really complain about anything.</li>
            <li> For me they work really well.</li>
            <li> And I was really looking forward to doing my nails with it.</li>
            <li> These nail brushes really do the job.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> It will not work very well.</li>
            <li> Both packs of these that I ordered were package very well.</li>
            <li> They were better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> even my friends and family wants to get haha</li>
            <li> Bristles are nice and firm, which is what i want in a nail design brush.</li>
            <li> My young daughter is using her creativity in many different inspired nail designs for her self and her friends!</li>
            <li> The brush ends are a bit stiff, which I found handy for thinner lines and using my non-dominant hand.</li>
            <li> besides that they are not very expensive</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love the brushes and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> The quality of this brushes is good, I really enjoy using them and they are wood, in the past I ordered from other company some &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I should mention I&#x27;m not a professional, just someone too cheap to pay for manicures I can do at home.</li>
            <li> i not good drawing but for me who am learning to do it is really good</li>
            <li> A couple of the brushes broke after only one use, one I was able to glue back together</li>
            <li> Decent quality brushes.</li>
            <li> guess because the brushes are stiff and the strokes aren&#x27;t easily made because of this!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them if you&#x27;re looking for nail brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these little brushes.  </li>
            <li> this is much nicer then the picture, i will be using them once a week with my 10 year old.</li>
            <li> Have Had it for about 6 months and the only useful tool is the dotter when I decorate.</li>
            <li> some of the bristles are coming off.&lt;br /&gt;Its normal because the acetone is drying.</li>
            <li> But I am not too worried I have a few more brushes in this set that I can use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plastic handles with many different shaped brushes, not too long and for the price I like them.</li>
            <li> There are several different styles of brushes in this pack and its nice to have options when you are trying to do different designs with your nails.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re way more inexpensive than the ones i buy from the strange nail wholesale supply store but the same quality.</li>
            <li> Ok, but the brushes are a little to soft.</li>
            <li> (You know, when you swipe the color across in a straight line and then use a wide curved brush to lift out the color to make the smile line).</li>
            <li> I expected a little bit better brush, but for the money these are well worth it..</li>
            <li> They are lovely small sizes for creating designs.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last forever, but seem pretty well put together.</li>
            <li> I got these for less than $2 and free shipping.</li>
            <li> loved this set and the price is totally unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, these are a great little set for a small amount of $$$!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t do nail professionally or just for the at home nail artist</li>
            <li> 3-4 brushes look very similar, and I don&#x27;t really know what the difference is, but I&#x27;m not going to complain about having extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the amount of brushes for the price.  </li>
            <li> The price is awesome just the only issue is that the brush part is a little stiff so if you are trying to draw things on your nails you need to be careful.</li>
            <li> Although, the silver part does come loose from the stick sometimes, it&#x27;s not a big problem as can easily be glued back.  </li>
            <li> But I mean, easy fix</li>
            <li> the handles are wooden not plastic, it even came with a clear plastic pouch to keep them in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once so far</li>
            <li> Definitely not for the professional, but if you&#x27;re experimenting with nail design, these will do.</li>
            <li> I was surprised cause they are much bigger than they look</li>
            <li> I had to wait a few weeks for their arrival, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Its a good set, but the only thing it&#x27;s missing is a round edged flat brush for doing french manicures.</li>
            <li> These seem soo much sturdier and nicer than other nail brushes I have bought.</li>
            <li> they came much quicker than expected especially considering where they&#x27;re shipped from.</li>
            <li> but I just would say that unless you have a steady hand and are careful I may look else where.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the little money it will cost to buy these, they aren&#x27;t worth even that much.</li>
            <li> Long enough to hold as close or far as you want</li>
            <li> Just as pictured, none of them are loose and I do plan on using them all in the near future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because of super short handles, they are a little harder to maneuver in my big hands.</li>
            <li> Just a little FYI to anyone whose brushes are falling apart: NEVER soak your whole brush.</li>
            <li> The product has nice shine and a sturdy base as a whole.</li>
            <li> The brushes worked well for little designs on my nails, but the variety isn&#x27;t very diverse and it took a really long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> If amazon keeps trying to order me to do specific things at their pleasure I will simply  go back to the previous online site that I was ordering from and ditch amazon completely.</li>
            <li> Are perfecto for make designs in long and short nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always needing flat brushes.</li>
            <li> They look like mini make up brushes, and I was expecting something a little different, as far as size and stiffness of the brushes.  </li>
            <li> Came in tact with a little clear pouch carrier.</li>
            <li> Product arrived a little early.</li>
            <li> Not so much for painting delicate things, but for flowers and fill in areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much of a splurge, but I might just buy 1 brush next time that does all the things these 8 brushes can do.</li>
            <li> i think these are my faoritie there not too long</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to wait long to get this product  </li>
            <li> Each one allows for different designs and strokes; on the other hand, if you get nail polish remover on them, then the paint will come off.</li>
            <li> Let air dry on paper towel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can find a use for every single brush in the collection, but I have used two (for drawing stripes, and for cleaning my cuticles with remover, post-mani) as well as the dotting tool.</li>
            <li> , they were plain white and didn&#x27;t even have the same tips as displayed.</li>
            <li> The brushes are slightly smaller than I expected but this product works extremely well.</li>
            <li> They were very poorly made, and when I attempted to clean them with non-acetone nail polish remover, the coating on the brushes &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; and were no longer useable.</li>
            <li> A lil wood glue would help keep the brush tips from coming loose though.</li>
            <li> gotta say the design is not the one you see (white with black stripes), but doesn&#x27;t matter for me...</li>
            <li> but it looks just like the picture above, and it comes with a small little clear package.</li>
            <li> The item was a little bit tiny</li>
            <li> Overall they aren&#x27;t that bad, but I wish they were a little better.</li>
            <li> And maybe the angle brush for removing smudges around the nails but brush isn&#x27;t firm enough</li>
            <li> the package arrived longer than expected and did not impress my wife.</li>
            <li> not very well glued in</li>
            <li> The silver part came off a few brushes but I glued them back on.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> First time I used these it was horrible because I didn&#x27;t have brush cleaner available.</li>
            <li> It took a little long to get here, but I got them when it said I would.</li>
            <li> A must have for endless possibilities.</li>
            <li> If you use your imagination the possibilities are endless with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered some other nail designing stuff from other companies and they had to come from Hong Kong</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail the other day</li>
            <li> but the other one was beyond help.</li>
            <li> But other than that 5⭐ for these brushes</li>
            <li> But other than that I like than.</li>
            <li> not exactly what I ordered some of the brushes that I wanted didn&#x27;t come, but I still use them.</li>
            <li> , well made stiff brushes for both paint and nail polish, not too stiff, no loose bristles.</li>
            <li> The only thing that is not very good is the plastic covering.</li>
            <li> They are a little thicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> The design on the brushes is the same as the one pictured, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like to use an expensive, high-end brush, but these perform very well for my hobby work.  </li>
            <li> I SHOULD NOT BE ORDERED or FORCED TO POST A SPECIFIC TYPE OF FEEDBACK</li>
            <li> They are extremely helpful!</li>
            <li> going to try another review and if this place keeps telling me that my post is not good enough for them</li>
            <li> The acrylic will stick to brush and mess up brush and nails.</li>
            <li> Brushes also get frizzy and out of wack with little use,  </li>
            <li> I notice with nail polish it a little to get use to because of the polish and how it dries</li>
            <li> Lines was too thick even with hardly any nail polish on it even while using the tip only.</li>
            <li> lots of choices on line but take a few minutes to shop the vendors.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because they do shed quit a  few bristles.</li>
            <li> they are actually not as cheap as I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> Professional manicures are expensive</li>
            <li> I gave a four because they are somewhat stiff.</li>
            <li> Accidentally washed some of the white handle off, so now it&#x27;s just solid brown, which isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> so i can really say anything bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet.</li>
            <li> one or 2 brushes were too hard.i am not sure if it is a defect but it looks as if it got dipped in a glue or something.</li>
            <li> I usually brush off reviews like this, where the person doesn&#x27;t receive the product.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have had is that the handles are painted wood and my nail polish remover damaged the paint when I carelessly let it touch it.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive, but it&#x27;s the moral of it.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure</li>
            <li> Not sure I can say it</li>
            <li> Brush ends can get very stiff over time even with cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to work with.</li>
            <li> you may need brush cleaner to prevent brushes from getting hard.</li>
            <li> Not good for acrylic painting on nails.</li>
            <li> It is streaky and thin when using the brushes</li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble drawing on my nails because every swipe i would take off the base nail polish.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try them out because my acrylic paint (from another vendor) has not arrived yet.</li>
            <li> but sadly, the zebra printed is all gone :|</li>
            <li> not to bad though.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy, never even got this product.</li>
            <li> but if you already have done your base coat and a coat of colored polish using a acrylic paint wouldn&#x27;t damage your nails which is what I have done.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed because when they arrived, they weren&#x27;t what was in the picture</li>
            <li> The glue holding the metal in place for the brushes, is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE these. I use them for nails, paintings, every day make up, special effect make up. Etc. They&#x27;re starting to chip but they we&#x27;re cheap so they&#x27;ve gotten their worth.</li>
            <li> Brushes are ok, but be careful Around nail polish  remover as it removes the paint.</li>
            <li> I love these little brushes.  I don&#x27;t use them for my nails, instead I use them to apply my liquid eye liner.  These brushes are amazing for precision.</li>
            <li> The set of brushes I received are not the ones in the photograph. I actually got a set with more brushes, but I feel like they are cheaper quality than the ones in the photo. I&#x27;ve only used them once so far and they seem okay, but I really wanted the ones pictured. Beware. You may not get what you want.</li>
            <li> Cute brushes nice for clean up</li>
            <li> These brushes are WONDERFUL for nail art. I wish the set came with a striping brush also. it works great for nail polish and acrylic paint.</li>
            <li> great price and quality</li>
            <li> 5/10 you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> First time I used these it was horrible because I didn&#x27;t have brush cleaner available. They are a little thicker than I expected. Not that great for details. Overall they aren&#x27;t that bad, but I wish they were a little better. Shipping was good (thats why it gets 4 stars) they arrived in the estimated arrival  time.</li>
            <li> Love using this tools to do my nails. Its some really good brushes and i use them all the time</li>
            <li> Great Product, Awesome Price and Fast Shipping! Love the variety of brush shapes and sizes. A must have for endless possibilities. Wish you could see pics of the wonderful nail art my daughter has created. Shipment received before estimated shipping dates.</li>
            <li> These are super helpful for nail art. Not so much for painting delicate things, but for flowers and fill in areas.</li>
            <li> loved this little set of brushes for nail art, its just the right size.</li>
            <li> I thought they were metal handles but it&#x27;s wood</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I have been looking for and can&#x27;t wait to use them.  The may be cheap, but these are not cheaply made and are outstanding quality. I love this set.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. The price is awesome just the only issue is that the brush part is a little stiff so if you are trying to draw things on your nails you need to be careful. I had a lot of trouble drawing on my nails because every swipe i would take off the base nail polish. The doting tool works well though. Overall yes I would buy it again but I just would say that unless you have a steady hand and are careful I may look else where.</li>
            <li> Good brushes love the size would recommend !!!</li>
            <li> Great Brushes! they arrive at a good time. The quality is good as well and they are easy to use.I would recommend this product, especially if they help to use draw or make design nail art.</li>
            <li> Came in tact with a little clear pouch carrier. Have Had it for about 6 months and the only useful tool is the dotter when I decorate. And maybe the angle brush for removing smudges around the nails but brush isn&#x27;t firm enough so I have to do it almost a dozen times for results. Brushes also get frizzy and out of wack with little use,  But I like my dotter</li>
            <li> I ordered these on the seventh and it was said to come on the 3rd of the NEXT month and they actually came a week later. I was very pleased with how quickly they came and the brushes work very nicely</li>
            <li> I received the items in the picture. An 8 piece brush set with the zebra print.&lt;br /&gt;I received them way before estimated time.&lt;br /&gt;The price of these were cheap!&lt;br /&gt;I bought these brushes to use them to clean up around my cuticles when I paint my own nails.&lt;br /&gt;They work great.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using one the most and since i dip the brush in acetone some of the bristles are coming off.&lt;br /&gt;Its normal because the acetone is drying. But I am not too worried I have a few more brushes in this set that I can use.&lt;br /&gt;Overall i would buy these again. I loved that they have a cute design and do exactly what I bought them for.</li>
            <li> These came as advertised. The design on the brushes is the same as the one pictured, at least for me. The only draw back I think its the cleaning process. DO NOT USE 100% Acetone or Acetone polish remover to clean these brushes it will degrade the integrity of the bristles. I got these to do nail art designs and I&#x27;ve found that using any nail polish doesn&#x27;t work. It is streaky and thin when using the brushes but if you already have done your base coat and a coat of colored polish using a acrylic paint wouldn&#x27;t damage your nails which is what I have done. I use a seche vite top coat to &amp;#34;rehydrate&amp;#34; the acrylic paint and leave you with a shiny finish. If you do use acrylic paint be sure to use a 100% acetone polish remover for easy removal of the paint.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Perfect for those who just started doing their own nails! Mine come earlier than expected which was great. You get exactly what you see in the picture!! :)</li>
            <li> I received these brushes and was excited to try them. I used one to clean up nail polish on the skin around the nail but it didn&#x27;t do a great job with bigger mistakes. It only successfully cleaned off the tiny mistakes. I used another brush to try to paint a perfect design on my nail but the brush was so stiff. I thought it would soften when i used it with the nail polish but it was unsuccessful. Maybe it was nail polish. I&#x27;m not sure yet. I&#x27;ll try it again on the next manicure but for now, it&#x27;s just whatevers.</li>
            <li> these were a whole lot better than I thought they would be...I love them.I Will do business again..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks, Jeannie</li>
            <li> I love zebra print and since I stopped biting my nails and been painting them these work great to make new designs.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap for a reason. Accidentally washed some of the white handle off, so now it&#x27;s just solid brown, which isn&#x27;t too bad. And the silver part pulls off, but you can pop it back on.</li>
            <li> great product. would buy this again in a heartbeat. looking forward to many great things with this wonderful product. a must have.</li>
            <li> The brushes worked well for little designs on my nails, but the variety isn&#x27;t very diverse and it took a really long time to arrive. It&#x27;s not much of a splurge, but I might just buy 1 brush next time that does all the things these 8 brushes can do.</li>
            <li> My wife does not do nails professionally but have great interest in doing these stuff. so bought this set  of brushes as a gift. the package arrived longer than expected and did not impress my wife. one or 2 brushes were too hard.i am not sure if it is a defect but it looks as if it got dipped in a glue or something.</li>
            <li> these brushes are very nice. love the design. came as shown in the picture. nicely packaged in an envelope almost like a cd envelope but nicer. they are nice to have for doing nail art and can dip them in any nail polishes for that wonderful nail art. love having these brushes. would definitely recommend them and the price is great. only thing is if you need them for a gift or want them soon i would order them as soon as possible because i thought they would be in a week but it said the shipment would be 17-28 days. luckily they came earlier within the shipping days which was great and i am happy with this product. makes it easy to do my nail art!</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the brushes, exactly what I expected and it works perfectly fine they are very useful tools</li>
            <li> very nice it is easy and you really do  it your self and with the differ and sizes for many designs</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone .. are of very good quality and very beautiful .. besides that they are not very expensive</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! Great for use of gel application, nail art design or French tip perfecting tool! Would recommend to all!</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and easy to hold on to. Also the quality is good The brushes are a nice size and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bought this to do zebra print designs. Didn&#x27;t become skinny enough to make the lines fine. Lines was too thick even with hardly any nail polish on it even while using the tip only.</li>
            <li> I did like the brushes, are so nice design, and Wood! Are perfecto for make designs in long and short nails.</li>
            <li> These are very good and they work for more than nail art. I use them when I do canvas panels to highlight and define letters.</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes and its exactly as it was described, cant wait to see what i can do with these brushes !</li>
            <li> These are perfect for what I need them for.  The price was great and they work wonderfully!  Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Awesome set of starter brushes. Would buy them for my sisters and daughter. If you use your imagination the possibilities are endless with these brushes. I love the mini dotter that it comes with.</li>
            <li> Arrived with all brushes intact. They are lovely small sizes for creating designs.</li>
            <li> because the nail art detailing brushes gave me more ability to make awesome designs like flowers and ladybugs as well as stars.</li>
            <li> I paint on canvas with these....great deal for the money for small detail brushes....love them AND love the price I paid....lots of choices on line but take a few minutes to shop the vendors.  You never have to make it to the retail places for the sales anymore...they are always on sale in Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> If I could choose zero I would. I DID NOT RECIEVE MINE!!! I would not and will not buy from this seller again. Can&#x27;t believe i didn&#x27;t receive it!! Waste of time and money. SMH. I ordered some other nail designing stuff from other companies and they had to come from Hong Kong and I still got them. Very disappointing. Was really looking forward to this also.</li>
            <li> I usually brush off reviews like this, where the person doesn&#x27;t receive the product.  Because it would never happen to ME.  Well four months later... and i still don&#x27;t have the brushes.  What a rip off.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter.  She is very much into nail artistry and she loves this set!!</li>
            <li> Love the brushes,  but I don&#x27;t use them for my nails,  I use them for makeup. Plus they match the decor of my room...... Zebra!!!</li>
            <li> these serve there purpose well may not be the best nail brushes I&#x27;ve ever had but hey you get what you pay for and work well for someone who doesn&#x27;t do nail professionally or just for the at home nail artist</li>
            <li> The brushes were in good condition when I got them. I haven&#x27;t had the chance to use all of them but the one that I did use gave me the desired result. Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive starter set. I learned from trial and error that I prefer the dotting tool over pretty much everything else, but this set is great and diverse.</li>
            <li> Good quality love the black and white on it..tips are good quality as well good for fine detail great price</li>
            <li> They got to my house on time. Even before the date they said they would be there. I&#x27;m giving 4 stars for now as I haven&#x27;t used them TOO much but I like them and they look quite sturdy :3</li>
            <li> amazing to used and not to big. perfectly fit in hand and it was shipped pretty fast and I just love it.</li>
            <li> all the different sices are so perfect for all things i wanted to do / try with my acrylic nails! i ordert them in my starter pack and i am glad i did! I  am sure i will order them again if i need new.</li>
            <li> These seem soo much sturdier and nicer than other nail brushes I have bought. While these were also affordable, they did not totally fall apart like a different brand i tried. Just make sure you don&#x27;t get remover on the handles if you don&#x27;t want the paint to be affected.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail the other day and I gotta say im somewhat impress. The reason why I say somewhat is because I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it looks just like the picture above, and it comes with a small little clear package. I cant wait to use them.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as pictured. Designs were a little worn off in some places but that&#x27;s fine, they are still cute! Bristles are nice and firm, which is what i want in a nail design brush. Using for the first time tonight!</li>
            <li> These brushes are good, and the price is excellent. The only thing that is not very good is the plastic covering. Also are beautiful.  I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Plastic handles with many different shaped brushes, not too long and for the price I like them.</li>
            <li> bristles falls off of brush after several uses...not recommended</li>
            <li> Very cheap, fell apart upon first use. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> these brushes are as nice as anything I could buy in a local beauty or art store, but the price is amazing.  I had to wait a few weeks for their arrival, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> How do you rate something that never showed up, as I was wondering through my orders I cam across these and realized they never appeared at my home.</li>
            <li> A couple of the brushes broke after only one use, one I was able to glue back together but the other one was beyond help. Definitely not for the professional, but if you&#x27;re experimenting with nail design, these will do.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, handles could be a little longer but for the price can&#x27;t complain.  Good quality bristles and cute design.  I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because of super short handles, they are a little harder to maneuver in my big hands.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes...work well..</li>
            <li> Good! I was uncertain about buying them, but I&#x27;m glad did! You get what u see and for a good price. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no artist, but like to detail my R/C and plastic models, and these are working out great.  I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like to use an expensive, high-end brush, but these perform very well for my hobby work.  The bristles are firm, yet flexible, allowing for good control and precision.  I also like the shorter, stout handles.  For the money, I can&#x27;t imagine a nicer brush set, and I plan to buy more of them.</li>
            <li> You get what u pay for i guess because the brushes are stiff and the strokes aren&#x27;t easily made because of this!</li>
            <li> My only &#x27;druther with this set is that they have 2 differently sized dotting tools, instead of just one. I don&#x27;t think I can find a use for every single brush in the collection, but I have used two (for drawing stripes, and for cleaning my cuticles with remover, post-mani) as well as the dotting tool. All three have worked just fine, remained as stiff as they were pre-use, and were easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> this is a great brush set - have already had alot of fun using this product for creating fun nail art!</li>
            <li> Love these for my nails! They work awesome.</li>
            <li> Product arrived a little early. Not in great shape. The handle is wood not plastick so paint will chip off. not very well glued in so brush tip does fall but is good for some nail designs</li>
            <li> Beautiful ! Neat! Soooo easy to handle and work with. I took one of them for my eyeliner brush but the rest or for nail. Love the dotter so handy. Awesome for curves lines. But be creative I notice with nail polish it a little to get use to because of the polish and how it dries but if you use acrylic paint to do your nails these brushes are a MUST! Glides on handles perfect!</li>
            <li> i think these are my faoritie there not too long and i love the zebra print on them!!! 8 piece set is gret for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I bought these for detail watercolor painting, amazing results, well made stiff brushes for both paint and nail polish, not too stiff, no loose bristles. they came much quicker than expected especially considering where they&#x27;re shipped from. they come in a plastic film package bag and they even have the rubber tube tops on them to protect the brushes. They&#x27;re the perfect size for the tiny painting. Overall amazing deal :)</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this and loves it. If she is happy I am happy, so thanks. Everything worked out well and quick shipping. Thanks again. I don&#x27;t use this, my wife does, so she could answer any questions one might have about it.</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the brushes.  I haven&#x27;t used them that much, but the bristles are the right stiffness and they are securely attached and cut accurately.  The only problem I have had is that the handles are painted wood and my nail polish remover damaged the paint when I carelessly let it touch it.  I didn&#x27;t think about the paint.  I cleaned it up and used white nail polish to repair the damage, but it would be nice if the handles were plastic.</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok they are as shown in picture. They are made of cheep material. The brushes work pretty good some of the bristles fall of. it was an ok buy would have looked more into getting better ones though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Shipping takes FOREVER!</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of brushes. For the price I can&#x27;t really complain about anything. I&#x27;m new to nail art and found it fairly easy to draw with them. The brush ends are a bit stiff, which I found handy for thinner lines and using my non-dominant hand. 3-4 brushes look very similar, and I don&#x27;t really know what the difference is, but I&#x27;m not going to complain about having extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;1. Seem to be pretty sturdy&lt;br /&gt;2. Long enough to hold as close or far as you want&lt;br /&gt;3. Each brush comes with a tiny plastic cap, so I don&#x27;t have to bother about getting nail polish everywhere if I missed a spot after cleaning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;1. Brush ends can get very stiff over time even with cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;2. Nail polish remover removes the paint off the handles, so needs extra care!</li>
            <li> They dont work all that great but they are good for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> Basically took my money. That&#x27;s it. No product no response no nothing. It wasn&#x27;t expensive, but it&#x27;s the moral of it.</li>
            <li> These are cute but you get what you paid for. The silver part came off a few brushes but I glued them back on. It arrived  7days after purchased.</li>
            <li> Great product I love it comes exactly how it looks in the picture great quality brushes for nailart I love mine!</li>
            <li> There are several different styles of brushes in this pack and its nice to have options when you are trying to do different designs with your nails.</li>
            <li> Perfect wee brushes for nails. They do the trick, the quality is good and the shipping, from China, is actually quite fast.&lt;br /&gt;I am quite pleased with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for a great product.  I was surprised at the amount of brushes for the price.  Some of them I don&#x27;t have a use for and don&#x27;t know what to use them for but most are useful.  They didn&#x27;t fall apart when I cleaned them with nail polish remover and a cotton ball.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> I like this brush set because, for the price, the quality of these brushes are pretty good. Each one allows for different designs and strokes; on the other hand, if you get nail polish remover on them, then the paint will come off. So I recommend these as a gift or if you just like being creative with your nails.</li>
            <li> I have used these and they work just fine for me.  Great buy and I would recommend them for sure.  I may add that it did take a good bit of time to arrive, but I was in no rush.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes has everything that I need to do my pedicures, manicures etc. Basically they are great for small and intricate areas.</li>
            <li> going to try another review and if this place keeps telling me that my post is not good enough for them then i will just find another place to do online business with. I see no reason to attempt to force the buyer to write a certain amount of feedback in order for it to be posted and even then, they demand positive feedback, well what if the items are not that great? this is my issue. I SHOULD NOT BE ORDERED or FORCED TO POST A SPECIFIC TYPE OF FEEDBACK IF I DO NOT FEEL LIKE IT. Simple truth, if it is a good product that should be sufficient to post. If amazon keeps trying to order me to do specific things at their pleasure I will simply  go back to the previous online site that I was ordering from and ditch amazon completely. Thank you</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty decent. They work well and clean up nicely. Perfect for those home manicures. All sizes are covered.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve made great nail designs!! My young daughter is using her creativity in many different inspired nail designs for her self and her friends!</li>
            <li> exactly what was pictured. the handles are wooden not plastic, it even came with a clear plastic pouch to keep them in</li>
            <li> Very nice set for the price. I am just starting to learn how to do nail art so this is a good kit to start with.</li>
            <li> The glue holding the metal in place for the brushes, is horrible.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Worth buying them and so cheap.</li>
            <li> would recommend a fan brush, just because it would be great, its the only brush that I don&#x27;t have. Other then that they are great!</li>
            <li> Cheap, so I can&#x27;t complain.  They look like mini make up brushes, and I was expecting something a little different, as far as size and stiffness of the brushes.  Still worth it!</li>
            <li> These are nice. the zebra print was a big hit with me teenage daugther. She loves doing nail&#x27;s and not they look good too.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for the price. I gave it four stars because they do shed quit a  few bristles. If you are using these for more than just hobbies, I would buy a better quality set. They worked great for my spa day with some friends!!!</li>
            <li> Not good for acrylic painting on nails.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give this a 5 only because I haven&#x27;t used it yet. They arrived quickly and they look exactly like they do in the picture. I can&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> The brushes are perfect size for easy handling!!! Still waiting to buy some acrylic paint to work with these!! I dont want to ruin them with nail polish.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with this, are not difficult. Ideal for beginners. I am thrilled to be working fine with them. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I gave a four because they are somewhat stiff. not to bad though. Kinda hard to work with. But a great price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price. We use it for cake decorating. They don&#x27;t fray and the hair doesn&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> I do love these brushes! For me they work really well.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy, never even got this product. And I was really looking forward to doing my nails with it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Perfect! Very easy to use and definitely met my expectations. Will definitely do business again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> easy to handle.. great set to buy.. especially if your a starter in nail art.</li>
            <li> I am defiantly pleased and these are going to help me soo much!! I have recommended these to all of my friends at school!!!</li>
            <li> Great little brush set for a novice.  My daughter loves them.  Although, the silver part does come loose from the stick sometimes, it&#x27;s not a big problem as can easily be glued back.  Otherwise, these are a great little set for a small amount of $$$!</li>
            <li> I expected a little bit better brush, but for the money these are well worth it.. If you want better brushes, you might want to pay a bit more, but for beginners as my daughter is, they worked out fine... The next brushes will be better, but I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;ll pay more.</li>
            <li> it took a while  for this product to be delivered but they were right on it btw what dates i would be getting the product. i can&#x27;t complain it was free shipping. i have not use them yet but i got exactly what i had order exactly like the pictures shows is what you would be getting. I am happy with my order. i would like to summit a picture i just don&#x27;t know how.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure how well they work, but they seemed very high quality. I would have purchased another pack for myself if I didn&#x27;t already have a set of brushed. The print on them is so cute!</li>
            <li> They broke as soon as I opened them</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes specifically because they were cute and had great reviews.  I was very disappointed because when they arrived, they weren&#x27;t what was in the picture, they were plain white and didn&#x27;t even have the same tips as displayed.</li>
            <li> Deec. These nail brushes really do the job. They&#x27;re way more inexpensive than the ones i buy from the strange nail wholesale supply store but the same quality. Lovers of nail art, rejoice.</li>
            <li> Excellent to use for manicures and French manicures.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is amazing when i got it i questioned the size of it but once i started to use it to design my nails i fell in love with how straight the brush part was and that,when i washed it ONCE it did not come/fall off.</li>
            <li> The brushes I received were not as pictured.  They were very poorly made, and when I attempted to clean them with non-acetone nail polish remover, the coating on the brushes &amp;#34;melted&amp;#34; and were no longer useable.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite nail brushes! They work so well and I highly recommend them to everyone! Thank a lot!</li>
            <li> These brushes work wonderfully for what I needed. Everything you need for nail art is in this pack. Plus, they&#x27;re adorable!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they&#x27;re just what I needed !!! N they are actually not as cheap as I thought they&#x27;d be. A lil wood glue would help keep the brush tips from coming loose though. But other than that 5⭐ for these brushes</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for doing nail art and painting on nails. You can also use them for nail gel. Do not use them for applying nail acrylic powder. The acrylic will stick to brush and mess up brush and nails. It will not work very well. Just clean brushes with Acrylic nail brush cleaner or acetone. Rinse with soap and water. Let air dry on paper towel.</li>
            <li> I did not get any of these brushes,and I did not know why...so can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s good or not..anyways their look nice thoe...</li>
            <li> These brushes seem to be the right size and shape for use on the nails (as opposed to brushes for painting). Its a good set, but the only thing it&#x27;s missing is a round edged flat brush for doing french manicures. (You know, when you swipe the color across in a straight line and then use a wide curved brush to lift out the color to make the smile line). Decent quality brushes. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, and they arrived before my orders inside the state did, very impressed, waiting for one more to come in. If you do your own nails, I would recommend this for you</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast! I received this item very quickly. Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try them out because my acrylic paint (from another vendor) has not arrived yet. I did receive the item as pictured and so based on looks and shipping I would recommend this product. I will do an update review when I actually get to try them out.</li>
            <li> The brushes are slightly smaller than I expected but this product works extremely well. Both packs of these that I ordered were package very well. Very good product! Will re-buy</li>
            <li> looks good haven&#x27;t used yet</li>
            <li> Ok brushes. You get what you pay for. These are a great set for just starting out in nail art. If you are looking for better and a larger set I recommend another brand. Not sure I can say it but here goes I love my nail art brush set from MASH.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone who is in to nail art. Shows exactly what is pictured, takes no time to ship, and is a great price. Overall, fabulous purchase!</li>
            <li> Said they were nicer quality than most of the regular brushes that come attached to the nail polish caps.&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll last forever, but seem pretty well put together. Best price for this sort of thing on Amazon when I checked, so this is what I ordered. I should mention I&#x27;m not a professional, just someone too cheap to pay for manicures I can do at home.</li>
            <li> I received the items in perfect condition!! great package and great quality. gotta say the design is not the one you see (white with black stripes), but doesn&#x27;t matter for me... great product! :)</li>
            <li> i not good drawing but for me who am learning to do it is really good also i buy it cheaper so i can really say anything bad.</li>
            <li> and everyone I gave one set to loved it, I ran out and had to order more!!! loved this set and the price is totally unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great selection of sizes. Good quality and easy on the pocketbook. Great for nails or light painting. Super for sculpting detail works and oils.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, strong brush, variety of sizes! LOVE-LOVE-LOVE I want to buy another set just to have on hand. Great price, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was pictured and work very well shellac&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have two daughters and they love having their nails done.  Professional manicures are expensive so I thought I&#x27;d try to learn more and do my daughters&#x27; nails myself.  I&#x27;ve watched several youtube videos and gotten some great ideas!  The brushes are great and allow the great designs I’ve seen in the videos to take form.  So far so good, I have no complaints.  (I’ve used a nail art brush before so I have nothing to compare it too, but I think the brushes work well, they haven&#x27;t fallen apart, and they clean up nicely with nail polish remover.  I&#x27;m not a professional by any means; think these brushes are great for the &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; if nothing else.)</li>
            <li> Just got the package today. (2/20/2014) They were better than I expected. The product has nice shine and a sturdy base as a whole. No doubht, five stars.</li>
            <li> Brushes are very, very nice.  The bristles stay together and enable one to brush very fine lines.  They seem to clean easily.  Have only had them for a short time so can not comment on their durability.  For the price would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I like these they work very good for the gel nails I do. The flat rush is great for the clear coats I&#x27;m always needing flat brushes.</li>
            <li> Just a little FYI to anyone whose brushes are falling apart: NEVER soak your whole brush. Whether your using water or acetone, it will loosen the glue therefore making the metal tip come off.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected. Ok, but the brushes are a little to soft. But other than that I like than. Stylish</li>
            <li> I love these handy dandy little brushes!  They&#x27;re well made and sturdy.  Plus, stylish.  ;)  I highly recommend them if you&#x27;re looking for nail brushes.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is great for designing your nails!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to write a review of the product but seeing as it&#x27;s been three months since I ordered it and I still don&#x27;t have it I guess I can&#x27;t actually do that. I contacted the seller and they were no help whatsoever and couldn&#x27;t even respond in full sentences. It&#x27;s not the end of the world, the brushes were only a couple bucks, but it is an annoyance. Don&#x27;t waste the little money it will cost to buy these, they aren&#x27;t worth even that much.</li>
            <li> These brushes work well. They don&#x27;t fall apart like some do. All different sizes.  I would recommend these to a friend.</li>
            <li> I got these for less than $2 and free shipping. The quality seems cheap, but you get what you pay for. Overall, it&#x27;s a great deal and nice to gift for young girls who love doing their nails.</li>
            <li> The quality of this brushes is good, I really enjoy using them and they are wood, in the past I ordered from other company some &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; brushes but they were plastic so i decided to order this ones and i really liked them</li>
            <li> These are great brushes!  Good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving these brushes 4 stars because these brushes do it&#x27;s job but once nail polish remover touches the white part of the brush, the colors start to come off and get all over my hands. But I mean, easy fix, I put tape around them. Other than that, I love the brushes and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> these were simple and so the brush part came apart on one occasion but for the most part they work okay</li>
            <li> The item was a little bit tiny I thought it would be longer in length but to my surprise they were smaller than I imagined, but for the price I liked the item</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to wait long to get this product  I was surprised cause they are much bigger than they look I know my daughter will enjoy this. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes!!! I used them for lip applications only (lipstisck, liptarts etc.,) so if you are looking for very precise product this is it</li>
            <li> Really good brushes, especially for the price! It took a little long to get here, but I got them when it said I would.</li>
            <li> Work great for the nail art detailing I need sometimes</li>
            <li> Totally gorgeous! Just as pictured, none of them are loose and I do plan on using them all in the near future. Absolutely great pricing and fast shipping and great packaging. Quality is there, the brushes haven&#x27;t shed on me, I swatched some polishes to see if they were streaky and they are not, glides on smooth as it would with any brush and cleaned the polish with NON ACETONE polish remover so I could preserve the bristles, I suggest the same (:</li>
            <li> Just awesome, exactly what i needed. Looks just like the picture</li>
            <li> this is much nicer then the picture, i will be using them once a week with my 10 year old. thank you!</li>
            <li> they appear to be well made  and will work wonderful for doing nails. I was very happy with the fast delivery</li>
            <li> These work really well and clean up good.  Glad I bought 2 pkgs at the price, well worth it.  I do recomennd these.</li>
            <li> Nice variety of brushes.  Great value!</li>
            <li> Item just as described, good brushes. you may need brush cleaner to prevent brushes from getting hard. nail polish remover doesn&#x27;t always get the brushes clean</li>
            <li> Not what I  was looking for.</li>
            <li> not exactly what I ordered some of the brushes that I wanted didn&#x27;t come, but I still use them. They are great</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I paid for... They were so different not what I saw in the picture.. I am going to return it</li>
            <li> thats all i can say! even my friends and family wants to get haha but sadly, the zebra printed is all gone :|</li>
            <li> Very cheap but I made them work</li>
            <li> Cute brushes work nicely</li>
            <li> They are extremely helpful! I do my nail art on every design and I constantly use these, especially the angled brush for cleanups around the cuticles and when I get mistakes on my hands or finger tips. I love them!</li>
            <li> took like 1 month shipped from china,for the quality you know you can imagine cause its made in china.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, not only are they cute but they are practical too. They work well for doing nail art. I am just a beginner and I don&#x27;t have any complaints. They even arrived earlier than I anticipated.</li>
