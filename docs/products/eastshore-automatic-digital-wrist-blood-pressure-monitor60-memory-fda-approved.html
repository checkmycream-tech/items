            <li>Beautiful it was.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with it!</li>
            <li>so it was a great buy.</li>
            <li>SELLER WAS GREAT AND SENT ITEM AT LIGHTNING SPEED.</li>
            <li>THANK-YOU FOR A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>Works great for the price.</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>I wanted to ensure that I am recommending a good product that I have used for a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this during nursing school and have always had good results with it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this wrist BP meter!  </li>
            <li>For the price I can honestly say I cannot recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to read.</li>
            <li>Had to return, if they could get the calibration right, it would be a great value and purchase.</li>
            <li>sure makes it easy!  </li>
            <li>I had a manual BP before that was very accurate.</li>
            <li>i FOUND THIS PRODUCT TO BE VERY ACCURATE.</li>
            <li>It is also very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>EXCEPT it can&#x27;t give an accurate reading to save your life!</li>
            <li>We love our purchase and if even has a storage case.</li>
            <li>I hope that if you do purchase this product that you are more satisfied then I am.</li>
            <li>Handy wrist model with accurate read out.</li>
            <li>Product arrived ok.  </li>
            <li>Better take a walk</li>
            <li>ITS OK.</li>
            <li>TOO MANY READING</li>
            <li>I have an Omron 7 wrist monitor that is awesome, and should have just purchased a second for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price it is okay</li>
            <li>works ok, but does not get accurate reading, but it did what i needed it to do, if you want better reading, spend the money if you can</li>
            <li>Even without repositioning the monitor, re-taking another reading is much more accurate.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use unlike those arm band stethescope tyes.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>, so bought it and it was so easy to use and worked just as described.</li>
            <li>the batty compartment door opens too easy for its placement..</li>
            <li>I was amazed that I could get a good product for a decent price.</li>
            <li>Functionally it operates fine and is easy to use, but an inch or two variation in height of your arm</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and to read, while providing accurate readings.</li>
            <li>This monitor is accurate, extremely easy to use, includes pulse and settings and memory for 2 people.</li>
            <li>cheapest on i could fine</li>
            <li>The pump worked fine</li>
            <li>nice , fast and cheap</li>
            <li>My readings from the wrist meter are accurate.</li>
            <li>I took my pressure just before going to the Doctor, and it is accurate.  </li>
            <li>No work accurate...</li>
            <li>Works well and seems accurate</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it is cheap, but you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>If it worked it would have been very useful, as it is it&#x27;s just gathering dust.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy, plus it has a memory feature so both mt husband</li>
            <li>Lacks user friendly instructions in handbook, you have to search for battery compartment, once you figure out there are no battereies included.</li>
            <li>Works quickly and has always been accurate to readings obtained by a manual Bp cuff.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say is that it has an automatic shutoff so that it will turn off after 20 seconds.    </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>The product is very inconsistent with it&#x27;s readings, and for some one getting one of these for home use, they are probably dependent on an accurate reading.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even seem worth the effort of returning it.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t always allow you to retest and isn&#x27;t ever consistent.</li>
            <li>After years of having blood pressure of around 120/80 I purchased this and it consistently said I had a BP of 159/95ish.</li>
            <li>It was 25 points higher than the arm type.</li>
            <li>This is my first home blood pressure device and went for price and features.</li>
            <li>( you have to have the device higher than your heart. )</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does claim FDA approval, so maybe I did weight that a bit higher than I should have in my buying</li>
            <li>It is simple to put on and easy to readout</li>
            <li>Only takes 2 - AAA batteries and easy to change</li>
            <li>Doing Business was so Smooth,Excellent Product,Lightning Fast Shipping,Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>Storing a history of readings was the main point that sold me on this and the large display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried for days to see whether it was a fluke that it was so high.</li>
            <li>, I have a 6 inch circumference wrist, which is a normal size wrist.</li>
            <li>The wrist monitors are not as accurate as the other ones.  </li>
            <li>I now edd to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this new monitor over others.</li>
            <li>AFTER SHE USED THIS TO GET VITAL SIGNS, i CHECKED IT MYSELF WITH A MANUAL BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF.</li>
            <li>very convenient and simple to use.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get wildly varying results using this, probably any wrist meter.  </li>
            <li>Have been testing this for over 10 days and ready to send it back or throw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li>Wrist too high and your BP is artificially low.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I purchased the digital wrist blood pressure monitor so we could provide these vital statics to our physicians.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend this type of monitor for anyone that needs to keep an eye on their BP, especially those who may live alone or be elderly - you can&#x27;t get much easier than this, just be aware of the false readings and re-test.</li>
            <li>Always sit in the same chair with the same arm height and at least you can reasonably compare the variations day to day, but I&#x27;m not convinced the accuracy is right up there with an arm cuff.</li>
            <li>But the EastShore unit, though very inexpensive, is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This one is much less accurate and has idiosynchrancies that make it less than desirable for daily monitoring.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This one is much less accurate and has idiosynchrancies that make it less than desirable for daily monitoring.</li>
            <li> I like that this one sits flat on the medial surface of the wrist rather than the side because it stays in place, which is mcportamt when dealing with patients that are contracted or noncompliant.  </li>
            <li> The unit seems particularly sensitive to its position on the wrist (readings vary wildly if position is slightly off), so the difficulty in strapping it down is more than just inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> only two things I would improve-make pulse digits bigger and hold numbers on display a little longer prior they are changing to another system display.  </li>
            <li> Bought it long time ago and still works</li>
            <li> the bigger issue is that it is harder for me with my limitations to take it off and put it</li>
            <li> I am an EMT monitoring my own blood pressure and some of the false high readings are pretty scarey - until you realize they are false!</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it seems to work well and have had little problem with following the induced instructions.</li>
            <li> I have used another monitor that was never accurate (according to the doctor&#x27;s readings) and only showed my blood pressure - no pulse.</li>
            <li> I have not yet had a chance to compare the accuracy with another monitor, however I know that about half the time I get a false &#x27;high&#x27; reading.</li>
            <li> as you&#x27;re trying to pull the strap tight before engaging the velcro, it&#x27;s almost impossible to keep your thumb off the buttons on the machine.  </li>
            <li> Since I had been having some extreme headaches and was worried that it was the result of a possible recent increase in my BP, this was scary.</li>
            <li> I know the limitations of wrist cuff monitors having owned two of them previous to buying the EastShore.  </li>
            <li> This little machine</li>
            <li> and you get markedly different results which makes it tough to monitor your BP with any level of consistency and accuracy.   </li>
            <li> THAT IS BECOMMING HARD OF HEARING.</li>
            <li> Makes sense now that I have it, but it is hard for me to stay in that position and be still.  </li>
            <li> But, that is the least of the problems I had with this product.</li>
            <li> I have several BP monitors, this is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> Strapping a monitor on your wrist is not particularly easy with any unit, but it is quite difficult with the EastShore --</li>
            <li> Useless...  </li>
            <li> this cuff is crap.</li>
            <li> and I followed instructions, but it kept putting pressure on my wrist until it was painful!, but it never read blood pressure or pulse</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> instructions are terrible</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Doing Business was so Smooth,Excellent Product,Lightning Fast Shipping,Highly Recommend. I ordered my product online and it arrived three days later.Beautiful it was.</li>
            <li> I recently (beginning of May) bought the wrist blood pressure cuff. I would not recommend anyone else buying this as the 3rd day I had it the battery door fell off! Now it is a month later and it works like every third try. It starts but the screen doesnt record. I now edd to buy a new one. I thought I was gettng a deal. I guess I got what I paid for. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> No matter what i tried I could not get a reading. The only message I recieved is ERR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware</li>
            <li> Lacks user friendly instructions in handbook, you have to search for battery compartment, once you figure out there are no battereies included. Readings sometimes come up error and you have to attempt mutiple times to get your reading.</li>
            <li> My husband and I purchased the digital wrist blood pressure monitor so we could provide these vital statics to our physicians.  This little machine sure makes it easy!  It is simple to put on and easy to readout makes this a wonderful product for anyone who needs to keep track of blood pressure and heart rate measurements.  We love our purchase and if even has a storage case.</li>
            <li> This item did not work once I put batteries in it, it did not inflate so with that it could not measure my blood pressure, will return it for another unit.</li>
            <li> I want to let you know that if you are looking for a pressure cuff you should bypass this product.  The battery life is very short &amp; I am often needing to change the batteries.  The only good thing I can say is that it has an automatic shutoff so that it will turn off after 20 seconds.    For the price I can honestly say I cannot recommend this product.  I hope that if you do purchase this product that you are more satisfied then I am.</li>
            <li> The product is very inconsistent with it&#x27;s readings, and for some one getting one of these for home use, they are probably dependent on an accurate reading. It is also very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it seems to work well and have had little problem with following the induced instructions. cheapest on i could fine so it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> The EastShore Automatic Digital wrist blood pressure device did not work at all on me. I read the instructions and understood them perfectly and I followed instructions, but it kept putting pressure on my wrist until it was painful!, but it never read blood pressure or pulse, I have a 6 inch circumference wrist, which is a normal size wrist.</li>
            <li> Handy wrist model with accurate read out. Very easy to read. I couldn&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it was.</li>
            <li> I had a manual BP before that was very accurate. This one is much less accurate and has idiosynchrancies that make it less than desirable for daily monitoring. This one doesn&#x27;t always allow you to retest and isn&#x27;t ever consistent. I was pretty disappointed for sure.</li>
            <li> i WOULD HIGHLEY RECOMMEND THIS BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF. i AM A NURSE AND I PURCHASED ONE FOR A NURSING ASSISTANT, THAT IS BECOMMING HARD OF HEARING. AFTER SHE USED THIS TO GET VITAL SIGNS, i CHECKED IT MYSELF WITH A MANUAL BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF. i FOUND THIS PRODUCT TO BE VERY ACCURATE. IT IS MADE AFFORDABLE FOR ALMOST ANYONE. SELLER WAS GREAT AND SENT ITEM AT LIGHTNING SPEED. THANK-YOU FOR A GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I know the limitations of wrist cuff monitors having owned two of them previous to buying the EastShore.  But the EastShore unit, though very inexpensive, is not worth the money.

The unit seems particularly sensitive to its position on the wrist (readings vary wildly if position is slightly off), so the difficulty in strapping it down is more than just inconvenient.  In addition, the memory recall function on my unit does not work.    On the plus side, it is cheap, but you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> nice , fast and cheap</li>
            <li> This product has it all going on.....EXCEPT it can&#x27;t give an accurate reading to save your life! Had to return, if they could get the calibration right, it would be a great value and purchase.</li>
            <li> very convenient and simple to use. only two things I would improve-make pulse digits bigger and hold numbers on display a little longer prior they are changing to another system display.  Also price jumped in 2010 for about $ 4.00</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this wrist BP meter!  It is so easy to use unlike those arm band stethescope tyes.  My readings from the wrist meter are accurate.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to track my bp for a month... Well..that is all it lasted. Currently it inflates and will not read. So, I am going to contact the Company. It appears one definitely gets what one pays for.</li>
            <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t look at all like the one pictured. But, that is the least of the problems I had with this product. After years of having blood pressure of around 120/80 I purchased this and it consistently said I had a BP of 159/95ish. Since I had been having some extreme headaches and was worried that it was the result of a possible recent increase in my BP, this was scary. I tried for days to see whether it was a fluke that it was so high. After seeing the same numbers for over a week I made an appointment for the doctors. My blood pressure was 117/79...  this cuff is crap. If it worked it would have been very useful, as it is it&#x27;s just gathering dust. It doesn&#x27;t even seem worth the effort of returning it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived ok.  The wrist monitors are not as accurate as the other ones.  But it does give an indication whether your blood pressure is up.  It was 25 points higher than the arm type.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Strap it on your wrist, push the buttons, wait 30 seconds or so, read your BP and pulse rate.  I took my pressure just before going to the Doctor, and it is accurate.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> No work accurate... Nobody knows how to reset... Useless...  Don&#x27;t buy it.. A lot of pharmacy now have the blood pressure kiosk... Better take a walk so you can do exercise n measure your blood pressure...</li>
            <li> Needed to start watching my blood pressure at home and this seamed to be the easiest way for me., so bought it and it was so easy to use and worked just as described. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I like the ease of use with the EastShore Automatic Digital Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor. I have not yet had a chance to compare the accuracy with another monitor, however I know that about half the time I get a false &#x27;high&#x27; reading. I am an EMT monitoring my own blood pressure and some of the false high readings are pretty scarey - until you realize they are false! Even without repositioning the monitor, re-taking another reading is much more accurate. I do recommend this type of monitor for anyone that needs to keep an eye on their BP, especially those who may live alone or be elderly - you can&#x27;t get much easier than this, just be aware of the false readings and re-test.</li>
            <li> works ok, but does not get accurate reading, but it did what i needed it to do, if you want better reading, spend the money if you can</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a while now. I wanted to ensure that I am recommending a good product that I have used for a while. This product is great. I have not had any problems with it. It is easy to use and to read, while providing accurate readings. I was amazed that I could get a good product for a decent price. I recommend this to anyone that needs to track there blood pressure on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> ITS OK. I DONT KNOW HOW TO USE IT . TOO MANY READING NOT SAME EACH TIME. MAY BE IT ME.BUT CANT GET IT YET.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get wildly varying results using this, probably any wrist meter.  Wrist too low and you&#x27;re probably thinking you&#x27;re about to have a stroke.  Wrist too high and your BP is artificially low.  Functionally it operates fine and is easy to use, but an inch or two variation in height of your arm and you get markedly different results which makes it tough to monitor your BP with any level of consistency and accuracy.   Always sit in the same chair with the same arm height and at least you can reasonably compare the variations day to day, but I&#x27;m not convinced the accuracy is right up there with an arm cuff.</li>
            <li> I have several BP monitors, this is by far the worst. The readings are erratic! Have been testing this for over 10 days and ready to send it back or throw it in the garbage. I have an Omron 7 wrist monitor that is awesome, and should have just purchased a second for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this  NO !</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for with this monitor.  The pump worked fine but it did not inflate the cuff.  I replaced it with a WalMart blood pressure monitor that&#x27;s working as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this during nursing school and have always had good results with it. Works quickly and has always been accurate to readings obtained by a manual Bp cuff. I like that this one sits flat on the medial surface of the wrist rather than the side because it stays in place, which is mcportamt when dealing with patients that are contracted or noncompliant.  Works great for the price.</li>
            <li> Works well and seems accurate</li>
            <li> Bought it long time ago and still works well I get the same B/P and pulse as the Dr.s&#x27; office so it&#x27;s pretty accurate. Only takes 2 - AAA batteries and easy to change Only have had to do it 1 x since I got it in Feb of 2014. Has enough memory for 2 people separately. Very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Quick and easy, plus it has a memory feature so both mt husband and I can store our bp records.</li>
            <li> I have used another monitor that was never accurate (according to the doctor&#x27;s readings) and only showed my blood pressure - no pulse. This monitor is accurate, extremely easy to use, includes pulse and settings and memory for 2 people. I would recommend this new monitor over others.</li>
            <li> This is my first home blood pressure device and went for price and features. Storing a history of readings was the main point that sold me on this and the large display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have gotten an arm cuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I did not realize this was used wrist side up only. Makes sense now that I have it, but it is hard for me to stay in that position and be still.  ( you have to have the device higher than your heart. )..  the bigger issue is that it is harder for me with my limitations to take it off and put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the batty compartment door opens too easy for its placement.. every time I take this on or off I end up with the batteries falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are terrible as others have noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does claim FDA approval, so maybe I did weight that a bit higher than I should have in my buying criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is okay</li>
