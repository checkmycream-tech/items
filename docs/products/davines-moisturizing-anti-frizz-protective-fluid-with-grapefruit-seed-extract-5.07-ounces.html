            <li>Excellent item ...</li>
            <li>Works great!!</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>But this is a great way to start.    </li>
            <li>V. McDaniel, author of \\&quot;Win</li>
            <li>It give hair smoothness and a great healthly look.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful on my fine, processed hair.</li>
            <li>This product is the perfect fit for the Momo shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Great product for fine hair.</li>
            <li>-- you have a nice protective barrier against heat and humidity.    </li>
            <li>I have tried Aveda and liked it until I purchased this.</li>
            <li>When You Lose: A Guide to Successful Dieting,\\&quot; available as an e-book for Kindle.</li>
            <li>The product has a light, pleasant scent that does not linger.     </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I love it more!</li>
            <li>I have very fine bleached hair</li>
            <li>but this has been a favorite of mine since my stylist told me to try it over 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if it were more affordable.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love the smell,  but would buy again.</li>
            <li>mostly during the summer months.  </li>
            <li>It controls my hair much better than with just argan oil, which is what I used before.</li>
            <li>and I love almost all Davines products this one is ok</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work for me better products out there.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>I love, love,  love Davines  conditioner and was excited to try the anti frizz product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for friz control while at the same time healthy for the hair.  </li>
            <li>My fine, frizzy hair did what it always does in humidity.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge change in the frizz factor.</li>
            <li>well worth the cost.  :-)</li>
            <li>Always does the trick, smooth ends and light feel all day.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Controls fly away frizz for my naturally curly hair - and I live in FL!  </li>
            <li>I love the way it works so much that I can get by that issue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product junkie too and really wanted to love Davine&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Does not completely remove the frizz but works perfectly provided its followed by heat treatment stays so for long time!</li>
            <li>I have fine but thick, mostly straight hair but have issues with &#x27;frizz&#x27; and fly aways around the crown.  </li>
            <li>If you want minimal work with styling and a light help with controlling frizz, this does the job better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The price is much more affordable than what I was using prior and it was tougher to get.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely re-purchase!</li>
            <li>3 stars describes &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34;, which is how I would describe this product exactly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that this product doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>Not a dramatic difference</li>
            <li>With all the rave reviews on Davine&#x27;s and this product in particular, I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li>Not totally frizz free</li>
            <li>Much easier to locate and purchase.</li>
            <li>This product does absolutely nothing to prevent frizz.</li>
            <li>I have other products that work better.</li>
            <li>I only took off one star because it is pricey for the size of the bottle, and since I have long hair, I go through quite a bit rather quickly, and it&#x27;s not able to block out every ounce of moisture, but overall, this is one of the best styling products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It works great on my thick, coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li>Great product, not heavy nor sticky and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I ran into this product through browsing for a new anti-frizz protectant with added benefits.</li>
            <li>I live in TX where it is humid all the time - this is now a staple in my hair routine (and I&#x27;ve tried everything).  </li>
            <li>We live in the South and I have wavy frizzy hair in this humidity.</li>
            <li>I have not found any product that will totally eliminate frizz, especiualy in hot, humid New York weather.</li>
            <li>My hair is long, but baby fine, so I was surprised that I had to use a quarter-sized dollop of this anti-frizz fluid.</li>
            <li>because you only need about dime size for not so humid days and about a quarter size for more humid days it last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I use about a dime size amount on EACH half of my hair and work through from ends up to the top of my head, and then I brush it through and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>I live in San Francisco, so when I get caught in the morning mist or evening fog, I do see a slight bit of frizz on the top/side sections, but that is less of a complaint about the product and more of one about the SF summer weather :)</li>
            <li>I use about the size of a nickel (maybe a little more) and then put a argan oil on my ends since they tend to be dry.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down like other heat protectors do.</li>
            <li>I live in hot, humid south Florida and my highlighted hair becomes an instant mess of frizz whenever I venture outside.</li>
            <li>I have short wavy/curly dry hair,  use this in combination with a leave in conditioner and blow dry my hair straight without any frizz.  </li>

            <li> I LOVE this product and cheaper to purchase on line than at expensive hair salon!</li>
            <li> Can also use on dry hair as a styling aid.     </li>
            <li> so I only use it from my scalp to about halfway down (I have shoulder length hair).  </li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do what I expected it should do.  </li>
            <li> The only product I found that I can count on to tame my halo of gray hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have below shoulder-length curly hair that I straighten everyday and follow by flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly wavy, thick but fine/coarse at shoulder length that I straighten through a Tourmaline flat iron system at around 419 degrees because of how coarse my hair is.</li>
            <li> its a little expensive but because a little goes a long way its worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This works extremely well</li>
            <li> and you only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li> but it does make my hair a bit tacky and weighed down.</li>
            <li> It can be a little sticky, at times, though.....</li>
            <li> I usually end up pinning it up randomly for a few minutes as it dries (helps to remove the natural wave and makes it straighter) and I have noticed that since using this, my hair ends up less curly and definitely less frizzy by the time it dries.</li>
            <li> Massage it into towel dried hair and voila</li>
            <li> I did not give it 5 stars as I do not love the smell.  </li>
            <li> , not sure if that&#x27;s because I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have a TON of thick frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> The instructions aren&#x27;t complicated, just put it on after you get out of the shower when your hair is damp.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I would definitely recommend this product. I have a TON of thick frizzy hair and I have tried countless products but this has been a favorite of mine since my stylist told me to try it over 2 years ago. Can&#x27;t say I love it more!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. You only need a drop -- about the size of a quarter. Massage it into towel dried hair and voila -- you have a nice protective barrier against heat and humidity.    It is not a be all end all. I have not found any product that will totally eliminate frizz, especiualy in hot, humid New York weather. But this is a great way to start.    Can also use on dry hair as a styling aid.     The product has a light, pleasant scent that does not linger.     I would give it 5 stars if it were more affordable.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well! Leaves hair soft and less frizzy. Not totally frizz free, not sure if that&#x27;s because I have thick hair. Don&#x27;t love the smell,  but would buy again.</li>

            <li> I like this product -- it keeps my bleached hair from being too frizzy. It can be a little sticky, at times, though.....</li>
            <li> The only product I found that I can count on to tame my halo of gray hairs.  I use it every day.  I did not give it 5 stars as I do not love the smell.  Reminds me of the odor of perm solution.  I love the way it works so much that I can get by that issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this product. I tried it but my hair was still frizzy the next day. Plus, it makes my strands look clumpy.</li>
            <li> I have short wavy/curly dry hair,  use this in combination with a leave in conditioner and blow dry my hair straight without any frizz.  Great product, not heavy nor sticky and a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> I live in hot, humid south Florida and my highlighted hair becomes an instant mess of frizz whenever I venture outside. I stumbled on this Anti-Frizz product recently and had to give it a try. It is wonderful on my fine, processed hair. My hair is long, but baby fine, so I was surprised that I had to use a quarter-sized dollop of this anti-frizz fluid. But that amount did the trick. I am so relieved to find this product. Now I have to hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it any time soon. Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;Susan V.

            <li> I love this stuff.  I have fine but thick, mostly straight hair but have issues with &#x27;frizz&#x27; and fly aways around the crown.  This works extremely well and you only need a small amount.  It did tangle my ends so I only use it from my scalp to about halfway down (I have shoulder length hair).

            <li> I love this product. We live in the South and I have wavy frizzy hair in this humidity. I have tried Aveda and liked it until I purchased this. I bought if about a year ago and forgot about it until today.  Works great!!</li>
