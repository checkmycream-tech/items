            <li>It is pleasant just not quite what I would have ordered</li>
            <li>and I really,really missed using a body wash that smelled good.</li>
            <li>The products came very quickly, in good condition.</li>
            <li>Not as good as their Pine scented.</li>
            <li>Love it&#x27;s richness,skin conditioning, and it&#x27;s scent!</li>
            <li>Not to strong and feels great.</li>
            <li>Really nice fragrance, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>Nice price.  </li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>This body wash has a nice citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the Pine scented and decided to try the newer ones that they have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it was a problem with my apt building manager.</li>
            <li>Have used it for years and this new fragrance is wonderful...</li>
            <li>Great to wake up smelling this fresh.</li>
            <li>It smells very nice, and the bathroom smells fresh when I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>So, bottom line is that this soap makes me smell good, feel clean and no itch.  </li>
            <li>It is just okay.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent of this one.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>Vitabath has always been wonderful, but the new scents are terrific, nice to have some choices.  </li>
            <li>I remember Vitabath from years back but not all the great scent combinations that are available now.  </li>
            <li>Smell not as &#x27;yummy&#x27; as they make it sound, but I do like the Vitabath product line...</li>
            <li>I bought several in this line and they all smelled great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m eczema prone, so I have to use fragrance-free, sulfate free body washes and soaps</li>
            <li>lot of soaps, so this is WORTH it!</li>
            <li>had I been able to do a whiff test first.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a paraben free body wash that was sensitive enough for my psoriasis infected skin, but still smelled awesome and this one is it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve LOVED Vitabath since I was in the military, I FAVORITE will always be original&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Spring</li>
            <li>This one leaves my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>I had a tiny sample bottle and loved it and had to buy the full size.  </li>
            <li>The Pomegranate &amp; Blood Orange smell incredibly fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>and I feel clean and fresh after the shower.  </li>
            <li>A new favorite shower gel is added to my \\&quot;keep on hand always</li>
            <li>Smells good and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>But these are nice too, just wish the bottles were bigger.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I struggle with sensitive skin, so the primary reason I chose this product was because it is sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>This rinses off easily, leaves my skin feeling moisturized, not tight or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this two stars, as opposed to one star, because it&#x27;s quite possible that the issue is mine, but I believe that a product that is labeled sulfate free has a certain implication of being mild, and that&#x27;s just not this product.</li>
            <li>This is a long time favorite.</li>
            <li>I was hoping the scent would be more subtle and have a more orange scent</li>
            <li>but they are rebranding the line very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very allergic to&lt;</li>
            <li>in mind these are super concentrated, so you don&#x27;t use a whole lot &amp; this bottle will last a while.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>You can count on a refreshing shower everyday.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a new &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li>I love the scents, &amp; use this one to alternate out with the pink icing one.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>The scent lingers a little bit, too, after you&#x27;ve rinsed off, which I enjoy.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to some products; but this one did not bother me at all; so I would recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>bad these aren&#x27;t edible, they smell so good!</li>
            <li>I use this as a shave gel for my legs--it is that thick and rich.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my sensitive skin, no breakouts, or irritations.</li>
            <li>Bought for my darling wife since she was going through dry skin issues - had a couple of bath&#x27;s with this stuff &amp; it took care of her dry skin issues - highly recommended</li>

            <li> Great soap. A little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for the last 2 years. The fragrances are amazing! It&#x27;s pricey but again, a little bit goes a long way so it doesn&#x27;t run out fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff is dreamy, luscious good!

            <li> Nice price.  Lots of suds and smells wonderful! I bought several in this line and they all smelled great.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is thick and smells great, like a very expensive shower gel.  The Pomegranate &amp; Blood Orange smell incredibly fresh and clean.

            <li> I&#x27;ve LOVED Vitabath since I was in the military, I FAVORITE will always be original&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Spring Green\\&quot;. But these are nice too, just wish the bottles were bigger. But the&lt;br /&gt;good news is it&#x27;s concentrated, so a little goes a LONG way! I&#x27;m very allergic to&lt;br /&gt;a lot of soaps, so this is WORTH it!</li>
            <li> Nice.  Great lather and I feel clean and fresh after the shower.  Not all that crazy about the smell.  It is pleasant just not quite what I would have ordered had I been able to do a whiff test first.  I will be ordering again but in another scent.</li>
            <li> Lives up to the Vitabath reputation...Have used it for years and this new fragrance is wonderful...even my grandgirls want for themselves</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I struggle with sensitive skin, so the primary reason I chose this product was because it is sulfate free.  I don&#x27;t know what else is in it, but it is extremely irritating.  It smells very nice, and the bathroom smells fresh when I get out of the shower.  I&#x27;m giving this two stars, as opposed to one star, because it&#x27;s quite possible that the issue is mine, but I believe that a product that is labeled sulfate free has a certain implication of being mild, and that&#x27;s just not this product.</li>
            <li> I remember Vitabath from years back but not all the great scent combinations that are available now.  Love the scent of this one.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a paraben free body wash that was sensitive enough for my psoriasis infected skin, but still smelled awesome and this one is it!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> This body wash has a nice citrus scent.  Some soaps make me itch.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  Some non-sulfate soaps seem to not clean well and I still feel a &#x27;film&#x27; left behind.  This one leaves my skin feeling clean.  So, bottom line is that this soap makes me smell good, feel clean and no itch.  5-stars granted.  Booyah!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m eczema prone, so I have to use fragrance-free, sulfate free body washes and soaps and I really,really missed using a body wash that smelled good. I used Pacifica products. They smell great and aren&#x27;t drying, but they&#x27;re pricey. I came across Vitabath and decided to give it a try without even smelling it. I choose the Blood Orange and Orange Peel. IT&#x27;S FANTASTIC! No adverse skin reaction and it&#x27;s a scent dupe for Pacifica Tuscan Blood Orange. It lathers great, too. I feel like a girly girl again. The scent lingers a little bit, too, after you&#x27;ve rinsed off, which I enjoy. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Vitabath has always been wonderful, but the new scents are terrific, nice to have some choices.  The products came very quickly, in good condition.</li>
            <li> This is the best vitabath product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells. This has a wonderful scent. Not to strong and feels great. I have ordered this shower gel on a monthly basis. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as their Pine scented. This shower gel is too perfumey. I was hoping the scent would be more subtle and have a more orange scent but it smells like perfume. I really liked the Pine scented and decided to try the newer ones that they have.&lt;br /&gt;My wife gave some of them away and I don&#x27;t like when she showers with it.</li>
            <li> Best smelling shower gel ever!</li>
            <li> I thought I got it late but it was a problem with my apt building manager. I got it and it&#x27;sgreat. I haven&#x27;t used vitabath for years but I&#x27;ll start using it again.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s okay.  It&#x27;s a new &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; for me. It beats using any regular bath soap that&#x27;s on the market.</li>
