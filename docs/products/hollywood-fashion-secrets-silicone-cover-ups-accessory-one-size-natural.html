            <li> long as you put them away properly you can get a lot of usage for this product!!</li>
            <li> They are a little &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; than the most expensive ones but &amp;#34;you get what you pay for!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So when I lost them, i bought these - thinking that they would be the same (but for alot less money).  </li>
            <li> I had previously bought some other ones and paid at least twice as much.  </li>
            <li> Just save the plastic paper so you can put it away carefully each time u use it</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands in the past and none have been as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was initially a little disappointed when I first opened the package, but you know?  </li>

            <li> A little irritation the first time I used them, but have used them several times since with no problems. Love how well they clean.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Don&#x27;t expect any support, but they keep your headlights from showing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved these! The adhesive won&#x27;t rip you apart when you take them off, but they stay in place all day. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Perfect cover-up. ReUsable many times. Just save the plastic paper so you can put it away carefully each time u use it</li>
            <li> Worked great! And we&#x27;re comfy!</li>
            <li> I have to be honest here I love these! I have tried a few different brands in the past and none have been as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the package it says up to 25 uses but for me I had mine for almost a year and only had to change them because I forgot to take them off in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you put them away properly you can get a lot of usage for this product!! I would buy this over and over again.</li>
            <li> Must have changed the manufacturing process.  Did not maintain &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; factor over more than a few wears.</li>
            <li> Love the product, will order again.</li>

I was initially a little disappointed when I first opened the package, but you know?  they work!  and that is all that matters.  They are a little &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; than the most expensive ones but &amp;#34;you get what you pay for!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very similar to what I purchased 3-4yrs ago at Charming Charlies and they no longer carry them. Very happy to locate them here. This is the best product I have found in cover-ups. Price is also good and shipping prompt.</li>
            <li> Seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years,mif your like me, and have lil&#x27; girls that can stand on their own, this is all that you need!!</li>
            <li> these are not silicone, they are rubbery gel for which you can see your nipple through</li>
            <li> These are great for when a woman wants a smoother look under her clothes. They are so comfortable, I forgot I was wearing them!</li>
            <li> Super product. I feel very comfortable in t shirts and gym attire</li>
            <li> Best invention ever for the ladies who hate wearing bras!</li>
            <li> Smooth, not obvious like other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I discovered these years ago and thought they were a god send.  I do not know if they have changed how they are manufacturing these, the material but they make your nipples look as if they are the size of silver dollars.</li>
