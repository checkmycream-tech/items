            <li>Wow these are the BEST.</li>
            <li>It is fairly abrasive, and feels like it is lightly scratching my skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and awesome.</li>
            <li>WOW, this is the best Salux that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>hope this review helps people with this wonderful product and learn a little more about their skin!!</li>
            <li>Super exfoliating!!</li>
            <li>They are not expensive, but are very effective.</li>
            <li>They are so much more hygienic than a loofah.</li>
            <li>Better than wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>But better than nothing</li>
            <li>purchased the product after reading a blog post about it, the product description, and a handful of the top reviews.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The family is enjoying using it as well.  </li>
            <li>Will purchase more before they run out.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I scrub, I like to take off the top layer of skin.</li>
            <li>Love these for showering.</li>
            <li>I have used these for over a year, and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>It should feel invigorating not painful!!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Was able to throw away one of those scrub brushes with the arm.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for scrubbing your back.  </li>
            <li>MUCH better than those sponge poufs I used to use before.</li>
            <li>Just  gotta love it.</li>
            <li>It holds up better than the mesh scrunchy things.</li>
            <li>Okay but they are shorter than the one I bought from the organic health food store.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I Absolutely love this wash cloth.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that the product you receive is made in Japan like advertised.</li>
            <li>More of a scrub than those bath poofs but not abrasive feeling.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>So glad that I found them here.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>While things like Amlactin have helped, adding the Salux clothes to my beauty routine helped even more.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t help feeling like they&#x27;re more sanitary to use than a loofah or washcloth.</li>
            <li>I am buying more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>The more you use it, the better your skin will look.  </li>
            <li>Have been using for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>’s simpler, more hygienic and easier to pack than a brush or loofah.</li>
            <li>I bought mine out of curiosity, and I’m glad</li>
            <li>Love these wash towels I have used them since i was 13 and got one in a hawaiian grocery store</li>
            <li>I like these as a more hygienic and more versatile alternative to loofas, washcloths, and bath poofs.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use lotion after because of the opportunity for it to soak in better.</li>
            <li>But great for exfoliating before shaving and really helps my skin absorb moisturizers after my shower.</li>
            <li>(By the way, mosquitoes are more attracted to the smell of unwashed skin than they are to washed--or so I&#x27;ve read.)</li>
            <li>Will be buying more when they wear out.</li>
            <li>I wasn’t sure I was going to like using these bath towel</li>
            <li>although I really do love have they make my skin feel.</li>
            <li>They stand up better to washing than some of the ones that you can find in pharmacies and grocery stores so keeping them nice and clean is not an issue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these since I first saw one in 1976, and they&#x27;re absolutely the best &amp;#34;washcloth&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even try to use it on more sensitive areas though, lol.</li>
            <li>Exfoliation is very important to maintain smooth skin and it also helps with blood flow.  </li>
            <li>I also gave one to my brother and we agreed that while it does hurt when you scrub, afterwards you feel so clean!</li>
            <li>These are absolutely the best I recommend them highly</li>
            <li>(JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Bought then before and loved them so much, that they are  going  to be given to guests when they are with us.</li>
            <li>great size and quality.. dries super fast.</li>
            <li>Glad to have the original again.</li>
            <li>I love that it rinses clean</li>
            <li>Easy to pack for traveling.</li>
            <li>but these are still going strong.  </li>
            <li>The texture is perfect for exfoliation and the length is just right for scrubbing the back.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s as good as new.</li>
            <li>These are the best yet, Great for getting your back - gets rid of dead skin - you feel clean!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these towels.</li>
            <li>They last forever and do a great job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Leaves skins feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>The material is holding up great and after multiple uses, I wonder if one of these will ever wear out (you receive 3.)  </li>
            <li>I showed her net ands he was so happy.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great for cleaning back and exfoliating skin.</li>
            <li>Very durable and effective.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really, really easy to rinse it completely clean.</li>
            <li>#34;I&#x27;ll just give it a light swipe with this cloth over my cleanser&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Simple but great product.  </li>
            <li>These bath towels are far superior to loofahs.  </li>
            <li>Now it is always clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth snd clean.</li>
            <li>so I am so excited to have found it</li>
            <li>The best part is the ability to wash my back with ease - the first time I used it, I&#x27;m sure I sounded like one of the old Herbal Essences commercials (Mmmmm!</li>
            <li>Fast-Drying, Easy to Clean, and Great for Buffing Rough Skin!</li>
            <li>I feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Because now I don&#x27;t feel really clean unless I can scour myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you get used to these things, you will not feel clean unless you have one.</li>
            <li>to keep clean</li>
            <li>I never felt really clean without using it.</li>
            <li>feel clean as if I have been at spa.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel really clean unless I have used my cloth.</li>
            <li>Exfoliating and will scrub your skin clean of any dirt, oils, etc.  </li>
            <li>Very nice long cloths.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not very much money and is a great way to keep clean.</li>
            <li>They work great, last forever and the package is funny.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good for use on your back</li>
            <li>True skin cleaning.</li>
            <li>It was what I had expected, very happy with this product, just like the ones I&#x27;m used to back in the island&#x27;s.... :)</li>
            <li>I love these gentle exfoliating cleansing cloths.</li>
            <li>These are cool.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean quickly under running water.</li>
            <li>Drys quickly.  </li>
            <li>is a bit rough feeling on the skin, especially on more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>PanOxyl quickly ruined my towel though (no surprise since it has Peroxide in).</li>
            <li>I have used similar products for many years and love them.</li>
            <li>They were expedited quickly.</li>
            <li>After all the communication with users, posting Q&#x27;s in the Q &amp; A&#x27;s and reading highly rated reviews, I would LOVE to give this product ZERO stars.</li>
            <li>Much better than using a back brush...and great for applying anti-acne cleansers to back.</li>
            <li>but when you get out of the bath/shower put on a good petroleum free cream, or oil, something stable and extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li>He loved that it scrubbed all the dirt off, and since it was long he could use it to reach everywhere.</li>
            <li>and I have dry skin, so I need a good scrub.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!!!</li>
            <li>no big deal, love them anyway!</li>
            <li>I kept mine for about 5 years before it completely started to fall apart; luckily I was able to find replacements online.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my body never felt cleaner - I was squeaky clean all over.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for anyone who wants smooth, clean skin and likes a good back scrub without having to twist into yoga-like poses to reach every square inch.</li>
            <li>Especially us single folks who like to wash our own backs!</li>
            <li>These are absolute fantastic.</li>
            <li>I feel super clean, my skin feels silky smooth -- even my knees and elbows feel baby soft.</li>
            <li>Great to scrub dead skin off.</li>
            <li>but it does soften up a bit after about a weeks worth of use, or you just get used to it.</li>
            <li>It was one of those purchases where I believe I truly got my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>These were bought as a gift because my patents really liked the one I left while visiting.  </li>
            <li>The absolute best thing I have ever run cross my back.</li>
            <li>Gets every inch of my broad back easily after a good work out.</li>
            <li>Also they are huge so super easy to wash your back!</li>
            <li>It’s really good for scrubbing (and exfoliating) all over, it foams up easily with a small amount of soap, rinses easily and completely, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>but I use high quality bar soap and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Also the lowest price I found right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>someone wants to feel clean; try</li>
            <li>Scrubbing your back is very easy.</li>
            <li>Bath time just became a slightly bit more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long enough to easily scrub your back as well as the rest of your body, dries easily and folds up beautifully for traveling.</li>
            <li>so two things about keratosis light exfoliation ( on a regular basis, preferably later in the day while your skin is in its renewal process), and a good cream moisturizer or oil after bath while skin is still moist!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Folded up or stretched out and it scrubs nicely</li>
            <li>The material feels something like a mosquito net, but with a more distinct woven pattern.</li>
            <li>Gets a nice lather, but takes up a bit of room when hanging to dry in the shower.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those of us obsessed with a good, thorough scrub down when taking a shower.</li>
            <li>and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li>I first learned about these from a friend in Hawaii</li>
            <li>Love it, my daily wash cloth!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>It SCRUBS like no loofa or any similar product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>I love to use this on my back and feet.</li>
            <li>so use much lighter pressure when you scrub!</li>
            <li>They feel a bit abrasive at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve glad a finally did give it a try.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I also buy body wash by the gallon [EO Brand] which saves A LOT of money as it last for six months or more.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>We totally love our set of exfoliating Japanese washcloths.  </li>
            <li>The material is neither too soft or too rough and is perfect for total body exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It very invigorating!</li>
            <li>They leave skin so smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>threw the first, of three cloths, in the trash.  </li>
            <li>Top elbow area same spot on both arms and one on my cheek.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the first one</li>
            <li>Very abrasive, but it feels so right.</li>
            <li>If you want baby soft, clean skin, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous soap sacks, sisal towels, Cure Towel and this one really does top them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth it, especially where it&#x27;s hot, and clean pores allow one to sweat.</li>
            <li>Ok, I think I&#x27;m getting known for writing some long reviews.</li>
            <li>The Salux clothes pretty much eliminated that</li>
            <li>These wash cloths are thick and amazing, well worth the price!  </li>
            <li>I use it after a long soak in the tub and my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li>Once you wet it and use it, then it will be more willing to hang.</li>
            <li>I love this washcloth even though at first it feels rough when you start using it.  </li>
            <li>Tip to save water: use a bucket; fill while letting the body get thoroughly wet; apply face wash and allow to sit; apply body wash to cloth; TURN OFF WATER leaving bucket full while you give yourself a good scrub down; rinse with bucket water and finally one more time with shower.</li>
            <li>Feels great like a total body scratch down.</li>
            <li>They are not like other brands soft and dont feel clean this ones do a better job.</li>
            <li>Item as described, very fast shipper, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>looooooove these, they lather so well, great long length, and extremely well made.</li>
            <li>so it is ready when I use it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I bought this for this very purpose.  </li>
            <li>Okay, not really,</li>
            <li>and my skin feel so much smoother</li>
            <li>very well&lt;br /&gt;-easy</li>
            <li>am writing this review for both products since I don&#x27;t know which one is responsible for this awesomeness.</li>
            <li>I absorbs and distributes soap/body wash very well</li>
            <li>And very efficient with soap</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The soap be it bar or liquid form of soap suds up really well with it.</li>
            <li>- it was absolutely HEAVENLY.  </li>
            <li>Also, be gentle on your nether regions.  </li>
            <li>These scrub very well.</li>
            <li>They lather up really well and rinse out quickly and dry quickly too.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>and is very hard-wearing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to pay three times as much for Dermologica cloths like this.</li>
            <li>They really suds up and scrub very well.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for exfoliation during daily showers.</li>
            <li>utilized the product gently for &amp;#34;CHICKEN SKIN&amp;#34; on sides of my arms.  </li>
            <li>They are large enough to easily and quickly wash my back.</li>
            <li>this &#x27;scratchy&#x27; pad is almost as good as having your significant other wash and scratch your back at the same time.  </li>
            <li>In China,&amp;#34; !SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH: ...........</li>
            <li>These are genuine high quality Japanese wash cloths.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash in lingerie bag, then hang dry.</li>
            <li>I use the same one to scrub my shower with comet and it rinses so cleanly, I can use it on myself after.</li>
            <li>They exfoliate well, make those hard-to-reach places scrubbable, dry very quickly and never smell, and soap up well.</li>
            <li>Dry fast and light weight.</li>
            <li>The clothes rinse out like a dream and dry quickly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like her old one.</li>
            <li>My new go to scrubber!</li>
            <li>I have had some mild back acne (bacne) for years and nothing I tried ever did anything to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>I purchased a similar Earth Therapeutics product a while ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement in stores locally.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Nice to get a good back scratch when showering and the length allows for diagonal, two-handed washing, something that is really difficult with standard square washcloths.  </li>
            <li>Completely gets rid of body acne, and makes me smoother than I have ever been in my life!!</li>
            <li>Would be a lot better if it had a little loop for hanging on a hook.&lt;br /&gt;-it</li>
            <li>Dries fast and completely between uses.  </li>
            <li>I just rinse it off and shake the water off after each shower - do not put in washer every few days as many do.</li>
            <li>Better value for the money as these last a really long time.</li>
            <li>They work, they&#x27;re more sanitary and easier to carry than a loofah, and they can be air or towel dried.</li>
            <li>These are worth the money, because they last forever and they&#x27;re not too rough on your skin while still giving you that scrubbed clean feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-hard to hang on a hook when it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
            <li>Have looked all over to find them where we now live, but could not.  </li>
            <li>Salux makes it feel like you have new skin.  </li>
            <li>He works on a loading dock and gets covered with fine dark dirt.</li>
            <li>It can be machine washed (but not dried!)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re rough enough to exfoliate, but soft enough to feel very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve marked my review according to the product quality/cost, but I don&#x27;t use this often</li>
            <li>Just some old scarring and pixelated areas.</li>
            <li>Also, might be a placebo effect, but the old pixelated marks seem to be fading quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH</li>
            <li>Not for the sensitive skin types.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I get far cleaner using this...</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with sensitive skin, however, as it may be too abrasive.</li>
            <li>You are only trying to remove dead skin and set the healthy skin underneath free!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wash towel is long enough to easily scrub your back as shown on the package.</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few</li>
            <li>If you like high quality soap, the Salux makes the bar last longer.  </li>
            <li>Multiple wash clothes all being high grade.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these I&#x27;ve been using them for years and will never go back to a wash cloth or body sponge</li>
            <li>These exfoliate like no other wash cloth!</li>
            <li>After one use, a normal human being will ask himself how he got along without it.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that you put a little soap on the wash towel and it gets very sudsy and lasts for the whole shower.  </li>
            <li>It gets used daily and still looks like new.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These dry fast</li>
            <li>Once you get used to the high level of epidermal stimulation, every shower will feel like you&#x27;ve just taken a trip to an Asian spa…except without all the public nudity and semi-sadistic spa</li>
            <li>And each one lasts me 6 months with daily showering before getting too soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning - it&#x27;s quite rough, so go gentle.</li>
            <li>These last a long time and when you want a new one, the old one can be used for household chores.</li>
            <li>this has really helped a lot get off all that extra dry skin.</li>
            <li>Seriously... the scrubber things in most people&#x27;s showers or gross, and you cant wash your back with them.  </li>
            <li>its also long enough that you can really scrub your back with it.</li>
            <li>Really does a fabulous job of exfoliating your skin gently, without doing any damage or being painful.</li>
            <li>The length is perfect for scrubbing your back, I hated the traditional loofah that just simply couldn&#x27;t reach around the back.</li>
            <li>The other two just sit (brand new) in my hallway</li>
    </ol>

            <li> WOW, this is the best Salux that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> hope this review helps people with this wonderful product and learn a little more about their skin!!</li>
            <li> Super exfoliating!!</li>
            <li> They are not expensive, but are very effective.</li>
            <li> They are so much more hygienic than a loofah.</li>
            <li> Better than wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> But better than nothing</li>
            <li> purchased the product after reading a blog post about it, the product description, and a handful of the top reviews.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> The family is enjoying using it as well.  </li>
            <li> Will purchase more before they run out.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I scrub, I like to take off the top layer of skin.</li>
            <li> Love these for showering.</li>
            <li> I have used these for over a year, and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> It should feel invigorating not painful!!</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Was able to throw away one of those scrub brushes with the arm.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for scrubbing your back.  </li>
            <li> MUCH better than those sponge poufs I used to use before.</li>
            <li> Just  gotta love it.</li>
            <li> It holds up better than the mesh scrunchy things.</li>
            <li> Okay but they are shorter than the one I bought from the organic health food store.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love this wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that the product you receive is made in Japan like advertised.</li>
            <li> More of a scrub than those bath poofs but not abrasive feeling.</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> So glad that I found them here.  </li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> While things like Amlactin have helped, adding the Salux clothes to my beauty routine helped even more.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t help feeling like they&#x27;re more sanitary to use than a loofah or washcloth.</li>
            <li> I am buying more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> The more you use it, the better your skin will look.  </li>
            <li> Have been using for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> ’s simpler, more hygienic and easier to pack than a brush or loofah.</li>
            <li> I bought mine out of curiosity, and I’m glad</li>
            <li> Love these wash towels I have used them since i was 13 and got one in a hawaiian grocery store</li>
            <li> I like these as a more hygienic and more versatile alternative to loofas, washcloths, and bath poofs.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use lotion after because of the opportunity for it to soak in better.</li>
            <li> But great for exfoliating before shaving and really helps my skin absorb moisturizers after my shower.</li>
            <li> (By the way, mosquitoes are more attracted to the smell of unwashed skin than they are to washed--or so I&#x27;ve read.)</li>
            <li> Will be buying more when they wear out.</li>
            <li> I wasn’t sure I was going to like using these bath towel</li>
            <li> although I really do love have they make my skin feel.</li>
            <li> They stand up better to washing than some of the ones that you can find in pharmacies and grocery stores so keeping them nice and clean is not an issue.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since I first saw one in 1976, and they&#x27;re absolutely the best &amp;#34;washcloth&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even try to use it on more sensitive areas though, lol.</li>
            <li> Exfoliation is very important to maintain smooth skin and it also helps with blood flow.  </li>
            <li> I also gave one to my brother and we agreed that while it does hurt when you scrub, afterwards you feel so clean!</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the best I recommend them highly</li>
            <li> (JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Bought then before and loved them so much, that they are  going  to be given to guests when they are with us.</li>
            <li> great size and quality.. dries super fast.</li>
            <li> Glad to have the original again.</li>
            <li> I love that it rinses clean</li>
            <li> Easy to pack for traveling.</li>
            <li> but these are still going strong.  </li>
            <li> The texture is perfect for exfoliation and the length is just right for scrubbing the back.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s as good as new.</li>
            <li> These are the best yet, Great for getting your back - gets rid of dead skin - you feel clean!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these towels.</li>
            <li> They last forever and do a great job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Leaves skins feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> The material is holding up great and after multiple uses, I wonder if one of these will ever wear out (you receive 3.)  </li>
            <li> I showed her net ands he was so happy.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Great for cleaning back and exfoliating skin.</li>
            <li> Very durable and effective.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really, really easy to rinse it completely clean.</li>
            <li> #34;I&#x27;ll just give it a light swipe with this cloth over my cleanser&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Simple but great product.  </li>
            <li> These bath towels are far superior to loofahs.  </li>
            <li> Now it is always clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth snd clean.</li>
            <li> so I am so excited to have found it</li>
            <li> The best part is the ability to wash my back with ease - the first time I used it, I&#x27;m sure I sounded like one of the old Herbal Essences commercials (Mmmmm!</li>
            <li> Fast-Drying, Easy to Clean, and Great for Buffing Rough Skin!</li>
            <li> I feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Because now I don&#x27;t feel really clean unless I can scour myself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you get used to these things, you will not feel clean unless you have one.</li>
            <li> to keep clean</li>
            <li> I never felt really clean without using it.</li>
            <li> feel clean as if I have been at spa.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel really clean unless I have used my cloth.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating and will scrub your skin clean of any dirt, oils, etc.  </li>
            <li> Very nice long cloths.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not very much money and is a great way to keep clean.</li>
            <li> They work great, last forever and the package is funny.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s good for use on your back</li>
            <li> True skin cleaning.</li>
            <li> It was what I had expected, very happy with this product, just like the ones I&#x27;m used to back in the island&#x27;s.... :)</li>
            <li> I love these gentle exfoliating cleansing cloths.</li>
            <li> These are cool.</li>
            <li> Rinses clean quickly under running water.</li>
            <li> Drys quickly.  </li>
            <li> is a bit rough feeling on the skin, especially on more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> PanOxyl quickly ruined my towel though (no surprise since it has Peroxide in).</li>
            <li> I have used similar products for many years and love them.</li>
            <li> They were expedited quickly.</li>
            <li> After all the communication with users, posting Q&#x27;s in the Q &amp; A&#x27;s and reading highly rated reviews, I would LOVE to give this product ZERO stars.</li>
            <li> Much better than using a back brush...and great for applying anti-acne cleansers to back.</li>
            <li> but when you get out of the bath/shower put on a good petroleum free cream, or oil, something stable and extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> He loved that it scrubbed all the dirt off, and since it was long he could use it to reach everywhere.</li>
            <li> and I have dry skin, so I need a good scrub.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!!!</li>
            <li> no big deal, love them anyway!</li>
            <li> I kept mine for about 5 years before it completely started to fall apart; luckily I was able to find replacements online.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my body never felt cleaner - I was squeaky clean all over.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for anyone who wants smooth, clean skin and likes a good back scrub without having to twist into yoga-like poses to reach every square inch.</li>
            <li> Especially us single folks who like to wash our own backs!</li>
            <li> These are absolute fantastic.</li>
            <li> I feel super clean, my skin feels silky smooth -- even my knees and elbows feel baby soft.</li>
            <li> Great to scrub dead skin off.</li>
            <li> but it does soften up a bit after about a weeks worth of use, or you just get used to it.</li>
            <li> It was one of those purchases where I believe I truly got my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> These were bought as a gift because my patents really liked the one I left while visiting.  </li>
            <li> The absolute best thing I have ever run cross my back.</li>
            <li> Gets every inch of my broad back easily after a good work out.</li>
            <li> Also they are huge so super easy to wash your back!</li>
            <li> It’s really good for scrubbing (and exfoliating) all over, it foams up easily with a small amount of soap, rinses easily and completely, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> but I use high quality bar soap and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Also the lowest price I found right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> someone wants to feel clean; try</li>
            <li> Scrubbing your back is very easy.</li>
            <li> Bath time just became a slightly bit more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long enough to easily scrub your back as well as the rest of your body, dries easily and folds up beautifully for traveling.</li>
            <li> so two things about keratosis light exfoliation ( on a regular basis, preferably later in the day while your skin is in its renewal process), and a good cream moisturizer or oil after bath while skin is still moist!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Folded up or stretched out and it scrubs nicely</li>
            <li> The material feels something like a mosquito net, but with a more distinct woven pattern.</li>
            <li> Gets a nice lather, but takes up a bit of room when hanging to dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those of us obsessed with a good, thorough scrub down when taking a shower.</li>
            <li> and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li> I first learned about these from a friend in Hawaii</li>
            <li> Love it, my daily wash cloth!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> It SCRUBS like no loofa or any similar product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> I love to use this on my back and feet.</li>
            <li> so use much lighter pressure when you scrub!</li>
            <li> They feel a bit abrasive at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve glad a finally did give it a try.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I also buy body wash by the gallon [EO Brand] which saves A LOT of money as it last for six months or more.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> We totally love our set of exfoliating Japanese washcloths.  </li>
            <li> The material is neither too soft or too rough and is perfect for total body exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It very invigorating!</li>
            <li> They leave skin so smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> threw the first, of three cloths, in the trash.  </li>
            <li> Top elbow area same spot on both arms and one on my cheek.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the first one</li>
            <li> Very abrasive, but it feels so right.</li>
            <li> If you want baby soft, clean skin, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous soap sacks, sisal towels, Cure Towel and this one really does top them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth it, especially where it&#x27;s hot, and clean pores allow one to sweat.</li>
            <li> Ok, I think I&#x27;m getting known for writing some long reviews.</li>
            <li> The Salux clothes pretty much eliminated that</li>
            <li> These wash cloths are thick and amazing, well worth the price!  </li>
            <li> I use it after a long soak in the tub and my skin feels so much better.</li>
            <li> Once you wet it and use it, then it will be more willing to hang.</li>
            <li> I love this washcloth even though at first it feels rough when you start using it.  </li>
            <li> Tip to save water: use a bucket; fill while letting the body get thoroughly wet; apply face wash and allow to sit; apply body wash to cloth; TURN OFF WATER leaving bucket full while you give yourself a good scrub down; rinse with bucket water and finally one more time with shower.</li>
            <li> Feels great like a total body scratch down.</li>
            <li> They are not like other brands soft and dont feel clean this ones do a better job.</li>
            <li> Item as described, very fast shipper, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> looooooove these, they lather so well, great long length, and extremely well made.</li>
            <li> so it is ready when I use it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this for this very purpose.  </li>
            <li> Okay, not really,</li>
            <li> and my skin feel so much smoother</li>
            <li> very well&lt;br /&gt;-easy</li>
            <li> am writing this review for both products since I don&#x27;t know which one is responsible for this awesomeness.</li>
            <li> I absorbs and distributes soap/body wash very well</li>
            <li> And very efficient with soap</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The soap be it bar or liquid form of soap suds up really well with it.</li>
            <li> - it was absolutely HEAVENLY.  </li>
            <li> Also, be gentle on your nether regions.  </li>
            <li> These scrub very well.</li>
            <li> They lather up really well and rinse out quickly and dry quickly too.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> and is very hard-wearing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to pay three times as much for Dermologica cloths like this.</li>
            <li> They really suds up and scrub very well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for exfoliation during daily showers.</li>
            <li> utilized the product gently for &amp;#34;CHICKEN SKIN&amp;#34; on sides of my arms.  </li>
            <li> They are large enough to easily and quickly wash my back.</li>
            <li> this &#x27;scratchy&#x27; pad is almost as good as having your significant other wash and scratch your back at the same time.  </li>
            <li> In China,&amp;#34; !SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH: ...........</li>
            <li> These are genuine high quality Japanese wash cloths.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash in lingerie bag, then hang dry.</li>
            <li> I use the same one to scrub my shower with comet and it rinses so cleanly, I can use it on myself after.</li>
            <li> They exfoliate well, make those hard-to-reach places scrubbable, dry very quickly and never smell, and soap up well.</li>
            <li> Dry fast and light weight.</li>
            <li> The clothes rinse out like a dream and dry quickly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly like her old one.</li>
            <li> My new go to scrubber!</li>
            <li> I have had some mild back acne (bacne) for years and nothing I tried ever did anything to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I purchased a similar Earth Therapeutics product a while ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement in stores locally.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice to get a good back scratch when showering and the length allows for diagonal, two-handed washing, something that is really difficult with standard square washcloths.  </li>
            <li> Completely gets rid of body acne, and makes me smoother than I have ever been in my life!!</li>
            <li> Would be a lot better if it had a little loop for hanging on a hook.&lt;br /&gt;-it</li>
            <li> Dries fast and completely between uses.  </li>
            <li> I just rinse it off and shake the water off after each shower - do not put in washer every few days as many do.</li>
            <li> Better value for the money as these last a really long time.</li>
            <li> They work, they&#x27;re more sanitary and easier to carry than a loofah, and they can be air or towel dried.</li>
            <li> These are worth the money, because they last forever and they&#x27;re not too rough on your skin while still giving you that scrubbed clean feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-hard to hang on a hook when it&#x27;s brand new.</li>
            <li> Have looked all over to find them where we now live, but could not.  </li>
            <li> Salux makes it feel like you have new skin.  </li>
            <li> He works on a loading dock and gets covered with fine dark dirt.</li>
            <li> It can be machine washed (but not dried!)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re rough enough to exfoliate, but soft enough to feel very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve marked my review according to the product quality/cost, but I don&#x27;t use this often</li>
            <li> Just some old scarring and pixelated areas.</li>
            <li> Also, might be a placebo effect, but the old pixelated marks seem to be fading quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH</li>
            <li> Not for the sensitive skin types.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I get far cleaner using this...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with sensitive skin, however, as it may be too abrasive.</li>
            <li> You are only trying to remove dead skin and set the healthy skin underneath free!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wash towel is long enough to easily scrub your back as shown on the package.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few</li>
            <li> If you like high quality soap, the Salux makes the bar last longer.  </li>
            <li> Multiple wash clothes all being high grade.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these I&#x27;ve been using them for years and will never go back to a wash cloth or body sponge</li>
            <li> These exfoliate like no other wash cloth!</li>
            <li> After one use, a normal human being will ask himself how he got along without it.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that you put a little soap on the wash towel and it gets very sudsy and lasts for the whole shower.  </li>
            <li> It gets used daily and still looks like new.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These dry fast</li>
            <li> Once you get used to the high level of epidermal stimulation, every shower will feel like you&#x27;ve just taken a trip to an Asian spa…except without all the public nudity and semi-sadistic spa</li>
            <li> And each one lasts me 6 months with daily showering before getting too soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning - it&#x27;s quite rough, so go gentle.</li>
            <li> These last a long time and when you want a new one, the old one can be used for household chores.</li>
            <li> this has really helped a lot get off all that extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously... the scrubber things in most people&#x27;s showers or gross, and you cant wash your back with them.  </li>
            <li> its also long enough that you can really scrub your back with it.</li>
            <li> Really does a fabulous job of exfoliating your skin gently, without doing any damage or being painful.</li>
            <li> The length is perfect for scrubbing your back, I hated the traditional loofah that just simply couldn&#x27;t reach around the back.</li>
            <li> The other two just sit (brand new) in my hallway</li>
            <li> Always a new blemish, and the resulting dark mark would take months to fade.</li>
            <li> COMES!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to last a long time (still has the same &#x27;bite&#x27; as it did on day 1 after using for</li>
            <li> Soap lathers well and the cloth is long enough to use on you back.  </li>
            <li> I especially like that this wash towel is LONG.</li>
            <li> Because these unfold, they can be rinsed out well, and hung flat to avoid mildew.  </li>
            <li> The ones I received were made in Japan, not China, and look like they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin especially in the winter gets really really dry</li>
            <li> These started out rather stiff right out of the package, but after a few uses they loosened up.</li>
            <li> It probably will feel a little harsh at first</li>
            <li> Too rough for daily use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry this is so long..</li>
            <li> It definitely is somewhat rough but that is what needs to be to do the job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the cloth is thicker keeps its rough texture far longer then other brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Worth trying out!</li>
            <li> Exfoliating but can be a little rough if you have sensitive parts.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again, and wont order any other brand.</li>
            <li> Recently I got a wimpy one that was a huge disappointment so tried Amazon.</li>
            <li> Rinse after use and hang to dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much dry skin I had until I used a Salux towel.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t look like my last set and lasted only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These clothes are big enough to exfoliate hard to get spots like your back.</li>
            <li> Abrasives are generally bad for the skin with prolonged use, but I can see it being useful for less sensitive areas (such as the feet).</li>
            <li> I also think that its helped me get rid of a little back acne I started to experience.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I like a rough luffa texture.</li>
            <li> It was recommended as a face washing cloth, but I find it way to rough for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I find that bunching it up and using circular motions helps reduce the rough effect.  </li>
            <li> Arrived couple days before the expected date, product as described.</li>
            <li> The material is rough, but not too rough.</li>
            <li> They have a rough texture</li>
            <li> The other thing you have to remember when dealing with keratosis is that it&#x27;s a dry skin condition!</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s so long, I will take one and cut it in half for travel.</li>
            <li> It got rid of the small red bumps on the back of my thighs too after a few uses.</li>
            <li> This woven nylon shower or bath scrubbing cloth can be folded up or used long to scrub the back in those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much obsessed with these.</li>
            <li> Scrub the itching area (hard) with one of these cloths (dry) and itching is relieved for a long time without damage to skin.  </li>
            <li> Once you use these, its hard to go back to anything else.  </li>
            <li> They definitely exfoliate and might be a little too rough for delicate areas.</li>
            <li> (especially if you&#x27;re really dirty and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!!)</li>
            <li> Small amount of soap or geek goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and it takes away the black coloring that my flip flops leave behind on the heels of my feet!</li>
            <li> No more itchiness on my back - which is hard to reach.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They produce copious amounts of foam with small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package&#x27;s front side)</li>
            <li> but it did take a little time to get used to the feeling.</li>
            <li> DO NOT use on your face fyi, even if you think you are putting little to no pressure.</li>
            <li> Cuts down time and saves money!</li>
            <li> usually fully-dries in less then</li>
            <li> It might be hard for some people to get used to because of this, but this is also the reason that it works so well at removing dead skin and cleaning your pores.</li>
            <li> It folds up small.</li>
            <li> The other buffing cloth was very expensive and had mixed reviews on Amazon, but I started reading about the Salux Nylon cloths and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> This woman said that she scrubbed her arms raw!</li>
            <li> Some people will consider this a negative, but I dont,  </li>
            <li> arm bend area break out different from the chicken skin, like hives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure what I did before discovering them!</li>
            <li> I mean just soap and water without this cloth isn&#x27;t efficient.</li>
            <li> You can get cheapo versions at Target or Walmart that cost $1.99, but those are thin and poorly made, always fall apart within a few weeks, coming unraveled and getting stray threads everywhere.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve since become addicted.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m addicted them.  </li>
            <li> I always hated those loofahs on a stick because they never seemed to exfoliate my back</li>
            <li> One day I foresee these replacing all lame wash cloths.</li>
            <li> After one week of use, the chicken skin and breaks outs on sides of my arms got out of control and waaaay worse.  </li>
            <li> Apply while the skin is still moist (I use a combination of cold pressed olive oil and organic castor oil that I mix myself all over after a bath/shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had keratosis pilaris (aka Chicken Skin) on my arms ever since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> would like to address some of the bad reviews I&#x27;ve read on here.&lt;br /&gt;1st</li>
            <li> Absolutely hated my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is shocking to me!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these!  They are so much more hygienic than a loofah.</li>
            <li> Necessity.  Better than wash cloth.  Easy to wash in lingerie bag, then hang dry.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. But better than nothing</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these towels. If you like to massage your skin and get the blood circulating this is what you should have. When I have finished showering my skin tingles. Oh what a feeling</li>
            <li> this &#x27;scratchy&#x27; pad is almost as good as having your significant other wash and scratch your back at the same time.  It is awesome!</li>
            <li> Where hqs this product been all my life. If this Japanese company would advertise here they could not keep up. Great product.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the best I recommend them highly</li>
            <li> I bought these for me. I like a rough luffa texture. As soon as they arrived, my husband took one and showered with it. He works on a loading dock and gets covered with fine dark dirt. He loved that it scrubbed all the dirt off, and since it was long he could use it to reach everywhere. I love that it rinses clean so it is ready when I use it. It has been over a month since I bought these and we have only opened 1 package. It gets used daily and still looks like new. If I squinch it up and soap it up it works like a poof. Folded up or stretched out and it scrubs nicely</li>
            <li> I first learned about these from a friend in Hawaii and I&#x27;ve since become addicted. The greatest product for achieving smooth skin. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wow these are the BEST. Also the lowest price I found right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love these! The best and simplest invention ever</li>
            <li> These exfoliate like no other wash cloth!</li>
            <li> Too rough for daily use</li>
            <li> LOVE this item! I purchased the group of three Salux Nylon towels. One I kept. Two I gave as gifts. They were a HIT! Not sure what I did before discovering them!</li>
            <li> This is a quality product for the cost. If this is what you need, it should work well. I&#x27;ve marked my review according to the product quality/cost, but I don&#x27;t use this often and here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the product after reading a blog post about it, the product description, and a handful of the top reviews. It was recommended as a face washing cloth, but I find it way to rough for this purpose. It is fairly abrasive, and feels like it is lightly scratching my skin. The material feels something like a mosquito net, but with a more distinct woven pattern. Abrasives are generally bad for the skin with prolonged use, but I can see it being useful for less sensitive areas (such as the feet). It washes and dries very easily.</li>
            <li> Once you use these, its hard to go back to anything else.  Love it</li>
            <li> great size and quality.. dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I really liked these wash clothes. I also gave one to my brother and we agreed that while it does hurt when you scrub, afterwards you feel so clean!</li>
            <li> Love it, my daily wash cloth!</li>
            <li> These bath towels are far superior to loofahs.  They last forever and do a great job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li> No more itchiness on my back - which is hard to reach.  Now it is always clean and smooth. I bought this for this very purpose.  The family is enjoying using it as well.  Will purchase more before they run out. Yes, this is made in Japan.</li>
            <li> Took years to wear the last ones out and I&#x27;m addicted them.  Gets every inch of my broad back easily after a good work out.</li>
            <li> Must have for every woman. buy the three pack.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner.  Exactly as described.  Leaves skins feeling silky smooth.  Love it!</li>
            <li> So scrubby! Lathers great. I feel so clean and refreshed. Rinse after use and hang to dry. It dries so quick...never gets smelly. But you can just toss it into your laundry if you ever want to wash it. Love this. And this three pack will last me forever.</li>
            <li> great shower accessory</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve buy buying these for a couple of years.  Love them!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice long cloths. Exfoliating but can be a little rough if you have sensitive parts. Gets a nice lather, but takes up a bit of room when hanging to dry in the shower.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s the point!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom was Korean and she used to buy these by the case from the local Korean store. I have one in every bathroom for all my kids and will leave one in the guest bathroom in the wrapping, for others to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I scrub, I like to take off the top layer of skin. Okay, not really, but I do like a good scrub. It&#x27;s invigorating. I especially like that this wash towel is LONG. So I can scrub my back without dislocating my elbow. In fact, it&#x27;s so long, I will take one and cut it in half for travel. Because now I don&#x27;t feel really clean unless I can scour myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very much money and is a great way to keep clean. Much better than a loofah or any expensive spa-scrubby things I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Product as stated.  Love these for showering. Drys quickly.  Easy to pack for traveling.</li>
            <li> I bought these as gifts for stocking stuffers.  I have used these for over a year, and absolutely love them.  Much better than using a back brush...and great for applying anti-acne cleansers to back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much obsessed with these. Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. Completely gets rid of body acne, and makes me smoother than I have ever been in my life!! If you self tan you DEFINITELY need this for prep</li>
            <li> Once you get used to these things, you will not feel clean unless you have one. Great for the gym. Dries almost&lt;br /&gt;instantly in a swim suit drier - centrifuge.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves them. Especially us single folks who like to wash our own backs! I use the same one to scrub my shower with comet and it rinses so cleanly, I can use it on myself after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks now, and I can say that I&#x27;m loving the results. I have had some mild back acne (bacne) for years and nothing I tried ever did anything to get rid of it. I used bath sponges, loofahs, soap, body wash, but nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using these wash cloths, the bacne is starting to go away and my skin feel so much smoother now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-works very well&lt;br /&gt;-easy to keep clean&lt;br /&gt;-seems to last a long time (still has the same &#x27;bite&#x27; as it did on day 1 after using for 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-hard to hang on a hook when it&#x27;s brand new. Once you wet it and use it, then it will be more willing to hang. Would be a lot better if it had a little loop for hanging on a hook.&lt;br /&gt;-it is a bit rough feeling on the skin, especially on more sensitive areas. It might be hard for some people to get used to because of this, but this is also the reason that it works so well at removing dead skin and cleaning your pores.</li>
            <li> I recommend this produce. I love it !</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem back. Always a new blemish, and the resulting dark mark would take months to fade. Couldn&#x27;t wear nice tops, even had intimacy problems. Absolutely hated my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought &amp;#34;Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/towel&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Stiefel PanOxyl 10 Percent Benzoyl Peroxide Foaming Wash&amp;#34; at the same time since I saw that combination recommended in one of the reviews. That was 40 days ago. Not one blemish since then!! Just some old scarring and pixelated areas. I can&#x27;t even describe how happy this makes me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PanOxyl quickly ruined my towel though (no surprise since it has Peroxide in). I don&#x27;t care!!! Also, might be a placebo effect, but the old pixelated marks seem to be fading quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review for both products since I don&#x27;t know which one is responsible for this awesomeness. The cloth is great. It SCRUBS like no loofa or any similar product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many. Don&#x27;t even try to use it on more sensitive areas though, lol. I use this combination on my back, then switch to a milder soap and softer cloth for the rest of my body. Could probably do my feet with it too.. will try that next time. I guess the wash cloth might be a bit short for a big person. I&#x27;m a 6&#x27; female and manage okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO happy.</li>
            <li> Orginally bought,them for my wifey well now im also using them as well and they work amazing lol</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> These started out rather stiff right out of the package, but after a few uses they loosened up. The texture is perfect for exfoliation and the length is just right for scrubbing the back.  I love to use this on my back and feet. Great product!</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this washcloth for the bumps on my arms and back to be followed by the use of Amlactin lotion.  I love this washcloth even though at first it feels rough when you start using it.  I find that bunching it up and using circular motions helps reduce the rough effect.  It is a good length and very strong so it&#x27;s good for use on your back and it doesn&#x27;t fall apart.  I absorbs and distributes soap/body wash very well and once you rinse it, you can shake off the excess water and it dries very fast.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that will wake you up in the shower and make your skin feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> Ok, I think I&#x27;m getting known for writing some long reviews. I just have a lot to say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a kid I had a friend who&#x27;s mom was from Japan. She gifted me one of these wonderful cloths! I&#x27;ve been searching for something as good since!! I&#x27;m THRILLED to have found them again!!&lt;br /&gt;This is why I give it 5 stars!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to address some of the bad reviews I&#x27;ve read on here.&lt;br /&gt;1st: I have keratosis as well, someone referred to this as &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; which is just fowl (yes a joke). This woman said that she scrubbed her arms raw! This is shocking to me!! Yes everything has a learning curve!! But if you are using this for keratosis remember two things one is that you aren&#x27;t going to get rid of these bumps in one go so use much lighter pressure when you scrub! It should feel invigorating not painful!! The other thing you have to remember when dealing with keratosis is that it&#x27;s a dry skin condition! YES it needs exfoliation but when you get out of the bath/shower put on a good petroleum free cream, or oil, something stable and extremely moisturizing. Apply while the skin is still moist (I use a combination of cold pressed olive oil and organic castor oil that I mix myself all over after a bath/shower. That is my preference!) so two things about keratosis light exfoliation ( on a regular basis, preferably later in the day while your skin is in its renewal process), and a good cream moisturizer or oil after bath while skin is still moist!&lt;br /&gt;This cloth worked GREAT for me so I am so excited to have found it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd where I think this cloth is great for all over body I don&#x27;t suggest it on your face or tender areas. For these areas I prefer a washcloth!&lt;br /&gt;Gentle pressure is so important for a good result here!!! You are only trying to remove dead skin and set the healthy skin underneath free!!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this is so long.. I&#x27;ve had keratosis since I was a teen and did my time in cosmetology school so I know how skinworks..&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review helps people with this wonderful product and learn a little more about their skin!!</li>
            <li> Love this. Makes my skin feel soft and awesome. And it makes washing your back a breeze. Was able to throw away one of those scrub brushes with the arm. It got moldy, too. Been using this cloth every day for a couple of months now and it&#x27;s as good as new.</li>
            <li> I never felt really clean without using it. I mean just soap and water without this cloth isn&#x27;t efficient. My skin is smooth snd clean. Small amount of soap or geek goes a long way. Dry fast and light weight. Great product.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for scrubbing your back.  And very efficient with soap - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have used similar products for many years and love them. Recently I got a wimpy one that was a huge disappointment so tried Amazon. These are the best yet, Great for getting your back - gets rid of dead skin - you feel clean! Some have said you must use body wash but I use high quality bar soap and it works just fine. I just rinse it off and shake the water off after each shower - do not put in washer every few days as many do. These last a long time and when you want a new one, the old one can be used for household chores. So happy Amazon has these!</li>
            <li> I cant shower without these, is definitely a must have!!! I highly recommend them!!!</li>
            <li> Love these wash cloths! Have been using them for several years. MUCH better than those sponge poufs I used to use before. Better value for the money as these last a really long time. They feel a bit abrasive at first but once you get used to them you won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> (JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN [NOT in China], or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH THIS REVIEW)!&lt;br /&gt;If you DO receive a look-alike from an unscrupulous merchant and the package says &amp;#34;Made In China,&amp;#34; !SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH: ...........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They produce copious amounts of foam with small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package&#x27;s front side)...I THEN continue to use the now-shorter, &amp;#34;spent&amp;#34; cloth for house-hold scrubbing of bath-stalls, stoves, ovens, soiled pots/pans, etc. This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It usually fully-dries in less then a couple of hours when hung from its end or draped in its middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S GREAT!! (especially if you&#x27;re really dirty and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!!)</li>
            <li> Just  gotta love it. They are not like other brands soft and dont feel clean this ones do a better job. I love it!</li>
            <li> WOW, this is the best Salux that I have tried.  It&#x27;s a tight weave that feels very good to the skin and does an excellent job of hold lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous soap sacks, sisal towels, Cure Towel and this one really does top them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve glad a finally did give it a try.</li>
            <li> feel clean as if I have been at spa.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended these to me and I&#x27;ve been getting them ever since. They exfoliate well, make those hard-to-reach places scrubbable, dry very quickly and never smell, and soap up well. And each one lasts me 6 months with daily showering before getting too soft. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I gave two away of the three for Christmas. I have been using one for a while and needed to replace mine. This is wonderful for your skin. I don&#x27;t feel really clean unless I have used my cloth. It holds up better than the mesh scrunchy things. its also long enough that you can really scrub your back with it. The soap be it bar or liquid form of soap suds up really well with it. My skin especially in the winter gets really really dry this has really helped a lot get off all that extra dry skin. I also think that its helped me get rid of a little back acne I started to experience. It probably will feel a little harsh at first but it does soften up a bit after about a weeks worth of use, or you just get used to it. The two i gave away as gifts....the receivers were extremely happy with theirs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never before used something like this though I did have a luffa sponge at one time.  These are absolute fantastic. The first time I used it, my body never felt cleaner - I was squeaky clean all over. The wash towel is long enough to easily scrub your back as shown on the package. The material is holding up great and after multiple uses, I wonder if one of these will ever wear out (you receive 3.)  I like the fact that you put a little soap on the wash towel and it gets very sudsy and lasts for the whole shower.  If you like high quality soap, the Salux makes the bar last longer.  It was one of those purchases where I believe I truly got my money&#x27;s worth.  Highest recommendation!</li>
            <li> Okay but they are shorter than the one I bought from the organic health food store.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Exfoliating and will scrub your skin clean of any dirt, oils, etc.  Got my 3 pack supply and this should last a while!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth!  Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever felt cleaner, the way it cleans and scrubs your skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those of us obsessed with a good, thorough scrub down when taking a shower. Tip to save water: use a bucket; fill while letting the body get thoroughly wet; apply face wash and allow to sit; apply body wash to cloth; TURN OFF WATER leaving bucket full while you give yourself a good scrub down; rinse with bucket water and finally one more time with shower. Cuts down time and saves money! I also buy body wash by the gallon [EO Brand] which saves A LOT of money as it last for six months or more.</li>
            <li> I bought these Salux washcloths after reading about them in a beauty forum. Where have these been all my life?! I feel super clean, my skin feels silky smooth -- even my knees and elbows feel baby soft. The best part is the ability to wash my back with ease - the first time I used it, I&#x27;m sure I sounded like one of the old Herbal Essences commercials (Mmmmm! Oh! Aaaaaaah!) - it was absolutely HEAVENLY.  I highly recommend these for anyone who wants smooth, clean skin and likes a good back scrub without having to twist into yoga-like poses to reach every square inch. BONUS: The clothes rinse out like a dream and dry quickly!</li>
            <li> True skin cleaning. Not for the sensitive skin types.  Also, be gentle on your nether regions.  You&#x27;ll start a fire!!!</li>
            <li> I love them. Makes your skin feel so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My Aunt Marge was give one 20 years ago. She told me about the cloth so I searched the internet (sh has dial up) and found it on Amazon. I showed her net ands he was so happy. It&#x27;s exactly like her old one.</li>
            <li> We totally love our set of exfoliating Japanese washcloths.  Once you get used to the high level of epidermal stimulation, every shower will feel like you&#x27;ve just taken a trip to an Asian spa…except without all the public nudity and semi-sadistic spa staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, this is the best washcloth we&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s long enough to easily scrub your back as well as the rest of your body, dries easily and folds up beautifully for traveling.</li>
            <li> I love these washcloths! My skin is very soft and it takes away the black coloring that my flip flops leave behind on the heels of my feet!</li>
            <li> One day I foresee these replacing all lame wash cloths. They are amazing, and need to be more popular. Platypus.</li>
            <li> Multiple wash clothes all being high grade. Bath time just became a slightly bit more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love this wash cloth. The material is neither too soft or too rough and is perfect for total body exfoliating. The length is perfect for scrubbing your back, I hated the traditional loofah that just simply couldn&#x27;t reach around the back. Just make sure that the product you receive is made in Japan like advertised.</li>
            <li> I am being using this product for 20 years , for me it is so good that I will keeping using it until I die.if someone wants to feel clean; try</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> excellent just what I wanted</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for and work wonderfully.  I ordered the 3 blue ones but got the assorted colors instead...no big deal, love them anyway!</li>
            <li> I love these clothes!  I&#x27;ve been using them for about eight years now and I will never go back to a washcloth.  Exfoliation is very important to maintain smooth skin and it also helps with blood flow.  This cloth definitely does the trick.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by ones that claim to have the same results.  They lie!</li>
            <li> These scrub very well. I had read a website that a dermatolost recommended using these daily so I decided to try it out. More of a scrub than those bath poofs but not abrasive feeling.</li>
            <li> I love these.  Have looked all over to find them where we now live, but could not.  This was one of our regular purchases at the Asian food market we used to go to.  So glad that I found them here.  They stand up better to washing than some of the ones that you can find in pharmacies and grocery stores so keeping them nice and clean is not an issue.  They are scratchy, which is what I was looking for.  Nice to get a good back scratch when showering and the length allows for diagonal, two-handed washing, something that is really difficult with standard square washcloths.  They lather up really well and rinse out quickly and dry quickly too.  I grew up with these in the shower and I love them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that lives up to its description. I use it all over and it makes my skin super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Fast-Drying, Easy to Clean, and Great for Buffing Rough Skin!</li>
            <li> These are just amazing. I&#x27;ve had keratosis pilaris (aka Chicken Skin) on my arms ever since I was a teenager. While things like Amlactin have helped, adding the Salux clothes to my beauty routine helped even more. I actually don&#x27;t even have to use Amlactin on my arms anymore to keep my KP in check!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clothes are big enough to exfoliate hard to get spots like your back. I always hated those loofahs on a stick because they never seemed to exfoliate my back well enough and I&#x27;d still end up feeling itchy. Drove me nuts. The Salux clothes pretty much eliminated that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These dry fast and I can&#x27;t help feeling like they&#x27;re more sanitary to use than a loofah or washcloth.</li>
            <li> It is what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much dry skin I had until I used a Salux towel. The price is great and I&#x27;ll repurchase once the need arises. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing! Super exfoliating!! My skin feels like butter afterwards. Replacing my loofah with this, using once or twice a week! My new go to scrubber! Also they are huge so super easy to wash your back!</li>
            <li> Have been using these since I was a kid.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Been using these for over 14 yrs. Buying these in bulk was great! I have plenty around in the house or to give a friend to try. I swear by these for bathroom body care in the shower.</li>
            <li> Seriously... the scrubber things in most people&#x27;s showers or gross, and you cant wash your back with them.  Because these unfold, they can be rinsed out well, and hung flat to avoid mildew.  I can wash my back without turning into a pretzel.  These are also scratchy.  Some people will consider this a negative, but I dont,  I feel like I get far cleaner using this... but it did take a little time to get used to the feeling.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time&lt;br /&gt;the cloth is thicker keeps its rough texture far longer then other brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Worth trying out!</li>
            <li> Bought then before and loved them so much, that they are  going  to be given to guests when they are with us.</li>
            <li> Item as described, very fast shipper, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these! Really does a fabulous job of exfoliating your skin gently, without doing any damage or being painful. Leaves your skin soft and smooth. I am buying more for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth.  Salux makes it feel like you have new skin.  The more you use it, the better your skin will look.  It also makes it easier for the skin to absorb whatever you put on after washing.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning back and exfoliating skin. Have been using for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Exfoliation successful!</li>
            <li> It was what I had expected, very happy with this product, just like the ones I&#x27;m used to back in the island&#x27;s.... :)</li>
            <li> These cloths are great.  They do a great job of exfolliating and rinse out easily.</li>
            <li> These are amazing for exfoliation!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these I&#x27;ve been using them for years and will never go back to a wash cloth or body sponge</li>
            <li> This woven nylon shower or bath scrubbing cloth can be folded up or used long to scrub the back in those hard to reach places. It’s really good for scrubbing (and exfoliating) all over, it foams up easily with a small amount of soap, rinses easily and completely, and dries quickly. It folds up small. It can be machine washed (but not dried!) and is very hard-wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s simpler, more hygienic and easier to pack than a brush or loofah. It can’t unravel like those pouffe things. I bought mine out of curiosity, and I’m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning - it&#x27;s quite rough, so go gentle. It very invigorating!</li>
            <li> Love these wash towels I have used them since i was 13 and got one in a hawaiian grocery store</li>
            <li> Item is as described. No problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a nylon bath sponge for years, thinking it was helping my skin, but I read about another buffing cloth on line so started investigating.  The other buffing cloth was very expensive and had mixed reviews on Amazon, but I started reading about the Salux Nylon cloths and decided to try it.  I could tell an immediate difference in my skin after using the Salux.  The ones I received were made in Japan, not China, and look like they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love these gentle exfoliating cleansing cloths.They leave skin so smooth and clear. They are not expensive, but are very effective.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Product is just as described. I purchased a similar Earth Therapeutics product a while ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find a replacement in stores locally. I like these as a more hygienic and more versatile alternative to loofas, washcloths, and bath poofs.</li>
            <li> The  best Skin Bath Wash Towels I have ever used.  They were expedited quickly. I will be looking forward to buying from you again.</li>
            <li> Works great! They are large enough to easily and quickly wash my back. They keep their texture well with use. I used to pay three times as much for Dermologica cloths like this.</li>
            <li> These were bought as a gift because my patents really liked the one I left while visiting.  They last forever and can be washed.  I&#x27;ve used some copycats and they stayed fraying but these are still going strong.  They definitely exfoliate and might be a little too rough for delicate areas.</li>
            <li> These are genuine high quality Japanese wash cloths. Very durable and effective. They really suds up and scrub very well.</li>
            <li> These are cool. I don&#x27;t understand them, but they seem effective. Very abrasive, but it feels so right.</li>
            <li> Never mind exfoliation, these things are the best way there ever was to relieve really bad itching!!  Fingernails, back scratchers and such will damage skin.  These cloths do not.  Scrub the itching area (hard) with one of these cloths (dry) and itching is relieved for a long time without damage to skin.  Blissful relief!!!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these from CVS years ago and they stopped selling them. I kept mine for about 5 years before it completely started to fall apart; luckily I was able to find replacements online. If you want baby soft, clean skin, this is the product for you. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for those with sensitive skin, however, as it may be too abrasive.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of exfoliating.  It definitely is somewhat rough but that is what needs to be to do the job.  Soap lathers well and the cloth is long enough to use on you back.  Rinses clean quickly under running water.</li>
            <li> These wash cloths are thick and amazing, well worth the price!  You can get cheapo versions at Target or Walmart that cost $1.99, but those are thin and poorly made, always fall apart within a few weeks, coming unraveled and getting stray threads everywhere.  These are worth the money, because they last forever and they&#x27;re not too rough on your skin while still giving you that scrubbed clean feeling.</li>
            <li> i cant even explain how wonderful these make your skin feel. just buy them and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since I first saw one in 1976, and they&#x27;re absolutely the best &amp;#34;washcloth&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever found.  They&#x27;re rough enough to exfoliate, but soft enough to feel very comfortable.  And it&#x27;s really, really easy to rinse it completely clean.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I use it after a long soak in the tub and my skin feels so much better. It got rid of the small red bumps on the back of my thighs too after a few uses. Make sure you use lotion after because of the opportunity for it to soak in better.</li>
            <li> looooooove these, they lather so well, great long length, and extremely well made. Also one of the best exfoliators I&#x27;ve used because most are not that course and I have dry skin, so I need a good scrub. DO NOT use on your face fyi, even if you think you are putting little to no pressure. I left my face scrub at home once and thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll just give it a light swipe with this cloth over my cleanser&amp;#34; nope. nope. nope. Don&#x27;t do it. But great for exfoliating before shaving and really helps my skin absorb moisturizers after my shower. Will definitely buy again, and wont order any other brand.</li>
            <li> They work, they&#x27;re more sanitary and easier to carry than a loofah, and they can be air or towel dried. Worth it, especially where it&#x27;s hot, and clean pores allow one to sweat. (By the way, mosquitoes are more attracted to the smell of unwashed skin than they are to washed--or so I&#x27;ve read.)</li>
            <li> The absolute best thing I have ever run cross my back.</li>
            <li> Arrived couple days before the expected date, product as described. My last Salux towel must have been a Chinese knock off it didn&#x27;t look like my last set and lasted only a few weeks. Glad to have the original again.</li>
            <li> Just what I was expecting. Beautiful !!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic for exfoliation during daily showers.</li>
            <li> After all the communication with users, posting Q&#x27;s in the Q &amp; A&#x27;s and reading highly rated reviews, I would LOVE to give this product ZERO stars. I cannot understand the 3-5 star reviews???!?!?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I utilized the product gently for &amp;#34;CHICKEN SKIN&amp;#34; on sides of my arms.  After one week of use, the chicken skin and breaks outs on sides of my arms got out of control and waaaay worse.  They are ALL still trying to heal. I also got some type of arm bend area break out different from the chicken skin, like hives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw the first, of three cloths, in the trash.  The other two just sit (brand new) in my hallway closet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I forgot to mention that this product also left scars on my arms. Top elbow area same spot on both arms and one on my cheek.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with these. Scrubbing your back is very easy. The material is rough, but not too rough. Great to scrub dead skin off. Feels great like a total body scratch down. Will be buying more when they wear out. I&#x27;m still using the first one and it&#x27;s been about 3 months.</li>
            <li> I wasn’t sure I was going to like using these bath towel although I really do love have they make my skin feel. They have a rough texture so it&#x27;s like exfoliating your skin with every wash.</li>
            <li> stocking stuffers. They work great, last forever and the package is funny.</li>
            <li> Simple but great product.  Dries fast and completely between uses.  After one use, a normal human being will ask himself how he got along without it.  Therefore, it makes a universal gift.</li>
            <li> Gives you a grat wash! I like how it feels like a back rub!!</li>
            <li> I have used these for ~2 years now and will continue to do so. The size is great which makes it easy to scrub your back.&lt;br /&gt;These get used until they start to &#x27;thread up.&#x27; Highly recommended.</li>
