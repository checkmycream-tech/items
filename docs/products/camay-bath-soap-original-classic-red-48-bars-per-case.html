            <li>This order says it was made in the USA, so quality is much better.</li>
            <li>Change is not always for the better.</li>
            <li>I have used this soap for many years now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a soapy film.</li>

            <li>Thank you for the quick delivery of Camay Bath Soap, Original.....</li>
            <li>I recently rediscovered Camay when someone gave me a bar, and I tried it, wondering if it was still as good as it was</li>
            <li>Loved this soap since I was a kid but can&#x27;t find it locally, so ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness it is available on Amazon in a reasonable quantity.  </li>
            <li>Very close to the original.</li>
            <li>Camay is misleading customers by calling it \\&quot;Original Classic Red\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Glad to have Camay soap which is not available in most stores.  </li>
            <li>but we&#x27;re through our first bar already.   </li>
            <li>When the local stores stopped stocking it I was glad to find another source.</li>
            <li>the product was exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li>This is not the original lightly-fragranced, soft scent.</li>
            <li>My 81 year old Mother has used this product for most of her adult life, and is distressed that she can no longer find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The wrapper indicates it is from Mexico with Spanish being the primary language.  </li>
            <li>I have really missed this soap and have spent more $ than I should because I couldn&#x27;t&lt;</li>
            <li>and it turn out to be the Original Classic Red as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>live in fear they will stop making it!  </li>
            <li>They must have standardized this funky formula internationally as &#x27;classic&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to all my friends and anyone who uses camay soap.</li>
            <li>She never used anything else, and she had skin like a baby, so I am not surprised to read about other users loving it for their skin and using it for years.</li>
            <li>Did not see that other camay products were available.</li>
            <li>The picture indicates the 3 bath bars like is normally sold - This is some other kind of soap loosely thrown &amp; sealed into a bag.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Camay soap because I moved to a new city and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>As this product is also produced outside of the US (if not exclusively now with US companies all getting away from union extortion, high taxes and tariffs), I used to be able to purchase the Latin American version that had the original scent at dollar stores, but I haven&#x27;t seen it around lately, just the red packages.</li>
            <li>The soap seems old.</li>
            <li>My wife has used this for years and her skin is unbelievably soft.  </li>
            <li>No CAMAY marked on the bar of soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also long lasting in the shower and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>As a young adult, I tried all sorts of other soaps but always came back to Camay.  </li>
            <li>Too bad, because the original pink was a multi-generational favorite in my family going back to the 1940s.</li>

            <li> Camay soap has been a staple in my life for a long time! It&#x27;s a wonderful product that should be put back on store shelves. It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a soapy film.</li>
            <li> Since losing a local source for Camay soap, I was unable to purchase it locally. This purchase was a great buy at about $1 a bar. 54 bars is a lot of soap but we&#x27;re through our first bar already.   This was a very positive transaction (excellent value, prompt shipping with substantial packaging)and I am pleased with it.  Tom Stelter</li>
            <li> My grandmother has been gone a long time now, but I still remember that \\&quot;red\\&quot; bar in her bathroom. She never used anything else, and she had skin like a baby, so I am not surprised to read about other users loving it for their skin and using it for years. I recently rediscovered Camay when someone gave me a bar, and I tried it, wondering if it was still as good as it was all those years Grandma used it. It is. We can still get it here, but I&#x27;m not surprised that Amazon, where you can find everything else, still carries it. That&#x27;s good to know in case my supplier quits.</li>
            <li> Camay has changed their formula, and if you love Camay for the way it USED to smell, you will be disappointed with the new odor. I call it odor because it is unpleasant and over-perfumed. Camay is misleading customers by calling it \\&quot;Original Classic Red\\&quot;. This is not the original lightly-fragranced, soft scent.

            <li> Could not find this soap at any of the local stores.  I have been using Camay forever and it was great finding it online.  I wonder if it will still be available after I finish the 48 bars!!</li>
            <li> I have really missed this soap and have spent more $ than I should because I couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt; find it.  Glad I could find this online.</li>
            <li> the product was exactly what i wanted.  the time it took to get here was done as stated by shipper.  i was suprised to have the soap sent to the post office (pleasantly)!</li>
            <li> Have never had a bad experience with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery is great.&lt;br /&gt;Products great.&lt;br /&gt;Very helpful in finding what you want.</li>
            <li> Loved this soap since I was a kid but can&#x27;t find it locally, so ordered from Amazon. It has a great smell, makes plenty of lather and leaves you feeling clean and refreshed. It&#x27;s also long lasting in the shower and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> We have been using Camay soap for years.  We can&#x27;t buy it in stores anymore.  Great soap.  The soap for beautiful women!</li>
            <li> I ordered Camay soap because I moved to a new city and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. Only one store sold it where I came from and each six hour trip back I would stock up. I was about to run out so I ordered from this company through Amazon and it was delivered the very next day and cheaper than I could buy it in a store!    This soap is wonderful, I&#x27;ve used it for years and I&#x27;m 60! You can&#x27;t miss with this product or this company.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick delivery of Camay Bath Soap, Original.....last time I ordered Camay it was the International version and I was not happy with the soap.  It had a oily residue and unpleasant odor.  This order says it was made in the USA, so quality is much better.</li>
            <li> With this harshly scented soap, I felt as though I was bathing with a bar of Felz Naptha, highly scented to hide it&#x27;s low quality. As this product is also produced outside of the US (if not exclusively now with US companies all getting away from union extortion, high taxes and tariffs), I used to be able to purchase the Latin American version that had the original scent at dollar stores, but I haven&#x27;t seen it around lately, just the red packages. They must have standardized this funky formula internationally as &#x27;classic&#x27;. Too bad, because the original pink was a multi-generational favorite in my family going back to the 1940s. Change is not always for the better.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it is not one of those international version of the soap and it turn out to be the Original Classic Red as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Great Soap.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap since I was a little girl.  It was sold in the stores until 2006.  It was getting harder and harder to find until I found it on amazon.  Thank you for caring this soap.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in the product. The soap seems old. Would not purchase again. Did not see that other camay products were available.</li>
            <li> What I recieved was not Camay b ut some knockoff- no triangle cut into bar -no camay name on bar- wrong color- not 3 pak box as shown but single wrapped bars  with multiple languages lable. No return lable enclosed or I would have sent it back!</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for years and her skin is unbelievably soft.  good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for many years now. It seems to be the only one that does not break me out. I would recommend it, however, I can no longer find it in stores so I order through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Glad to have Camay soap which is not available in most stores.  Very close to the original.</li>
            <li> Will always use this brand</li>
            <li> The delivery service was excellent and the product met all expectations. I would highly recommend this product to all my friends and anyone who uses camay soap.</li>
            <li> My 81 year old Mother has used this product for most of her adult life, and is distressed that she can no longer find it in the stores. Thank goodness it is available on Amazon in a reasonable quantity.  It was delivered to her as promised, timely and in good condition.  She was delighted.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment of a great product at a great price!!  Shipment arrived earlier than promised and was in perfect condition and exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> WE PREFER CAMAY AND WHEN P &amp; G DISCONTINUED IT, WE SEARCHED SEVERAL RETAILERS AND FINALLY AMAZON UNTIL WE FOUND A SOURCE. WE JUST DID NOT AGREE TO CHANGE OUR BRAND OF BAR SOAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PURCHASE ( WHEN ADDED TO PREVIOUS PURCHASES ) SHOULD BE ENOUGH CAMAY TO LAST US FOR LIFE.</li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t find it in the store so I went to mine and bought up the bars on the shelf. Then they didn&#x27;t replace them so I had to go to Amazon. Now mom and her sister have the soap they swear by, Camay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase of Camay bath soap.</li>
            <li> The stores in my area have stopped carrying Camay soap.  I still keep an eye out for it at my local stores.  I have very sensitive skin.  My parents discovered Camay would not cause rashes or breakouts.  As a young adult, I tried all sorts of other soaps but always came back to Camay.  Two years ago, my daughter bought a case of Camay soap for me through Amazon. I am thrilled to be able to buy it by the case through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This soap is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Have used it forever....live in fear they will stop making it!  Always the perfect soap for me!  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was delighted to see that I could buy Camay soap on Amazon.com.   I have been looking all over for the Camay soap.  I was afraid I would never wash again, HaHaHa.</li>
            <li> There is no way to get back to this seller to complain; Item is not as shown; bought case which 48 bars individually thrown into box. This is NOT CAMAY that I received. The picture indicates the 3 bath bars like is normally sold - This is some other kind of soap loosely thrown &amp; sealed into a bag.  No CAMAY marked on the bar of soap. Cannot return. STUCK! I have allergies &amp; can only use Camay. This does not smell like Camay nor are the ingredients the same as listed on my &amp;#34;REAL&amp;#34; Camay soap.  Had no tracking from this seller no communication at all. Soap appeared in 2 weeks in a busted up box with all these individual bars just thrown in there. The wrapper indicates it is from Mexico with Spanish being the primary language.  FAKE FAKE FAKE!!  Somebody help me!!</li>
            <li> I grew up on Camay and I love it! It is now made in Mexico and smells slightly different than in the past. I like the &#x27;original&#x27; Camay as shown in the picture.</li>
