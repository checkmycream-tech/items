            <li> Good coverage and moisture.</li>
            <li> Second foundation I ever bought in my life.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation on a daily basis and I never wore foundation in my life because I have good skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, as I am now getting older I am seeing some sunspots popping up so I bought the foundation to wear only when I have to go out to a special occasion- to give me that flawless look.  I applied it with my fingers which worked out well but next time I would try using a make-up sponge since I think it would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and that&#x27;s why I bought this because it&#x27;s a cream foundation. It didn&#x27;t help much with my dry skin but I do have really dry skin and that is why I moisturized before applying. I did use the L&#x27;oreal powder after and then spayed with 10YEARS YOUNGER MAKE UP FINISH which did help ease/ get rid of the dryness. (Note I do have really dry skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product, and so far I like the L&#x27;oreal brand. I  will keep using it on special occasions because it looked great and natural and did give me the flawless look!</li>
            <li> I really like the product a lot and I am sadded to hear this product is to be discontinued</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery !!! I would buy it again...</li>
            <li> This product arrived in horrible condition. Both containers I order were scratched on the outside, they looked already used.. the inside was not smooth like seen in pictures (i&#x27;ve purchased these before not online and it&#x27;s a wonderful product) Love the product when purchased and used it before. Clearly disappointing when opening containers and both were half filled looked as if they were samples or previously used. I will be sending back.</li>
            <li> Wonderful non-drying oil control foundation, light yet provides good, natural cover.</li>
            <li> I just received my order- it absolutely is not what I ordered... I received Almay Wake-Up liquid makeup -energizing caffeine ... and I order L&#x27;Oreal Paris Visible Repair foundation- sand beige.  I tried to send an email about this but it keeps coming back with a send error... Calling was useless as well. I am extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> Not really happy w/this product.  I do use the same makeup but had never ordered it b4.  The color was darker than the same color code at the drug store and when I opened it all the makeup was stuck to the lid and none left in the jar.  I had to scrape it out of the lid and put it back in the jar.  Not nice and smooth now so harder to use.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this foundation so far. The coverage is great and it stays on throughout the day.  The color is perfect. The sand color is usually my best match and this one did not disappoint,  no orangey tone to it. I have already purchased a second time. I have only worn it in winter weather, my only concern is that it might be too greasy for hot weather. Time will tell I guess.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s third one she loves it!</li>
            <li> The color perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product and was so happy to have found it online for a lower price than in the store.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this make up.  I apply it with a foundation brush.  I goes on very smooth and blends great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic price for a product I could not get in stores anymore..</li>
            <li> Perfect for my complexion.</li>
            <li> I use this makeup foundation exclusively.  Goes on smoothly, lasts a long time, perfect shade for me.  Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I expected.  The way it was shipped it ended up a bit of a mess inside the container.  I don&#x27;t know if this could have been avoided.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple different brand name foundations similar to \\&quot;L&#x27;Oreal Visible Lift repair\\&quot; and they didn&#x27;t come close to L&#x27;Oreals&#x27; compact foundation, it has great coverage and it feels light and goes on smoothly and evenly. The other brands don&#x27;t go on as well. I am glad there are reviews on the products, because they are very informative and it was easier to make a decision to purchase because of their remarks. I would recommend this product to anyone! Thank you so much.</li>
