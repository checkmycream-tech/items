            <li>THANK YOU AMAZON FOR MAKING HIS LIFE BETTER ,</li>
            <li>I do recommend it mostly as a gift.</li>
            <li>The scent gets even better the longer someone wears it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am wearing this fragrance as I write this review, with my colleagues in the office breathing over my shoulder as we all enjoy this rich and sweet air...a good one!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This cologne is a favorite of my husband.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it again.</li>
            <li>Cuba Gold is the best smelling cologne ever for only 6 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Everyone i went to said they love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>If you like one of these colognes you are sure to like the others because I sure have.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love the smell of this cologne.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this scent.  </li>
            <li>We both love how it smells</li>
            <li>Ordered this item many times with no problem...</li>
            <li>Love potion.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging that the perfume sits in.</li>
            <li>Cute stocking stuffer and</li>
            <li>I suggest get many because people will ask for one.</li>
            <li>&amp; I went ahead to order more.</li>
            <li>To me it smells like powdery floral soap, mellow and lovely.</li>
            <li>We love Cuba gold</li>
            <li>I love it on my husband.</li>
            <li>I think this the best you can get in Amazon with similar price range.</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unique looking.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember where I originally got it, but I always liked the scent.</li>
            <li>Clever packaging and great gift for the guys.</li>
            <li>Love the scent &amp; the size of it makes it easy to carry anywhere</li>
            <li>A great smelling alternative to the popular Le Male cologne at a fraction of the price!  </li>
            <li>This is light &amp; very comfortable for</li>
            <li>A clean woodsy smell that is not over the top or to timber smelling.  </li>
            <li>The cologne smells good-- not the super-best men&#x27;s cologne, but nice enough.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume it smells great and stays on long</li>
            <li>like a fine Cuban the Cuba Gold&#x27;s aroma is just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my father will love his Father&#x27;s Day gift &amp; will definitely order more!</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>It really is  a light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy smelling myself throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>so I seen that amazon has it really cheap on sale..</li>
            <li>Cheap Price.</li>
            <li>Its my pleasure that they liked the product which does not cost much.</li>
            <li>Packaging is kinda cool and fits easily in a drawer.</li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d love a cheap scent so much!</li>
            <li>highly recommend it, though keep in mind everyone has their own tastes/preferences and may not like it.</li>
            <li>My mom says it reminds her of a rich doctors cologne.</li>
            <li>I get regular compliments saying it smells nice!</li>
            <li>Cuba Gold is a good cheap fragrance to have just for a back up or a go to before stepping out of the house.</li>
            <li>Despite it not being an overpowering scent it does last for a fair amount of time.  </li>
            <li>It does smell good but the smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I think it would be good gift if your budget is very low.  </li>
            <li>It also smells fresh, minty, clean, and almost soapy.</li>
            <li>It came in quickly.</li>
            <li>I guess it smells kind of woodsy and warm, and on me the scent lingers for a few hours.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the quality of the product and timely shipping very much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparently he had it before and was glad to receive a new one.</li>
            <li>For the cheap price, I really like this cologne for men.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, but last 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>It has a nice deep sandalwood and spicy smell.</li>
            <li>The container is pretty cool also.</li>
            <li>Some may avoid this because of the cheap price but you definitely get more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>your looking for a nice sweet sharp smelling cologne that last a long time and stays on your body get this because it is truly perfect</li>
            <li>These fragrances are simply the best as far as scent and last I power .</li>
            <li>First off, the value alone makes this worth buying.</li>
            <li>Was found for the first time at a gas station and now cannot do without it.</li>
            <li>I first received a bottle of this cologne as a birthday gift four years ago.</li>
            <li>home?&lt;br /&gt;;)~</li>
            <li>Bought it as a present and the person enjoyed</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>If you love a scent thats perfect for not only casual wear but for fancy occasions this the scent for you.</li>
            <li>They usually spray out pretty good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like a sexy smell but good for casual wear.  </li>
            <li>At first, they thought it was a real tabacco until I had to show them it was \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;.   </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but it does wear off pretty fast.</li>
            <li>this smells pretty decent...  </li>
            <li>Overall, it has a fun look, great smell but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>It has crisp smell and is a good purchase given its low cost when compared to the other branded perfumes.</li>
            <li>I like to keep cologne at the ready, for when I am around females.   </li>
            <li>VERY WELL  </li>
            <li>Cuba cologne has an pleasantly unusual scent for men.  </li>
            <li>Everytime I wear this out with my girlfriend, she always has to stay real close to me.</li>
            <li>It is made for a man, but as a woman I really dig it.</li>
            <li>my wife didn&#x27;t believe me when I told her how much I payed for it.</li>
            <li>It definitely smells VERY similar to Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier (which would cost 5x more!!).</li>
            <li>The cologne is not loud at all, it is soft and more like a musk.</li>
            <li>Cigar smell and sweet vanilla mixed together.....</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this perfume as a purse or post work out spray.</li>
            <li>and women, as well as some men who aren&#x27;t(not judging here), will be attracted to you... for the cheap price not only you won&#x27;t smell like some cheap tourist while being fondled by TSA, but it can almost compete with way more expensive stuff...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it smells like one of the high end designer fragrances.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne, it goes anywhere with me considering its shaped like a cigar, and comes in a little tin just incase</li>
            <li>nobody wants to be near to me after use this</li>
            <li>dont last too long but its ok for the price ... try it</li>
            <li>strength of the cologne is not so strong but enough for people to smell it with only one spray.</li>
            <li>I first tried this about 7 years ago when my younger brother had some.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with Le Male Cologne by Jean Paul Gaultier, it is somewhat similar to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love that it is in a small package so he can try it before he spends a lot of money on it.....</li>
            <li>Smells great and is a lot bigger than expected about 7-8 inches long shipped fast and came undamaged definitely will be buying again in the future</li>
            <li>I enjoy this cologne on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li>Smells soft - my 2 son&#x27;s wanted this, plus they like that</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not an overbearing cologn for guys - it&#x27;s soft - my husband uses it too.</li>
            <li>There is a slight sweet jasmine smell like the cologne could be unisex, but then it has a wood-like scent that makes it masculine.  </li>
            <li>It has a classic fresh scent to it but also has a little musk in it.</li>
            <li>I actually love the cologne smell and had bought the bigger version of this but also three small ones for the car and Computer case and what not and not a one of them sprays.</li>
            <li>Smells a little like a sweet vanilla tobacco and coco smell to it.</li>
            <li>About 4 of these bottles &#x3D; 1 Normal size of a standard cologne.</li>
            <li>Not sweet or musky just aromatic and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance last long, which was important because my husband is extremely active.</li>
            <li>it smells amazing like expensive stuff .</li>
            <li>Good price and the ladies go crazy over it</li>

            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am wearing this fragrance as I write this review, with my colleagues in the office breathing over my shoulder as we all enjoy this rich and sweet air...a good one!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a favorite of my husband.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> Cuba Gold is the best smelling cologne ever for only 6 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Everyone i went to said they love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> If you like one of these colognes you are sure to like the others because I sure have.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love the smell of this cologne.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this scent.  </li>
            <li> We both love how it smells</li>
            <li> Ordered this item many times with no problem...</li>
            <li> Love potion.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging that the perfume sits in.</li>
            <li> Cute stocking stuffer and</li>
            <li> I suggest get many because people will ask for one.</li>
            <li> &amp; I went ahead to order more.</li>
            <li> To me it smells like powdery floral soap, mellow and lovely.</li>
            <li> We love Cuba gold</li>
            <li> I love it on my husband.</li>
            <li> I think this the best you can get in Amazon with similar price range.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very unique looking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember where I originally got it, but I always liked the scent.</li>
            <li> Clever packaging and great gift for the guys.</li>
            <li> Love the scent &amp; the size of it makes it easy to carry anywhere</li>
            <li> A great smelling alternative to the popular Le Male cologne at a fraction of the price!  </li>
            <li> This is light &amp; very comfortable for</li>
            <li> A clean woodsy smell that is not over the top or to timber smelling.  </li>
            <li> The cologne smells good-- not the super-best men&#x27;s cologne, but nice enough.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it smells great and stays on long</li>
            <li> like a fine Cuban the Cuba Gold&#x27;s aroma is just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my father will love his Father&#x27;s Day gift &amp; will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> It really is  a light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy smelling myself throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> so I seen that amazon has it really cheap on sale..</li>
            <li> Cheap Price.</li>
            <li> Its my pleasure that they liked the product which does not cost much.</li>
            <li> Packaging is kinda cool and fits easily in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d love a cheap scent so much!</li>
            <li> highly recommend it, though keep in mind everyone has their own tastes/preferences and may not like it.</li>
            <li> My mom says it reminds her of a rich doctors cologne.</li>
            <li> I get regular compliments saying it smells nice!</li>
            <li> Cuba Gold is a good cheap fragrance to have just for a back up or a go to before stepping out of the house.</li>
            <li> Despite it not being an overpowering scent it does last for a fair amount of time.  </li>
            <li> It does smell good but the smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I think it would be good gift if your budget is very low.  </li>
            <li> It also smells fresh, minty, clean, and almost soapy.</li>
            <li> It came in quickly.</li>
            <li> I guess it smells kind of woodsy and warm, and on me the scent lingers for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the quality of the product and timely shipping very much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently he had it before and was glad to receive a new one.</li>
            <li> For the cheap price, I really like this cologne for men.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but last 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It has a nice deep sandalwood and spicy smell.</li>
            <li> The container is pretty cool also.</li>
            <li> Some may avoid this because of the cheap price but you definitely get more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> your looking for a nice sweet sharp smelling cologne that last a long time and stays on your body get this because it is truly perfect</li>
            <li> These fragrances are simply the best as far as scent and last I power .</li>
            <li> First off, the value alone makes this worth buying.</li>
            <li> Was found for the first time at a gas station and now cannot do without it.</li>
            <li> I first received a bottle of this cologne as a birthday gift four years ago.</li>
            <li> home?&lt;br /&gt;;)~</li>
            <li> Bought it as a present and the person enjoyed</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> If you love a scent thats perfect for not only casual wear but for fancy occasions this the scent for you.</li>
            <li> They usually spray out pretty good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a sexy smell but good for casual wear.  </li>
            <li> At first, they thought it was a real tabacco until I had to show them it was \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;.   </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but it does wear off pretty fast.</li>
            <li> this smells pretty decent...  </li>
            <li> Overall, it has a fun look, great smell but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It has crisp smell and is a good purchase given its low cost when compared to the other branded perfumes.</li>
            <li> I like to keep cologne at the ready, for when I am around females.   </li>
            <li> VERY WELL  </li>
            <li> Cuba cologne has an pleasantly unusual scent for men.  </li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this out with my girlfriend, she always has to stay real close to me.</li>
            <li> It is made for a man, but as a woman I really dig it.</li>
            <li> my wife didn&#x27;t believe me when I told her how much I payed for it.</li>
            <li> It definitely smells VERY similar to Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier (which would cost 5x more!!).</li>
            <li> The cologne is not loud at all, it is soft and more like a musk.</li>
            <li> Cigar smell and sweet vanilla mixed together.....</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this perfume as a purse or post work out spray.</li>
            <li> and women, as well as some men who aren&#x27;t(not judging here), will be attracted to you... for the cheap price not only you won&#x27;t smell like some cheap tourist while being fondled by TSA, but it can almost compete with way more expensive stuff...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it smells like one of the high end designer fragrances.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, it goes anywhere with me considering its shaped like a cigar, and comes in a little tin just incase</li>
            <li> nobody wants to be near to me after use this</li>
            <li> dont last too long but its ok for the price ... try it</li>
            <li> strength of the cologne is not so strong but enough for people to smell it with only one spray.</li>
            <li> I first tried this about 7 years ago when my younger brother had some.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re familiar with Le Male Cologne by Jean Paul Gaultier, it is somewhat similar to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love that it is in a small package so he can try it before he spends a lot of money on it.....</li>
            <li> Smells great and is a lot bigger than expected about 7-8 inches long shipped fast and came undamaged definitely will be buying again in the future</li>
            <li> I enjoy this cologne on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li> Smells soft - my 2 son&#x27;s wanted this, plus they like that</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not an overbearing cologn for guys - it&#x27;s soft - my husband uses it too.</li>
            <li> There is a slight sweet jasmine smell like the cologne could be unisex, but then it has a wood-like scent that makes it masculine.  </li>
            <li> It has a classic fresh scent to it but also has a little musk in it.</li>
            <li> I actually love the cologne smell and had bought the bigger version of this but also three small ones for the car and Computer case and what not and not a one of them sprays.</li>
            <li> Smells a little like a sweet vanilla tobacco and coco smell to it.</li>
            <li> About 4 of these bottles &#x3D; 1 Normal size of a standard cologne.</li>
            <li> Not sweet or musky just aromatic and fresh.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance last long, which was important because my husband is extremely active.</li>
            <li> it smells amazing like expensive stuff .</li>
            <li> Good price and the ladies go crazy over it</li>
            <li> This is not very expensive but is not a cheap product.</li>
            <li> Two of them said the smell last long enough.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> The smell does not last too long, but for the price can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the only other thing in the box was a ton of Styrofoam peanuts.</li>
            <li> i would give five stars but the delivery took long time .</li>
            <li> But in the long run.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give this product 4/5 is because it seems to last only a few hours.  </li>
            <li> The scent carries a long way.</li>
            <li> Smell does not last long but should be expected for cologne under 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was everything expected.</li>
            <li> I got an empty bottle...</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> worth a buy and blind buy it if you like vanilla,powdery, tobacco scents</li>
            <li> Just like I expected to smell.</li>
            <li> I have got it for few of my friends living in different geographical location.</li>
            <li> Will be trying the other ones</li>
            <li> Brand new in the package, wasn&#x27;t broken or leaking from shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really worth it.</li>
            <li> I live with a person that has a sensitive nose and they have not had anything bad to say about it......</li>
            <li> Cuba Gold is a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> An empty freakin&#x27; bottle!!!</li>
            <li> Smells manly, scent lasts a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I just broke the tops off and dumped em in an empty perry ellis bottle... seriously.</li>
            <li> It last about 1 hour, leaving not even a faint smell..</li>
            <li> This is one of the few places I can still find this for my husband!</li>
            <li> Crazy to be such an inexpensive cologne</li>
            <li> (My purchase must have a slow leak, because the box &amp; wrapping it came in smell divine as well)&lt;br</li>
            <li> but these are no good.</li>
            <li> i sprayed a little on my chest and had people to smell ( yes know awkward place).</li>
            <li> arrived in the mail broken.</li>
            <li> Very subtle.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the poor rating, but you can&#x27;t rate what you didn&#x27;t receive.</li>
            <li> I tried to find it in the US but was unable to do so.</li>
            <li> Then leave a faint smell on my shirt for days and days..</li>
            <li> Sad to say won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I recommend that you purchase this colonge, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The spraying cap was damaged upon arrival im a lil disappointed in that</li>
            <li> terrible !!!</li>
            <li> , what&#x27;s the worst that can happen, a skunk follow you</li>

            <li> Perfect..just as described</li>
            <li> i would give five stars but the delivery took long time . it smells amazing like expensive stuff . dont last too long but its ok for the price ... try it</li>
            <li> bought it for son.  he loves it and I think it smells great. wish the women&#x27;s fragrance of this was just as good.</li>
            <li> A student of mine from Spain wore this delightful smelling aftershave. I tried to find it in the US but was unable to do so. Found it on Amazon and bought 4 tubes of it to give as gifts. It is wonderful smelling.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic. It has a nice deep sandalwood and spicy smell. I could not be happier. Cuba house will get my repeat business</li>
            <li> Been using Cuba Gold for years, in my opinion it is the best of the fragrancies.  Not sweet or musky just aromatic and fresh.  Very subtle.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was everything expected.</li>
            <li> It has a classic fresh scent to it but also has a little musk in it. For the price it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> smells great, came in great packaging and in good condition. Brand new in the package, wasn&#x27;t broken or leaking from shipping.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have over a dozen colognes. This cologne smells 100% identical to Jean Paul Gaultier.. I purschased this for the price. I own a car wash. I often like to smell good. How ever. Spraying my John Paul at $80 a bottle was killing me. So a worker brought this for me. I was in shock at how close it smells to my Jean Paul Gaultier.. So I purschased 10 More. How ever. I wish I never did. Keep in mind it&#x27;s 5 bucks. But also john paul is a lot more liquid inside. About 4 of these bottles &#x3D; 1 Normal size of a standard cologne. So I spray this on. I work inside and outside. It last about 1 hour, leaving not even a faint smell.. It&#x27;s as if I didnt spray anything at all. Most of my good colognes.. Curve, Aqua Geo, gucci.. Will last a while a day ever.. Then leave a faint smell on my shirt for days and days.. This cologne will not last. So it smells great for about 45 min. An hour nothing.. So keep this in mind before buying. Yes the price is great. But in the long run. It&#x27;s not really worth it.</li>
            <li> This cologne has been one of my best go to options for a couple of years now, it is a light appealing scent that most women love smelling.&lt;br /&gt;I had one lady friend who even stated that I smelled like &amp;#34;an angel&amp;#34;.  Despite it not being an overpowering scent it does last for a fair amount of time.  One of the best (if not the best) value cologne&#x27;s you can buy!</li>
            <li> Smells manly, scent lasts a few hours.  The silver case is made of aluminum, solidly built.  For around 5 bucks, this is a steal.  I like to keep cologne at the ready, for when I am around females.   Cigar smell and sweet vanilla mixed together..... is the only way to describe this Cologne.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d love a cheap scent so much! Fabulous to smell, it gives an amazing bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> Arrived on time! Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> Did no like the scent at all. I give it 4 stars because perfumes and colonges are subjective. It came in quickly. I found it to be very musky and heavy.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, and am pleased with the item. The cigar-like packaging is so cute! The cologne smells good-- not the super-best men&#x27;s cologne, but nice enough. I would definitely buy it again, &#x27;cause guys would get a kick out of it! Even comes in a silver tube… like a fine cigar!</li>
            <li> Smells great and is a lot bigger than expected about 7-8 inches long shipped fast and came undamaged definitely will be buying again in the future</li>
            <li> If you love a scent thats perfect for not only casual wear but for fancy occasions this the scent for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance as one of the gifts for my husband&#x27;s birthday. He loves it. It has an intoxicating scent. I found myself sniffing my husband. The fragrance last long, which was important because my husband is extremely active. I recommend that you purchase this colonge, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Cant beat this cologne for the price! Was found for the first time at a gas station and now cannot do without it. This cologne smells so good on my man and you cannot beat the price. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> The smell is divine. (My purchase must have a slow leak, because the box &amp; wrapping it came in smell divine as well)&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute. (But, the artwork on the aluminum tube, I bought, is coming off.)&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I have purchased this before and I will purchase this product again. My husband likes it, and I like it on my husband.</li>
            <li> I am very happy .. this smells pretty decent...  I have nothing to complain about...  I will buy more! in fact today!</li>
            <li> smells great. Long lasting. Great price. Will buy again...and is cheaper thenn buying it in stores. Will be trying the other ones</li>
            <li> my  son loved it more than me.......lol</li>
            <li> The only reason I give this product 4/5 is because it seems to last only a few hours.  It really is  a light fragrance.  I live with a person that has a sensitive nose and they have not had anything bad to say about it......I guess no news is good news.  However,  I haven&#x27;t as of yet had anyone compliment me on the fragrance.  Nevertheless, I like the smell of it and I would still recommend getting it......especially for the price that I paid.</li>
            <li> MY BROTHER IN LA. USES CUBA GOLD AN HAS FOR YEARS  AN CAN NO LONGER FIND IT SO MY HUSBAND WENT TO AMAZON AN BOY WAS HE EVER HAPPY ,MY ORDER ARRIVED PACKED VERY WELL  ( AND IT WAS WHAT I HAD ORDERED ) THANK YOU AMAZON FOR MAKING HIS LIFE BETTER , OH AN THE PRICE WAS GREAT</li>
            <li> It has crisp smell and is a good purchase given its low cost when compared to the other branded perfumes.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my step-dad and brother for Christmas. It does smell good but the smell doesn&#x27;t last. At first, they thought it was a real tabacco until I had to show them it was \\&quot;cologne\\&quot;.   Overall, it has a fun look, great smell but doesn&#x27;t last very long. I do recommend it mostly as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, it goes anywhere with me considering its shaped like a cigar, and comes in a little tin just incase you might drop it. It last all day and for $5? Yes!</li>
            <li> Cuba cologne has an pleasantly unusual scent for men.  There is a slight sweet jasmine smell like the cologne could be unisex, but then it has a wood-like scent that makes it masculine.  The cologne is not loud at all, it is soft and more like a musk. The scent gets even better the longer someone wears it.  It&#x27;s almost like a sexy smell but good for casual wear.  For the cheap price, I really like this cologne for men.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be an add-on to go along with the Diesel Zero Plus cologne that I ordered. The only problem is that the only other thing in the box was a ton of Styrofoam peanuts. Sorry for the poor rating, but you can&#x27;t rate what you didn&#x27;t receive.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne in the world it smells great and you dont  have to use alot. I been using this for 10 years now and I love it. It also drives the women krazy!!</li>
            <li> I am wearing this fragrance as I write this review, with my colleagues in the office breathing over my shoulder as we all enjoy this rich and sweet air...a good one!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My husband has bought this before and loves the cologne. Great scent! Will buy again! Great service and great product.</li>
            <li> I love it. Nice and easy spray. I carry it around with me in my jacket. The smell does not last too long, but for the price can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> arrived in the mail broken.</li>
            <li> I first received a bottle of this cologne as a birthday gift four years ago. Smells like apple cinnamon, which is amazing. Give this cologne a try, it&#x27;s very low in cost for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent but is too light to notice you even have it on.</li>
            <li> Smells great for being so cheap!</li>
            <li> This cologne is a favorite of my husband. It was a great value and shipped quickly. I appreciate the quality of the product and timely shipping very much!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Smells so good for $5. Can&#x27;t beat this</li>
            <li> Everytime I wear this out with my girlfriend, she always has to stay real close to me. She tells me it smells so good that she thinks this should be my permanent cologne. My mom says it reminds her of a rich doctors cologne.</li>
            <li> Crazy to be such an inexpensive cologne this smells wonderful. Very warm spicy smell.  Smell does not last long but should be expected for cologne under 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> I first tried this about 7 years ago when my younger brother had some. Just wanted to get some of my own. Reasonably priced, and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice scent</li>
            <li> Used to wear this cologne years ago. Bought it at a store by in my hometown. When I moved away I couldn&#x27;t find it. About ten years went by then one day I came across it on amazon. So glad I found it again.</li>
            <li> A great smelling alternative to the popular Le Male cologne at a fraction of the price!  I have no issues with it lasting- I wear it to work, and I can still smell it the next day!  I get regular compliments saying it smells nice!</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells great. I really enjoy smelling myself throughout the day. The longevity of this fragrance is about 6-8 hours before re-applying.  The price of this fragrance does misrepresent the value of it. Cuba Gold is a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it smells great and stays on long i thought they have discontinued it but when i realized it was still on the market i order it its at a great price also love it thank you</li>
            <li> Cuba Gold is the best smelling cologne ever for only 6 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well i got it today and went to try it out. I tested the strength of the cologne and the lasting of it. both passed my test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strength of the cologne is not so strong but enough for people to smell it with only one spray. the test of the lasting part. Today i had band practice and wanted to see what people thought of the cologne. i sprayed a little on my chest and had people to smell ( yes know awkward place). Everyone i went to said they love the smell of it. so for me that is a win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bottle is a nice collectable to me if you collect colognes like i do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if your looking for a nice sweet sharp smelling cologne that last a long time and stays on your body get this because it is truly perfect</li>
            <li> Years ago I owned this cologne. I don&#x27;t remember where I originally got it, but I always liked the scent. Even though it&#x27;s a men&#x27;s cologne and I&#x27;m a woman, I wore it anyway because I personally liked it.  I had forgotten all about it until recently and couldn&#x27;t remember the name, just that the bottle was shaped like a cigar. Googled it and found it on Amazon, of course!  I guess it smells kind of woodsy and warm, and on me the scent lingers for a few hours. I do remember the same packaging (cigar-shaped bottle inside the silver tube) although the bottle is now skinner than I remember and therefore contains fewer fluid ounces.  Still a favorite scent after all these years!</li>
            <li> A great buy, cheap price and great smell.  If you like one of these colognes you are sure to like the others because I sure have.  I enjoy this cologne on an everyday basis.</li>
            <li> Clever packaging and great gift for the guys. Nice manly scent....and I like it, too. Would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Very sexy fragrance, My wife picked this out for me and I absolutely love it! Highly recommended if you like smelling sexy!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite!!! I&#x27;ve bought these for years. Smells amazing...like caress soap!</li>
            <li> This is a great gift to give to a man who likes to smell great. Product is a great buy</li>
            <li> This are GREAT!!! the smell is very nice, I will be giving this as Christmas stoking stuffer.&lt;br /&gt;they arrived perfectly and on time.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good would by it over n over again</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and I absolutely love the smell of this cologne.  If you&#x27;re familiar with Le Male Cologne by Jean Paul Gaultier, it is somewhat similar to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, though keep in mind everyone has their own tastes/preferences and may not like it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent.  My husband wears it and its amazing :).  The container is pretty cool also.</li>
            <li> Meet all expectations. Happy customer</li>
            <li> llegaron dos fragancias iguales</li>
            <li> This is actually a very good fragrance. Some may avoid this because of the cheap price but you definitely get more than your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husbands stocking for Christmas. As soon as he took the class bottle out of the tube it broke in several pieces! Thankfully it smelt good because the smell lingered for over a week!</li>
            <li> Good price and the ladies go crazy over it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent!  I bought one and my bestfriend kept it, bought another and my husband kept it.  It is made for a man, but as a woman I really dig it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few places I can still find this for my husband! We both love how it smells</li>
            <li> Love this scent and hubby loves it too! Accurate delivery too!</li>
            <li> Smells soft - my 2 son&#x27;s wanted this, plus they like that there Grandma is from Cuba - it&#x27;s not an overbearing cologn for guys - it&#x27;s soft - my husband uses it too.</li>
            <li> The spraying cap was damaged upon arrival im a lil disappointed in that but over all id buy again maybe differently</li>
            <li> I got an empty bottle... An empty freakin&#x27; bottle!!! Ordered this item many times with no problem... Sad to say won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like you&#x27;ve been there before, this is the potion. Love potion.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging that the perfume sits in. It&#x27;s very unique looking. The perfume also smells really good! I would highly recommend this perfume as a purse or post work out spray.</li>
            <li> Smells good and get compliments but it does wear off pretty fast. It&#x27;s cheap so that&#x27;s expected. It is made in Paris though</li>
            <li> I was thankful to persent this gift to my son, he was also thankful and very pleased. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome toys - Love it!</li>
            <li> Cute stocking stuffer and they smell very nice ..</li>
            <li> I found this cologne in Florida years ago.  When my husband ran out I couldnt find it in the stores anywhere.  One day I decided to search the web and there it was.  It makes him smell like a man.</li>
            <li> I like them way it smells. The scent carries a long way. I would recommend. Next time will buy again another scent</li>
            <li> For the price your getting le male in a cuba gold bottle. if you like le male this is a must buy and cost a fraction. worth a buy and blind buy it if you like vanilla,powdery, tobacco scents</li>
            <li> These fragrances are simply the best as far as scent and last I power . I suggest get many because people will ask for one.</li>
            <li> Someone told me this smells really good so I seen that amazon has it really cheap on sale..&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a present but it does smell very good &amp; I went ahead to order more.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, but last 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Great price and expedient delivery</li>
            <li> I actually love the cologne smell and had bought the bigger version of this but also three small ones for the car and Computer case and what not and not a one of them sprays. All three are duds. They usually spray out pretty good but these are no good. I just broke the tops off and dumped em in an empty perry ellis bottle... seriously. : (</li>
            <li> First off, the value alone makes this worth buying. The scent is often compared to Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier. To me, this cologne has a very pleasant vanilla smell to it. It also smells fresh, minty, clean, and almost soapy. It&#x27;s not too over-powering either and seems to last a while as well.</li>
            <li> Good Smells. Cheap Price. Can&#x27;t Complain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now a fan.  This smells really nice and isn&#x27;t overbearing - thumbs up from my wife.  Packaging is kinda cool and fits easily in a drawer.</li>
            <li> terrible !!! nobody wants to be near to me after use this</li>
            <li> Excellent balance of scents!</li>
            <li> To me it smells like powdery floral soap, mellow and lovely. Last about 3-4 hours and projects moderately. It definitely smells VERY similar to Le Male by Jean Paul Gaultier (which would cost 5x more!!). This fragrance actually came before Le Male!!</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite fragrance; it mixes well with his body chemistry; and its affordable!!  We love Cuba gold</li>
            <li> Great product! Love the scent &amp; the size of it makes it easy to carry anywhere you like. I&#x27;m sure my father will love his Father&#x27;s Day gift &amp; will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> Bought extras to give to my dad and my uncle for Fathers day.  Good price and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Wear it all the time mixes well with my body chemistry. I get lots of complements when I wear it</li>
            <li> pckg came on time. smells gd, ladies def approve this on me! and actually does last a gd amount during the day + night. very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> Just like I expected to smell.</li>
            <li> Cuba Gold is a good cheap fragrance to have just for a back up or a go to before stepping out of the house. This is light &amp; very comfortable for yourself &amp;another&#x27;s around you</li>
            <li> and women, as well as some men who aren&#x27;t(not judging here), will be attracted to you... for the cheap price not only you won&#x27;t smell like some cheap tourist while being fondled by TSA, but it can almost compete with way more expensive stuff... give it a try, what&#x27;s the worst that can happen, a skunk follow you home?&lt;br /&gt;;)~</li>
            <li> Enjoyed it! I love it on my husband. I would buy again and I love that it is in a small package so he can try it before he spends a lot of money on it.....</li>
            <li> It was s***! Don&#x27;t recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a present and the person enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;Apparently he had it before and was glad to receive a new one.</li>
            <li> This smells good. Lasts a while. And for the price would buy another. You can you the tube for a stogie on the go it is preety sturdy.</li>
            <li> I have got it for few of my friends living in different geographical location. All of them liked the smell. Two of them said the smell last long enough. I think it would be good gift if your budget is very low.  Its my pleasure that they liked the product which does not cost much. I think this the best you can get in Amazon with similar price range.</li>
            <li> like a fine Cuban the Cuba Gold&#x27;s aroma is just what I was looking for.  A clean woodsy smell that is not over the top or to timber smelling.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price. This is not very expensive but is not a cheap product. In my opinion it smells like one of the high end designer fragrances. Smells a little like a sweet vanilla tobacco and coco smell to it. Beautiful smells together. Its a great buy and my wife didn&#x27;t believe me when I told her how much I payed for it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne. I always get complimented when I spray some on.</li>
            <li> This was a good choice of cologne for my brother, he is really enjoying the one. I be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> my friend mentioned her college son received this from his grandmother in fl. but used it up. since they are from cuba i figure would make great christmas gift boy was he surprised and happy</li>
