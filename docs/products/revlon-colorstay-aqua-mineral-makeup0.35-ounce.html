    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is an awesome powder!</li>
            <li>This powder, combined with my foundation makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>the BEST!!!</li>
            <li>I think I have found the perfect combination.</li>
            <li>and I think for a &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brand this is probably the best mineral makeup out there, but the packaging leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li>It blends beautifully.</li>
            <li>Wonderful.. Beautiful coverage... love it!</li>
            <li>It feels great when it is being applied</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think Revlon did a great job with their labeling, but that&#x27;s beside the point.  </li>
            <li>Great customer service....</li>
            <li>it has a great price</li>
            <li>it always feels great going on and look great all day</li>
            <li>This is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful coverage and feels so cool going on, especially nice in summer</li>
            <li>I am absolutely loving this powder and will continue purchasing it!</li>
            <li>This product does not give good coverage.</li>
            <li>It would be good for someone just looking to highlight a good complexion.</li>
            <li>I only use the brush included for touch ups while I&#x27;m out, I have a wonderful MAC brush that I otherwise use that works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup!  </li>
            <li>so glad I got this!</li>
            <li>Love the shimmer in this mineral powder!</li>
            <li>This makeup goes on with a cool/wet feeling which feels AMAZING</li>
            <li>It is perfect coverage, because you can control how much you use.</li>
            <li>The reason this is so nice is that I need heavier coverage on just parts of my face.</li>
            <li>This makeup provides good coverage; it is buildable but I like a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; coverage to let my freckles show through.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even get it to cover the very light freckles.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rub off at all, which I find a HUGE plus!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>so glad I found it on amazon and can keep this as part of my&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, it does feel interesting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a makeup addict, but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing while applying because it has coconut water in it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic powder!</li>
            <li>I love mineral powder but not this one.</li>
            <li>It should be used as a setting powder over your favorite foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel smooth !</li>
            <li>I will be sure and buy more when its out</li>
            <li>Just like any foundation, the more you use the heavier the coverage.</li>
            <li>so I am using this on top of a liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>Its pretty amazing just on its own, but I wanted a setting powder to go with it.</li>
            <li>and I love this easy care make up.</li>
            <li>My skin is combination and makeup has always melted quite easily off of my face by lunch time.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a foundation that is good for my older, dryer, begining to wrinkle skin.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;wet\\&quot; sensation really isn&#x27;t a huge draw to me.</li>
            <li>overall a great product...</li>
            <li>IS A LIGHT COVERAGE</li>
            <li>I need more on the preverbial tzone because I tend to be redder in that area, but I can lighten the coverage around my eyes where I am beginning to wrinkle when I smile, and it cakes.</li>
            <li>My skin gets very oily very quickly with this foundation - as in \\&quot;wash face and reapply at lunchtime\\&quot; oily.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to achieve a &#x27;natural&#x27; look with his product yet.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend you use a primer or a good moisterizer under it if you skin is normal to dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very, very glittery.</li>
            <li>Would only recommend to people with even complexions and looking for very light coverage or a dewy look.</li>
            <li>I went to reorder and just curios how this seller can sell this for this much?!</li>
            <li>No matter how many layers are applied, it doesn&#x27;t actually cover anything.  </li>
            <li>It settles into any lines or \\&quot;textured spots\\&quot; and makes them MORE obvious, and doesn&#x27;t blend well.    </li>
            <li>It makes me really want to wear makeup!</li>
            <li>I use this makeup all the time and pay about $3 more for it at the local discount store.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned it would not be fresh, but it is just as fresh as I get locally and went on just as smoothly.</li>
            <li>To complicate things, the old color &#x27;Light/Medium&#x27; in the original Colorstay Mineral Makeup was a lighter, pink-porcelain tone.</li>
            <li>for oily skin i use clean and clear matifying moisturizer and blotting paapers/face wipes throughout the day to DAB the oil away</li>
            <li>At more than $10 for less than .4 ounces, I want to be able to pop that out and scrape every last bit of the product of the corners.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it on bare skin and over other products, can&#x27;t seem to find what this product is good for.</li>
            <li>This brush forces application in straight brush strokes and doesn&#x27;t blend, just stays where you apply it.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really benefit me when I&#x27;m looking to even out my skin tone.    </li>
            <li>even (the whole reason I went for mineral makeup to begin with).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the sense that it really does anything for my skin, and I think its just a gimmick.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>for the \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; i would say that you yourself will notice it but others will not unless you stress themout as much as your stressing about it</li>
            <li>Really its a highlighting shimmer.</li>
            <li>Thanks so ,much</li>
            <li>(I have read complaints about it only being light coverage, so I cannot comment on that aspect.)</li>
            <li>The packaging is better than the Colorstay foundation (there&#x27;s a little slideout brush that&#x27;s super soft)</li>
            <li>Revlon has more pigments then the Almay but less cooling effect</li>
            <li>The main issue I have with this is the packaging...</li>
            <li>she would highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>But that liquidy feel just causes it to cling to that spot making it harder to smooth it around.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice until I saw it mentioned and even then I had to get right up next to the mirror to tell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dislike it, but could live without it to have a product that works.  </li>
            <li>This has actually kept my makeup 80% on throughout most of the day, with minimal touch ups to  my t zone...</li>
            <li>This product gets 2 stars from me because the brush is very soft.</li>
            <li>I bought the new Aqua product as a replacement for the old Revlon Colorstay mineral foundation when I ran out, since it seems to have been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>This product covers, adds a slight glow to my skin and is just downright fun!</li>
            <li>This product offers no coverage WHATSOEVER.  </li>
            <li>It can seem \\&quot;glittery\\&quot; in the direct sunlight but not indoor lighting.     </li>
            <li>The old foundation was virtually unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>but I have the impression this is a replacement product for the old foundation), but the old foundation settled on my skin</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s just a complete exageration.</li>
            <li>I used to have allot of problems with acne and as soon as I changed to this product it completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>Im also not sold completely on the feel of it turning from a powder to liquid feel on my face.</li>
            <li>I went through all the old brands of foundation that I&#x27;ve used before</li>
            <li>When used on top of my foundation, I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is tight or dry at all.</li>
            <li>And I have fun using it because the dry powder and dry brush feleing wet is just too cool.</li>
            <li>I have pale skin, somewhat oily and prone to breakouts, and I&#x27;m just getting old enough to start seeing texture changes that are on the edge of being \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I tried this because my normal mineral makeup by Revlon (the Colorstay foundation powder) is either discontinued or no longer sold at CVS/RiteAid hoping this would be similar.</li>
            <li>I also loved the old Colorstay Mineral Makeup &amp; found the new version to be a big disappointment.</li>
            <li>I have smooth skin with only a few freckles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a definite improvement over the old foundation - the brush can be replaced and the lid can be put on without it.  </li>
            <li>Weird and kind of cakey.  </li>
            <li>If mineral foundation is what you need spend your hard earned money buying tried, true, and costly Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>That said, I have to be very careful not to put too much of the product on the applicator</li>
            <li>The brush quality is nice but can be difficult to use since it is a flat brush and mineral powder should be applied in circular strokes for even coverage and buffing.</li>
            <li>sparkly*, not a good look for a 30-odd woman who just wants to go to work with skin that looks normal and</li>
    </ol>

            <li> of girls are so dramatic about the luminous effect and the light coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I flat out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25, have acne prone combination skin: red bumps, dry patches around chin, and oily t zone, no wrinkles.     </li>
            <li> it have an open mind ask around and combine it  with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased a primer from Urban Decay, I haven&#x27;t tried other brands.</li>
            <li> The product got 2 stars because I have problem skin and tend to be a little picky, and the packaging was a slight improvement, but otherwise I might not have even rated it that highly.  </li>
            <li> I find using the brush that is supplied makes the coverage to heavy so only use it for under my eyes and around my nose to cover up the bags and red skin</li>

            <li> My skin is pale, and my face has red around the cheeks and nose at times, so its hard to find makeup to get rid of the red, and also not be too dark for my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This product offers no coverage WHATSOEVER.  It feels great when it is being applied but there is no trace of it going on. You can&#x27;t build coverage at all. If mineral foundation is what you need spend your hard earned money buying tried, true, and costly Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li> I found this on sale at one of our clearance stores nearby. I bought it not knowing it felt wet. The first time I tried it I thought something was wrong w me! Thank god for google. Anyways, I&#x27;m 46 and powder makes my lines show and my face look dull. This product covers, adds a slight glow to my skin and is just downright fun! :) im so glad I found it on amazon and can keep this as part of my&lt;br /&gt;Makeup regimen!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: still love!!&lt;br /&gt;But I went to reorder and just curios how this seller can sell this for this much?! Lol </li>
            <li> I tried this because my normal mineral makeup by Revlon (the Colorstay foundation powder) is either discontinued or no longer sold at CVS/RiteAid hoping this would be similar. I flat out hate this product. :( The packaging is better than the Colorstay foundation (there&#x27;s a little slideout brush that&#x27;s super soft) so it doesn&#x27;t get everywhere like the Colorstay version, but the coverage is awful. When you apply it to your skin it feels \\&quot;wet\\&quot; hence the aqua name I guess. It&#x27;s dry powder, but gives you the oddest sensation of wet, dewy skin, but doesn&#x27;t feel wet when you touch your face afterward. The coverage is next to nothing. I almost felt like I was just putting finishing powder on my face. It&#x27;s also very, very glittery. I hate glittery foundations/powders because my face is already oily. I don&#x27;t need extra shine. All in all this product was very disappointing. I will be returning it and stocking up on Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay instead if it is indeed being discontinued. This product gets 2 stars from me because the brush is very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25, have acne prone combination skin: red bumps, dry patches around chin, and oily t zone, no wrinkles.     This product does not give good coverage. Even when I use concealer on problem spots it doesn&#x27;t blend well with the concealer. It would be good for someone just looking to highlight a good complexion. It does contain mica and gives a \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; look, so if you want a matte finish stay away! It can seem \\&quot;glittery\\&quot; in the direct sunlight but not indoor lighting.     The brush quality is nice but can be difficult to use since it is a flat brush and mineral powder should be applied in circular strokes for even coverage and buffing. This brush forces application in straight brush strokes and doesn&#x27;t blend, just stays where you apply it. Even when using a round brush to apply it is difficult to blend.     I do like the coconut water because it goes over the dry patches without causing them to stand out, but again coverage is not great so it doesn&#x27;t really benefit me when I&#x27;m looking to even out my skin tone.    Would only recommend to people with even complexions and looking for very light coverage or a dewy look.</li>
            <li> I bought the new Aqua product as a replacement for the old Revlon Colorstay mineral foundation when I ran out, since it seems to have been discontinued.  Wish I&#x27;d learned my lesson the last time and purchased it at a store that takes returns!  It may work well for some skin.  I have pale skin, somewhat oily and prone to breakouts, and I&#x27;m just getting old enough to start seeing texture changes that are on the edge of being \\&quot;fine lines\\&quot;.  The product got 2 stars because I have problem skin and tend to be a little picky, and the packaging was a slight improvement, but otherwise I might not have even rated it that highly.  The packaging:  It&#x27;s a definite improvement over the old foundation - the brush can be replaced and the lid can be put on without it.  That makes it less messy, especially if I have to carry it with me.  Unfortunately, the inside is still designed like a shaker, and it&#x27;s still impossible to remove.  At more than $10 for less than .4 ounces, I want to be able to pop that out and scrape every last bit of the product of the corners.  The feel:  It&#x27;s...odd.  Powdery texture, but it feels wet when applying.  I don&#x27;t dislike it, but could live without it to have a product that works.  When it sets (ha) I can tell I&#x27;m wearing something.  The old foundation was virtually unnoticeable.  The coverage:  Nonexistent.  Not to keep comparing (but I have the impression this is a replacement product for the old foundation), but the old foundation settled on my skin, looked like it wasn&#x27;t there, and made lines, pores and blemishes practically disappear.  THIS stuff, on the other hand, does NONE of those things.  No matter how many layers are applied, it doesn&#x27;t actually cover anything.  It settles into any lines or \\&quot;textured spots\\&quot; and makes them MORE obvious, and doesn&#x27;t blend well.    The other:  My skin gets very oily very quickly with this foundation - as in \\&quot;wash face and reapply at lunchtime\\&quot; oily.  And it&#x27;s *sparkly*, not a good look for a 30-odd woman who just wants to go to work with skin that looks normal and even (the whole reason I went for mineral makeup to begin with).  When I touch my face, the makeup comes off, but the sparkly stuff sometimes doesn&#x27;t.  In short, I could have saved my money, brushed baby powder on my face, and gone to work looking just about the same all week.  I won&#x27;t be using the rest of this bottle.</li>
            <li> I recently bought Revlon colorstay liquid foundation. Its pretty amazing just on its own, but I wanted a setting powder to go with it. I ended up with this. I had no idea it is actually meant to be a foundation. The label says nothing at all to that effect. \\&quot;Mineral makeup\\&quot; is all it says. To me, that just doesn&#x27;t scream, \\&quot;hey, I&#x27;m a foundation!!\\&quot; So it wasn&#x27;t until I popped on here and saw everyone talking about what a horrid foundation it was that I realized anything. I then went to Revlon&#x27;s site where its listed under their foundations. I don&#x27;t think Revlon did a great job with their labeling, but that&#x27;s beside the point.  This is an awesome powder! I like the little brush that&#x27;s included, although it was incredibly difficult to extend at first. The \\&quot;wet\\&quot; sensation really isn&#x27;t a huge draw to me. I don&#x27;t get the sense that it really does anything for my skin, and I think its just a gimmick. That being said, it does feel interesting. When used on top of my foundation, I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is tight or dry at all. When I used it alone, I did get a little of that sensation. It doesn&#x27;t rub off at all, which I find a HUGE plus! No more gross residue on my phone screen!   I know a lot of people have mentioned that there are \\&quot;sparkles\\&quot; in the powder. I didn&#x27;t notice until I saw it mentioned and even then I had to get right up next to the mirror to tell. Unless Revlon made some sort of mistake with some of their shipments and dumped a ton of glitter in here, there is no way in the world you&#x27;ll get a \\&quot;disco ball\\&quot; effect. I think that&#x27;s just a complete exageration. This powder, combined with my foundation makes my skin look flawless. I&#x27;m not a makeup addict, but I love this stuff. It makes me really want to wear makeup!</li>
            <li> I used to have allot of problems with acne and as soon as I changed to this product it completely cleared up. I don&#x27;t think it was all down to just this product but I do know that every time I try using a liquid foundation again on my skin I have trouble with pimples. I find using the brush that is supplied makes the coverage to heavy so only use it for under my eyes and around my nose to cover up the bags and red skin and then I use a Kabuki brush for the rest of my face. Only thing I don;t like abut this product is that it takes allot of work to get the last of the makeup out of the container at the end.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup!  It&#x27;s lightweight and gives your skin a luminous glow without being over sparkly!  It feels refreshing while applying because it has coconut water in it.  Fantastic powder!</li>
            <li> This product does not cover well. I have smooth skin with only a few freckles. I couldn&#x27;t even get it to cover the very light freckles. Im also not sold completely on the feel of it turning from a powder to liquid feel on my face. I love mineral powder but not this one.</li>
            <li> I agree with &#x27;ArtistKae&#x27;. I also loved the old Colorstay Mineral Makeup &amp; found the new version to be a big disappointment. The coconut water just makes it go on blotchy. I even tried using a wider brush but it didn&#x27;t help. It melts on contact with your skin giving a cooling wet effect. But that liquidy feel just causes it to cling to that spot making it harder to smooth it around. The result for me was uneven, minimal coverage. To complicate things, the old color &#x27;Light/Medium&#x27; in the original Colorstay Mineral Makeup was a lighter, pink-porcelain tone. The new &#x27;Light/Medium&#x27; is a darker tone with a heavy yellow base. On a fair-skin blonde, it looks like a bad spray-tan job. Not what I have come to expect from Revlon.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she says...it doesn&#x27;t cake...or turn orange...overall a great product... she would highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> *Disclaimer: i am not paid by Revlon or any company i bought this product myself for $11.99 at Target (i forgot my coupon)&lt;br /&gt;First off i dont think this is meant to be a foundation it says nothing on the packing about it being used as a foundation so i have no clue why people think its one haha. It should be used as a setting powder over your favorite foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also for oily skin i use clean and clear matifying moisturizer and blotting paapers/face wipes throughout the day to DAB the oil away (everyone gets it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also i personally use dream matte mousse and the dream matte powder cause i have oily skin but usually dont need to with my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; i would say that you yourself will notice it but others will not unless you stress themout as much as your stressing about it then they will \\&quot;see\\&quot; the \\&quot;glitter\\&quot;. Really its a highlighting shimmer. If youve never used highlighters or illuminaters you&#x27;ll be turned off but rather than say no and return it have an open mind ask around and combine it  with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO Skin type does matter for results. so use knowledge of your skin to make this work for you with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alot of girls are so dramatic about the luminous effect and the light coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Revlon and Almay have the same parent company hence very similar packaging between the Almay Wake Up and this one. Almay and Revlon \\&quot;Cooling\\&quot; powders are different in that Revlon has coconut and Almay has Cucumber! Revlon has more pigments then the Almay but less cooling effect but it WILL feel \\&quot;wet\\&quot; but isnt.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A LIGHT COVERAGE SO USE A FOUNDATION UNLESS YOUR ALREADY \\&quot;FLAWLESS\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Im so glad I got this! It makes your face feel smooth ! I will be sure and buy more when its out and I just got it last night .</li>
            <li> Wonderful coverage and feels so cool going on, especially nice in summer</li>
            <li> Wonderful.. Beautiful coverage... love it! Great customer service....the BEST!!! Will definitely buy from USA Traders again!! Thanks so ,much</li>
            <li> Love the shimmer in this mineral powder!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a foundation that is good for my older, dryer, begining to wrinkle skin. I think I have found the perfect combination. I purchased a primer from Urban Decay, I haven&#x27;t tried other brands. Then I apply this over it. It is perfect coverage, because you can control how much you use. Just like any foundation, the more you use the heavier the coverage. The reason this is so nice is that I need heavier coverage on just parts of my face. This blends so well that you can put the extra just where you need it, using a lighter touch where foundation tends to cake up. I need more on the preverbial tzone because I tend to be redder in that area, but I can lighten the coverage around my eyes where I am beginning to wrinkle when I smile, and it cakes. It blends beautifully. And I have fun using it because the dry powder and dry brush feleing wet is just too cool. I do recommend you use a primer or a good moisterizer under it if you skin is normal to dry.</li>
            <li> Weird and kind of cakey.  Feels wet, but is a powder.  I haven&#x27;t been able to achieve a &#x27;natural&#x27; look with his product yet.  I&#x27;ve tried it on bare skin and over other products, can&#x27;t seem to find what this product is good for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item a few times from seller- it has a great price and I love this easy care make up. it always feels great going on and look great all day</li>
            <li> My face started not agreeing with anything I was using. I went through all the old brands of foundation that I&#x27;ve used before and I still got this weird blotchy texture.. (Whether with primer, or without) It wasn&#x27;t until I bought this that the weird blotchy spots stopped showing up. My skin is combination and makeup has always melted quite easily off of my face by lunch time. This has actually kept my makeup 80% on throughout most of the day, with minimal touch ups to  my t zone... And that was without primer. Because of the way my skin is, I have always used liquid &amp; powder foundations so I am using this on top of a liquid foundation. (I have read complaints about it only being light coverage, so I cannot comment on that aspect.) My skin is pale, and my face has red around the cheeks and nose at times, so its hard to find makeup to get rid of the red, and also not be too dark for my skin. The last mineral powder (Maybelline) I used, with the lightest color they had, still did not match my skin and rubbed off orange. Ive had no problems with this rubbing off at all, let alone leaving an orange color on anything. I only use the brush included for touch ups while I&#x27;m out, I have a wonderful MAC brush that I otherwise use that works wonderfully. This makeup goes on with a cool/wet feeling which feels AMAZING and it makes me want to just put it on all day. I am absolutely loving this powder and will continue purchasing it!</li>
            <li> I use this makeup all the time and pay about $3 more for it at the local discount store.  This is a great deal.  I was concerned it would not be fresh, but it is just as fresh as I get locally and went on just as smoothly.</li>
            <li> This makeup provides good coverage; it is buildable but I like a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; coverage to let my freckles show through. That said, I have to be very careful not to put too much of the product on the applicator or it&#x27;ll appear too heavy [SIDEBAR:  I do not use the little brush that comes with it, I use one that came with Pur Minerals instead].  This formula doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other mineral makeups do.  The main issue I have with this is the packaging...you can tweak the coverage to suit you and I think for a &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brand this is probably the best mineral makeup out there, but the packaging leaves something to be desired. My shipment was received well before promised and intact!</li>
