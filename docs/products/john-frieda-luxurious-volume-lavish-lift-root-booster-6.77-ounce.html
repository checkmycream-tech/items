            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have another type that I got through ipsy that I like much more.</li>
            <li>I notice that my hair does have more volume and body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First,  I love this product and I&#x27;ll explain</li>

            <li>Glad Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>Could not find it in many stores that&#x27;s y</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok --</li>
            <li>This is an OK product.  </li>
            <li>I love John Frieda products..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have discovered it.</li>
            <li>This gives more volume.</li>
            <li>is a great product that does what it promises at a reasonable price point.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely perfect for flat heads.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to mousse as it does not dull the hair colour.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s way better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This product does wonders for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have really fine and curly hair, and damaged for coloring...</li>
            <li>This is working well on my fine, thinning medium-short hair.  </li>
            <li>Having fine hair, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of volumizing sprays.</li>
            <li>This one does the trick and at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Thanks John Frieda!!!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get my package and because I&#x27;ve used this product before.  </li>
            <li>I am now using the whole product line for fine hair, and my hair never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>Hair is not stiff or sticky, but has much more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>My hair stays full throughout the day when I use this, but the body does fall out a bit.</li>
            <li>I really did want to love it, but</li>
            <li>I love the products, not greasy or drying, and make my hair very shinny and full.  </li>
            <li>Have purchase several John Frieda products and most of the time I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>My hair has more body and looks good for a few days.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase these products from a salon and pay a lot more for the privilege.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In five minutes my normally droopy hair looked fuller and had more lift.</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s best to spray roots after toweling off most moisture, then hold your head down toward your waist to blow dry the roots.</li>
            <li>Overall, my hair looked great and kept its shape in hot, really humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and fine without body or curl.</li>
            <li>This root booster does what it says on my fine, stick straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very thin hair at the top and this product does a very good job at providing volume with no stickiness.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and very full.</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend use with or without hair product because my curls come out natural looking and very curly with this product alone...</li>
            <li>Good amount of life with little to no build up.</li>
            <li>John Frieda products do exactly what they say they will do.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to get the left I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>you so much!</li>
            <li>At least for me, great combo with these products.</li>
            <li>apologize for the long review but thought I&#x27;d be detailed in what I did in hopes it can help someone!</li>
            <li>She has lovely silky straight hair that lies too flat.</li>
            <li>I should have known better not to buy John Frieda products, they should be called John Fried producst, firs of all, this thing makes your hair feel like straw, it takes out the shine and the softness making it look and feel dry and lifeless.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and this is the only product I have found that adds textures and fullness.</li>
            <li>I expected better from John Frieda.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any added volume really</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>I dont have much time for that, but I do like the product when I use it.</li>
            <li>It really lifts my roots.</li>
            <li>Really adds noticeable volume.</li>
            <li>Does very well to lift hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much difference except in my pocketbook.</li>
            <li>This is root lift that really works.</li>
            <li>I find it leaves my hair a bit heavy and kind of sticky.  </li>
            <li>and it had a nice scent which was subtle and fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to weigh my hair down even more than if I didn&#x27;t use anything at all.</li>
            <li>Too make my hair even bigger next time I&#x27;m probably going to use freezing hairspray more on my roots as I</li>
            <li>after doing that I flipped my hair down again and sprayed it with light hair spray,  then flipped it back, and with a hair pick adjusted it how I wanted it- then sprayed it with freezing hair spray lightly ( at the roots)</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and silky and completely devoid of volume.</li>
            <li>I applied it to the roots of my freshly washed and towel dried hair and let my blow dryer create the adequate volume I needed at a low cool setting.</li>
            <li>but in my case I did need to do a little more along with using this spray...</li>
            <li>Then I set my hair on velcro rollers and spray a little more Root Booster on the root.  </li>
            <li>so normally it&#x27;s super flat unless I pin it up with hair pins.</li>
            <li>On wet hair I use cheap detangler.</li>
            <li>This is the least effective volumizer or root booster I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This product gives much needed body to my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>Really helps if you have straight hair or too long hair: creates build and volume for real and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair looking or feeling like it has a ton of products.</li>
            <li>and I will always give a new one a try.  </li>
            <li>It takes longer to blow dry hair with this and makes your hair not silky soft, but the volume it gives is so worth it!</li>
            <li>Looks and feels very natural.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this product made it hard to style.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I let the rest of my hair air dry or pile it on top of my head to dry, which helps bend the roots up for the volume problem.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that always falls flat, especially in the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>I have limp, oily, unmanageable, fine, hair.</li>
            <li>I do have problem hair, thinning and baby fine and have found few products that can help me.</li>
            <li>But what is even better, the result of the blow dry is smoother and closer to the hairdresser look than with other products.</li>
            <li>As is started out really short, it didn&#x27;t have much poof - and I needed poof.  </li>
            <li>It coats the hair but is not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>the whole next day.</li>
            <li>I have not tried another root lift product because I like this one so much, so I can&#x27;t compare if it&#x27;s better or worse than others.</li>
            <li>The two that work ok for me is the Pantene Root Lift or the  * Matrix Bodifying spray which are both lightweight and provide   the right amount of lift and of course the TIGI Catwalk Root lifter   works but is too expensive</li>
            <li>, this product didn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and the sprays I use are light so my hair flowed</li>
            <li>My hair just became flat again very soon.</li>
            <li>I saw some reviews of people not satisfied, but I can tell you what I did which left be satisfied all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for my super thick and heavy hair that usually has no volume!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m unsure if for people with thin and light hair if maybe just this spray is enough, but for me I needed a little more work. )</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is just below shoulder length, and it is hard to get volume into my hair and keep it there.</li>
            <li>Maybe I expected too much</li>
            <li>It did nothing for my hair as far as volume and left my hair sticky.</li>
            <li>Normally I take a shower, towel dry my hair, and then part it all over the place and spray this all over my roots.</li>
            <li>but this product made a huge difference for me, and from previous experiences without it ( and still using the other products and techniques I&#x27;m gonna mention)</li>
            <li>Okay, I never write reviews and I take my hair VERY seriously.</li>
            <li>but this product really took that step down. )</li>
            <li>I usually spray it on the top and use my comb to make it &#x27;poof&#x27; a little.</li>
            <li>I just sprayed it on per directions and let it dry naturally.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> after doing that I flipped my hair down again and sprayed it with light hair spray,  then flipped it back, and with a hair pick adjusted it how I wanted it- then sprayed it with freezing hair spray lightly ( at the roots)</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and silky and completely devoid of volume.</li>
            <li> I applied it to the roots of my freshly washed and towel dried hair and let my blow dryer create the adequate volume I needed at a low cool setting.</li>
            <li> but in my case I did need to do a little more along with using this spray...</li>
            <li> Then I set my hair on velcro rollers and spray a little more Root Booster on the root.  </li>
            <li> so normally it&#x27;s super flat unless I pin it up with hair pins.</li>
            <li> On wet hair I use cheap detangler.</li>
            <li> This is the least effective volumizer or root booster I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This product gives much needed body to my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> Really helps if you have straight hair or too long hair: creates build and volume for real and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair looking or feeling like it has a ton of products.</li>
            <li> and I will always give a new one a try.  </li>
            <li> It takes longer to blow dry hair with this and makes your hair not silky soft, but the volume it gives is so worth it!</li>
            <li> Looks and feels very natural.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product made it hard to style.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I let the rest of my hair air dry or pile it on top of my head to dry, which helps bend the roots up for the volume problem.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that always falls flat, especially in the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I have limp, oily, unmanageable, fine, hair.</li>
            <li> I do have problem hair, thinning and baby fine and have found few products that can help me.</li>
            <li> But what is even better, the result of the blow dry is smoother and closer to the hairdresser look than with other products.</li>
            <li> As is started out really short, it didn&#x27;t have much poof - and I needed poof.  </li>
            <li> It coats the hair but is not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> the whole next day.</li>
            <li> I have not tried another root lift product because I like this one so much, so I can&#x27;t compare if it&#x27;s better or worse than others.</li>
            <li> The two that work ok for me is the Pantene Root Lift or the  * Matrix Bodifying spray which are both lightweight and provide   the right amount of lift and of course the TIGI Catwalk Root lifter   works but is too expensive</li>
            <li> , this product didn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and the sprays I use are light so my hair flowed</li>
            <li> My hair just became flat again very soon.</li>
            <li> I saw some reviews of people not satisfied, but I can tell you what I did which left be satisfied all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for my super thick and heavy hair that usually has no volume!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m unsure if for people with thin and light hair if maybe just this spray is enough, but for me I needed a little more work. )</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is just below shoulder length, and it is hard to get volume into my hair and keep it there.</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected too much</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my hair as far as volume and left my hair sticky.</li>
            <li> Normally I take a shower, towel dry my hair, and then part it all over the place and spray this all over my roots.</li>
            <li> but this product made a huge difference for me, and from previous experiences without it ( and still using the other products and techniques I&#x27;m gonna mention)</li>
            <li> Okay, I never write reviews and I take my hair VERY seriously.</li>
            <li> but this product really took that step down. )</li>
            <li> I usually spray it on the top and use my comb to make it &#x27;poof&#x27; a little.</li>
            <li> I just sprayed it on per directions and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> I add a little high shine gloss for the polished look and to make it feel a bit softer.  </li>
            <li> This gives my hair lift where otherwise it would be lying flat against my head.</li>
            <li> I only wish the lift would last longer, because for my long hair it only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> does the job of giving volume to your hair even tho not blown dry.</li>
            <li> I spray a bit on my crown, then blow dry.</li>
            <li> I wish that you didnt need to blow dry in order for the product to work well.</li>
            <li> I have tried to just spray the product and not blow dry, but it doesnt do well for me like that.</li>
            <li> I spray it on the hair roots and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> Then  I spray this product on damp hair after I dry the hair a for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Apply to roots while damp then blow dry and style.  </li>
            <li> Once my hair is dry</li>
            <li> The root booster adds the volume but it makes the hair feel just a tad dry, so my remedy is hair polish.  </li>
            <li> I use this on the roots when I blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> Due to that it is heavy and really weighs if down...</li>
            <li> I spray it on while my hair is wet and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> But, did it work, not really, not for me anyway.  </li>
            <li> I like this because it works and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling too wet.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with this product as I love other John Frieda products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try anything for roots, and although it did stand them up a little, it also seemed to dry them out a bit</li>
            <li> took this product and sprayed it on the roots and began blow drying (upside down), half way through it while it was mostly dry</li>
            <li> I then teased the roots slightly ( and I mean just a tad,  which I usually have to do so much</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week, when I have time to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> When almost dry, I use the round brush, with sections of hair to finish the drying process.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this product on the roots again and finished blow drying (still upside down).  </li>
            <li> Then I blowdry upside down</li>
            <li> This root booster gives my hair lots of lift without weighing it down or making it sticky.</li>
            <li> Does not make my hair sticky or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> just a squirt down the part line and then the mousse.</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick hair that is very flat and gets oily.</li>
            <li> I have lots of medium thick hair, and it&#x27;s VERY long.</li>
            <li> After I blow dried it</li>
            <li> It gives my hair some fluffy lift where needed and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch like others do.  </li>
            <li> I like that you can spray it on, and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy perfume or anything.</li>
            <li> I have thin, baby-fine hair, and this product actually gives it some lift.</li>
            <li> my usual brand at easily half the price.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on various products over the years, all of which have either done a so-so job or been totally disappointing.</li>
            <li> and my hair still had at least half the volume</li>
            <li> had run out of the Paul Mitchell Volumnizing Spray that I usually use and bought this product in a pinch at CVS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually really hard to please when it comes to products.  </li>
            <li> This product is a hard to get &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would at least nominally work</li>
            <li> My formerly thick hair has no body unless I use this.</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but I&#x27;m not one to spend a lot of money on hair products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;OH, you have to cover your counters in the bathroom because it stains them, not a good product at all.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed, I do not see the results of this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, frizzy, and has been dyed for 30 years.</li>
            <li> Now, I hate flat hair</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I was unable to target the root area</li>
            <li> sorry, I didn&#x27;t like the feel or look of my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> However, this might have been a bottle gone bad.  </li>
            <li> I hate it when I like a product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like makes your hair feel awful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> John Frieda products do exactly what they say they will do.  I love their products!  I am now using the whole product line for fine hair, and my hair never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> I saw this on the Today Show and it was given rave reviews. It&#x27;s about as effective as spraying water in my hair. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> It works!  I am going to order it again. What more can I say!</li>
            <li> * The John Frieda Root lifter left my hair feeling waxy and oily  * Wish it had worked for me  * The two that work ok for me is the Pantene Root Lift or the  * Matrix Bodifying spray which are both lightweight and provide   the right amount of lift and of course the TIGI Catwalk Root lifter   works but is too expensive</li>
            <li> Works! Great Amazon experience!</li>
            <li> Love this product - easy to apply and best of all it WORKS.  I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair to a longer style.  As is started out really short, it didn&#x27;t have much poof - and I needed poof.  GOT it with this product.</li>
            <li> does the job of giving volume to your hair even tho not blown dry. I just sprayed it on per directions and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed, I do not see the results of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have very thin hair at the top and this product does a very good job at providing volume with no stickiness. I spray it on while my hair is wet and blow dry.  It coats the hair but is not heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all.  I expected better from John Frieda.  I find it leaves my hair a bit heavy and kind of sticky.  I have another type that I got through ipsy that I like much more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any added volume really</li>
            <li> I just discovered John Frieda Root lift booster and I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed. I have limp, oily, unmanageable, fine, hair. I avoid products like the plague because I don&#x27;t want it to turn oily midday. However, this product does not make my hair greasy. It leaves it with a style and some volume and I have to say, I have not looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can never manage to get my hair to look good on it&#x27;s own and finally I&#x27;ve found a product that can help me with that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will forever buy this product. I cannot say enough good things about it. I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you John Frieda!</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good. I have medium to thick hair that is very flat and gets oily. This is a nice product that I found wasnt too smelly. I use it a few times a week, when I have time to blow dry my hair. I spray a bit on my crown, then blow dry. I notice that my hair does have more volume and body. I wish that you didnt need to blow dry in order for the product to work well. I dont have much time for that, but I do like the product when I use it. I have tried to just spray the product and not blow dry, but it doesnt do well for me like that. My hair stays full throughout the day when I use this, but the body does fall out a bit. I would buy this again, but I think a bottle will last me for several years!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that always falls flat, especially in the dry winter months. I have tried dozens of volumizing products, and this is the only one I have found that truly gives my hair the boost it needs. Thank you, John Frieda!</li>
            <li> Okay, I never write reviews and I take my hair VERY seriously. I&#x27;m usually really hard to please when it comes to products.  I have lots of medium thick hair, and it&#x27;s VERY long. .. Due to that it is heavy and really weighs if down... so normally it&#x27;s super flat unless I pin it up with hair pins. Now, I hate flat hair so I always would pin it up. I always wanted lots of body without doing that cause I wanted my hair to have that flow by just being down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First,  I love this product and I&#x27;ll explain why- but in my case I did need to do a little more along with using this spray... but this product made a huge difference for me, and from previous experiences without it ( and still using the other products and techniques I&#x27;m gonna mention) my hair would NEVER hold up. (I&#x27;m unsure if for people with thin and light hair if maybe just this spray is enough, but for me I needed a little more work. ) I saw some reviews of people not satisfied, but I can tell you what I did which left be satisfied all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this product and sprayed it on the roots and began blow drying (upside down), half way through it while it was mostly dry I sprayed this product on the roots again and finished blow drying (still upside down).  After I blow dried it I could see the roots were lifted a lot! I then teased the roots slightly ( and I mean just a tad,  which I usually have to do so much but this product really took that step down. ) after doing that I flipped my hair down again and sprayed it with light hair spray,  then flipped it back, and with a hair pick adjusted it how I wanted it- then sprayed it with freezing hair spray lightly ( at the roots) and that&#x27;s that! Was good all day,  even took a nap and still had body in my hair. Too make my hair even bigger next time I&#x27;m probably going to use freezing hairspray more on my roots as I tease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product didn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff and the sprays I use are light so my hair flowed fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apologize for the long review but thought I&#x27;d be detailed in what I did in hopes it can help someone!</li>
            <li> Great product. Good amount of life with little to no build up.</li>
            <li> Best root booster I&#x27;ve tried so far and I&#x27;ve tried lots.</li>
            <li> I could not locate this item at any local stores...perhaps discontinued?  Anyhow, I&#x27;m glad I was able to find and purchase it through Amazon.  I have fine hair.  This product does wonders for my fine hair. It gives it a lot of volume.  I love it!  I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I went a few days without using this stuff, and boy did I suddenly realize how much it had been helping me. Normally I take a shower, towel dry my hair, and then part it all over the place and spray this all over my roots. Then I blowdry upside down and voila - an extra 1/2&amp;#34; of volume that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This product gives much needed body to my fine, limp hair.  Hair is not stiff or sticky, but has much more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;!  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I have curly hair and I needed a softner for my hair prior to putting on hair product.  I love it and would recommend use with or without hair product because my curls come out natural looking and very curly with this product alone...</li>
            <li> I was unable to target the root area so I wasn&#x27;t able to get the left I had hoped for.  It felt like just using mousse everywhere so I didn&#x27;t see getting an improvement.</li>
            <li> Did nothing to lift my roots nor did it add volume to my hair. Have purchase several John Frieda products and most of the time I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This root booster gives my hair lots of lift without weighing it down or making it sticky. I love this styling product.</li>
            <li> I like the way this spray smells and it also feels weightless on my roots. I only wish the lift would last longer, because for my long hair it only lasts a few hours. Otherwise, this spray is the best thing for a homemade blowout.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a miracle product or anything, but it does give me some added volume. Works best if you use it before blow-drying your hair. A little expensive, but I&#x27;m not one to spend a lot of money on hair products.</li>
            <li> Not a fan. I have very fine hair and this product made it hard to style. OH well gave it a try</li>
            <li> This product is a hard to get &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;. If you have to re-wash your hair after applying this, I can&#x27;t see an up side. I really did want to love it, but sorry, I didn&#x27;t like the feel or look of my hair after using it. It leaves a waxy dullness that I can&#x27;t say looks attractive.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying this again, and I can&#x27;t in all honesty recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and this is the only product I have found that adds textures and fullness.</li>
            <li> It really lifts my roots. I have really fine and curly hair, and damaged for coloring... it makes my hair look fuller! love it!</li>
            <li> Really adds noticeable volume. Will be ordering more when I run out. Does not make my hair sticky or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> A good product that lives up to its name.  Very pleased with the results after using this.</li>
            <li> This is working well on my fine, thinning medium-short hair.  It gives my hair some fluffy lift where needed and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch like others do.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and fine without body or curl. I have spent a lot of money on various products over the years, all of which have either done a so-so job or been totally disappointing. This product works great for me. I spray it on the hair roots and then blow dry. This gives my hair lift where otherwise it would be lying flat against my head. I wear my hair short in a texturized hair cut style which adds some volume but this product makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. Now I can&#x27;t imagine my hair my without it.&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon because John Frieda seems to have changed the product now, or changed the spray mechanism.  I hate it when I like a product and it works for me, that the manufacturer changes it.  Glad Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> Does very well to lift hair. Could not find it in many stores that&#x27;s y I went on line</li>
            <li> Use after shampoo and before I put on the mousse. Keeps hair soft and very full. I have blonde, skinny hair that likes to hug my head and this gives me a lot volume when I use it with the Frieda Mousse. I love the products, not greasy or drying, and make my hair very shinny and full.  I do not have to use tons of it before it works....just a squirt down the part line and then the mousse. At least for me, great combo with these products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok -- I like that you can spray it on, and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy perfume or anything. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s way better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift for my cousin -- who thrives on it.  She has lovely silky straight hair that lies too flat.</li>
            <li> WITH MY THINNING HAIR, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT! IT GIVES MY HAIR BODY AND BOUNCE AND SHINE AND ACTS AS A STYLING LOTION AS WELL!</li>
            <li> I have thin, baby-fine hair, and this product actually gives it some lift. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, as are all of the John Frieda products. I have been using the SHEER BLONDE products for years. This is a great alternative to mousse as it does not dull the hair colour.</li>
            <li> This is an OK product.  I am forever searching for the product that will give me luxurious volume.  I think John Frieda products are good and I will always give a new one a try.  But, did it work, not really, not for me anyway.  I hope this doesn&#x27;t discourage people from giving this product a try.  I do have problem hair, thinning and baby fine and have found few products that can help me.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, frizzy, and has been dyed for 30 years. This product does add some volume. But what is even better, the result of the blow dry is smoother and closer to the hairdresser look than with other products. On wet hair I use cheap detangler. Then  I spray this product on damp hair after I dry the hair a for a couple of minutes. When almost dry, I use the round brush, with sections of hair to finish the drying process. This is the best my hair has ever turned out besides the salon.</li>
            <li> This root booster does what it says on my fine, stick straight hair.  Apply to roots while damp then blow dry and style.  Once my hair is dry I add a little high shine gloss for the polished look and to make it feel a bit softer.  The root booster adds the volume but it makes the hair feel just a tad dry, so my remedy is hair polish.  Enjoy:)!</li>
            <li> no any help to my hair</li>
            <li> I love John Frieda products.. quality yet affordable.  Thanks John Frieda!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference except in my pocketbook.</li>
            <li> This is the least effective volumizer or root booster I have ever tried. A solid disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to weigh my hair down even more than if I didn&#x27;t use anything at all. It also seems to make my hair flatter by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> My formerly thick hair has no body unless I use this. I&#x27;m glad to have discovered it. I wish they&#x27;d invent one to use daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try anything for roots, and although it did stand them up a little, it also seemed to dry them out a bit and then didn&#x27;t really last. My hair just became flat again very soon.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like makes your hair feel awful</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time and was as described!</li>
            <li> I should have known better not to buy John Frieda products, they should be called John Fried producst, firs of all, this thing makes your hair feel like straw, it takes out the shine and the softness making it look and feel dry and lifeless. I gave the product to a co-worker that I don&#x27;t like, that says a lot. Trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH, you have to cover your counters in the bathroom because it stains them, not a good product at all.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with this product as I love other John Frieda products.  Maybe I expected too much but I didn&#x27;t get the volume I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This is root lift that really works. I have been using it for two years and it is my go-to product. I have fine hair that is just below shoulder length, and it is hard to get volume into my hair and keep it there. This product does work well, and I can see the difference when I don&#x27;t use it. I find it&#x27;s best to spray roots after toweling off most moisture, then hold your head down toward your waist to blow dry the roots. This gives more volume. After that I can either set my hair for curls or use a curling dryer brush with mousse or styling gel. Sometimes I let the rest of my hair air dry or pile it on top of my head to dry, which helps bend the roots up for the volume problem. I have not tried another root lift product because I like this one so much, so I can&#x27;t compare if it&#x27;s better or worse than others. My local Fry&#x27;s store stopped carrying this, so either I will have to buy on Amazon or at another local store.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get my package and because I&#x27;ve used this product before.  However, this might have been a bottle gone bad.  It did nothing for my hair as far as volume and left my hair sticky.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for my super thick and heavy hair that usually has no volume! It takes longer to blow dry hair with this and makes your hair not silky soft, but the volume it gives is so worth it! Not to mention, I slept overnight and my hair still had at least half the volume the whole next day. Great product for the price and comes in a large bottle!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product.  My hair is very fine.  I use this on the roots when I blow dry my hair.  Then I set my hair on velcro rollers and spray a little more Root Booster on the root.  My hair has more body and looks good for a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed that this works!  Terrific stuff.</li>
            <li> Having fine hair, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of volumizing sprays. This one does the trick and at such a great price. My prior experience with less-expensive hair products hasn&#x27;t always been great, but I&#x27;m impressed with John Frieda.</li>
            <li> I like this because it works and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling too wet. I usually spray it on the top and use my comb to make it &#x27;poof&#x27; a little.</li>
            <li> Fullfills its promises. Really helps if you have straight hair or too long hair: creates build and volume for real and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair looking or feeling like it has a ton of products. Looks and feels very natural. As if you were born with great hair, with volume and shine!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely perfect for flat heads. My hair is fine and silky and completely devoid of volume. I always use a volumnizing shampoo and conditioner followed up by a volumnizing spray. I normally purchase these products from a salon and pay a lot more for the privilege.&lt;br /&gt;I had run out of the Paul Mitchell Volumnizing Spray that I usually use and bought this product in a pinch at CVS. I was hoping this would at least nominally work but my expectations weren&#x27;t high.&lt;br /&gt;This actually ended up working as well as my usual brand at easily half the price. I applied it to the roots of my freshly washed and towel dried hair and let my blow dryer create the adequate volume I needed at a low cool setting. In five minutes my normally droopy hair looked fuller and had more lift. My hair didn&#x27;t have a lacquer feel to it and it had a nice scent which was subtle and fresh. Overall, my hair looked great and kept its shape in hot, really humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product that does what it promises at a reasonable price point.</li>
