            <li>Still a nice set</li>
            <li>All of the popular shampoos just didn&#x27;t work for me anymore</li>

            <li> and I will use it until its gone, but next time I&#x27;m going back to pink!</li>
            <li> I used a lot of other organic and natural shampoos, but it is hard to find sulfate free shampoo that actually suds and gets the crap out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> They have watered down and altered the formula.</li>
            <li> If I could give it negative stars I would.</li>

            <li> So.. I am not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> (Pantene, Herbal Essence, etc) and would make my head itch like crazy.  </li>

            <li> love this brand, smells great and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Love product and received the product sooner than I yjoughy</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this duo of Enjoy. Especially the conditioner, which has a mint smell to it and leaves a cool refreshing feel to your scalp. My hair also looks amazing and shiny after use!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  I also like the fact that Amazon offers this product so I do not have to buy it from a salon.</li>
            <li> This is not the same shampoo &amp; conditioner that you get at the salon! They have watered down and altered the formula. Totally stripped and damaged my hair. If I could give it negative stars I would.</li>
            <li> I prefer the luxurious shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I like the pink ENJOY duo better. This one does not leave my hair as soft, and the conditioner can give your head a tingly sensation, which is okay sometimes, but not my personal favorite! Still a nice set and I will use it until its gone, but next time I&#x27;m going back to pink!</li>
            <li> The product itself works well. However, I returned it because I do not care for the smell. It smells mediciney, like mouthwash</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner!  It has a minty smell that is so rejuvenating in the morning.  All of the popular shampoos just didn&#x27;t work for me anymore (Pantene, Herbal Essence, etc) and would make my head itch like crazy.  I used a lot of other organic and natural shampoos, but it is hard to find sulfate free shampoo that actually suds and gets the crap out of your hair.  Enjoy cleans very well &amp; I have been using it for years now.</li>
            <li> Great value. Love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and rinse.</li>
            <li> Very good price! Good seller.</li>
            <li> Fabulous deal, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Finally found the liter size of my favorite shampoo/conditioner!!  Also picked up some pumps for ease of use at a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great products. Be sure to procure a pump for the bottles. They are large and heavy to lift each time you need to usesome product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products now for a couple of years.  My hair was thinning, and this was recommended by my hair stylist.  It does work, and I&#x27;ve found my hair back to the thickness it was before.</li>
            <li> Did not receive the combo only the shampoo..</li>
            <li> I tried to save money again and find something to replace my WEN Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner but alas, nothing compares to WEN. This stuff makes my hair somewhat frizzy, an I have really fine, straight hair that usually doesn&#x27;t do &#x27;frizzy&#x27; unless I&#x27;m in Hawaii. So.. I am not happy with this product at all. I just really wish I hadn&#x27;t went for it and bought the largest bottles since I am unemployed currently and am on a very tight budget, so now I&#x27;m stuck using something that just does not do good by me. :(</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been buying from my salon at a fraction of the price. Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditioner for fine colored hair I have tried!</li>
            <li> good shampoo products and conditioner great</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look and feel healthier. The main reason I got it is because I feel like I lose a lot of hair and I&#x27;m hoping this helps prevent that. I have been using enjoy for years and I love it.</li>
