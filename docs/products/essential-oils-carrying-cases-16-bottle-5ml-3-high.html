            <li>HOWEVER, I&#x27;m okay with it because it does the job</li>

            <li> There is just enough room to hold them- not too tight or too loose.  </li>
            <li> The case is just a small, not super-sturdy cloth essential oil bottle holder.  </li>
            <li> I got the black and gray box because I don&#x27;t like too flashy colors and this holds 16 of the 5 or 15 ml bottles very well.  </li>

            <li> Fit the 15ml oils perfectly! 30ml fit, but with difficulty closing the zipper.</li>
            <li> Does the trick!  I opted for the smaller size, versus the 30-bottle carrying case, because I feel it&#x27;s sturdier.  Lots of padding and protection for your essential oils!</li>
