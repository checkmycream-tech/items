            <li>I have used Joop for many years.  </li>

            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>I do not believe this to be the authentic Joop Eau De Toilette fragrance.</li>
            <li>My husband wears the mens version (which I LOVE)</li>
            <li>get a lot of compliments ...a nice light scent...</li>
            <li>Sexy, heavenly perfume .</li>
            <li>I just Love it.</li>
            <li>My mom and me we both love it .</li>
            <li>I still love this scent.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this many times and each time it is such a delightful fragrance and brings you my mood.</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite of mine for years, always satisfied</li>
            <li>I am glad to be able to get it since it was supposedly discontinued.</li>
            <li>Many layers of scent...</li>
            <li>My hubby loves the sexy scent.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>, what more can you ask for, ty.</li>
            <li>You need to find a better way to ship perfume.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without my Joop and the price is great.</li>
            <li>It is light, not overpowering, but it has brought many compliments over the years.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My mistake was getting overly excited at the price and ordering my FAVORITE scent without reading the customer comments.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong and I myself can&#x27;t smell it when on me.  </li>
            <li>i love my joop and shipping was so quick like everything i order from amazon  </li>
            <li>No wonder it was priced so cheaply.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Valentines/5th</li>
            <li>My wife loves this perfume and it is not always available in stores.</li>
            <li>I first came across Joop when a co-worker had it on--it was love at first sniff!!  </li>
            <li>So I was so excited when I found it on here and to mae</li>
            <li>The distinctive scent and it&#x27;s uniquely curved bottle that is all Joop.</li>
            <li>I will pay full price at the mall to make sure I get the real thing.</li>
            <li>lightly sweet but a bit spicy.</li>
            <li>I really fell in love with this scent.</li>
            <li>She likes the mild fragrance which lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Thats exactly what I did, threw it in the garbage!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wished, but still very pleasant and fresh.</li>
            <li>Well worth</li>
            <li>I have worn Joop for nearly 20 years, never having found anything I like better.  </li>
            <li>Well how much do I have to spray on to even get a familiar hint of what this used to smell like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not flowery, just the right amount of musk.  </li>
            <li>This is the true scent of Joops, light, vanilla, scent with soft woodsy undertones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s suitable for different ages.</li>
            <li>From now on Amazon will be where I look first for this perfume.</li>
            <li>A gift for my niece,  her favorite scent form back in the day.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for the first time in a Paris perfumery while in development.</li>
            <li>The UK purchase has more definate \\&quot;tones\\&quot;, much stronger/longer lasting qualities.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to wear it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find this perfume in the stores for a long time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  used  the perfume for a long time, I came across it  in Europe, now I must say that the price here in the States is so much more reasonable</li>
            <li>But I can sometimes find it at certain Walgreen&#x27;s locations.</li>
            <li>My bottle got here on time, it was not broken and it sprays well.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommended.</li>
            <li>The bottle is Joop!, but the contents absolutely are not.</li>
            <li>It arrived in plenty of time to give to my daughter and she was absolutely awed.  </li>
            <li>From a very grateful&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still my favorite but increasingly more difficult to find.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive the package in just a few days.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes it just smelled like something cheap my grandma ordered from Avon.</li>
            <li>Sensual yet not heavy.</li>
            <li>This perfum smelt abrasive and old like it had been sitting around for awhile.</li>
            <li>It has a sexy feminine scent that is long lasting and not heavy- can be worn everyday.  </li>
            <li>The outside of the bottle smelled like old vomit.</li>
            <li>It is not your usual flowery, sweet scent</li>
            <li>It is my daughter&#x27;s favorite and it is very hard to find Women&#x27;s Joop locally.  </li>

            <li> It is my daughter&#x27;s favorite and it is very hard to find Women&#x27;s Joop locally.  </li>
            <li> I will never understand why the women&#x27;s bottle is clear &amp; the Men&#x27;s Joop bottle is PINK?!  </li>
            <li> Must have been on the shelves way too long.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this typing the required is to long</li>
            <li> And it lasts all day or night long.</li>
            <li> This seller (who should be ashamed) is obviously aware of the poor quality of their product and has it priced to move.</li>
            <li> The entire transaction of this sale went extremely well!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase my fragrances overseas and the Joop I get in the UK is definately not the same as the fragrance I recently purchased online.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> the bottle was half empty when I got it.</li>
            <li> But, if you savor heavy orientals, maybe you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was so harsh</li>
            <li> Order Joop and receive in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Usually just wear it on weekends...</li>
            <li> This has been my signature scent for the past 25 years</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find but it will always be one of my favorites</li>
            <li> I have worn Joop ever since I can remember (got addicted while living in Germany) and still get compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li> Not like an expensive perfume you just received.  </li>
            <li> This smells like stale alcohol, not Joop!</li>

            <li> Yuck scent. No wonder it was priced so cheaply. But, if you savor heavy orientals, maybe you&#x27;ll like it. I immediately resold the product on Craig&#x27;s List at a loss.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend.She likes it</li>
            <li> Item as described.  This is the true scent of Joops, light, vanilla, scent with soft woodsy undertones. Prompt delivery.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I love Joop for Women.  I have been using it for many years.  I always get compliments on it when wearing it.  It is not too strong and I myself can&#x27;t smell it when on me.  Very light and refreshing fragnance. I am so glad that I can find it on Amazon as it is no longer sold in stores.</li>
            <li> And you know what they say.  Happy wife, happy life.  She smells great and I like making her happy.  Top recommendation.</li>
            <li> I have been using for years. Love this perfume</li>
            <li> Well how much do I have to spray on to even get a familiar hint of what this used to smell like. Terrible price for food coloring in water.</li>
            <li> I love Joop Woman! Always have. But I can never find it where I shop for my perfume. I was told once that it was discontinued. But I can sometimes find it at certain Walgreen&#x27;s locations. From now on Amazon will be where I look first for this perfume. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have used Joop for many years.  It&#x27;s not flowery, just the right amount of musk.  I don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have worn Joop ever since I can remember (got addicted while living in Germany) and still get compliments on the scent. It is not your usual flowery, sweet scent so if that is what you expect from a woman&#x27;s perfume, don&#x27;t buy Joop. Can&#x27;t live without my Joop and the price is great. Great seller.</li>
            <li> Used this years ago . It still smells the same. Nice price &amp; free 2 day shipping . I will never understand why the women&#x27;s bottle is clear &amp; the Men&#x27;s Joop bottle is PINK?!  Lol  Smells nice though!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother. She likes the mild fragrance which lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My bottle got here on time, it was not broken and it sprays well. The scent is as I remembered from years ago when I used to get it from Walmart. I got the 3.4 oz. and let me tell ya... It is a really good sized bottle! Well worth it&#x27;s money. Sure made my day! Fantastic Valentines/5th Anniversary gift from my husband! :)  I am very happy with the product. :)</li>
            <li> Arrived in time for Christmas. My wife loves this perfume and it is not always available in stores. The larger bottle should last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> love this. i&#x27;m a 90&#x27;s girl and this brings back memories.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used  the perfume for a long time, I came across it  in Europe, now I must say that the price here in the States is so much more reasonable</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; service</li>
            <li> Sure wish I knew before I ordered this perfume that there was no returns!  It smelled terrible!  Must have been on the shelves way too long. Talk about throwing money away!  Thats exactly what I did, threw it in the garbage!</li>
            <li> The entire transaction of this sale went extremely well! I was very excited to receive the package in just a few days. However, I was disappointed in the product itself. I do not believe this to be the authentic Joop Eau De Toilette fragrance. I usually purchase my fragrances overseas and the Joop I get in the UK is definately not the same as the fragrance I recently purchased online. The UK purchase has more definate \\&quot;tones\\&quot;, much stronger/longer lasting qualities.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying \\&quot;do not purchase\\&quot;. I just prefer the UK&#x27;s version of Joop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this in the local stores here for the longest time. My husband wears the mens version (which I LOVE) and I had seen the womens version once but when I went back to get a bottle for myself, it was gone. So I was so excited when I found it on here and to mae it even better, it was on sale! lol I love it. Its a great smelling perume that sticks with me.</li>
            <li> This is the only place I can get this for an almost 2 for 1 price and since she swears by this fragrance, I can keep her happy for Mother&#x27;s Day and Christmas.  I can also get them without having to go outside of the US and my sister and I can split the price and get her something else without overspending for the holidays.</li>
            <li> I first came across Joop when a co-worker had it on--it was love at first sniff!!  I had to ask her what scent she had on.  That was over 10 years ago and I have been wearing it ever since.  It has a sexy feminine scent that is long lasting and not heavy- can be worn everyday.  Every time I have it on someone (both male &amp; female) ask me what scent I have on.....even the FedEx deliveryman asked me!  It has become my signature scent.  I would recommend this perfume for both day and evening wear.     CapeCod washashore from NY</li>
            <li> AMAZON is AMAZING!!!! it is good to know that this scent is available and affordable. this is no longer available in stores and easy to access!!!</li>
            <li> My Sin, Ombre Rose and Joop, these are my scents.  Over my life time, they have been a signature of mine.  Absolutely beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this scent!  Have been wearing it now for about 20 years!  Always have people asking what I&#x27;m wearing!  It&#x27;s a nice musk for women</li>
            <li> The lesson here is you can&#x27;t get the quality you are used to at a drastically reduced price. My mistake was getting overly excited at the price and ordering my FAVORITE scent without reading the customer comments. This product falls WAY short of my expectations. The outside of the bottle smelled like old vomit. The perfume smelled like rubbing alcohol and burned my skin. After a few minutes it just smelled like something cheap my grandma ordered from Avon. THIS IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO JOOP! AS I KNOW IT. This bottle is being tossed in the trash as no returns are possible. I regret this purchase and my $26 lesson. I will pay full price at the mall to make sure I get the real thing. This seller (who should be ashamed) is obviously aware of the poor quality of their product and has it priced to move. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mum, as we can&#x27;t get in Ireland anymore. She was absolutely thrilled. She loves it. Will be back again for me.</li>
            <li> I buy one every year for my wife...Don&#x27;t like this typing the required is to long, I will be skipping this part next time.</li>
            <li> Several years ago my girlfriend gave me JOOP as a gift.  For years I couldn&#x27;t wear any fragrance because my husband would get a head ache - JOOP doesn&#x27;t - so this is my only fragrance - and it is still commented on by folks.  I love it and will continue to wear it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> the price was unbeatable! I love it! I haven&#x27;t been able to find this perfume in the stores for a long time!</li>
            <li> My Grandma has always used Joop (20+ years). I can&#x27;t wait for her to open this for Christmas! This makes a perfect gift for older women.</li>
            <li> A gift for my niece,  her favorite scent form back in the day.  She loves it.  Arrived on time neatly packaged.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> This,is the only perfume I wear...get a lot of compliments ...a nice light scent... Usually just wear it on weekends...so a bottle will last me a year!</li>
            <li> Loved this scent for many years.</li>
            <li> Great price, product and service.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> Great budget fragrance - my favorite for this price range. Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wished, but still very pleasant and fresh.</li>
            <li> Sexy, heavenly perfume . It lasts on your skin . I just Love it. It&#x27;s suitable for different ages. My mom and me we both love it . Absolutely recommended.</li>
            <li> I still love this scent.</li>
            <li> Love this, I don&#x27;t know what I will do when resellers run out!</li>
            <li> This is not the Joop scent I know.  It&#x27;s not wearable.  My boyfriend and  I gagged. It&#x27;s not returnable.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this many times and each time it is such a delightful fragrance and brings you my mood. Sensual yet not heavy. lightly sweet but a bit spicy. Very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite of mine for years, always satisfied</li>
            <li> My husband just bought me this perfume for Christmas and I LOVE it!! It is my new favorite!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i love my joop and shipping was so quick like everything i order from amazon  thank you</li>
            <li> Great perfume at a super price! This is hard to find.Amazon came thru again with product and speed of shipment.Good job.</li>
            <li> This perfum smelt abrasive and old like it had been sitting around for awhile. It was so harsh I didn&#x27;tfeel like I could wear it.  Not like an expensive perfume you just received.  A total waste of money. I will not be buying from this seller again, whatsoever!!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent and it does a good, but not overpowering job.  I am glad to be able to get it since it was supposedly discontinued.</li>
            <li> Purchased for the first time in a Paris perfumery while in development. Still my favorite but increasingly more difficult to find.  Many layers of scent... always popular and not boring.</li>
            <li> This has been my signature scent for the past 25 years and I still get compliments on it. Evening is best to wear joop as it is a strong scent. And it lasts all day or night long. I spray it just before bedtime after a shower or bath too. My hubby loves the sexy scent.</li>
            <li> As described. Excellent value. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I get compliments every time I wear this. I love it. It&#x27;s hard to find but it will always be one of my favorites</li>
            <li> Order Joop and receive in just a few days. I love this stuff everytime I wear it someone always comments on it, what more can you ask for, ty.</li>
            <li> The distinctive scent and it&#x27;s uniquely curved bottle that is all Joop. Great perfume at an unbeatable price. My wife loves it!</li>
            <li> I really fell in love with this scent. There was nothing that I didn&#x27;t like about Joop. I would tell all my friends about it</li>
            <li> I have worn Joop for nearly 20 years, never having found anything I like better.  It is light, not overpowering, but it has brought many compliments over the years.  It is also a good price here.  The best is now hearing, \\&quot;Grandma, you always smell so good!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The bottle is Joop!, but the contents absolutely are not. This smells like stale alcohol, not Joop! perfume.</li>
            <li> the bottle was half empty when I got it.You need to find a better way to ship perfume.Wouldn&#x27;t order perfume from you again.</li>
            <li> Smells good, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find Joop at Amazon!!  It is my daughter&#x27;s favorite and it is very hard to find Women&#x27;s Joop locally.  It arrived in plenty of time to give to my daughter and she was absolutely awed.  Thank you for the great service and for helping me make my Daughter&#x27;s Birthday a great success.  From a very grateful&lt;br /&gt;  Carolyn Maddox</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!  Just what the lady wanted!!!</li>
