            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>was satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>In love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>bought after falling in love with smell from sample-got the body butter which is luxurious and</li>
            <li>Nice and light.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I received a Twilight Woods gift set awhile ago on Christmas, and I quickly fell in love with the scent!</li>
            <li>so I guess it was worth the wait!!</li>
            <li>This is mild &amp; nice.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the fact that I can get it so quickly!</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s light and feminine.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, it&#x27;s light and not too flowery.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but this seems to carry so much alcohol.</li>
            <li>It is light, not bold, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the woodsy, light mist.</li>
            <li>if ur looking for a nice room spray or mainly for your linens, then this works just fine</li>
            <li>Its strong at first, then fades into a very sweet almost fruity smell.</li>
            <li>I love this scent so much!  </li>
            <li>If you want something light, check out Sweet Pea or Carried Away.  </li>
            <li>By far one of my favorite scents!</li>
            <li>My husband loved the scent and it was a very big hit.</li>
            <li>l its sorta musky sweet</li>
            <li>She wants me to order some more.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>and I found that it is my new favorite body spray.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it is an amazing fragrance that every girl who loves woodsy, deep, musky fragrances should consider!!!  </li>
            <li>The price and shipping is economical and affordable.</li>
            <li>other than that it smells good, my sister loves it</li>
            <li>It was the right sent to get her however it is a matter of opinion</li>
            <li>but it seems to me that the body spray is just too large!</li>
            <li>It only smells good to those who are over 70 years old.</li>
            <li>but I was quite surprised because the smell is sweet, sweet but</li>
            <li>in particular I&#x27;m dying to sweet smells.</li>
            <li>I bought two bottles and I am not sorry I did.</li>
            <li>My sister love this as a present</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take a lot to smell it and it stays with you the whole day into the night!</li>
            <li>I get it everytime at bath body works but at a way higher price.</li>
            <li>The price was perfect (I ordered several other scents) but shipping time left something to be desired.</li>
            <li>but you would only need one spritz just because the smell gets too strong.</li>
            <li>It smells realy good and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and will last a while.</li>
            <li>I got this fast</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this scent a few years back when the body lotion was gifted to me by a friend.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I LIKE SO MUCH</li>
            <li>It really does not last too long, although my friend said she could smell it( after I had it one for hours) and commented how nice it is, but I could not smell it on myself.</li>
            <li>i think this makes a fine room or linen spray, but for me personally the scent is a little too sweet or musky to wear..</li>
            <li>This is exactly the same body mist I usually buy from BBW for a higher price ($14.00)</li>
            <li>I leave the house for work an hour early and by the time I get home 8 hours later I still can smell it.</li>
            <li>smell of this perfume is nice but it is so faint</li>
            <li>My previous purchase of this item lasted much longer .</li>

            <li> smell of this perfume is nice but it is so faint</li>
            <li> My previous purchase of this item lasted much longer .</li>
            <li> For some reason the smell doesnt last long at all.</li>
            <li> Bath and Body Works body sprays are very long lasting!</li>
            <li> It is not too strong,the smell does not last for very long .</li>
            <li> But this products scent is in between, it&#x27;s not too strong and not too faint.</li>
            <li> You can wear it behind your ears and on the back of your wrists for just the right amount of fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I brought it to gym class with me to use afterwards, and all the girls near my locker used up half the bottle!  </li>
            <li> It has lasted me a very long time and the smell stays with you for hours.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t like faint scented products, I enjoy stronger scents.</li>
            <li> buy this cologne really curious</li>
            <li> I am dark complected</li>
            <li> but I wear it all year round.</li>
            <li> For everyday use.</li>
            <li> I hardly use it because I feel as though I am spraying alcohol on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering, instead it&#x27;s a subtle, feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say.</li>
            <li> Ill deff start buying it from here.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells terrible!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like. Smells very good and is refreshing after a shower.</li>
            <li> I am dark complected so I tend to lean towards scents that are a bit heavier and spicy. A lot of reviews say they save this for cooler weather but I wear it all year round. The price was perfect (I ordered several other scents) but shipping time left something to be desired. Package showed up without any damage so I guess it was worth the wait!! I don&#x27;t think everyone can pull off this scent but my body chemistry mixes perfectly with it!</li>
            <li> I love this scent so much!  It is very deep and woodsy!  It is perfect for nighttime.  You can wear it behind your ears and on the back of your wrists for just the right amount of fragrance.  I like how it is not a girly smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell manly either.  It is my favorite body spray (that I own).  I brought it to gym class with me to use afterwards, and all the girls near my locker used up half the bottle!  I should buy more...  Anyway, it is an amazing fragrance that every girl who loves woodsy, deep, musky fragrances should consider!!!  If you want something light, check out Sweet Pea or Carried Away.  Enjoy this Fragrance Mist!!!!</li>
            <li> By far one of my favorite scents! Bath and Body Works body sprays are very long lasting! You can&#x27;t beat this price seeing how it costs $14 at Bath and Body Works and on their website.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but this seems to carry so much alcohol. I hardly use it because I feel as though I am spraying alcohol on me.</li>
            <li> My husband loved the scent and it was a very big hit.</li>
            <li> smells so nice. Love this item</li>
            <li> my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> It is a great price and a fabulous smell. My grand daughters love it too! So I keep an extra around.</li>
            <li> love the price and smell</li>
            <li> This is probably the best smelling body spray I have ever bought. So glad I did, as I wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect. Just smells beautiful / lovely!!!!, makes me feel good!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite it smells so good</li>
            <li> it smells good but you would only need one spritz just because the smell gets too strong. other than that it smells good, my sister loves it</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same body mist I usually buy from BBW for a higher price ($14.00) but I only paid $8.64 including shipping. It arrived on time and was well packaged. I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s light and feminine. If you want to save money I recommend you buy it here.</li>
            <li> I got this fast it don&#x27;t leak and I found that it is my new favorite body spray. Very happy.</li>
            <li> i think this makes a fine room or linen spray, but for me personally the scent is a little too sweet or musky to wear.. it needs vanilla or lilac to balance it out. if ur looking for a nice room spray or mainly for your linens, then this works just fine and they give u a lot at a great price. just dont recommend it as a body spray lol</li>
            <li> This is a very nice fragrance. It is light, not bold, and smells wonderful. It really does not last too long, although my friend said she could smell it( after I had it one for hours) and commented how nice it is, but I could not smell it on myself. I bought two bottles and I am not sorry I did. It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, fresh fragrance</li>
            <li> For some reason the smell doesnt last long at all. My previous purchase of this item lasted much longer .</li>
            <li> Excellent Body mist for my wife! She like it!!</li>
            <li> Nice, light fragrance, but doesn&#x27;t stay.  I like it because it is understated, and won&#x27;t knock people over at the grocery store!</li>

            <li> Love it Love it! Frangrance is nice asweet and robust. Great price too!</li>
            <li> It appears to be generic</li>
            <li> I received a Twilight Woods gift set awhile ago on Christmas, and I quickly fell in love with the scent! I typically don&#x27;t like faint scented products, I enjoy stronger scents. But this products scent is in between, it&#x27;s not too strong and not too faint. It&#x27;s the perfect medium and it smells wonderful! Great price for a nice size fragrance. Great combined with the Twilight Woods lotions, and body wash.</li>
            <li> will purchase this again. Smells soooo good. I bought it for my daughter as a gift. She wants me to order some more.</li>
            <li> Light and fragrant!  Love it.</li>
            <li> buy this cologne really curious but I was quite surprised because the smell is sweet, sweet but if exagerancion, I recommend it. in particular I&#x27;m dying to sweet smells. I loved it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the fact that I can get it so quickly! And with safe packaging. It has lasted me a very long time and the smell stays with you for hours.</li>
            <li> It was okay. It arrived on time and was packaged well but the scent was not for me. Sorry to say. I still have it and use it to fragrance the room though.</li>
            <li> Smell nice but not so nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this perfume is nice but it is so faint and I even like the smell. It is not too strong,the smell does not last for very long . I will not buy it again. .</li>
            <li> I use this product. It smells great.&lt;br /&gt;The price was good&lt;br /&gt;I was satisfied with the product&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend it</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite scent. Its strong at first, then fades into a very sweet almost fruity smell. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent a few years back when the body lotion was gifted to me by a friend. I&#x27;m a huge fan of the woodsy, light mist. Everyone who smells it on me asks about it and instantly becomes a fan as well. It&#x27;s not overpowering, instead it&#x27;s a subtle, feminine fragrance. I&#x27;m definitely HAPPY I made this purchase. The bottle is huge and will last a while. The price and shipping is economical and affordable. Megabyteme will be added to my favorites!</li>
            <li> Amazing price and just what I was wanting.  Will be ordering more soon! Love my body mist and goes perfect with matching lotion.</li>
            <li> In love this fragrance. In bought the coordinating body lotion and shower gel at the same time. In use them all on the days in use them. In have 95% left in my body spray,  33% left in my lotion, and 65% left in my shower gel. Maybe the sizes of the product could be adjusted? Granted everyone may use the products in different proportions,  but it seems to me that the body spray is just too large!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Doesn&#x27;t take a lot to smell it and it stays with you the whole day into the night!</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister for the holiday season and she absolutely loves it.  It was the right sent to get her however it is a matter of opinion so I would suggest that you go to a store and see which one that you like.</li>
            <li> Twlight Woods fine fragrance mist is a good scent.  price is good. Was well packaged.  Will order it again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> bought after falling in love with smell from sample-got the body butter which is luxurious and then 2 bttles of the spray for the final touch</li>
