            <li>I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li>/&gt;While testing Skinology&#x27;s complimentary bottle, we loved the glass dropper.  </li>
            <li>- I use it for massage and relaxation because I love the smell of it.</li>

            <li>I really enjoy putting this in my oil diffuser, and letting my house smell like summer time!</li>
            <li>This product has many uses, which even I haven&#x27;t tried yet.</li>
            <li>Better yet, lemons are one of my favorite smells.</li>
            <li>Who couldn&#x27;t use more of that?  </li>
            <li>It is a perfect treatment for my dry, itchy scalp , as well as my cuticles.</li>
            <li>As a parent who&#x27;s child likes to help them clean, making my own cleaners is important.  </li>
            <li>I  just love the huge size of this bottle as I use lemon oil for an assortment of purposes from cleaning the home to beauty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great natural household cleaner.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed more of that either, but I haven&#x27;t been ultra consistent, to be perfectly honest.  </li>
            <li>I received a complimentary bottle of this to give my honest opinion on.</li>
            <li>complimentary  to try it and give my honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and many different ways to use it</li>
            <li>It comes with a dropper for easy measure that makes it easy when you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not to strong.  </li>
            <li>so I liked the nice clean fresh lemon scent right away.  </li>
            <li>I usually always have a candle burning because I just love having something that smells so delicious.</li>
            <li>ALSO HUGE</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of citrus limon scents.</li>
            <li>The face wash only has three ingredients which I think is great.</li>
            <li>But quality is extremely important and there is NO governing body to check the oils and protect us from people selling untested, sub par oils, oils that have been diluted with a carrier oil, etc.  </li>
            <li>and I can reassure you that this a great quality essential oil</li>
            <li>Grate size and the dropper is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This really is a very nice sized bottle and great tasting and smelling essential oil that I believe everyone needs to add to their collection of essential oils.</li>
            <li>A very fresh scent, that is not over powering.</li>
            <li>It has a nice strong lemony smell but it is clear.  </li>
            <li>Worth trying!</li>
            <li>The BEST is to find someone who has a third party keeping them &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34;, but WOW, THEN is when the prices go thru the roof!  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to see how I would like it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this to clean our oven, microwave, and refrigerator</li>
            <li>Not only did it clean my refrigerator, oven and microwave, but it also leaves a pleasant citrus smell.</li>
            <li>Works great in my Essential oil diffuser to make my house smell fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>You can use it to clean and deodorize your kitchen and bath.  </li>
            <li>To clean my counters in kitchen</li>
            <li>Pure Lemon Essential Oil smells great and even tasted fine in my water as lemon water.</li>
            <li>Finally a lemon oil that you can ingest safely this bottle is huge and i love that i can put it my water...</li>
            <li>i now have a good supply to last me...</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell of fresh lemons and this one smells just like them.</li>
            <li>I love this oil so much.</li>
            <li>The aroma of fresh squeezed lemons filled the house.  </li>
            <li>Generous sized bottle every bit as good as the smaller, expensive&lt;br /&gt;brands</li>
            <li>Clearly that&#x27;s true of THIS oil! :-)  </li>
            <li>Smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Great product, I add it to my water everyday and really enjoy the flavor.</li>
            <li>I love to use lemon essential oil for so many things.</li>
            <li>A pure oil will dothis to plastic which is why good oils aren&#x27;t generally sold with rubber dropper lids cuz they will cause rubber to deteriorate.  </li>
            <li>It is necessary to mention that the bottle is huge - 4 ounces!!</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like fresh squeezed lemons!</li>
            <li>The Skinology Lemon Essential Oil is a huge bottle compared to most and affordable.</li>
            <li>In exchange for my unbiased honest opinion I received a 4oz bottle of Skinology Beauty Solutions Lemon Essential Oil at a promotional cost.</li>
            <li>I find it just perfect and very invigorating to say the least.</li>
            <li>#34;top quality&amp;#34; fresh oil.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t have that fresh lemony smell.</li>
            <li>so I thought I would boil a stock pot of water with some lemon essential oils in it and get some moisture in the air as well as a nice fresh lemon scent.  </li>
            <li>I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>From my experience, not all essential oils come with their own dropper.  </li>
            <li>It smells like fresh squeezed lemons.</li>
            <li>Smells like freshly squeezed lemons.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t report on that at the moment, but I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Not only has it lightened scars, but it makes my skin fee germ free and clean !</li>
            <li>comes right off.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using any kind of Lemon Essential Oil</li>
            <li>I am happy so far with the Skinology 100% Pure Lemon Essential Oil and can&#x27;t wait to try all of these recipes!</li>

            <li>I was given the opportunity to test this Skinology 100 percent pure Lemon Essential Oil and give my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am now reasonably certain I can put it in my diffuser without gunking it up with carriers oils!  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m generally a very committed Amazon Prime buyer!  </li>

            <li>This is one of the many highly recommended essential oils that is in the Skinology line of beauty solutions.  </li>
            <li>We use vinegar, water, and lemon essential oils to clean most surfaces in the house, especially the microwave and</li>

            <li>essential oils generally should be light and evaporate quite quickly, but there ARE exceptions so...  </li>
            <li>To clean the shower  put 40 drops of lemon oil mixed with 20 drops of tea tree oil and water in a 16 oz.</li>
            <li>the more pure an oil is the less residue it leaves.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more Skinology 100 percent pure Lemon Essential Oil in the future.</li>
            <li>Lemon Essential Oil arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Lemon essential oil can be used in many different ways.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got COPD and after careful selection and about two months of diffusion I&#x27;ve been forgetting to take my Spiriva inhaler at night except maybe two nights a week and have been breathing fine...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ok, a bit heavy...</li>
            <li>You just add some to a water bottle and it not only is it a powerful disinfectant and antibacterial cleanser</li>
            <li>I received this complimentary lemon essential oil for testing and reviewing purposes</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the lemon essential oil , and I really like the experience.</li>
            <li>For a very soft citrus scent to them.  </li>
            <li>and if you keep it upright you&#x27;re probably OK as long as you are using the oil up and not leaving the rubber gasket as a seal for very long!  </li>
            <li>Itâ€™s important to keep harsh chemicals away from high contact surfaces like your kitchen.</li>
            <li>Huge size will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE diffusing lemon during the day mixed with other oils I need!  </li>
            <li>You can use the essential oil as a mild cleaner that packs a big punch as a disinfectant and antibacterial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Once you get your Skinology 100% Pure Lemon Essential Oil</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle and it should last for a while.</li>
            <li>yes you can ingest certain essential oils.  </li>
            <li>It is great to apply to the bottoms of feet and chest to help with cold symptom relief.</li>
            <li>and I am really hoping it will help with my adult acne that I am constantly covering up.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and enjoy every drop of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently been using lemon oil for scar treatment and really like it .</li>
            <li>Droppers make the use of essential oils so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>my house pets and Lemon essential oil can make a real difference.  </li>
            <li>This will last forever and the dropper it comes with is very convenient.</li>
            <li>use all natural cleaners</li>
            <li>my 37 year old granddaughter is drinking it because she had the flu; lemons healing properties are well established.</li>
            <li>You can actually drop a few drops in your garbage disposal and make it smell better.</li>
            <li>Good produce for the price, but the lemon scent smells a bit too much like some artificial lemon scents.</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as others, and not crazy expensive too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I would be comfortable to use it in anything that I would put on my body.</li>
            <li>-thats exactly what I expected from this product.</li>
            <li>No, I am trying out some different uses for the 100% Pure Lemon Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li>I have really wanted to try lemon essential oil since a friend of mine told me she lost 10lbs in a month changing nothing except adding 2-3 drops of lemon essential oil to her glass of water in the morning</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m going as natural as I can starting with an ALMOST completely paleo diet.  </li>
            <li>Especially if you have some sort of infection or cavities the coconut oil can&#x27;t be beat and the lemon is just a tasty boost to the antimicrobial action of the coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lemon Essential Oil is a natural antiseptic and energy booster for your body.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another use for lemon essential oil is as a natural cleaning agent for your home.</li>
            <li>I personally like to use this in my natural homemade toothpaste.</li>
            <li>, so I watched and the oil seemed to leave a residue in less than half of the spot the center, till I turned the envelope over and noticed that it had a plastic window that had prevented what would haven been a more normal absorption.  </li>
            <li>It is super concentrated and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like other brand-named lemon essential oil that I have.</li>
            <li>It was not long after the water started boiling when members of the family started to ask one by one what are you making?</li>
            <li>Sadly, you must be careful cuz a number have the WORDS &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; actually in their NAMES, but the products are not organic and these are strong concentrated plant extracts, EVERYTHING that goes into the distillation process becomes very concentrated as well...including pesticides!  </li>
            <li>I have a couple of cats and fresh air can be hard to come by.  </li>

            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> /&gt;While testing Skinology&#x27;s complimentary bottle, we loved the glass dropper.  </li>
            <li> - I use it for massage and relaxation because I love the smell of it.</li>

            <li> I really enjoy putting this in my oil diffuser, and letting my house smell like summer time!</li>
            <li> This product has many uses, which even I haven&#x27;t tried yet.</li>
            <li> Better yet, lemons are one of my favorite smells.</li>
            <li> Who couldn&#x27;t use more of that?  </li>
            <li> It is a perfect treatment for my dry, itchy scalp , as well as my cuticles.</li>
            <li> As a parent who&#x27;s child likes to help them clean, making my own cleaners is important.  </li>
            <li> I  just love the huge size of this bottle as I use lemon oil for an assortment of purposes from cleaning the home to beauty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great natural household cleaner.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed more of that either, but I haven&#x27;t been ultra consistent, to be perfectly honest.  </li>
            <li> I received a complimentary bottle of this to give my honest opinion on.</li>
            <li> complimentary  to try it and give my honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li> Great smell and many different ways to use it</li>
            <li> It comes with a dropper for easy measure that makes it easy when you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not to strong.  </li>
            <li> so I liked the nice clean fresh lemon scent right away.  </li>
            <li> I usually always have a candle burning because I just love having something that smells so delicious.</li>
            <li> ALSO HUGE</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of citrus limon scents.</li>
            <li> The face wash only has three ingredients which I think is great.</li>
            <li> But quality is extremely important and there is NO governing body to check the oils and protect us from people selling untested, sub par oils, oils that have been diluted with a carrier oil, etc.  </li>
            <li> and I can reassure you that this a great quality essential oil</li>
            <li> Grate size and the dropper is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This really is a very nice sized bottle and great tasting and smelling essential oil that I believe everyone needs to add to their collection of essential oils.</li>
            <li> A very fresh scent, that is not over powering.</li>
            <li> It has a nice strong lemony smell but it is clear.  </li>
            <li> Worth trying!</li>
            <li> The BEST is to find someone who has a third party keeping them &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34;, but WOW, THEN is when the prices go thru the roof!  </li>
            <li> so I was excited to see how I would like it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this to clean our oven, microwave, and refrigerator</li>
            <li> Not only did it clean my refrigerator, oven and microwave, but it also leaves a pleasant citrus smell.</li>
            <li> Works great in my Essential oil diffuser to make my house smell fresh and clean.  </li>

            <li> I love this oil so much.</li>
            <li> The aroma of fresh squeezed lemons filled the house.  </li>
            <li> Generous sized bottle every bit as good as the smaller, expensive&lt;br /&gt;brands</li>
            <li> Clearly that&#x27;s true of THIS oil! :-)  </li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Great product, I add it to my water everyday and really enjoy the flavor.</li>
            <li> I love to use lemon essential oil for so many things.</li>
            <li> A pure oil will dothis to plastic which is why good oils aren&#x27;t generally sold with rubber dropper lids cuz they will cause rubber to deteriorate.  </li>
            <li> It is necessary to mention that the bottle is huge - 4 ounces!!</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like fresh squeezed lemons!</li>
            <li> The Skinology Lemon Essential Oil is a huge bottle compared to most and affordable.</li>
            <li> In exchange for my unbiased honest opinion I received a 4oz bottle of Skinology Beauty Solutions Lemon Essential Oil at a promotional cost.</li>
            <li> I find it just perfect and very invigorating to say the least.</li>
            <li> #34;top quality&amp;#34; fresh oil.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t have that fresh lemony smell.</li>
            <li> so I thought I would boil a stock pot of water with some lemon essential oils in it and get some moisture in the air as well as a nice fresh lemon scent.  </li>
            <li> I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> From my experience, not all essential oils come with their own dropper.  </li>
            <li> It smells like fresh squeezed lemons.</li>
            <li> Smells like freshly squeezed lemons.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t report on that at the moment, but I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Not only has it lightened scars, but it makes my skin fee germ free and clean !</li>
            <li> comes right off.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using any kind of Lemon Essential Oil</li>
            <li> I am happy so far with the Skinology 100% Pure Lemon Essential Oil and can&#x27;t wait to try all of these recipes!</li>

            <li> To clean the shower  put 40 drops of lemon oil mixed with 20 drops of tea tree oil and water in a 16 oz.</li>
            <li> the more pure an oil is the less residue it leaves.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more Skinology 100 percent pure Lemon Essential Oil in the future.</li>
            <li> Lemon Essential Oil arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Lemon essential oil can be used in many different ways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got COPD and after careful selection and about two months of diffusion I&#x27;ve been forgetting to take my Spiriva inhaler at night except maybe two nights a week and have been breathing fine...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ok, a bit heavy...</li>
            <li> You just add some to a water bottle and it not only is it a powerful disinfectant and antibacterial cleanser</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary lemon essential oil for testing and reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the lemon essential oil , and I really like the experience.</li>
            <li> For a very soft citrus scent to them.  </li>
            <li> and if you keep it upright you&#x27;re probably OK as long as you are using the oil up and not leaving the rubber gasket as a seal for very long!  </li>
            <li> Itâ€™s important to keep harsh chemicals away from high contact surfaces like your kitchen.</li>
            <li> Huge size will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE diffusing lemon during the day mixed with other oils I need!  </li>
            <li> You can use the essential oil as a mild cleaner that packs a big punch as a disinfectant and antibacterial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Once you get your Skinology 100% Pure Lemon Essential Oil</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle and it should last for a while.</li>
            <li> yes you can ingest certain essential oils.  </li>
            <li> It is great to apply to the bottoms of feet and chest to help with cold symptom relief.</li>
            <li> and I am really hoping it will help with my adult acne that I am constantly covering up.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and enjoy every drop of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been using lemon oil for scar treatment and really like it .</li>
            <li> Droppers make the use of essential oils so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> my house pets and Lemon essential oil can make a real difference.  </li>
            <li> This will last forever and the dropper it comes with is very convenient.</li>
            <li> use all natural cleaners</li>
            <li> my 37 year old granddaughter is drinking it because she had the flu; lemons healing properties are well established.</li>
            <li> You can actually drop a few drops in your garbage disposal and make it smell better.</li>
            <li> Good produce for the price, but the lemon scent smells a bit too much like some artificial lemon scents.</li>
            <li> It is not as strong as others, and not crazy expensive too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would be comfortable to use it in anything that I would put on my body.</li>
            <li> -thats exactly what I expected from this product.</li>
            <li> No, I am trying out some different uses for the 100% Pure Lemon Essential Oil.  </li>
            <li> I have really wanted to try lemon essential oil since a friend of mine told me she lost 10lbs in a month changing nothing except adding 2-3 drops of lemon essential oil to her glass of water in the morning</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going as natural as I can starting with an ALMOST completely paleo diet.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you have some sort of infection or cavities the coconut oil can&#x27;t be beat and the lemon is just a tasty boost to the antimicrobial action of the coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lemon Essential Oil is a natural antiseptic and energy booster for your body.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another use for lemon essential oil is as a natural cleaning agent for your home.</li>
            <li> I personally like to use this in my natural homemade toothpaste.</li>
            <li> , so I watched and the oil seemed to leave a residue in less than half of the spot the center, till I turned the envelope over and noticed that it had a plastic window that had prevented what would haven been a more normal absorption.  </li>
            <li> It is super concentrated and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like other brand-named lemon essential oil that I have.</li>
            <li> It was not long after the water started boiling when members of the family started to ask one by one what are you making?</li>
            <li> Sadly, you must be careful cuz a number have the WORDS &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; actually in their NAMES, but the products are not organic and these are strong concentrated plant extracts, EVERYTHING that goes into the distillation process becomes very concentrated as well...including pesticides!  </li>
            <li> I have a couple of cats and fresh air can be hard to come by.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be long lasting.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to get into essential oils and using a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Consider using it for therapeutic massages or aromatherapy next time you need to relax after a long day.</li>
            <li> It sounds strange but it can actually be added to water to make an energy boosting drink that detoxifies your body.</li>
            <li> Lemon essential oil is used for many things from help with cleaning to fragrancing your home to immune support and cold remedy.</li>
            <li> I have bought other lemon essential oils</li>
            <li> Would probably buy a different brand if I was using it for anything other than homemade cleaning solutions.</li>
            <li> Those gps a very long way.  </li>
            <li> This winter it has been incredibly dry in our house</li>
            <li> spray bottle and a little bit of white vinegar.  </li>
            <li> ANYWAY, so THIS oil smells like a cross between real lemon peel and lemon drop candy with a faint whiff of something I can&#x27;t define</li>
            <li> I have a few recipes I am wanting to try that require lemon essential oil.</li>
            <li> (Green Health oils appear to be tested outside their facility..</li>
            <li> It is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I would not say I am officially on the bandwagon of essential oils, but I am curious and wanting to try a few things to see if they will work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still, lemon was all I needed as far as oils and BA&#x27;s shipping starts at like $6.50, then goes SLOWLY up as your order grows</li>
            <li> A two ounce bottle of lemon from BA is like ten bucks, I have a problem paying over half the item price for shipping!  </li>
            <li> I found it had eaten thru the plastic film enough to act like a very permanent, very thin glue...</li>
            <li> Concentrated, unscented, very effective, but otherwise boring cleaners.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy my essential oils from Bulk Apothecary.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way here!</li>
            <li> I did this in the other side of the sink too.</li>
            <li> I wipe all areas in my house down with it.</li>
            <li> previously that do smell like lemon.</li>
            <li> I recommend you get some glass spray bottles and other small glass vials and even some with roller balls to use as you make blends and recipes.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in the bottom of my trash cans too.  </li>
            <li> but it leaves behind such an invigorating scent.</li>
            <li> The bottle also comes with a glass dropper cap which I like so nothing gets wasted</li>
            <li> I added a few drops of this lemon oil and use it for everything from countertops to floors to glass cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Face wash, disinfectant, cold remedies, and lemon water complete my list.</li>
            <li> yet they&#x27;re not so outrageously expensive that I can&#x27;t afford essential oils period!  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it smells like someone took a lemon, and squeezed it into this little bottle!</li>
            <li> I also have a hard time using chemicals</li>
            <li> So you want organic or at least &amp;#34;wildcrafted&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;m also disabled and sick and it&#x27;s been 28 years that the western docs have had to pile on the drugs and surgeries</li>
            <li> This was less expensive though.</li>
            <li> Duh!  </li>
            <li> It smells kinda artificial (like the smell you would expect in a cleaning product).</li>
            <li> (bad breath)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Grrrr  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Finally a lemon oil that you can ingest safely this bottle is huge and i love that i can put it my water... so many health benefits using lemon.. i now have a good supply to last me... the price was great</li>
            <li> In exchange for my unbiased honest opinion I received a 4oz bottle of Skinology Beauty Solutions Lemon Essential Oil at a promotional cost. I have really wanted to try lemon essential oil since a friend of mine told me she lost 10lbs in a month changing nothing except adding 2-3 drops of lemon essential oil to her glass of water in the morning and then another in the evening before bed. I just needed to get some and try it. Though too soon to see if I will lose weight from this I find I really love the flavor this adds to my sink water and am very happily enjoying this in more than just my water. I have also added it to my iced tea and regular tea and love it. Lemon essential oil is used for many things from help with cleaning to fragrancing your home to immune support and cold remedy. I am super excited to have this large sized bottle from Skinnology added to my newly started essential oil collection. Though my friend only added 2-3 drops to each of her glasses of water I have been adding atleast 5 to my driks. I do not find it overly extensive in scent that it is unbearable. I find it just perfect and very invigorating to say the least. I also think it will start to help me improve my health soon and not be so drained from whatever my body is going through currently. This really is a very nice sized bottle and great tasting and smelling essential oil that I believe everyone needs to add to their collection of essential oils.</li>
            <li> smells great!  Works great! Use it from cleaning, deodorizing, acne and allergies...</li>
            <li> Great product, I add it to my water everyday and really enjoy the flavor.</li>
            <li> Wow, I am in love with this essential oil! It has a wonderful strong citrus aroma and can be used for many purposes. Absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this Lemon Oil! Great smell and many different ways to use it-thats exactly what I expected from this product. Worth trying!</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It has a nice strong lemony smell but it is clear.  I use it as an in-wash scent booster, it works good and it&#x27;s not to strong.  I will be ordering another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> This oil is simply amazing !!! It is a perfect treatment for my dry, itchy scalp , as well as my cuticles.I use it everyday and enjoy every drop of it.It is necessary to mention that the bottle is huge - 4 ounces!! Give it a try, you definitely won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> I do not have time to squeeze a Lemon every time that I want it in my water or tea. Bought this to try and love it! Big 4ounce bottle will last a while beings it takes on a drop or two depending on your taste. It comes with a dropper for easy measure that makes it easy when you are in a hurry.Best Lemony taste that I have found. If you love the lemon taste in your water or tea, try this. Love it! I also used for making my lemon and pepper salmon.</li>
            <li> I am pretty excited to use the Skinology 100% Pure Lemon Essential Oil! I have a few recipes I am wanting to try that require lemon essential oil. Face wash, disinfectant, cold remedies, and lemon water complete my list. I would not say I am officially on the bandwagon of essential oils, but I am curious and wanting to try a few things to see if they will work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of this essential oil for the price is really great! It is 4.0 fluid ounces with a glass dropper. Once you get your Skinology 100% Pure Lemon Essential Oil I recommend you get some glass spray bottles and other small glass vials and even some with roller balls to use as you make blends and recipes. Okay so maybe I am on the bandwagon! Ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skinology 100% Pure Lemon Essential Oil smells great and even tasted fine in my water as lemon water. The face wash only has three ingredients which I think is great. I have started to use it and I am really hoping it will help with my adult acne that I am constantly covering up. I also have a hard time using chemicals so my next recipe will be the disinfecting spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a longer list of recipes now, especially since I have 4.0 fluid ounces! I want to make some felted dryer balls and I really want to get a diffuser that is a cool mist humidifier. I am happy so far with the Skinology 100% Pure Lemon Essential Oil and can&#x27;t wait to try all of these recipes!</li>
            <li> The Skinology Lemon Essential Oil is a huge bottle compared to most and affordable. I use lemon all through the house for everything because it is one Essential Oil that my husband likes the smell of.  He also smokes so I always have a diffuser running with it too. I put it in vinegar and put it in the dishwasher rinse section too.  I wipe all areas in my house down with it. I put it in water and drink it.  I put a few drops in the bottom of my trash cans too.  This is one oil everyone should use.  I also love the dropper that came with it.  This makes using it so easy and not messy at all.  I bought this at a discount for my unbiased honest review and that is what you received.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the Lemon Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li> smells great..haven&#x27;t discovered all the uses yet.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my essential oils from Bulk Apothecary.  I like the quality and yet they&#x27;re not so outrageously expensive that I can&#x27;t afford essential oils period!  But to buy just ONE item from them means paying almost double for the shipping so I thought I&#x27;d check and see what&#x27;s available here anyway!  I&#x27;m generally a very committed Amazon Prime buyer!  That said, I&#x27;m also disabled and sick and it&#x27;s been 28 years that the western docs have had to pile on the drugs and surgeries and I&#x27;m no weaker.  So I&#x27;m going as natural as I can starting with an ALMOST completely paleo diet.  I can&#x27;t afford to see a naturopath regularly so I&#x27;m mostly on my own.  Dr Mercola is a godsend if you haven&#x27;t read any of his stuff or visited his site.  Then it got to where, for a while I can&#x27;t even afford his most excellent multi vitamins, but I had my oils and kept diffusing them (blends I&#x27;ve made) basically all day and night and I keep improving! :-D. Just with the oils being all around me in teeny amounts!  I&#x27;ve got COPD and after careful selection and about two months of diffusion I&#x27;ve been forgetting to take my Spiriva inhaler at night except maybe two nights a week and have been breathing fine...this is huge!  I have allergies and can&#x27;t take oral allergy meds anymore so I&#x27;ve been using a steroid nasal spray nightly and am able go days without it too!  So essential oils are no joke.  They work!  But quality is extremely important and there is NO governing body to check the oils and protect us from people selling untested, sub par oils, oils that have been diluted with a carrier oil, etc.  NOW oils and Bulk Apothecary test each batch of oil which is great, BA will provide a C of A for each oil if requested but I don&#x27;t know what to look for so I have never asked.  Problem is it&#x27;s THEIR tests.  The BEST is to find someone who has a third party keeping them &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34;, but WOW, THEN is when the prices go thru the roof!  (Green Health oils appear to be tested outside their facility..I have their rose geranium and it&#x27;s ok, a bit heavy...essential oils generally should be light and evaporate quite quickly, but there ARE exceptions so...  So I&#x27;ve been using myself as a guinea pig to an extent.  My sister also has health issues and can afford more expensive oils so I am exposed to them periodically.  But I&#x27;ve improved with BA oils so I pretty much trust them...  Still, lemon was all I needed as far as oils and BA&#x27;s shipping starts at like $6.50, then goes SLOWLY up as your order grows so it&#x27;s only $9 ish to ship an order of over $100!  A two ounce bottle of lemon from BA is like ten bucks, I have a problem paying over half the item price for shipping!  ANYWAY, so THIS oil smells like a cross between real lemon peel and lemon drop candy with a faint whiff of something I can&#x27;t define that&#x27;s suspiciously chemical...But they could have just used twigs and leaves as well as peel for example... so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;top quality&amp;#34; fresh oil.  But I just had a spastic moment and spilled almost an ounce of this stuff on my bedspread, part of my phone and an envelope! Grrrr  It evaporated quickly enough not to hurt my phone, and gave me a perfect paper test...If you put a drop of essential oil on a piece of paper the more pure an oil is the less residue it leaves. (Tho you&#x27;re supposed to use construction paper, and it won&#x27;t work with thicker oils like vetiver, myrrh, even rose geranium) I&#x27;ve heard you should give it overnight....  Also it was much more than just a DROP! Duh!  ANYWAY, so I watched and the oil seemed to leave a residue in less than half of the spot the center, till I turned the envelope over and noticed that it had a plastic window that had prevented what would haven been a more normal absorption.  When I tried to open it to let it finish drying I found it had eaten thru the plastic film enough to act like a very permanent, very thin glue...it&#x27;s literally melted into the upper layer of paper!  This is GOOD, btw!  A pure oil will dothis to plastic which is why good oils aren&#x27;t generally sold with rubber dropper lids cuz they will cause rubber to deteriorate.  Some send glass droppers with their oils and leave it up to you and if you keep it upright you&#x27;re probably OK as long as you are using the oil up and not leaving the rubber gasket as a seal for very long!  Clearly that&#x27;s true of THIS oil! :-)  ANYWAY, so it passed the paper test! And then some.  ALSO HUGE if you are slogging thru all the oils on Amazon, look for CERTIFIED ORGANIC oils!  This will cut a lot of the junk out of your search.  Sadly, you must be careful cuz a number have the WORDS &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; actually in their NAMES, but the products are not organic and these are strong concentrated plant extracts, EVERYTHING that goes into the distillation process becomes very concentrated as well...including pesticides!  So you want organic or at least &amp;#34;wildcrafted&amp;#34; oils.  This oil is certified organic, it was actually cheaper than BA and I am now reasonably certain I can put it in my diffuser without gunking it up with carriers oils!  I LOVE diffusing lemon during the day mixed with other oils I need!  It&#x27;s a happy lively scent and perks up the brain assisting concentration, digestion, stimulates the lymphatic and endocrine systems, is a good antimicrobial and cleanser, skin toner blended with witch hazel or carrier oils, can be used with coconut oil as a great toothpaste!  Especially if you have some sort of infection or cavities the coconut oil can&#x27;t be beat and the lemon is just a tasty boost to the antimicrobial action of the coconut oil.  ANYWAY!  So it&#x27;s a good oil.  I will definitely order BA&#x27;s lemon in my next order to compare, and hopefully my sister will have some more expensive MLM oils to compare as well and will come back to update!  For now I&#x27;m happy and that&#x27;s something at this price!  Most of these bigger, cheaper bottles are really sub par one way or another! :-D</li>
            <li> The Lemon Essential Oil arrived well packaged for shipment.  When I opened the bottle, I fell in love immediately! It smells wonderful!  I am so glad I ordered it as it was the perfect companion to my newly created body butter.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t actually smell like lemons. I have bought other lemon essential oils previously that do smell like lemon. This was less expensive though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I made a lot of DIY household products, and I use a lot of lemon essential oil to make them. So I thought this would be a cheaper option. It came well packaged and the dropper works great. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like other brand-named lemon essential oil that I have. It smells kinda artificial (like the smell you would expect in a cleaning product). It just doesn&#x27;t have that fresh lemony smell. However, it is a really good price for what I got. I&#x27;m not sure if I would be comfortable to use it in anything that I would put on my body. I would only use it for making household products and nothing else.</li>
            <li> Happy with product. Seems to be long lasting. Bottle arrived with screw on lid accompanied by an eyedropper. Love that. no leaks!</li>
            <li> I recently got a diffuser so I am excited to try new smells and oils with it. I&#x27;ve tried this lemon essential oil and it worked great and smelled so good! I really enjoy the smell of fresh lemons and this one smells just like them. I&#x27;ve been also using this oil to add to my store bought cleaning solutions. I also tried it with water and I really liked it. I really like the dropper that comes with it. I use it all the time as this oil needs to be diluted and I don&#x27;t want to use too much of it. This is a large bottle and it should last for a while. I&#x27;m very glad I got this product for testing and reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been using lemon oil for scar treatment and really like it . Not only has it lightened scars, but it makes my skin fee germ free and clean !</li>
            <li> It is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to get into essential oils and using a diffuser. This oil is one of my favorites. I am a huge fan of citrus limon scents. I usually always have a candle burning because I just love having something that smells so delicious. I used this in my diffuser and I&#x27;m instantly hooked. It&#x27;s very strong but not overpowering. It instantly boosted my mood and I felt so much more energized. The nice thing is, this can be used for so many things. It&#x27;s a great natural household cleaner. You just add some to a water bottle and it not only is it a powerful disinfectant and antibacterial cleanser but it leaves behind such an invigorating scent. I love this oil so much. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> This is my first time using any kind of Lemon Essential Oil so I was excited to see how I would like it.  I love citrus scents so I liked the nice clean fresh lemon scent right away.  It comes in a large 4oz bottle which is very nice because I plan on using every drop!  The bottle also comes with a glass dropper cap which I like so nothing gets wasted and it can be measured correctly. This winter it has been incredibly dry in our house so I thought I would boil a stock pot of water with some lemon essential oils in it and get some moisture in the air as well as a nice fresh lemon scent.  It was not long after the water started boiling when members of the family started to ask one by one what are you making? muffins? lemon meringue pie?.... No, I am trying out some different uses for the 100% Pure Lemon Essential Oil.  The aroma of fresh squeezed lemons filled the house.  According to some research I did to find out what I could use Lemon Essential Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits of Lemon include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Cleansing and purification&lt;br /&gt;  Oral health and remedy for halitosis (bad breath)&lt;br /&gt;  Digestion&lt;br /&gt;  Thirst quencher&lt;br /&gt;  Remedy for abdominal colic pain&lt;br /&gt;  Cough relief&lt;br /&gt;  Calms stomach and relieves nausea&lt;br /&gt;  Prevents malabsorption&lt;br /&gt;  Improves digestion&lt;br /&gt;  Nourishes the skin&lt;br /&gt;  Promotes Weight loss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on trying them all and learning more uses for this fantastic Pure Lemon Essential Oil from Skinology Beauty Solutions. I received this product in exchange for a review. I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commissionâ€™s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my body butter! Smells great :) A must have for citrus lovers.</li>
            <li> I have just recently discovered Essential oils and all of their one million plus uses. I was given the opportunity to test this Skinology 100 percent pure Lemon Essential Oil and give my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The Lemon Essential Oil arrived quickly. It was packaged very well to prevent breakage during shipment.  I was very pleased with its packaging.  It also came with a glass dropper which I was very happy about. From my experience, not all essential oils come with their own dropper.  Droppers make the use of essential oils so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;This Lemon Essential Oil has a wonderful aroma. I love to use lemon essential oil for so many things. I use it for cleaning many things. I use it to make my own dishwasher detergent.  I love using it in my diffuser as well. Lemon Essential Oil is also a favorite of mine to mix with peppermint oil, thieves, and fractionated coconut oil for Colds. It is great to apply to the bottoms of feet and chest to help with cold symptom relief. I could go on and on at all of the many things I like to use Lemon Essential Oil for.  This is one of the best that I&#x27;ve tried. I will be ordering more Skinology 100 percent pure Lemon Essential Oil in the future.</li>
            <li> Yummy Lemon scented great for your kitchen great to add to your cleaning products into your bed linens</li>

            <li> I love the smell of this lemon essential oil. I bought it for thee main reasons, which is to help me with my detox, freshen up and clean our house. I put two to three drops in my bottle of water, shake it real good and TAH-DAHH, a refreshing, healthy water. It tastes good and I love how it makes me feel. It gives me the energy I need and I feel good about myself. I have used this to clean our oven, microwave, and refrigerator and it works like magic. Not only did it clean my refrigerator, oven and microwave, but it also leaves a pleasant citrus smell. I have a diffuser and I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love the refreshing smell in my room. There is something about the aroma that relaxes me and helps me sleep at night. If you love citrus smell, this essential oil is perfect for you. I received this complimentary lemon essential oil for testing and reviewing purposes and I can reassure you that this a great quality essential oil and I would also recommend it to all my fellow essential oil lovers.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s great. If you&#x27;re using it just for smell, it&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;therapeutic grade&amp;#34; oil so don&#x27;t use this for medical reasons.</li>
            <li> Works great in my Essential oil diffuser to make my house smell fresh and clean.  I have 6 malti-poo&#x27;s that are my house pets and Lemon essential oil can make a real difference.  You can use it to clean and deodorize your kitchen and bath.  I am able to add it to my water before my workout and it is uplifting and supports your immune system.  What is not to love about that?  It is super concentrated and a little goes a long way.  This oil can be used for massages also.  This is one of the many highly recommended essential oils that is in the Skinology line of beauty solutions.  *received for testing and review.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Excellent service.  Fast delivery.  Generous sized bottle every bit as good as the smaller, expensive&lt;br /&gt;brands and can be taken internally.  A couple drops in water from the handy dropper is all it takes.</li>
            <li> Works just as I had hoped! Grate size and the dropper is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary bottle of this to give my honest opinion on. I actually love it. It smells like fresh squeezed lemons. I use essential oils to make sugar scrubs and bath bombs. This has more scent than any lemon oil i&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;ve ordered my second bottle already!</li>
            <li> I  just love the huge size of this bottle as I use lemon oil for an assortment of purposes from cleaning the home to beauty. This will last forever and the dropper it comes with is very convenient. The price is practically a steal for the amount of oil you receive. I was given this product for testing purposes and plan to use every last drop!</li>

I personally like to use this in my natural homemade toothpaste. I have had no reactions to this oil and the oil seems to be of great quality. Its doing what I know Lemon Essential Oil should do. I would personally buy from this company to get my essential oil from. I received this product to give my unbiased review on.</li>
            <li> Lemon essential oil can be used in many different ways. I&#x27;ve used this product for cleaning my face as well as cleaning my counter tops in the kitchen yes I said counter tops. Safe to use and the smell is wonderful. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> As a parent who&#x27;s child likes to help them clean, making my own cleaners is important.  We use vinegar, water, and lemon essential oils to clean most surfaces in the house, especially the microwave and oven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While testing Skinology&#x27;s complimentary bottle, we loved the glass dropper.  It makes measuring your drops so much easier.  I found often I&#x27;d get too much otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the lemon essential oil , and I really like the experience. It has different purposes - I use it for massage and relaxation because I love the smell of it. Also can be used for cleaning which is good for me since I always use lemon scented cleaners.</li>
            <li> Multi purpose oil&lt;br /&gt;This lemon oil from skinology has a lot of household uses. I personally like to add the oil to my kitchen cleanser for a wonderful aroma during cleaning. Also can be used for massage and aroma therapy purposes. It sounds strange but it can actually be added to water to make an energy boosting drink that detoxifies your body. Great product</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like fresh squeezed lemons! Seriously, it smells like someone took a lemon, and squeezed it into this little bottle! It is not as strong as others, and not crazy expensive too. I really enjoy putting this in my oil diffuser, and letting my house smell like summer time! A very fresh scent, that is not over powering. A little goes a long way here! I mix it in with some of my bathbombs as well.  For a very soft citrus scent to them.  Product received for review.</li>
            <li> This smells great and I am not allergic to it. This is a plus for me. This works great in all kinds of ways. I have been using it for cleaning and making rooms in my house smell great. You can actually drop a few drops in your garbage disposal and make it smell better. I did this in the other side of the sink too. Works great for cleaning out a smelly trash can. Cleans great and leaves a nice lemony smell, instead of a trashy smell. This product has many uses, which even I haven&#x27;t tried yet. Better yet, lemons are one of my favorite smells.</li>
            <li> This lemon oil is very strong. Only one or two drops do the trick. However I do not recommend for flavoring water. Tastes like purfumed water.&lt;br /&gt;But it is excellent for aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> Nice size for the money.  I use lemon essential oil all the time!</li>
            <li> Smells like freshly squeezed lemons.  Tastes great, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use all natural cleaners n my home.  Concentrated, unscented, very effective, but otherwise boring cleaners.  I added a few drops of this lemon oil and use it for everything from countertops to floors to glass cleaner.  I also use it in my essential oils diffuser for an instant air freshener.  I have a couple of cats and fresh air can be hard to come by.  This stuff is great for clean air.  I&#x27;ve added a couple of drops to my drinking water - yes you can ingest certain essential oils.  Lemon is one of them.  This is a food grade oil made from lemons, so....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil, not only makes water taste, well, lemony...it is purported to boost your metabolism and help burn fat.  I can&#x27;t report on that at the moment, but I thought it was worth a try.  It&#x27;s also supposed to boost your energy.  Who couldn&#x27;t use more of that?  I haven&#x27;t noticed more of that either, but I haven&#x27;t been ultra consistent, to be perfectly honest.  I&#x27;ll keep at it though, and if somehow, I become a size 2 in the next week or so, I&#x27;ll be back to tell all about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, I love this stuff and will be using for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> These were gifts: my daughter is drinking it for it&#x27;s health benefits - my son-in-law drinks it for health benefits and he likes lemons - my 37 year old granddaughter is drinking it because she had the flu; lemons healing properties are well established.</li>
            <li> Good produce for the price, but the lemon scent smells a bit too much like some artificial lemon scents. Would probably buy a different brand if I was using it for anything other than homemade cleaning solutions.</li>
            <li> I received this large bottle of lemon oil complimentary  to try it and give my honest and unbiased opinion.  I have been doing a lot of researching on the Internet and lemon oil has a lot of health benefits.  To clean my counters in kitchen I use 3 drops and water in a spray bottle.  To keep refrigerator smelling good put a few drops on a cotton ball inside refrigerator.  For greasy mechanic hands  just mix a couple drops in with the soap and grease comes right off.  To clean the shower  put 40 drops of lemon oil mixed with 20 drops of tea tree oil and water in a 16 oz. spray bottle and a little bit of white vinegar.  These are just some things I am using the lemon oil for.  I recommend it.</li>
