            <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I thought it was going to be more of a holographic nail polish, but it turns out it IS glitter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Probably going to buy more.</li>
            <li>I love the sugarplum fairy.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t glop it on for more coverage.</li>
            <li>I love this polish.</li>
            <li>If you like holographic polishes, you&#x27;ll love this glitter that shows rainbows in the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this color.</li>
            <li>THIS POLISH IS AWESOME PERIOD POINT BLANK.</li>
            <li>I love this Polish it sparkle</li>
            <li>Better than I thought.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I put it on last night, and haven&#x27;t had any chips yet (which is wonderful).</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Anyway it is still super beautiful and will make your heart smile when you see it&#x27;s sparkly radness.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and with about 2 coats it gets pretty good coverage.</li>
            <li>I easily recommend it.</li>
            <li>Removal was fine....</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish it dries really quick.</li>
            <li>Super shiny and glittery!</li>
            <li>this is a must have polish especially with a tan lol in the summer.</li>
            <li>the only not so great thing is dont expect to take this off with just remover.</li>
            <li>I need smooth nails because snagging drives me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I love it worth the 8 dollars.</li>
            <li>polish is very dense with glitter and is distractingly amazing by itself or over just about any color/design.</li>
            <li>It is so beautiful especially with a glossy top coat, the way it catches the light is really pretty.</li>
            <li>honestly was not expecting this caliber of glitter, there is so much.</li>
            <li>It has a light lilac tone to it and with the glitter</li>
            <li>I want to add that the best way to remove this glitter polish or any glitter polish is to either buy nail remover wraps or make them by taking a cotton round pad soak it in acetone NOT non acetone polish remover.</li>
            <li>I love working with fun and unique colors.</li>
            <li>I love to apply glitter to my nails and this is a really pretty glitter color.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m never disappointed.  </li>
            <li>a couple of clear top coats you can make the texture even, or using a gel top coat works as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is VERy glittery and super cute.</li>
            <li>loved the polish color but,but it was very think like it was old.</li>
            <li>In 2 layers I have a solid disco ball glam, pleasure to look at it and love the name too...very pleased</li>
            <li>Very pretty addition to my nail polish collection....</li>
            <li>Its very pretty but be prepared to keep redoing your nails.</li>
            <li>so pretty when the light hits it.....stayed on for 8 days before it started to chip......</li>
            <li>Color Club is my new favorite nail polish brand.</li>
            <li>Was super fun to do.</li>
            <li>also it looks very shinny!!</li>
            <li>in all, given my information, this nail polish is stellar and would probably buy again!</li>
            <li>This is by far my Favorite polish...and i have around 100 polishes..</li>
            <li>I am a glitter junkie and this purchase made my obsession even more worse lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice in regular lighting and comes to life in the sun.</li>
            <li>I put it on and showed my husband, and when I told him the name, he said, &#x27;Yes, that is very much a Sugarplum Fairy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is so pretty.</li>
            <li>I love it because you can put it over another nail color to get a different look.</li>
            <li>Every time I buy Color Club, the polish on my nails looks EXACTLY like the photos.  </li>
            <li>It dries pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Does chop within the first week</li>
            <li>So pretty, and</li>
            <li>if you go outside while wearing it you&#x27;d better bring some sunglasses</li>
            <li>so pretty can&#x27;t wait to wear in the summer time.if</li>
            <li>This is a pretty holo glitter polish</li>
            <li>It looks so pretty.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>This would be a good color mixed with a plain polish or as a top coat</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moderately hard to remove because hey, it&#x27;s a glitter polish, but it is just SO eye catching!</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and dried very quickly.</li>
            <li>I suggest using it over a white or light gray.....</li>
            <li>and it dries fast</li>
            <li>MUCH.</li>
            <li>I put 2-3 coats on, depending on how much pop I want.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable too.</li>
            <li>but I have a couple by China Glaze that are much prettier.</li>
            <li>This is a very, gloppy polish.</li>
            <li>I have never had a glitter nail polish that sparkled this much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the much more expensive brands and they just aren&#x27;t as nice.</li>
            <li>be used alone or on top of other polish.</li>
            <li>This color is particularly hypnotic.  </li>
            <li>i love how it turns out but it peels off in one piece if a small chip happens</li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>Worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>all other reviews were right on....</li>
            <li>I think it would be hard to use it with tape techniques, I don&#x27;t think the lines would come out clean.</li>
            <li>It is not flat meaning you can see the flecks of glitter</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have a few of their polishes already and they&#x27;re always high</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like waiting long time to have my nails drying</li>
            <li> did have to put some thinner in the bottle and stir it up because it was absolutely way too thick.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and dries fast.</li>
            <li> The only reason I took one star off was due to the formula.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not very gently with my nails</li>
            <li> This polish even chips off of toe nails less then a week later.  </li>
            <li> Squeeze out the excess liquid and apply it the nail bed, To hold that in place and not lose moisture, wrap a small square of foil over the entire tip of the finger.</li>
            <li> It also came a few days before it was supposed to!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to be that way but putting thinner in it made it workable and didn&#x27;t damage the coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, yet not like a typical thick polish where it takes forever to dry, just a little difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> I must say that it is kinda thick</li>
            <li> Upon receiving it I was far from disappointed!</li>
            <li> This will blind you in the sun.</li>
            <li> It was nearly impossible to work with.</li>
            <li> hate using glitter nail polish, but this is an exception to all rules!&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous on my toes!&lt;br /&gt;Did one fingernail and couldn&#x27;t wait to remove it...</li>
            <li> I used this as a base coat and used a see through purple to make chevrons</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i love how it turns out but it peels off in one piece if a small chip happens</li>
            <li> This is a holo polish. However, it is what you would call a &amp;#34;non-linear&amp;#34; holo. It is not flat meaning you can see the flecks of glitter and it gives a holo effect. If you want a linear holo you would probably want to go with something from the color club halo hues collection. Anyway it is still super beautiful and will make your heart smile when you see it&#x27;s sparkly radness. Buy it if you&#x27;re looking for a lovely glitter, with a halo effect.</li>
            <li> loved the polish color but,but it was very think like it was old.</li>
            <li> Very pretty addition to my nail polish collection.... I suggest using it over a white or light gray..... oh and it makes for a great accent nail! Good formula and&lt;br /&gt;..... Removal was fine.... I always use Cutex polish Remover! U can get the remover @Walmart! :)</li>
            <li> This polish even chips off of toe nails less then a week later.  Its very pretty but be prepared to keep redoing your nails.</li>
            <li> Color same as picture and it dries fast which is a plus for me I don&#x27;t like waiting long time to have my nails drying also it looks very shinny!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is so pretty. It makes your nails sparkle in the sunlight. I have had so many complements when I am wearing it. I love it because you can put it over another nail color to get a different look.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my name for this polish brand.  Every time I buy Color Club, the polish on my nails looks EXACTLY like the photos.  This color is particularly hypnotic.  Once you wear it in the sunlight, you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> This looks so cute on. The perfect sparkle nails. The thicker you put it on the better it looks. I will be ordering more!!</li>
            <li> this is a must have polish especially with a tan lol in the summer. I bought 2 bottles of this and love them. the only not so great thing is dont expect to take this off with just remover. I had to take mine off with the nail grinder/filer. but it stays on awesome!! It lasted a month on my toes although i did put several coats&lt;br /&gt;if you are looking for great coverage that will give you that strong holographic look this is it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. I put it on and showed my husband, and when I told him the name, he said, &#x27;Yes, that is very much a Sugarplum Fairy&amp;#34;. It reminds me of all the times that I got to go see The Nutcracker as a child. I wish I could be a 55 gallon drum of this so that I will never run out.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I thought it was going to be more of a holographic nail polish, but it turns out it IS glitter.&lt;br /&gt;I hate using glitter nail polish, but this is an exception to all rules!&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous on my toes!&lt;br /&gt;Did one fingernail and couldn&#x27;t wait to remove it...I need smooth nails because snagging drives me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, given my information, this nail polish is stellar and would probably buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish it dries really quick. I love it worth the 8 dollars. Probably going to buy more.</li>
            <li> One of the best nail polishes I have. In 2 layers I have a solid disco ball glam, pleasure to look at it and love the name too...very pleased</li>
            <li> SO. MUCH. SPARKLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish is very dense with glitter and is distractingly amazing by itself or over just about any color/design. It&#x27;s moderately hard to remove because hey, it&#x27;s a glitter polish, but it is just SO eye catching!</li>
            <li> Awesome polish!! Everyone must own!</li>
            <li> I love the sugarplum fairy. Goes on smoothly and has a beautiful glossy effect. Reminds me of cute sparkly stickers that were popular in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This will blind you in the sun. It&#x27;s not holographic at all but boy does it sparkle!!  I always get people asking me what brand it is. I must say that it is kinda thick so don&#x27;t glop it on for more coverage. It dries pretty well.  I put 2-3 coats on, depending on how much pop I want. Does chop within the first week but I&#x27;m not very gently with my nails so that&#x27;s probably my fault. I love this polish. Does go on well,</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, love the color!!!! The holo is amazing in the sun!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far my Favorite polish...and i have around 100 polishes..i will definitely get another one soon. It is VERy glittery and super cute.</li>
            <li> This color on your nails just shines....all other reviews were right on....WOW....so pretty when the light hits it.....stayed on for 8 days before it started to chip......very happy and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Holographic glitter, just absolutely beautiful!! If you like holographic polishes, you&#x27;ll love this glitter that shows rainbows in the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used alone or on top of other polish. I used one coat over polish and was amazed at how well it covered. The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice. Color Club has the best holographic colors, at a very reasonable cost. I&#x27;ve used the much more expensive brands and they just aren&#x27;t as nice. Top notch!!!</li>
            <li> Color Club is my new favorite nail polish brand. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on this color. It went on smoothly and dried very quickly. It lasted about a week without any chips!</li>
            <li> THIS POLISH IS AWESOME PERIOD POINT BLANK. It is so beautiful especially with a glossy top coat, the way it catches the light is really pretty. You only need two coats &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This polish is amazing. So pretty, and if you go outside while wearing it you&#x27;d better bring some sunglasses cause you&#x27;ll need them! It&#x27;s very durable too.</li>
            <li> I love love love love this polish! It is a glitter polish, but two coats is enough for a solid layer. It also came a few days before it was supposed to!</li>
            <li> I love this Polish it sparkle so pretty can&#x27;t wait to wear in the summer time.if you&#x27;re a Polish addict you must have this in your collection ...</li>
            <li> Not quite what I thought it would look like paint. Appears different in pictures</li>
            <li> Best glitter ever!  Always get tons of compliments when I wear this.  Stays shining for weeks!</li>
            <li> This is UBER glitter polish! I looove it. I love glitter, I love color club! I have a few of their polishes already and they&#x27;re always high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly was not expecting this caliber of glitter, there is so much. I&#x27;ve never seen a glitter polish this dense before.&lt;br /&gt;I did have to put some thinner in the bottle and stir it up because it was absolutely way too thick. It was nearly impossible to work with. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to be that way but putting thinner in it made it workable and didn&#x27;t damage the coverage. It&#x27;s the only glitter polish that only needs one coat.&lt;br /&gt;This polish is great for accent nails. I think it would be hard to use it with tape techniques, I don&#x27;t think the lines would come out clean. I used this as a base coat and used a see through purple to make chevrons so the glitter was still visable. Turned out wonderfully. Was super fun to do. I love working with fun and unique colors. And there is definitely not another glitter polish like this one.&lt;br /&gt;With a couple of clear top coats you can make the texture even, or using a gel top coat works as well.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to use this again!</li>
            <li> Super shiny and glittery! Pictures don&#x27;t do it justice. It has a light lilac tone to it and with the glitter I can&#x27;t wait to do my toes with it. I love to apply glitter to my nails and this is a really pretty glitter color. It goes on smooth and with about 2 coats it gets pretty good coverage. If you like glitters I would suggest you try it.    *1/14/15  I want to add that the best way to remove this glitter polish or any glitter polish is to either buy nail remover wraps or make them by taking a cotton round pad soak it in acetone NOT non acetone polish remover. Squeeze out the excess liquid and apply it the nail bed, To hold that in place and not lose moisture, wrap a small square of foil over the entire tip of the finger. Let it soak for about 10-15 minutes and just wipe the polish off.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty holo glitter polish but I have a couple by China Glaze that are much prettier. This would be a good color mixed with a plain polish or as a top coat</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a great color.  Better than I thought.</li>
            <li> This holographic glitter is amazing! All the holographic color in glitter form. I am a glitter junkie and this purchase made my obsession even more worse lol.</li>
            <li> Glitter nail polish can be tricky.  Not Sugarplum Fairy by Color Club, it&#x27;s gorgeous! It covers the nail after 2 coats and is so sparkly! I have used it as a accent nail and with nail art and I&#x27;m never disappointed.  I love Color Club polishes their colors and glitters are unique and gorgeous! Tjis is a must have in any nail polish collection!</li>
            <li> Before buying any polish I Google swatches. This polish looked amazing. Upon receiving it I was far from disappointed! BEAUTIFUL!! The only reason I took one star off was due to the formula. This is a very, gloppy polish. It&#x27;s thick, yet not like a typical thick polish where it takes forever to dry, just a little difficult to work with. That being said- I&#x27;d buy it all over again. It&#x27;s simply a stunning glitter, opaque in one coat and gorgeous. It&#x27;s nice in regular lighting and comes to life in the sun. I easily recommend it.</li>
            <li> You only need two coats! I have never had a glitter nail polish that sparkled this much. It looks so pretty. I am overly impressed with it so far. I put it on last night, and haven&#x27;t had any chips yet (which is wonderful). Fingers crossed is stays this way. I will definitely buy more. I can see myself wearing this all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. It goes on thick and dries fast. Looks just like the picture. Worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> A must have for any polish lover , I didn&#x27;t have anything like this !</li>
