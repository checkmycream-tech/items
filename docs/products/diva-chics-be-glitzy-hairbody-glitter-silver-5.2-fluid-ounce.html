            <li>just okay.</li>

            <li>If anyone has any suggestions,  please let us all know :)</li>
            <li>It smelled ok.</li>
            <li>:) It also washes away easily and doesn&#x27;t leave traces of glitter everywhere for months.</li>
            <li>Washed of easily and didn&#x27;t damage the costumes at all.</li>
            <li>it does not work, very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and travels well since it has a lock to avoid spraying in the suitcase by accident</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s easy to wash off and doesn&#x27;t seem to get on everything.  </li>
            <li>Product smells really great and has just enough of a glitter spray without being too overwhelming like some products can be - not sticky or drying and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down if you don&#x27;t over spray it</li>
            <li>The product itself was great, went on a little wet and dried quickly leaving a wonderful sparkle of glitter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as if the sprayer can&#x27;t pump liquid through it, because if you remove the tube of the sprayer from water, and drain it of water, the pumping action works fine, but once you reintroduce it to liquid, it locks up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Same issue as many others.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>At first it was working fine, then the day of the show when my wife was spraying it on the pump jammed up and no longer works.  </li>
            <li>I bought this spray to use mainly for use as part of my fairy costume.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think of using a new bottle.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s very sweet smelling and a little nauseating.  </li>
            <li>:) I know that may sound silly, but try some</li>
            <li>I usually apply hairspray over the top to hold the glitter on, otherwise it comes off when the hair dries.  </li>
            <li>I have tried cleaning out the the tip of the sprayer, and running clear water through it.</li>
            <li>This spray is not as heavy with glitter or as noticeable as true gitter hairsprays.  </li>

            <li> I bought this in July, used it once when I first received it, to see how heavily the glitter sprayed on hair and such, and then again at a convention where I was dressing up in my fairy costume, and in that second use, after one spray, the sprayer jammed, and won&#x27;t spray anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, apparently, the other person who had the same issue was not a fluke.</li>
            <li> Apparently not.</li>
            <li> The company that produces this item needs to study their sprayer pump, and figure out one that is less likely to jam after 1 or 2 use&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and using hairspray after applying helps a little - but only a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen one review someone wrote that the sprayer on the bottle they bought broke after a few use&#x27;s, but I only saw that one</li>
            <li> Not very sparkly.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other sprays I have used, if I spray this in my hair I shed glitter *everywhere</li>
            <li> /&gt;They need to improve the product by using hairspray or other type of water-soluble adhesive as the delivery medium.</li>
            <li> It sprays nicer than other bottles.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, it clogs up after one or two uses.</li>
            <li> Only takes a few little squirts to be sublty shiny.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very wet..</li>
            <li> Very very wet.</li>
            <li> I spray this glitter on myself whenever someone upsets me and it has become a quick cure for being mad.</li>
            <li> I like this because I can spray a little on my finger and use it as eye glitter or anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to spray enough on to get that look you want.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dead.  </li>
            <li> But, it clogged making it worthless with a full bottle.</li>
            <li> I was never able to get even 1 spray.</li>
            <li> This one sucks!</li>
            <li> I need to find an empty spray bottle, to see if that will work. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that there aren&#x27;t any tips from the company on how to unclog it.</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t ruin all of my belongings :(</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it no stars if possible!! Same issue as many others. The bottle stopped working after 2 uses!! Save your money and agrivation and purchase another product. This one sucks!</li>
            <li> We got two of these for our daughters dance performance.  At first it was working fine, then the day of the show when my wife was spraying it on the pump jammed up and no longer works.  I have tried cleaning it out and doing everything possible to get it to work and it&#x27;s dead.  The product itself was great, went on a little wet and dried quickly leaving a wonderful sparkle of glitter.  Washed of easily and didn&#x27;t damage the costumes at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s glitter in a spritz bottle. need I say more?</li>
            <li> Great to put in your hair before you do it. Its not alot of sparkles.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these and they are all great but the pumps don&#x27;t work all of the time.  There is alot of glitter in the bottle which is great.  Covers alot.</li>
            <li> the pump broke after owning the item for only one day. The glitter is nice but had to throw away the bottle so it wouldn&#x27;t ruin all of my belongings :(</li>
            <li> I bought this spray to use mainly for use as part of my fairy costume. I&#x27;d seen one review someone wrote that the sprayer on the bottle they bought broke after a few use&#x27;s, but I only saw that one so I figured it was likely a flaw in the bottle they got. Apparently not. I bought this in July, used it once when I first received it, to see how heavily the glitter sprayed on hair and such, and then again at a convention where I was dressing up in my fairy costume, and in that second use, after one spray, the sprayer jammed, and won&#x27;t spray anymore.

            <li> I love the *product,* because I spray glitter in my hair every day. HOWEVER...it does not work, very quickly. The spray mechanism stops working. I need to find an empty spray bottle, to see if that will work. :(</li>
            <li> Not very sparkly.  It&#x27;s very hard to spray enough on to get that look you want.  It&#x27;s very wet.. Very very wet.</li>
            <li> This glitter spray is okay; just okay. Unlike other sprays I have used, if I spray this in my hair I shed glitter *everywhere* and using hairspray after applying helps a little - but only a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They need to improve the product by using hairspray or other type of water-soluble adhesive as the delivery medium.</li>
            <li> I love glitter and when I purchased this product I love it. Glitter , glitter and more glitter in your hair body etc. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I like this because I can spray a little on my finger and use it as eye glitter or anything.</li>
            <li> This spray is not as heavy with glitter or as noticeable as true gitter hairsprays.  It is not an actual hairspray, but just a water-based spray with glitter in it.  You have to apply it heavier to get the same effect. I usually apply hairspray over the top to hold the glitter on, otherwise it comes off when the hair dries.  It does look nice when it&#x27;s all said and done, and the bottle lasts longer than the hairspray glitter cans.</li>
            <li> The silver smells like blueberry Hubba Bubba. Yum! I spray this glitter on myself whenever someone upsets me and it has become a quick cure for being mad. Ha. :) I know that may sound silly, but try some and you&#x27;ll see. You can&#x27;t be upset, when you&#x27;re sparkly from yummy smelling glitter. ;) Great for anyone in customer service, I bet. :) It also washes away easily and doesn&#x27;t leave traces of glitter everywhere for months.</li>
            <li> Product smells really great and has just enough of a glitter spray without being too overwhelming like some products can be - not sticky or drying and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down if you don&#x27;t over spray it</li>
            <li> This glitz hair and body glitter looks great and smells good. I never tried a spray before.  It is easy to use and travels well since it has a lock to avoid spraying in the suitcase by accident</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this glitter!  It sprays on beautifully and easily.  I love being a fun-loving glitter girl!!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was never able to get even 1 spray. It was all stick. Finally, after giving up, I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> I like the glitter.  I like that it&#x27;s easy to wash off and doesn&#x27;t seem to get on everything.  I do not like the fragrance, however; it&#x27;s very sweet smelling and a little nauseating.  And, the pump has stopped working after about 2 weeks and about 1/10 of the product is used.  Very, very cheap packaging.</li>
            <li> The glitter is great. It&#x27;s the sprayer that is the problem.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle now, so when it stops working I just pour it into another spray bottle.  It&#x27;s too bad that there aren&#x27;t any tips from the company on how to unclog it. It sprays nicer than other bottles.  If anyone has any suggestions,  please let us all know :)</li>
            <li> As other reviewers said, it clogs up after one or two uses. My kid loved using it for parties and halloween. It smelled ok. But, it clogged making it worthless with a full bottle. Don&#x27;t think of using a new bottle. It will clog it too.</li>
            <li> Its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Only takes a few little squirts to be sublty shiny.....can&#x27;t wait to literally pour it on!  Blingy event coming soon..and I will shine!</li>
