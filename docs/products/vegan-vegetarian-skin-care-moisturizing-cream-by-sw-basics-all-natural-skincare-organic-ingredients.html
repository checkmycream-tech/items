            <li>SW Basics are wonderful products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer every night and loving it!!</li>
            <li>In the end, I used it on my feet and the quality of the ingredients is great.  </li>
            <li>If you are allergic to vitamin A, this one would be a great product for you.</li>
            <li>Feels great.</li>
            <li>This cream is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I still give it 4 stars for the best ingredients and caring about the animals:).</li>
            <li>I loved rubbing this on my feet and putting on my socks.</li>
            <li>I know the ingredients are good for my face</li>
            <li>Love the simplicity and quality of the ingredients!</li>
            <li>This is my winning ticket!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>But dries fast, and feels great!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best and most effective.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best I have ever used</li>
            <li>It is also animal cruelty free, which I love (and made in the good ol USA).</li>
            <li>have said this many time before-</li>
            <li>My skin was smoother, more hydrated, and not one but greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magical</li>
            <li>I LOVE it for my hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s healthy and vegetarian too.</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of this product - just 3 magic ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable, safe, and it does what it&#x27;s meant to.</li>
            <li>I only purchase 100% organic products and SW Basics are excellent.  </li>
            <li>Simple but wonderful!</li>
            <li>so I really wanted this to be great - and it would be if I didn&#x27;t dislike the smell.  </li>
            <li>, my skin looks phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I spent a long time, online, at many sites, looking for the best, most healthy ingredients to moisurize your skin; this one has the best 3 that they mentioned, and organic, too.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job of moisturizing, but it has a funny smell.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well made and has a fair amount of product that will last a good while.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you&#x27;re staying home, or use it right before bed.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>can honestly say this product will be a staple for me!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s somewhat like L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s 100% Shea butter, only much, much better.</li>
            <li>but I get a better response from my skin using straight oil instead of this &#x27;cream.</li>
            <li>but I was willing to cope with that because I don&#x27;t want the chemicals that make lotion easy to spread.  </li>
            <li>The second use and beyond was greater and greater reduction of the bumps and the redness wasn&#x27;t there AT all.</li>
            <li>Iâ€™m the type of girl that winces in pain at spending more than 10 bucks on a beauty product, particularly because I have</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for curly dry hair after shower.</li>
            <li>Love the ALL natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and really does live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any natural suggestions for lotion, I&#x27;d love to hear them.</li>
            <li>Everything that I hoped this moisturizer would be; and shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>Great handcream when used in small amounts.</li>
            <li>This gorgeous, 3 ingredient moisturizer by SW Basics delivers exactly what it promises as it deeply nourishes my skin (especially important during this long, dry winter), and the subtle, natural aroma is perfectly pleasing.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in the bumps within the first use.</li>
            <li>Regular lotions have so many chemicals</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the immediate relief and the following morning.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li>I chose this skincare system after much research for my Rosacea.  </li>
            <li>really.  </li>
            <li>really.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of this</li>
            <li>And the best part about it that it&#x27;s HALF the price that the tube of Retinol A cream was and lasted twice as long (I still have more than half of the cream left after a month) and within a month the tube of Retinol was gone!</li>
            <li>If you can get past all of the crunchiness--it&#x27;s rather a nice product.</li>
            <li>The texture is influenced by the room temperature--so it softens up when the ambient temperature is high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>best part is that there are only a few natural ingredients, which makes me happy because I HATE putting chemicals on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the thicknes of it but the natural smell of it is very of and bother my nose.</li>
            <li>I first started using their line of skincare products, I noticed that my skin had a really nice glow compared to anything I had ever tried in the past - definitely recommend all their products!</li>
            <li>and my skin felt very soft and plump.</li>
            <li>Hands, feet, knees, and especially loved it because it got rid of the \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really unscented and while it is slightly greasy (it&#x27;s supposed to be), it absorbed somewhat quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I awake to soft, silky skin (no oily residue), and my husband loves how it smells.</li>
            <li>Boy is this product natural---like coconut-oil-from-your-kitchen natural.</li>
            <li>It is soothing to the skin and has made my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that the only ingredients in here are coconut oil, shea butter and olive oil.  </li>
            <li>I use a tiny bit on my face, rubbing it into my hands first to soften, and also use on my hands and other parts of my body that get overly dry in the winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very sensitive to fragrance, so I&#x27;ve abandoned a lot of other products because the fragrance was overpowering.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The the other reviewers mentioned, this cream melts i to your skin and leaves it soft and supple the next morning!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very oily and heavy, but for dry patches</li>
            <li> insanely dry, itchy skin and many a product have failed me.</li>
            <li> It is a little too thick to try on my face, but other than that--I loved it every other single place I put this!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s as natural and isn&#x27;t hard on the budget.  </li>
            <li> The Vitamin A is a natural skin smoother and DID rid my skin of the bumps, but after paying $80 for a small tube that didn&#x27;t last long at all, I was looking at other options for myself.</li>
            <li> Luxurious, saturation for dry and thirsty skin.  </li>
            <li> It is subtle and natural, no extra fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have tried every moisturizer known to man regardless of price.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> This jar is about the size of a small container of Vaseline and has the same look and texture of it too!</li>
            <li> It leaves small reddish bumps all over my thighs and the back of my arms.</li>
            <li> This cream smells pretty bad (aka very natural and a little bit waxy).  </li>
            <li> But it has some serious hydrating properties and a small amount goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used SW Basics for a few nights now over my retin-a.</li>
            <li> It took a few hours to sink in (I put it on way before hitting the hay).</li>
            <li> My feet are really soft now, but sadly I will not be ordering this again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It may seem expensive at $30 a jar, but the jar lasts me a LONG time (over 6 months).</li>
            <li> I thought maybe at least it would reduce the appearance of the bumps or take away the redness associated with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to put on</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> I hate having dry skin, so this was tried EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> I have Keratosis Pilaris, which is nicknamed chicken skin for a reason.</li>
            <li> I received this, I automatically thought of the \\&quot;Chicken Skin\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for a foot cream!</li>

            <li> This jar is about the size of a small container of Vaseline and has the same look and texture of it too! But it has some serious hydrating properties and a small amount goes a long, long way. It&#x27;s really unscented and while it is slightly greasy (it&#x27;s supposed to be), it absorbed somewhat quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t attempt to apply this to my face, it&#x27;s very oily and heavy, but for dry patches its perfect &amp; I imagine I will be applying this to my entire body come winter time.&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly say this product will be a staple for me!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s somewhat like L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s 100% Shea butter, only much, much better.</li>
            <li> This cream is AMAZING! It has no smell at all. It is subtle and natural, no extra fragrances. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy like some creams seem to do. My clothes don&#x27;t end up sticking to my skin and it&#x27;s awesomely hydrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have said this many time before- I have Keratosis Pilaris, which is nicknamed chicken skin for a reason. It leaves small reddish bumps all over my thighs and the back of my arms. There isn&#x27;t a cure, although it CAN be managed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked it up online and found out that Retinol A cream cures it. The Vitamin A is a natural skin smoother and DID rid my skin of the bumps, but after paying $80 for a small tube that didn&#x27;t last long at all, I was looking at other options for myself. My doctor told me that Olive oil mixed with Nivea Body Oil would work, but I never&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this, I automatically thought of the \\&quot;Chicken Skin\\&quot;. I thought maybe at least it would reduce the appearance of the bumps or take away the redness associated with it. To my amazement it started doing both. I could tell a difference in the bumps within the first use. The second use and beyond was greater and greater reduction of the bumps and the redness wasn&#x27;t there AT all. My skin was smoother, more hydrated, and not one but greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be used ALL over your body. I hate having dry skin, so this was tried EVERYWHERE. I loved rubbing this on my feet and putting on my socks. It kept my feet from drying out ALL day. It is a little too thick to try on my face, but other than that--I loved it every other single place I put this!! Hands, feet, knees, and especially loved it because it got rid of the \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot;! And the best part about it that it&#x27;s HALF the price that the tube of Retinol A cream was and lasted twice as long (I still have more than half of the cream left after a month) and within a month the tube of Retinol was gone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer every night and loving it!! I awake to soft, silky skin (no oily residue), and my husband loves how it smells. He&#x27;s very sensitive to fragrance, so I&#x27;ve abandoned a lot of other products because the fragrance was overpowering. This gorgeous, 3 ingredient moisturizer by SW Basics delivers exactly what it promises as it deeply nourishes my skin (especially important during this long, dry winter), and the subtle, natural aroma is perfectly pleasing.</li>
            <li> Boy is this product natural---like coconut-oil-from-your-kitchen natural. And it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent. The texture is influenced by the room temperature--so it softens up when the ambient temperature is high. If you can get past all of the crunchiness--it&#x27;s rather a nice product. I&#x27;ve used SW Basics for a few nights now over my retin-a. It took a few hours to sink in (I put it on way before hitting the hay). The next morning--no retin-a soreness and my skin felt very soft and plump.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magical I LOVE it for my hair. it&#x27;s good for curly dry hair after shower. and it&#x27;s healthy and vegetarian too.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and have tried every moisturizer known to man regardless of price. This is by far the best and most effective. Great for face, body and hair! A miracle In a jar.</li>
            <li> I spent a long time, online, at many sites, looking for the best, most healthy ingredients to moisurize your skin; this one has the best 3 that they mentioned, and organic, too. It is also animal cruelty free, which I love (and made in the good ol USA). It says it&#x27;s a cream, and it looks like it when it&#x27;s in the jar, but when you take it out to put on your skin, it is as greasy as can be. The &#x27;cream&#x27; labeling is a bit misleading. Just make sure you&#x27;re staying home, or use it right before bed. I still give it 4 stars for the best ingredients and caring about the animals:).</li>
            <li> This cream smells pretty bad (aka very natural and a little bit waxy).  My husband was not a fan when I put it on my face.  In the end, I used it on my feet and the quality of the ingredients is great.  My feet are really soft now, but sadly I will not be ordering this again.  Too expensive for a foot cream!</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of this product - just 3 magic ingredients. It&#x27;s affordable, safe, and it does what it&#x27;s meant to.</li>
            <li> I only purchase 100% organic products and SW Basics are excellent.  I use this as a night cream and it just melts on your skin.  You only need a tiny bit.  Highly recommend.  If you like organic products, you might want to try Bubble and Bee products.  They have a similar cream but with lots of vitamin A.  If you are allergic to vitamin A, this one would be a great product for you.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and really does live up to the hype. Iâ€™m the type of girl that winces in pain at spending more than 10 bucks on a beauty product, particularly because I have insanely dry, itchy skin and many a product have failed me. Love the simplicity and quality of the ingredients!</li>
            <li> I know the ingredients are good for my face but I get a better response from my skin using straight oil instead of this &#x27;cream.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well made and has a fair amount of product that will last a good while.</li>
            <li> SW Basics are wonderful products.  I chose this skincare system after much research for my Rosacea.  I was not disappointed.  It&#x27;s simple, it&#x27;s as natural and isn&#x27;t hard on the budget.  It is soothing to the skin and has made my skin so soft.  All Rosacea sufferers know, there is no cure, however, when you find a product that helps than you&#x27;ve hit the lottery.  This is my winning ticket!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about 2 years now (yep - when the company used to be Sprout Skincare) and I have found nothing else that compares to this moisturizer. It is by far the best I have ever used and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem expensive at $30 a jar, but the jar lasts me a LONG time (over 6 months). I use a tiny bit on my face, rubbing it into my hands first to soften, and also use on my hands and other parts of my body that get overly dry in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that there are only a few natural ingredients, which makes me happy because I HATE putting chemicals on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using their line of skincare products, I noticed that my skin had a really nice glow compared to anything I had ever tried in the past - definitely recommend all their products!</li>
            <li> Feels great. Will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat 3 ingredients!</li>
            <li> I like the thicknes of it but the natural smell of it is very of and bother my nose.I got k9 nose so it might be different for others</li>
            <li> Simple but wonderful! The the other reviewers mentioned, this cream melts i to your skin and leaves it soft and supple the next morning! Love it!</li>
            <li> wanted to like.  really.  really. wanted to like.  but don&#x27;t.  try it if you like - it might be your thing.</li>
            <li> Great handcream when used in small amounts. A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that the only ingredients in here are coconut oil, shea butter and olive oil.  You don&#x27;t need much of this and it does a good job of moisturizing, but it has a funny smell.  I have been coping with that  by putting on a verbena body oil afterward but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again.  Not sure what I&#x27;ll do exactly.  Regular lotions have so many chemicals so I really wanted this to be great - and it would be if I didn&#x27;t dislike the smell.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to put on but I was willing to cope with that because I don&#x27;t want the chemicals that make lotion easy to spread.  If anyone has any natural suggestions for lotion, I&#x27;d love to hear them.</li>
            <li> Everything that I hoped this moisturizer would be; and shipping was super fast! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy. But dries fast, and feels great! Love the ALL natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> Luxurious, saturation for dry and thirsty skin.  I love the immediate relief and the following morning., my skin looks phenomenal.  My &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; facial quench.**</li>
