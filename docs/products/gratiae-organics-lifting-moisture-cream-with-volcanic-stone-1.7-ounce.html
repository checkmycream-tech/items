            <li>Love the Gratiae products.  </li>

            <li>Love the way it makes my face feel in the evening.  </li>

            <li>Have found my skin looks healthier and more youthful</li>
            <li>I love this cream.  </li>
            <li>, I mentioned this on another review as well, be sure to drink lots of water, eat well, exercise, get plenty of rest, and monitor alcohol or caffeine consumption.</li>
            <li>still love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am not convinced it has altered or reduced any signs of aging, but it is an awesome addition to my facial cleansing &amp; moisturizing practices.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin moisturized and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and feels nice.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it improved my skin so for the price there are probably better ones.</li>
            <li>It thawed out and seems to be ok though.....</li>
            <li>I have tried many moisturizing creams over the years.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to buy on  Amazon and not in Vegas.</li>
            <li>AND JUST LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I love what it does for my skin</li>
            <li>/ Acneic works better for me.</li>
            <li>is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Like many others on here, I bought two products from a lady in Las Vegas for an obscene amount of money.  </li>
            <li>I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Its a very nice moisturizer  cream, I would certainly recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Makeup started going on more easily.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product as a great and natural effecting moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels wonderful, appears healthy, but I am not convinced any of my fine lines have vanished due to its use.</li>
            <li>I love how they make my skin feel and the slight fragrance is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I found the product in Las Vegas and first purchased it there (for alot more money!).  </li>
            <li>This is a great mask &amp; I love that you only have to leave it on for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very mild</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and is not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking for products to prevent the fine lines.</li>
            <li>this cream is light and goes on easily without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Every product goes on easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality product that is for certain.</li>
            <li>It arrived in perfect condition within a few weeks from USA to Australia.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic for that purpose solely.</li>
            <li>This cream is absolutely great for my skin, especially with the volcanic stone.</li>
            <li>It was tampered and filled with I</li>
            <li>This product is very creamy and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Cheap compared to the ones you find in stalls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Works fabulous.</li>
            <li>I got duped by a crafty sales lady in Las Vegas....</li>
            <li>I am happy to get the product for less, but THERE IS A DIFFERENCE :)</li>
            <li>Gratiae products have been amazing so far and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I hope that comes across as a friendly reminder to take care of yourself :</li>
            <li>Livraison dans emballage original scell√©.</li>
            <li>The salesperson was very nice, unlike many of the people who sell this, but when I found it on Amazon at a much lower price, I had to buy my second jar here.  </li>
            <li>The price is definitely right!</li>
            <li>I did some research on my iPhone and discovered that Amazon had much more reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>I love Gratiae exfoliating gel and had high hopes for this moisture cream.</li>
            <li>works great on dark skin too.</li>
            <li>Your face will feel so smooth after  the first use.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them highly and getting them thru Amazon.com is much more economical.</li>
            <li>So Far, I am pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years because I have sensitive, combination skin.  </li>
            <li>Brilliant cream, light and fluffy and if used over the serum just a tiny amount needed</li>
            <li>I have never, over the past year, experienced any agitation of my skin using these topicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them previously and was thrilled to find them on Amazon for significantly lower price.</li>
            <li>and I fine that it works better than any other product.  </li>
            <li>After you rinse the mask off, you are left with a lovely glow.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth, soft, and supple.</li>
            <li>However, when I attempt to use an alternate moisturizer in the evening, say something of comparative price or value, I always notice immediately that the Gratiae product absorbs and feels better.</li>
            <li>She finds it much better than others of the same form.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product at a kiosk in the mall.  </li>
            <li>First purchase was in Miracle Mile in Vegas.  </li>
            <li>First bought this creme for twice the price on Nantucket Island.</li>
            <li>Many people comment on my healthy facial skin and it does help make me look younger with a glow.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous, light and luxurious moisturizer...even works well in the dry climate of Wyoming.</li>
            <li>This is a good cream for the money, but only if you use it with the Grataie facial lifting serum.  </li>
            <li>I try to only eat and use organic products so to find this organic skincare line at a much more reasonable price</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes &amp; isn&#x27;t oily or tacky at all.</li>
            <li>I have never had such smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use the whole jar.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;d really be upset.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it lifts anything yet</li>
            <li>very efficient products</li>
            <li>This product is very beneficial for the skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommendy the eye and face serums/creams!</li>
            <li>This is a must have makes your face feel smooth, firmer and younger!!!!</li>
            <li>Nothing really worked very well except Prevage and with that I had to put a moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li>I just shop around until I find a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I am very please.</li>
            <li>It is not worth more than $15.00 or $20 that I paid for it.</li>
            <li>got here early and was exactly as described</li>
            <li>More expensive not always means better product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend all these products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for making these products available at such a low cost</li>
            <li>I phoned the company directly and asked them why the products were so much cheaper on amazon.  </li>
            <li>the Elavonne Organic Rejuvenating MSM - 1 oz - Normal to Oily</li>
            <li>I had a problem with the stone being broken and the seller made good on it</li>
            <li>Know this isn&#x27;t new.  </li>
            <li>I live in northern Minnesota so by the time I got home to get my mail</li>
            <li>, the stone is great for under the eyes in the morning, it stays cold so with gentle outward sweeping strokes</li>
            <li>I use it daily and find it to be very rejuvenating and over time it does seem to tighten and moisturize the face very well.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this creme does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>This mask is essential to your skin care arsenal, if you are interested in maintaining your youthful glow.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I Can get a refund, but I&#x27;m sure going to try.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product in Las Vegas after several nights of no sleep.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the exact same product without any defects.</li>
            <li>The packaging was EXACTLY the same.  </li>
            <li>and I also have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>when I received this the jar  looked old and the writing on jar was flaking off.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and makes your face soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 years old</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If they continue to insist we purchase direct, I will drop the product.</li>
            <li>The cream leaves a silky soft touch to the skin .Will</li>
            <li>Ridiculously expensive, but to be truthful, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this moisturizing cream for 2+ years, the entire product line of Gratiae is somthing I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i very dry skin, and my skin holds a fair amount of moisture (not great) throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin, normal as far as oil/non-oily type, a white European complexion, and I reside in an arid region.</li>
            <li>I am impressed though, and as well, I have used more expensive and less expensive products that I am comparing the Gratiae to.</li>
            <li>I say this because the internal bodily functions do become apparent in outward appearances as well.</li>
            <li>Opened it and it was Less than half full.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it improved my skin so for the price there are probably better ones.</li>
            <li> It thawed out and seems to be ok though.....</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizing creams over the years.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to buy on  Amazon and not in Vegas.</li>
            <li> AND JUST LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I love what it does for my skin</li>
            <li> / Acneic works better for me.</li>
            <li> is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Like many others on here, I bought two products from a lady in Las Vegas for an obscene amount of money.  </li>
            <li> I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Its a very nice moisturizer  cream, I would certainly recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Makeup started going on more easily.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as a great and natural effecting moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels wonderful, appears healthy, but I am not convinced any of my fine lines have vanished due to its use.</li>
            <li> I love how they make my skin feel and the slight fragrance is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I found the product in Las Vegas and first purchased it there (for alot more money!).  </li>
            <li> This is a great mask &amp; I love that you only have to leave it on for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very mild</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and is not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking for products to prevent the fine lines.</li>
            <li> this cream is light and goes on easily without that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Every product goes on easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality product that is for certain.</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition within a few weeks from USA to Australia.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic for that purpose solely.</li>
            <li> This cream is absolutely great for my skin, especially with the volcanic stone.</li>
            <li> It was tampered and filled with I</li>
            <li> This product is very creamy and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Cheap compared to the ones you find in stalls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Works fabulous.</li>
            <li> I got duped by a crafty sales lady in Las Vegas....</li>
            <li> I am happy to get the product for less, but THERE IS A DIFFERENCE :)</li>
            <li> Gratiae products have been amazing so far and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I hope that comes across as a friendly reminder to take care of yourself :</li>
            <li> Livraison dans emballage original scell√©.</li>
            <li> The salesperson was very nice, unlike many of the people who sell this, but when I found it on Amazon at a much lower price, I had to buy my second jar here.  </li>
            <li> The price is definitely right!</li>
            <li> I did some research on my iPhone and discovered that Amazon had much more reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> I love Gratiae exfoliating gel and had high hopes for this moisture cream.</li>
            <li> works great on dark skin too.</li>
            <li> Your face will feel so smooth after  the first use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them highly and getting them thru Amazon.com is much more economical.</li>
            <li> So Far, I am pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years because I have sensitive, combination skin.  </li>
            <li> Brilliant cream, light and fluffy and if used over the serum just a tiny amount needed</li>
            <li> I have never, over the past year, experienced any agitation of my skin using these topicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them previously and was thrilled to find them on Amazon for significantly lower price.</li>
            <li> and I fine that it works better than any other product.  </li>
            <li> After you rinse the mask off, you are left with a lovely glow.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth, soft, and supple.</li>
            <li> However, when I attempt to use an alternate moisturizer in the evening, say something of comparative price or value, I always notice immediately that the Gratiae product absorbs and feels better.</li>
            <li> She finds it much better than others of the same form.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at a kiosk in the mall.  </li>
            <li> First purchase was in Miracle Mile in Vegas.  </li>
            <li> First bought this creme for twice the price on Nantucket Island.</li>
            <li> Many people comment on my healthy facial skin and it does help make me look younger with a glow.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous, light and luxurious moisturizer...even works well in the dry climate of Wyoming.</li>
            <li> This is a good cream for the money, but only if you use it with the Grataie facial lifting serum.  </li>
            <li> I try to only eat and use organic products so to find this organic skincare line at a much more reasonable price</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes &amp; isn&#x27;t oily or tacky at all.</li>
            <li> I have never had such smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use the whole jar.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;d really be upset.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say it lifts anything yet</li>
            <li> very efficient products</li>
            <li> This product is very beneficial for the skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommendy the eye and face serums/creams!</li>
            <li> This is a must have makes your face feel smooth, firmer and younger!!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing really worked very well except Prevage and with that I had to put a moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li> I just shop around until I find a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I am very please.</li>
            <li> It is not worth more than $15.00 or $20 that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> got here early and was exactly as described</li>
            <li> More expensive not always means better product.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend all these products.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for making these products available at such a low cost</li>
            <li> I phoned the company directly and asked them why the products were so much cheaper on amazon.  </li>
            <li> the Elavonne Organic Rejuvenating MSM - 1 oz - Normal to Oily</li>
            <li> I had a problem with the stone being broken and the seller made good on it</li>
            <li> Know this isn&#x27;t new.  </li>
            <li> I live in northern Minnesota so by the time I got home to get my mail</li>
            <li> , the stone is great for under the eyes in the morning, it stays cold so with gentle outward sweeping strokes</li>
            <li> I use it daily and find it to be very rejuvenating and over time it does seem to tighten and moisturize the face very well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this creme does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> This mask is essential to your skin care arsenal, if you are interested in maintaining your youthful glow.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I Can get a refund, but I&#x27;m sure going to try.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product in Las Vegas after several nights of no sleep.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the exact same product without any defects.</li>
            <li> The packaging was EXACTLY the same.  </li>
            <li> and I also have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> when I received this the jar  looked old and the writing on jar was flaking off.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and makes your face soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 years old</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If they continue to insist we purchase direct, I will drop the product.</li>
            <li> The cream leaves a silky soft touch to the skin .Will</li>
            <li> Ridiculously expensive, but to be truthful, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizing cream for 2+ years, the entire product line of Gratiae is somthing I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i very dry skin, and my skin holds a fair amount of moisture (not great) throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, normal as far as oil/non-oily type, a white European complexion, and I reside in an arid region.</li>
            <li> I am impressed though, and as well, I have used more expensive and less expensive products that I am comparing the Gratiae to.</li>
            <li> I say this because the internal bodily functions do become apparent in outward appearances as well.</li>
            <li> Opened it and it was Less than half full.</li>
            <li> It had a slight burn to my exfoliated skin which I don&#x27;t normally experience unless chemicals are in a product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Gratiae as may be more expensive but that little jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have trouble finding a product that works for me.</li>
            <li> and this is one of few products I can use that keeps my skin looking young.</li>
            <li> Same issues with other gratiae.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money, mine had actually been used and returned I guess because there was clearly 1/3 missing</li>
            <li> would encourage anyone with dry skin to use it.</li>
            <li> I just about had a heart attack when I saw that you could buy the same products for HUNDREDS less on amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other facial lotions and they make my face look pale with grey washed out tones.</li>
            <li> But, then I didn&#x27;t observe any with lifting (other than a minor temporary lifting) with any other creams I have used, including the $600 cream.  </li>
            <li> It is not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> In addition, it does not irritate my skin, (I have sensitive skin), it is not too thick or greasy, either.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products from this line &amp; have yet to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using the lifting moisture cream cream in combination with other Gratiae products for over a year now .</li>
            <li> Like the other products Gratiae for my wife</li>
            <li> But due to my skin type</li>
            <li> The box was a little smashed, but nothing was broken, I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> So, hands down, the Gratiae moisturizing properties are worthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two in combination work almost as well as my previous $600 dollar cream.  </li>
            <li> Make them hot or cold.  </li>
            <li> It seems to help fade the freckles a little.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased this product from a little shop in Las Vegas.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Tampered and leaking.</li>
            <li> I was using this everyday and</li>
            <li> yet it dried out.</li>
            <li> then I found it less expensive on the net.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, it is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I was on vacation in Miami when a sales person at skin care boutique tried to hard sell me and wanted me to pay exorbitant prices for this skin care line.</li>
            <li> Second, there was an unpleasant smell to this cream - like a faux floral.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than in the malls.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing it was open</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when this product dried out.</li>
            <li> It also provides a needed lift to tired aging skin!</li>
            <li> Can be used cold on eyes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the link of these products, sorry!</li>
            <li> In Vegas at the Paris Casino they have it and it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed, just Devastated.</li>
            <li> feel stupid</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing skincare at unbelieveable prices!</li>
            <li> This is the third purchase I have made of this cream and I fine that it works better than any other product.  To my amazement, the volcanic stone really smooths the skin to where it almost looks flawless.</li>
            <li> Great product, will continue using it as my every day cream.&lt;br /&gt;I would encourage anyone with dry skin to use it.</li>
            <li> The box was a little smashed, but nothing was broken, I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> I also started using this product do to a salesman in Las Vegas.  I appreciate his efforts or I would not have started using this wonderful moisture cream.  IT APPEARS TO BE A RETURNED PRODUCT and now I am buying it from the reseller.  The paper inside was all ripped, the info card was yellowed and worn, and an application stick in it had something on it like lipstick. I am happy to get the product for less, but THERE IS A DIFFERENCE :)</li>
            <li> This is a great mask &amp; I love that you only have to leave it on for 5 minutes. It smells great &amp; after you wash it off, it leaves a serum like film on your skin. It really moisturizes &amp; isn&#x27;t oily or tacky at all. After you rinse the mask off, you are left with a lovely glow. I have tried many products from this line &amp; have yet to be disappointed. This mask is essential to your skin care arsenal, if you are interested in maintaining your youthful glow.</li>
            <li> Love the Gratiae products.  I&#x27;ve used them previously and was thrilled to find them on Amazon for significantly lower price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, makes your skin feel like velvet and definitely reduces wrinkles by making your skin feel firmer within a weeks of using the cream. It arrived in perfect condition within a few weeks from USA to Australia.</li>
            <li> Wife liked the product. Much less expensive than in the malls.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love the way it makes my face feel in the evening.  Have not used the volcanic stone yet.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Love the stone! Good moisturizing.  Smells good.  My 3rd order on this product.  Love the stones for massage.  Make them hot or cold.  Can be used cold on eyes.  Feel great!</li>
            <li> This product is okay and seems to moisturize well. But I have not noticed any lifting significance or wrinkle reduction.</li>
            <li> I have been using their products since May 2011 and I also have sensitive skin.  Gratiae products have been amazing so far and are easy to use.  I would recommend them highly and getting them thru Amazon.com is much more economical.</li>
            <li> Love how it moisturizers my skin</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed, just Devastated. when I received this the jar  looked old and the writing on jar was flaking off. Not even sealed. Opened it and it was Less than half full. I paid $50.00 for Gratiae lifting cream. I feel like I have been totally ripped off. I am beginning to have my doubts about some of the companies that Amazon chooses. Not sure if I Can get a refund, but I&#x27;m sure going to try.</li>
            <li> I have been using the lifting moisture cream cream in combination with other Gratiae products for over a year now . Like others my introduction to the products was at a kiosk in Vegas-----need I say more!!!  Have found my skin looks healthier and more youthful and I think the best test for its effectiveness is when people find out I am older than I look.  Thanks to Amazon for making these products available at such a low cost</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It is not greasy and makes your face soft.  I use it under my make up.  It seems to help fade the freckles a little.  I would buy this again.  In Vegas at the Paris Casino they have it and it is very expensive.  On Amazon it was a good price.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Brilliant cream, light and fluffy and if used over the serum just a tiny amount needed so will last and last, the stone is great for under the eyes in the morning, it stays cold so with gentle outward sweeping strokes it clears the puffiness and refreshes your eyes.</li>
            <li> Gratiae Lifting Moisture with Volcanic Stone.  Like the other products Gratiae for my wife a great tool to reverse the aging Tema.  Since our visit to Las Vegas, she uses nothing but Gratiae.  We are delighted to have these products in the Netherlands can buy through Amazon.  Many thanks, best regards.  Wilhelmus Holierook, Haarlem, Netherlands</li>
            <li> ***Update November 13***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I am still using this product. I use it in combination with the lifting serum. I stopped using the ultrox (also by Gratiae), at this point. I have continued to apply the lifting serum and lifting moisture cream in the evening after I cleanse my face. I truly like the moisturizing benefits these products deliver. My skin feels smooth, soft, and supple. I have never, over the past year, experienced any agitation of my skin using these topicals. I do have sensitive skin, normal as far as oil/non-oily type, a white European complexion, and I reside in an arid region. I would recommend this product as a great and natural effecting moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall thoughts on the product&#x27;s anti-aging properties remains the same. My skin feels wonderful, appears healthy, but I am not convinced any of my fine lines have vanished due to its use. However, when I attempt to use an alternate moisturizer in the evening, say something of comparative price or value, I always notice immediately that the Gratiae product absorbs and feels better. So, hands down, the Gratiae moisturizing properties are worthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final note, I mentioned this on another review as well, be sure to drink lots of water, eat well, exercise, get plenty of rest, and monitor alcohol or caffeine consumption. I say this because the internal bodily functions do become apparent in outward appearances as well. If your body is not nourished properly, then it cannot perform optimally. Thus, your skin will show it! I hope that comes across as a friendly reminder to take care of yourself :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update April 24****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still love this moisturizer. It is fantastic for that purpose solely. I am not convinced it has altered or reduced any signs of aging, but it is an awesome addition to my facial cleansing &amp; moisturizing practices. Nice quality product that is for certain. I would purchase this product again, along with the ultrox anti-wrinkle cream &amp; the lifting serum as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Original Post Below*******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am loving this cream! After a few weeks, it is a keeper! I use this around my eyes, forehead, cheeks, and mouth/chin areas. In addition, it does not irritate my skin, (I have sensitive skin), it is not too thick or greasy, either. I will update my posting as time progresses. So Far, I am pleased with the quality. I will monitor the anti-aging components and report back after a couple months. I am impressed though, and as well, I have used more expensive and less expensive products that I am comparing the Gratiae to. The price is definitely right!</li>
            <li> This product works great. It leaves my skin moisturized and looking healthy. I have sensitive skin and have trouble finding a product that works for me. It is expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was already using Gratiae products, but I was paying the double. Now in amazon I found a way of saving my money and have these excellent products. I don&#x27;t have the link of these products, sorry!</li>
            <li> This cream is absolutely great for my skin, especially with the volcanic stone. I have never had such smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Know this isn&#x27;t new.  It was tampered and filled with I don&#x27;t know what.  Never happened before. Same issues with other gratiae.  Waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Tampered and leaking.</li>
            <li> Very nice and effective item for the price. i do recommend this lifting cream. works great on dark skin too.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product. I&#x27;m 37 years old and I&#x27;m looking for products to prevent the fine lines. I was disappointed when this product dried out. I was using this everyday and yet it dried out. I couldn&#x27;t use the whole jar. I probably finished 80%. I&#x27;m so thankful I didn&#x27;t buy this at the kiosks or I&#x27;d really be upset.  I definitely won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing it was open</li>
            <li> Great cream,goes on smothly</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this product overall.  It goes on smooth and feels nice.  I don&#x27;t know that it improved my skin so for the price there are probably better ones.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, light and luxurious moisturizer...even works well in the dry climate of Wyoming. Love it!!!!! Love it!!!!!! Love, Love Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> not worth the money, mine had actually been used and returned I guess because there was clearly 1/3 missing</li>
            <li> This is a good cream for the money, but only if you use it with the Grataie facial lifting serum.  i very dry skin, and my skin holds a fair amount of moisture (not great) throughout the day.  The two in combination work almost as well as my previous $600 dollar cream.  Don&#x27;t expect any lifting though.  I didn&#x27;t observe any at all.  But, then I didn&#x27;t observe any with lifting (other than a minor temporary lifting) with any other creams I have used, including the $600 cream.  I would definitely try the combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Business Lady</li>
            <li> this cream is light and goes on easily without that greasy feeling. I can&#x27;t really say it lifts anything yet but I have only used it for about a month now; but it does provide moisture to your face.  Just wish it contained spf so that I didn&#x27;t have to put that on over it.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I have used it before and liked it but didn&#x27;t like the price I paid in the store.  This was a good price.  I wasn&#x27;t happy at first when I got the cream and it was delivered by the post office in my mailbox.  I live in northern Minnesota so by the time I got home to get my mail it was frozen solid!  It thawed out and seems to be ok though.....</li>
            <li> This is a quality cream that my wife uses all the time. She finds it much better than others of the same form.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizing cream for 2+ years, the entire product line of Gratiae is somthing I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> very efficient products</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizing creams over the years.  This is perfect.  The fragrance is very mild so it doesn&#x27;t offend those with sensitivities.  It&#x27;s not greasy but just perfect.  I found the product in Las Vegas and first purchased it there (for alot more money!).  Then along comes a search with Amazon!  I HIGHLY recommend all these products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and then as now found it to be very good .</li>
            <li> This product is very creamy and smells nice. As for it actually doing what it claims; ie, lifting, after a month of using it, I saw no difference at all.</li>
            <li> I love Gratiae exfoliating gel and had high hopes for this moisture cream. It didn&#x27;t quite deliver as I had hoped. This says it is organic but I wonder about that. It had a slight burn to my exfoliated skin which I don&#x27;t normally experience unless chemicals are in a product. Second, there was an unpleasant smell to this cream - like a faux floral. I will continue to look for a a truly lifting cream.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at a kiosk in the mall.  The salesperson was very nice, unlike many of the people who sell this, but when I found it on Amazon at a much lower price, I had to buy my second jar here.  I also have the serum and both are excellent for my skin.</li>
            <li> It is not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. Your face will feel so smooth after  the first use. Highly recommend this product. Be sure to buy on  Amazon and not in Vegas.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED FOR OVER A YEAR AND JUST LOVE IT. I WOULDN&#x27;T BE WITHOUT IT AND THIS WAS A GOOD BUY.</li>
            <li> saw this product in santa barbara for 300$!!!!lol</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is one of few products I can use that keeps my skin looking young.</li>
            <li> I was on vacation in Miami when a sales person at skin care boutique tried to hard sell me and wanted me to pay exorbitant prices for this skin care line. I decided not to impulse buy. I did some research on my iPhone and discovered that Amazon had much more reasonable prices. Very happy with this product and love that its organic.</li>
            <li> It works for good for me.</li>
            <li> This product is very beneficial for the skin. I use it daily and find it to be very rejuvenating and over time it does seem to tighten and moisturize the face very well.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and packaged well.  This is a great product!  I love what it does for my skin and I&#x27;m sure it will make yours look great too!</li>
            <li> If my skin wasn&#x27;t so oily this would be perfect. But due to my skin type the Elavonne Organic Rejuvenating MSM - 1 oz - Normal to Oily / Acneic works better for me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the skin under your makeup.  Goes on easily and is not at all greasy.  Very smooth.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product in Las Vegas after several nights of no sleep.  The sales rep gave me a demonstration that was out of this world.  She put the eye serum then the cream on one eye and within a minute I could see the difference.  I highly recommendy the eye and face serums/creams!</li>
            <li> This is a must have makes your face feel smooth, firmer and younger!!!! I strongly recommend this product !!!!. :-)</li>
            <li> Speedy shipping and product was great. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use it every day for 3 years already&lt;br /&gt;I recomend it for all types of skins of 40 years and over</li>
            <li> Its a very nice moisturizer  cream, I would certainly recommend it to friends and family.Cheap compared to the ones you find in stalls.</li>
            <li> I have used the moisture cream for about a year. First purchase was in Miracle Mile in Vegas.  then I found it less expensive on the net. If they continue to insist we purchase direct, I will drop the product. It is not worth more than $15.00 or $20 that I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve been using this product for about 6 weeks and my lines are visibly smaller and/or non existent. A good product for the price! More expensive not always means better product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the eyelifting serum from a retailer in Las Vegas for $400.  Way more then I could afford, but the results I got were incredible.  I have been using them for about 8 months.  I love how they make my skin feel and the slight fragrance is wonderful.  I try to only eat and use organic products so to find this organic skincare line at a much more reasonable price is fabulous! Every woman over 40 should have this in there bathroom.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with this product, the serum, mask are the best products I used in this line.. Probably would not buy again</li>
            <li> It seems to be keeping the wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> The cream is great but does not need Volcanic Stone.  Should leave out and reduce price. Will reorder as needed.</li>
            <li> I love it. J&#x27;ai achet√© ce produit pour une premi√®re fois  Las V√©gas √† 4 fois le prix et tr√®s heureuse d,avoir command√© avec Amazon le m√™me produit √† 4 fois mois le prix pay√© √† Las V√©gas. J&#x27;adore ce produit, je l&#x27;utilise r√©guli√®rement et les r√©sultats sont exceptionnels. Pour un meilleur r√©sultats, appliquer le S√©rum et par la site la cr√®me Organics Liftinf Moisture avec Volcanic Stone. Livraison dans emballage original scell√©.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent bargain , it comes with a smooth rock to stimulate cells before application. The cream leaves a silky soft touch to the skin .Will probably order again the eye cream is very good as well .</li>
            <li> This product give s the skin a silky feel. It also provides a needed lift to tired aging skin! This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> First bought this creme for twice the price on Nantucket Island. I was happy to find product on Amazon for 1/2 the price and it&#x27;s the exact same product without any defects. I have very sensitive skin and this creme does not bother me at all. It&#x27;s light and moisturizing without being greasy. Many people comment on my healthy facial skin and it does help make me look younger with a glow. I have tried other facial lotions and they make my face look pale with grey washed out tones. Highly recommend Gratiae as may be more expensive but that little jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> got here early and was exactly as described</li>
            <li> this product does work!  I use it about every 3 days.  After I wash my face, I put this on for about 20 or 30 minutes, let it sit on the under jaw and neck area.  Then I take a warm washcloth and wipe it off.  It does lift the under jawline area.  Works fabulous. I think it&#x27;s good for the neck as well.</li>
            <li> Like many others on here, I bought two products from a lady in Las Vegas for an obscene amount of money.  I just about had a heart attack when I saw that you could buy the same products for HUNDREDS less on amazon.  I phoned the company directly and asked them why the products were so much cheaper on amazon.  They said that these products were defective and not actual products from Gratiae.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I would buy this cream (because I could not afford to buy another product in Vegas) just to see if there was a difference.  The packaging was EXACTLY the same.  The products even smelled the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel stupid I got duped by a crafty sales lady in Las Vegas....who even showed me on the website how &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; of a deal I was getting.  For me, being the great online shopper I am...I should have known better.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I also purchased this product from a little shop in Las Vegas.  Ridiculously expensive, but to be truthful, it was worth it.  I have tried many products over the years because I have sensitive, combination skin.  Nothing really worked very well except Prevage and with that I had to put a moisturizer over it.  But after a while, Prevage started to irritate my skin. So I tried this.  It is the best product I have ever used.  I use the creams in the morning and the serums at night and every once in awhile I use the mask products.  I began getting compliments on my skin within days.  My skin felt soft and smooth.  Makeup started going on more easily.  Everything they sell works.  I just shop around until I find a reasonable price.  Every product goes on easily and smoothly.  It soaks in so there is never any greasy feeling.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the perfect product, or if my skin just got lucky, but I highly recommend everything in their product line, and Amazon seems to have the best prices.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have used this product for several years and would never go back.  I had a problem with the stone being broken and the seller made good on it I am very please. I would use this seller again.</li>
