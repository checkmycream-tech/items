            <li>It lathers pretty well.</li>
            <li>but I have other choices out there for nice coconut</li>
            <li>Of note, the coconut scent is appealing, but not overwhelming, making this a good option overall.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find at a good price.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the product.</li>

            <li> but it left my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not picky about body wash, but this one dried out my skin and made me itch all over.</li>
            <li> Maybe I detect a tiny bit of a coconut smell under the other</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This sort of made my body feel dry which I did not like</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this body wash I have also got mousse and other hair styling products from herbal essences.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this body wash and all other herbal essences products to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I give it 2 stars instead of 1 only because my husband continues to use it without complaint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing less than I had imagined.</li>
            <li> Smell is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> it will not solve all lives problems, just a few!</li>
            <li> Not loving this product.</li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;d like to at least smell it IN the shower...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I just got an email saying they were out of stock. :(</li>
            <li> Too thin and weak, no good suds.</li>
            <li> The scent is not great.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it if you like a subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I was miserable for several days until I realized what was causing the problem.</li>
            <li> smells like bad coconut oil to me.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great smelling!! Like baby powder!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell but it made me a bit nauseated... Won&#x27;t be purchasing again</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like the product. The product really doesn&#x27;t make a lot of soapsuds like other body washes do. I feel like I have to apply a lot of product on my loofah to just get the suds going. The smell is nice; itâ€™s like a sweet smell. This sort of made my body feel dry which I did not like so I had to apply lotion to my body.</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not natural, but it&#x27;s cheap and smells great!</li>
            <li> Not loving this product. It&#x27;s very watery and doesn&#x27;t lather as well as other brands like Olay.  The scent is not great.  Not a fan and would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this , the smell is yummy .. almost makes you feel like it should be edible Lol</li>
            <li> Smells nice, has an interesting &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; when you use it.  good stuff</li>
            <li> Nice scent and hydrating product.</li>
            <li> i am not a fan of this body wash scent. smells like bad coconut oil to me. personal choice.</li>
            <li> Finally! A body wash! Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This body wash was ok. Nothing wrong with it if you like a subtle scent. I would have liked a stronger scent.</li>
            <li> smells good and hydrates my skin! thanks for the awesome product!</li>
            <li> Bought for a promotional price of $1.70 on 9/23/14. No comment on the scent as no one has made any comments about it, but it was really stinking cheap at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li> As I move toward the tender age of 62 my skin on my body is getting drier, and this certainly helps!  I use it with a puff, and you only need a drop!  You skin feels clean and hydrated afterwards!</li>
            <li> lvoed! great deal with coupon!</li>
            <li> Cheaper in walmart other then that i love it</li>
            <li> Its soap. Bought it because it was on sale.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well and keeps my hair hydrated nicely.  The smell is refreshing and reminds me of a breezy beach morning.</li>
            <li> I love body washes and I saw this was a new product so I HAD to try it. What most attracted me was that it said it smelled like coconut. It does not. It smells like.......fruit ? Maybe I detect a tiny bit of a coconut smell under the other smells?  It lathers great and I will use it up but I have other choices out there for nice coconut scents.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Oh-so-fabulous coconut scent.\\&quot;  Uhhh, no.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Enjoy irresistible, long-lasting fragrance.\\&quot;  Sorry.</li>
            <li> Refreshing, smells great&lt;br /&gt;hydrates your skin&lt;br /&gt;you really can&#x27;t go wrong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers up very well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could you ask for in a body wash?&lt;br /&gt;No it will not solve all lives problems, just a few!</li>
            <li> Smells good, makes me smell good.</li>
            <li> love the scent and great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essence conditioner and shampoo for years and I never knew they made body washes in my favorite scents!  I tried this for the first time and I love it! It smells so good and it leaves my skin so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Nice and clean. Love the fresh smell.</li>
            <li> This helps you feel so fresg, the scent also last a long time,  I llove it</li>
            <li> Lovely scented and I love having it delivered right to my door. Great on the skin non drying and rinses away easily</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. It is hard to find at a good price. I bought on subscription so I would never run out. My only complaint is that I just got an email saying they were out of stock. :(</li>
            <li> It does not smell great, but gives you a very clean non irritating feeling after shower</li>
            <li> This Wash is a gel.  I find that I like creamy washes better because they give more lather.  Smell is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> It smells great but it left my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Awesome product at awesome price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not picky about body wash, but this one dried out my skin and made me itch all over. I was miserable for several days until I realized what was causing the problem. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 only because my husband continues to use it without complaint.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this body wash that well.  It seems that I have to use a lot to feel clean.  It&#x27;s different than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Takes a lot of the product to get a lather.</li>
            <li> Too thin and weak, no good suds.</li>
            <li> Terrific product that I might not have tried if it were not for the great price with instant coupon. Smells amazing and great for the kids too. I plan to get more after I go through this bottle.</li>
            <li> I have not received any complaints from my family and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences&#x27; Hello Hydration Body Wash is a great product if you are a fan of coconut scents, which I am.  The product itself is also very effective in terms of lathering and moisturizing.  Of note, the coconut scent is appealing, but not overwhelming, making this a good option overall.  I would definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> Smells and feels like your lathering with shampoo, depending on how you feel about that, depends if you&#x27;ll like it or not.</li>
            <li> Smells great! love Herbal Essence!!!</li>
            <li> like the way it feels hours after you shower.</li>
            <li> I love Herbal essence products but I wasn&#x27;t too thrilled about this one. I didn&#x27;t feel like this keeps my skin hydrated like it states on the bottle. It doesn&#x27;t really suds up either. The only thing I liked was the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love Herbal Essences. I&#x27;ve always used the shampoo and conditioner, but this is the first time that I&#x27;ve tried the body wash.  It&#x27;s nothing less than I had imagined. Herbal Essences always seems to deliver with a wonderful (wonderful smelling too) product!</li>
            <li> Great smell and leaves the skin soft and moist</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this and got a GREAT deal on Subscribe and Save.  Anything coconut is awesome in my book.  I was a bit disappointed.  It lathers well and is non-irritating, but, the fragrance is super weak.  I don&#x27;t even need it to smell good for hours after my shower but, I&#x27;d like to at least smell it IN the shower...and this doesn&#x27;t give me that.  Since I got such a great deal, I&#x27;d purchase it again at the same price but, if you&#x27;re looking for something coconutty, this probably isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> this is a great body wash. Very pleasant scent and not drying on the skin.</li>
            <li> good stuff, coconut makes for a refreshing scent, not overpowering</li>
            <li> Love this body wash, smells fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It smells great!</li>
            <li> This is a larger than normal sized bottle - a great deal.  I have fallen in love with this scent and am so happy I can order it here now.</li>
            <li> Love herbal essence. I&#x27;ve only been a user of their shampoo and conditioner until I got this. Their body wash is just as amazing as their hair products. Since purchasing this body wash I have also got mousse and other hair styling products from herbal essences. I never realized how much of a good brand they were before. The body wash leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed and smelling delicious. They have a huge variety of scents. I would recommend this body wash and all other herbal essences products to friends and family. Product came as described and in proper packaging.</li>
            <li> Nice sense, feels clean. But I can sense the artifical . But since this is not promote as a natural product, that&#x27;s why I gave a 4 stars..</li>
            <li> I purchased this with subscribe and save. This definitely smells like coconut! It smells good, and it lathers up well so you do not need to use a lot!! I like how it makes my skin smell when I&#x27;m done using it. I didn&#x27;t really notice that it left my skin more hydrated than other body washes, that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars. It&#x27;s still an amazing body wash, and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not good on sensitive skin.  &amp;#34;I received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions stated are 100% my own&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It lathers pretty well. I was expecting a fruity herbal essence smell similar to the shampoo but this one has kind of a coconut-like smell. I don&#x27;t really like it. Definitely will not buy again. As far as hydration goes, I don&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin feeling more refreshed compared to other body washes like from olay or old spice. The scent of this body wash isn&#x27;t masculine or feminine.</li>
            <li> the smell is breath taking! And this cleans great !</li>
            <li> Leaves some kind of film on your skin, and leaves it itchy.</li>
