            <li>The idea of wax strips seems great.</li>
            <li>What a great Idea, but doesn&#x27;t always work that great.</li>
            <li>I decided to try these out since I didn&#x27;t feel like making a trip to the salon and let me tell you I was just happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Works great, saves money and also can be cut to suit needs.</li>

            <li>lol)  </li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t even bother with these strips, they are just glorified fly paper.</li>
            <li>Great for removing my girl-stach lol.</li>
            <li>obviously lol)</li>
            <li>This is a great product</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen wax strips for years and they WERE great.  </li>
            <li>Idk why people are bashing this great product.</li>
            <li>The lotion/oil attached is also very handy and just works well.</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>I used many kinds but this is about the best they have to offer.</li>
            <li>What kind of wax strip is that?!</li>
            <li>Good product for use wherever you want, recommend, great price for what you get.  </li>
            <li>TMI, sure, but someone&#x27;s gotta enlighten others  :D  </li>
            <li>If you want an easy way to wax at home, this is a great product!</li>
            <li>Me and my bright ideas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be good</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t ever remember purchasing a product I was as happy with as this.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, I like it.</li>
            <li>This product can be a good product.</li>
            <li>It does a good job.</li>
            <li>And I always had to repeat which isn&#x27;t a good idea as it irritates the skin and wears skin off and creating scabs.</li>
            <li>This product works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>Really good quality.</li>
            <li>and so it stays sort of melted, which means it can&#x27;t get a good grip on the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and so it stays sort of melted, which means it can&#x27;t get a good grip on the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>All in all a good product for home waxing needs.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for eyebrows but will search elsewhere for a good bikini wax.</li>
            <li>this is a good file,,, I recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li>Not as good as a salon job of course, but good in a pinch</li>
            <li>They are perfect for cleaning up and waxing eyebrows yourself at home, and the price is right!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>They worked great for more than a decade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always check to make sure I&#x27;m not waxing off hair that I don&#x27;t want to wax off!</li>
            <li>It works best for me when I run a strip under really hot water, instead of using the warmth of my hands.</li>
            <li>I love the results!</li>
            <li>The strips pull out 2-3 hairs at most!</li>
            <li>This product worked sooo much better!</li>
            <li>and I love them!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>So much more convenient and inexpensive than going to the salon each week!</li>
            <li>Could be better, but helps me to save a lot of money!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>but this was so easy, painless and did a great job.</li>
            <li>So these strips work amazing if you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are amazing.</li>
            <li>I suggest taking a blow dryer and warming up these strips to get the wax nice and gooey before applying and tearing off.</li>
            <li>A fraction of the price and the convienence and privacy of your own home.  </li>
            <li>The wax doesn&#x27;t pull of the hair effectively.  </li>
            <li>I warm it in the microwave for like 6 seconds, apply it, pull, and all my hair comes off.</li>
            <li>The wax does not pick up hair and does not stay warm when rubbed between your hands.</li>
            <li>I like the microwave kind</li>
            <li>Cut to the shape you need, then warm up with your hands, peel apart &amp; rub onto your skin.</li>
            <li>Basically, each layer of plastic retains some of the wax (kind of like peeling apart a peanut butter sandwich)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try to warm up the stripes with my hands though.</li>
            <li>It kind of works.....</li>
            <li>Really handy home kit.</li>
            <li>This product is a good value, but you need to make sure you allow the hair to gro for two to three weeks before using the waxing strips.</li>
            <li>Usually a good product, but this latest batch didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used my hair dryer to warm it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil included is nice for soothing and removing residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used a hair blower to warm them, and they still don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the way my skin felt after the removal of the lovely \\&quot;down\\&quot; that can come with menopause.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These aren&#x27;t the best, but they&#x27;re decent for the price.</li>
            <li>Instructions can be followed easily and results are good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried using it on my brows, and it does not seem to take out the hairs very easily at all, except perhaps the peach fuzz around the brows.  </li>
            <li>and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find a better way to do my own eyebrows.</li>
            <li>it works wonderful as far as im concerned</li>
            <li>This is by far the best inexpensive nail file..</li>
            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked al over for these as this kind works so much better.  </li>
            <li>I have always been satisfied using Sally Hansen Wax Strips (the pre-\\&quot;waxed\\&quot; kind) on my face, legs and bikini area.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that grows there</li>
            <li>Really easy to use!</li>
            <li>i have very fine to nonexistent lips hair and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and to take off!</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s the first thing we think to do because of a successful history of usage, but also look to your own body and</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to trim the strips before you warm them to get a nice smooth edge.</li>
            <li>using the wax, it is very important to wipe the waxed area with the remover afterwards in order to avoid having sticky and irritated skin.</li>
            <li>You are supposed to warm the strips between your hands, peel apart the two plastic sheets (which is fairly easy to do), and then apply to your face.  </li>
            <li>It does the Job, is good to try for first time and get an idea of what it is to use wax to remove hair, is very strong to be a strip...</li>
            <li>Packaging was nice and neat, everything was there, received quickly, and another great deal was the bits fit perfectly in the other files I had to take the file</li>
            <li>make sure you cut away at the bottom too.</li>
            <li>It seems to pull more off that way.</li>
            <li>I always get complimented on my brows :)</li>
            <li>Such a perfect product.  </li>
            <li>The adhesive hasn&#x27;t been able to be removed with face wash or dish soap, either.</li>
            <li>love this product &amp; you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it many times and it doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It takes significantly more hair off that way.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for 7 bucks.</li>
            <li>I think, with practice, it will work better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews complaining that the wax didn&#x27;t come off for days.</li>
            <li>I am trying to review this product on as many websites that I can to warn people of</li>
            <li>(maybe there&#x27;s a better method . . .), but you have to rush to wax your face/bikini/</li>
            <li>She has had much better results with an epilator.</li>
            <li>They remove most of the hair in one go.</li>
            <li>Until recently I thought it was the best I could find until I tried the Veet Wax Strips for face.</li>
            <li>They seem to remove even more hair and haven&#x27;t irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I love these wax strips.</li>
            <li>Great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>However, most of the strips are for eyebrows</li>
            <li>and I just don&#x27;t need that many for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Gets most all the hair.  </li>
            <li>I love pulling my unwanted hair out with these.</li>
            <li>Be sure and read the directions.</li>
            <li>it catches more hairs.</li>
            <li>I love the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Or will I be able to figure it out and be the</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but I know for sure</li>
            <li>it was okay</li>
            <li>and it removed most hairs.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better kits out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great price</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these strips on my eyebrows for several years, and they&#x27;ve always worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love that I don&#x27;t have to heat up wax.</li>
            <li>I love this hair remover wax strips....cleans up areas between visits to the beauty parlor....</li>
            <li>it warms better and faster than in the hand method....</li>
            <li>Use Veet or Parissa; both are much better.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s any consolation, the competition isn&#x27;t doing much better either.</li>
            <li>I found that holding the strip against the light bulb on my vanity warmed it nicely.</li>
            <li>I could probably get better results.</li>
            <li>The wax works MUCH better when it&#x27;s been warmed this way rather than rubbing the strip between your hands.</li>
            <li>Overall, very good product, would recommend!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite way to get rid of unwanted hair at home.</li>
            <li>Much better and easier to use than an at home wax kit.</li>
            <li>Its better if you do it with a proffesional...</li>
            <li>started using this kit more than 10 years ago after an aesthetician at a spa used these on me.</li>
            <li>I tried it twice more just to see if it would get that hair out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 56, and as I said below, I&#x27;ve used hair removers both SHHRWSK for Face/Bikini for many, many years and an epilator - both without one iota of adverse reaction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these strips on my face (chin, upper lip), and it works great!  </li>
            <li>So much more convenient (and money saving) than going to a salon&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am going to try and find another at home waxing kit, which will hopefully work better than this one.</li>
            <li>these worked great for a quick fix when in need, instead of having to bust out the full on kit.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how great it is for other areas, but great for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>- the heat gets the wax nice and melted, which always ensures a clean waxing.</li>
            <li>I even tried to warm up my hands first before trying to warm the wax strip in my hands.</li>
            <li>Directions are easy to understand and usally only have to do one area Once and works great!..</li>
            <li>Quick and easy - not as good as a salon wax, but works great for the time in between visits to tidy up the upper lip and eyebrows!</li>
            <li>This was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>but it did pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>I first look at the strip and see a good deal of hair....</li>
            <li>I have some fine, blonde fuzz on my face and this works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>Instead of rubbing the strips between my hands, I gently warm them with a lighter by quickly passing the lighter under the strip as I hold the strip with tweezers.</li>
            <li>They warm up quickly with the heat of your hands or blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Love these easy to use wax strips.</li>
            <li>This for me is ok for fine hairs...</li>
            <li>This is product is very good for eyebrow and upper lips.</li>
            <li>I had to cut the eyebrow strips to make them thinner to more precisely wax my eyebrows</li>
            <li>I totally recommend these they are super awesome!</li>
            <li>Its great cause there is no mess involved.</li>
            <li>easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>I also like how easy and convenient they are for traveling.</li>
            <li>These plastic strips are so easy to cut &amp; use.</li>
            <li>But, the product worked well and was easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>SO EASY and no chance of burns or even irritation</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a quick fix and will clean them up nicely.</li>
            <li>Overall good product for doing your own eyebrows and lip.</li>
            <li>I turn on my hot water faucet in the bathroom and when the metal spout warms up, I lay the strip I need on the faucet and warm it...</li>
            <li>It did NOTHING to remove fine eyebrow hair.  </li>
            <li>It did not, however, work on the fine hair on my toes.</li>
            <li>fine on my head but not on the face....</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I follow up on the stubborn hairs with tweezers, but this product does most of the work for me, and it leaves my skin super smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li>This is especially important in the hours after waxing because the trauma of waxing exposes your pores to the outside environment and it&#x27;s easy for bacteria to get in.</li>
            <li>gave this product 3 stars because of the easy clean up, and its easy to use (besides the rubbing in between your hands).&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>They do leave a little hair, but hey, nothing&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine, it&#x27;s not as good as a professional wax and sometimes leaves some irritation.</li>
            <li>I cut off all the wax free edges then placed the strip (before separating anything) against my Eyebrow and traced with a pen where my Eyebrow was.</li>
            <li>I use them on my brows and upper lip and they work great.</li>
            <li>There is a finishing oil in the package that feels great and removes the wax residue instantly.  </li>
            <li>Overall, for a at home product, is great.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re smooth and it does stay that way for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>It works great for eyebrows and any facial hair.</li>
            <li>Pain free-</li>
            <li>Just cut the strips to fit the area you are waxing, rub between your hands for about 5-10 seconds, and then apply and remove.</li>
            <li>I smooth it on and try to judge my placement.</li>
            <li>Plus, when you warm them up in your hands, you warm up two at a time, but only use one at a time -</li>
            <li>A good product for facial use for sure.</li>
            <li>The strips are perfect because you can cut them into just the right shape, and because they are clear you can see how much hair they will take out before you decide to rip them off.</li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to use and much more affordable than going to the salon every month or so.</li>
            <li>Nice,was very  useful for my wife .</li>
            <li>I can never find this particular kind again.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and very affordable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Sally Hansen for years and have found that the majority of their products are high quality and effective.</li>
            <li>the bright side, these don&#x27;t irritate my skin (besides the obvious redness) and the wax is easy to get off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They simply rinse off with warm water, no need even for soap!</li>
            <li>I would give the redness more time to fade if I were to try this for the first time.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this because I had a pool party I was hosting</li>
            <li>Works pretty well at removing MOST hairs but you&#x27;ll still need to do some tweezing.</li>
            <li>The container was is better at getting the hair out first rip</li>
            <li>I planned to have this as more of an experiment than a actual routine, but now I am sure to stock up!</li>
            <li>When I discovered these wax strips, I was beyond excited.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a way to make your own sizes or more smaller sizes for eyebrow areas.  </li>
            <li>Clean.</li>
            <li>Ive been waxing my own eyebrows for about 10 years and tried many different products.</li>
            <li>people having problems with the wax sticking to their face make sure you warm the strips enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many waxes and other methods of obliterating my mustache: this is the most convenient and works the best for me, so long as I follow the directions to the letter.</li>
            <li>This was sent to me right on time!</li>
            <li>Also, really easy to heat up; it literally only took like 45 seconds of rubbing at most to get it to the temp it needed to be at!</li>
            <li>Sure beats tweezing every single hair at a time, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li>Play fast and free with the scissors when working with your eyebrows!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did this on a Friday since I didn&#x27;t leave the house the whole weekend.</li>
            <li>Then I let the wax cool on my face, &amp; yank it up.</li>
            <li>good enough, so i don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li>the friction and the warmth of your hands are supposed to be good enough .</li>
            <li>I have tried these strips several times and none of them did it give a good result.</li>
            <li>Although the box says you can use it for more than just your face, it doesn&#x27;t really work anywhere but your face.&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the product formulation had changed was to blame for my current issue: the right side of my face is incredibly itchy and looks like I have about two dozen large mosquito bites.</li>
            <li>: it appears that my hormones have caused my skin to now be sensitive to hair removal of any kind on my face.</li>
            <li>I also cut the shape I like for the top arch and do the same, easy breezy!</li>
            <li>The finishing oil is really nice, and it&#x27;s convenient that, since the wax is already on the strip, there&#x27;s no mess.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face for fine hair and it did the job perfectly without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li>, pull quickly.</li>
            <li>You have to pull them off QUICKLY in one swift movement AGAINST the direction of hair growth and NOT pull them up when you&#x27;re tearing them</li>
            <li>I was worried about buying a waxing product with such a low price, but I was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>the key to the strips also is rubbing them on area a bit more - a bit longer to make sure it adheres to your face....</li>
            <li>I quickly use the finishing oil in hopes of removing the sticky from my eyelid and calming to the burning.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li>Works great for me on the brows and lip - small strips - easy to handle and travel with.</li>
            <li>First, cut the strips with scissors to fit your eyebrows/whatever you want to wax.</li>
            <li>Once you get your technique down these strips works great.</li>
            <li>Works very well and quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I just opened a new kit and was able to remove just 1 hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so happy I won&#x27;t have to take time out of my day to stop by the salon and can spend a lot less with this kit.</li>
            <li>and I thought also worked better than the clear stuff!</li>
            <li>this product does exactly what it promises and does it well when used as described!  </li>
            <li>These remaining hairs are easily pluckable though, so I continue to use this product even though I&#x27;d be very open to suggestions for a better alternative.  </li>
            <li>They are so easy to use and most of the time it only takes one go to get out all the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect for quick touch ups as they are much easier than heating up hard wax, no risk of burns.</li>
            <li>This product seemed like a great buy at first, but even when I followed the directions carefully and pulled off the paper in the correct direction, it ripped off my skin, and not my hair!  </li>
            <li>plan on using it again with extra olive oil handy</li>
            <li>Be sure your skin is oil free and the hair is brushed all in one direction.</li>
            <li>Just a 3-2-1 pull that sucker fast HAH :D</li>
            <li>I thought maybe my hands weren&#x27;t warm enough to warm the wax properly, so I held a strip to my (warmer) torso instead.  </li>
            <li>Works good on upper lip hair, not so much else where.</li>
            <li>I felt comfortable using this because I have used many different Sally Hansen products over the years without any adverse effects.</li>
            <li>I could only stomach that for 1 try, so now that I&#x27;m more comfortable with them</li>
            <li>Bigger pieces can be cut to the size you need BEFORE you warm them.</li>
            <li>But that is rare.  </li>
            <li>No mess, easy use, clean results.</li>
            <li>To avoid this, I make sure to clean off the wax residue and keep my skin clean and dry.</li>
            <li>But when you need a quick and fast fix, this will work.!</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use, all you have to do is warm them in your hands for a few seconds and you are ready.</li>
            <li>This product is good at grabbing every hair, as long as you warm it thoroughly before applying and allow it to cool slightly before pulling.</li>
            <li>It takes the wax right off.</li>
            <li>You have to cut the strips into the right shape and then rub them between your hands to activate the wax.</li>
            <li>Also, it was a bit sticky but the finishing oil included took it right off.</li>
            <li>just right for these to work...</li>
            <li>I can take care of it right away.  </li>
            <li>First of all it was a pain to get the strips warm enough to use (you do it by rubbing the strips .</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use by simply rubbing them between your palms.</li>
            <li>You should actually be able to cut some of the strips to specific shapes for doing eyebrows, for example, and the plastic is see-through so you can mostly avoid pressing against places you don&#x27;t want to (i.e., if you don&#x27;t want to completely remove your eyebrows!).  </li>

            <li>Why Sally WHY??? What happened to that wonderful white chocolate cold wax??? It smells so good I could eat it</li>
            <li>Being a full time college student, I don&#x27;t have much time or money on my hands for the salon.</li>
            <li>It says make the area warm and then says later don&#x27;t take a hot bath first...</li>
            <li>Shipping was kind of long...</li>
            <li>No matter how long I rub to warm them, they do not work.  </li>
            <li>Also removed like 99% of hair off my upper lip (better than the hot wax i get to use at my mom&#x27;s place!)</li>
            <li>works pretty great for the price, very little redness afterwards with the soothing oil</li>
            <li>Works for soft hair but not for strong hairs.</li>
            <li>The wax never gets warm enough to really do the job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge problem, but definitely not the best idea to put them together.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easily concealable if your a touch on the modest side, (as I am).</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and the only side effect I have experienced is occasional redness and of course discomfort at the moment I yank the wax strip off.</li>
            <li>2nd it hurts like Hell fire which would be worth it if it actually worked but 3rd, at most no matter how many times I tried, it rips out at most 20% of the hairs and leaves the rest to laugh at you.</li>
            <li>Really easy to use, convenient, and no mess whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>It also hurts quite a lot for something that doesn&#x27;t remove very much hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for sending it.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I just use a little bit of oil to remove any residual wax and am good to go.</li>
            <li>I think the medium or big will work better.</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t have the money to splurge with or don&#x27;t have time to get to the salon, it is pretty</li>
            <li>I repeated this FOUR MORE TIMES on the same spot in hopes that it would do something</li>
            <li>Took the whole flipping thing off!</li>
            <li>The strips are nice and wide</li>
            <li>(no makeup or moisturizer) and don&#x27;t use them if it&#x27;s a hot day and your face has perspiration</li>
            <li>There are no bumps or stickiness afterwards either thanks to the oil it comes with!</li>
            <li>After a disaster with hot wax, I decided to purchase these.</li>
            <li>I use either alcohol or a hot washcloth.</li>
            <li>They definitely get all the fine/invisible hairs that I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be able to remove.  </li>
            <li>I used it first for my lip.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;d ever bought a waxing kit.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the wax with the separate strips but thought \\&quot;oh how nice!</li>
            <li>The oil also works really well and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling oily like baby oil does!</li>
            <li>I really did like it!</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says it will do...</li>
            <li>After scrubbing my face with soap &amp; hot water, then cleanser (yes, even cleanser), then finally rubbing alcohol and more hot water and soap</li>
            <li>First time using them &amp; waxing ...</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>But I plan to buy another product next time that will get the job done more efficiently and won&#x27;t cause so much irritation.</li>
            <li>so I have tried everything from nightly tweezing to the roll on hot wax, (what a mess that was)and to be honest</li>
            <li>This is MUCH easier to use than wax and much cleaner too!</li>
            <li>Luckily, my reaction was nearly immediate, but often an allergic reaction can take hours to appear.  </li>
            <li>Not one single hair was lifted, so I read reviews on the Bliss wax strips, and someone said she had better luck after using her hair dryer to heat them.</li>
            <li>hope eyebrow hair grows back quickly, thank goodness for eyebrow pencils!</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s easier to do eyebrows with a pot of wax then with these little strips, these are great for larger areas.</li>
            <li>I applied the wax strip to my chin, yank, and...not much.</li>
            <li>Yank and...not much.</li>
            <li>These work really well for the price.</li>
            <li>Smooth on in the direction the hair is growing (and this should be the way you have brushed it).  </li>
            <li>I really do like these wax strips, once I tried them nothing else compares to the ease of use.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really remove that much hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get to master the art</li>
            <li>These strips work very well.  </li>
            <li>Of course it hurt a bit, but these strips use real wax so its not going to be pain-free</li>
            <li>but since that was not the point of this whole trial, I would have to recommend others to AVOID this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using these for years and find them very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>- 23 female, light complexion.</li>
            <li>Broke me out where I applied the strips on my face like really and didnt even really take hair off .</li>
            <li>But I decided to try the strips that are ready for use.</li>
            <li>worked very well.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very affordable.  </li>
            <li>BUT, the strips are VERY sticky, so handle with care.  </li>
            <li>but i dont have that much hair to deal with.  </li>
            <li>I have been using wax (the one I have to heat up) for a while now and thought maybe the strips would be very convenient.</li>
            <li>Well, the idea is great but the execution is poor.</li>
            <li>I tried fast motions for peeling the strips off and I tried slower motions.  </li>
            <li>The wax doesn&#x27;t adhere to the plastic very well, so it stays on your face instead of staying on the plastic and taking your hairs with it.  </li>
            <li>The wax doesn&#x27;t adhere to the plastic very well, so it stays on your face instead of staying on the plastic and taking your hairs with it.  </li>
            <li>Absolute garbage ...</li>
            <li>It is a much cheaper option, of course, than going to the salon.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t remove hair very well.</li>
            <li>to use&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is fast and not-messy&lt;br /&gt;Double</li>
            <li>I regret so much that i buy the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, but not really &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>next time i&#x27;ll cut the strip in 1/2 lengthwise for a better fit as it was too wide...</li>
            <li>Absolutely does not do the job.</li>
            <li>Fast.</li>
            <li>Rub them to get the wax adhered really well and pull.  </li>
            <li>Pull fast, don&#x27;t hesitate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient that there are two strips stuck together, so you can get symmetry when waxing your face.</li>
            <li>but hey, it&#x27;s a ready made wax strip, of course it will hurt..</li>
            <li>Simpley warm the wax by rubbing it between hands, cut the ready to use double sided wax, paste it on where you want the hair gone and rip it off the opposite direction of hair growth, use provided oil to remove the wax</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s basically smelly water that doesn&#x27;t help at all, I was still very sticky.</li>
            <li>It was delivered fast</li>
            <li>but I have never felt this much pain before when waxing.</li>
            <li>TO MUCH HAIR.</li>
            <li>Did not work very well</li>
            <li>They go much farther if you cut them.</li>
            <li>The instructions say the wax will be warm enough to use after simply rubbing them between your hands - ha!</li>
            <li>You have to use at least three strips to get off a good amount of hair.</li>
            <li>OMG I just used these for the first time, and wow these work very well!</li>
            <li>Simply rubbing the strips between your hands does not get the wax warm enough.</li>
            <li>My biggest tip for using this product is to blast the strip with your blow-drier for a few seconds to get it really warm</li>
            <li>Once the wax is warmed up, you&#x27;re placing it on your skin, which is also warm; it can&#x27;t cool back down</li>
            <li>Once the wax is warmed up, you&#x27;re placing it on your skin, which is also warm; it can&#x27;t cool back down</li>
            <li>I waxed my upper lip and it was so easy and mess free!  </li>
            <li>I like this at home waxing brand better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>Works better than all other products that I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>Is effective on quite short hair and you really don&#x27;t want to grow your hair long on your face before you can pull it.</li>
            <li>Other Sally Hansen products have better results than this one.</li>
            <li>At first I was impressed that removing the strip wasn&#x27;t as painful as I had anticipated.  </li>
            <li>I smooth and smooth with my finger to be sure all the hair is coated, then hold your skin tight with one hand and quickly rip back in the opposite direction the hair grew, holding the strip as close to your skin as possible</li>
            <li>Only problem I&#x27;ve had is that, occasionally, it doesn&#x27;t work on very fine hair(s) on my chin.  </li>
            <li>But its so simple and easy and I think it looks salon professional.</li>
            <li>It was less intense than the epilator and seemed to grab much more hair.  </li>
            <li>really wish Sally  Hansen would go back to the more traditional</li>
            <li>I trim the strips to small rectangles, warm, apply, and pull off.</li>
            <li>wax strip is double sided, true.</li>
            <li>: I use an old hair straightener (use an old one that you never use, you&#x27;re most likely going to get wax on it!), put it on its lowest setting, and use that to heat the wax.</li>
            <li>I was initially excited to see the new design with the white paper framing the waxy portion of strip.  </li>
            <li>May need more wax per strips to use less.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, does what I expected.</li>
            <li>Just used these tonight and the MAIN THING I can recommend is not to follow their sizes.</li>
            <li>I always end up going back to these for quick, at-home jobs.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand any of the negative comments on here but to each their own.</li>
            <li>it probably will not work well for you and cause you mild to moderate annoyance trying.  </li>
            <li>When I shave, the hair grows back so quickly that I have stubble by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Typically, I am able to get enough weekly uses out of the box to last me 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see on the strips that the hairs are being pulled out by the roots, but I think the next crop of hair then comes in -- so I do have to use it much more often than every 8 weeks to keep my upper lip under control.</li>
            <li>so it sticks more on the hair, instead, the wax sticks on your skin making everything a mess while the hair won&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s very easy to use and very little (if any) wax residue.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist said this is due to the wax strips taking off the top layer of my skin over and over, until there was damage and the skin is excessively sensitive to sun.  </li>
            <li>Tweezing may hurt a little more, but over time you get used to it.</li>
            <li>Removes most unwanted hair off my face with little effort.</li>
            <li>I was really shocked at how perfectly it worked.</li>
            <li>I have tried aloe, gentle face lotion for sensitive skin, and neosporin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for someone who is blond or naturally doesn&#x27;t have much body hair at all because that seems to be all it can handle.</li>
            <li>I pretty much have the same amount of hair that I had before using it.</li>
            <li>I had okay results with Nads in the green jar and thought this would work.</li>
            <li>The first time my skin got really irritated/dry but the second time I used it</li>
            <li>I prefer other strips I&#x27;ve used which were not so sticky but seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li>in other words if you need it for fine hairs on your face</li>
            <li>I used this product several times on my eyebrows, but it took a lot of time and practice to get it working right.</li>
            <li>so I thought surely it would be ripped out like all the barely there hairs on the other side.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to have completely clean and dry skin and to warm the strips very well, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine facial hair and the wax gets every last hair!</li>
            <li>I keep trying their other products because they&#x27;re so widely available</li>
            <li>These strips are my new go to now.</li>
            <li>BUT THE NEW STRIPS DO NOT WORK.  </li>
            <li>that might be the difference in the comments between dark, dense hair and fine almost not there hair.  </li>
            <li>Sally Hansen USED to make the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used(their white chocolate cold wax).  </li>
            <li>It takes several tries for the strip to pull out the hair, and each go-round irritates my skin a bit more.</li>
            <li>They work great on facial hair, I have tried it on my bikini area as well with poor results.</li>
            <li>i tried these strips more than once, and on different body areas, to make sure i wasn&#x27;t just doing it wrong.</li>
            <li>and WOW does it ever!</li>
            <li>, I was surprised!  </li>
            <li>I bought this for the first time last night at the store.</li>
            <li>They usually get most of the hair, but I have no problem tweezing 1-3 stray hairs it missed.</li>
            <li>And first two days treated areas were very red and burning.</li>
            <li>and I seem to get it wrong more times than right!</li>
            <li>When I ended up with a face full of wax, I read the directions a second time and ended up with wax coating my face a second time.  </li>
            <li>until the next morning when I woke up to my entire face full of bumps.</li>
            <li>I tried alcohol to clean the area first but by the time I would get the strip ready a small layer of perspiration would come back</li>
            <li>It was huge sticky itchy mess.</li>
            <li>a mess free solution\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, the oil in the little bottle that comes with the wax strips was actually pretty good at removing all the wax left behind by the strips.  </li>
            <li>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, the oil in the little bottle that comes with the wax strips was actually pretty good at removing all the wax left behind by the strips.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re strong enough to get lots of hair and the blue oil will get off any residue left.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Wax Strips have removed most of the hair when used on my face, but occasionally it takes a little bit of skin with it.</li>
            <li>Followed the instructions, and while the strips do remove the fine (near invisible) hairs on my eyebrows, they do not remove the thick ones which is the whole point of waxing your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>The strips are held between two clear layers of plastic (one layer has a Sally Hansen logo on it).  </li>
            <li>The warnings do not appear clearly on the box or instructions booklet, they come after the instructions.</li>
            <li>These strips are a great IDEA, but there are not enough of them to do the job (even reapplying until it won&#x27;t stick anymore) and the residue left behind is a pain.  </li>
            <li>But the instructions CLEARLY states, not to repeat waxing the same area within a 24 hr period, but like some of you I felt \\&quot;a few more times won&#x27;t hurt\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have used 4 of the strips so far.</li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised.</li>
            <li>I prefer this to the container of wax as it is not messy.</li>
            <li>I had been getting Brazillians professionally done over the summer</li>
            <li>:  Doesn&#x27;t actually remove much hair.  </li>
            <li>Works really well on facial hair, but not on body hair.</li>
            <li>Complete failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been getting professional waxes for years and decided to save some money and wax my lip at home.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the glowing reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>and I will now go and shave the old fashioned way...</li>
            <li>I even went as far as trying once again and, as anticipated, the hairs would not budge.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin to begin with but something in this strip is unlike anything I have come across.</li>
            <li>It worked very well for me except for the tiny hair.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for bikini use, doesn&#x27;t get almost any hair, for face only really.</li>
            <li>its been nearly 20 mins since I used the strips</li>
            <li>The hair that grows in is soft, not stubbly feeling.</li>
            <li>My routine is to take a shower and then do the waxing since my face and hands are completely oil-free after the shower.</li>
            <li>I think from now on I will stick to my razor or going to see a professional.</li>
            <li>For some reason Sally Hansen has changed this product to one that you rub together but doesn&#x27;t have near the sticky power as these.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my eyebrows and sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>It takes me a minute or so to be sure I have it in the proper placement and then with a firm pull, against the grain, I visously rip out my eyebrow.</li>
            <li>If you go slowly, you&#x27;ll just leave more wax on your skin and not remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>next to professional Laser hair removal or Pro hair waxing I would definately recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>Only thing is, your skin must be clean and dry!</li>
            <li>The latter work fine for waxing the legs as long as the hairs are long enough, but these Sally Hansen strips absolutely do not work on the body (they make some for the body that are just like these, only bigger), and are just OK for the much finer hair on the face.  </li>
            <li>No mess.  </li>
            <li>However, if you have had success with similar products in the past, this one might be worth trying.overall.  </li>
            <li>However, if you have had success with similar products in the past, this one might be worth trying.</li>
            <li>After cutting the shape, warm up the strips with a hair dryer and quickly pull strips apart, put on the area of the eyebrow to be waxed, wait about 30 second, and pull.</li>
            <li>Plus, none of the strips are small enough to wax under eyebrows without taking off more brow than you intended.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the small strips for the lip area and the results are salon worthy.</li>
            <li>In other words, don&#x27;t go jogging or cake on make-up right after you wax.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for occasion use in waxing your eyebrows or upper lip (don&#x27;t wax my bikini area).</li>
            <li>Wish they would go back to the green color; easy to see placement on skin</li>
            <li>I read the instructions carefully and applied the strips even more carefully, but I still ended up with no hair removed and blotchy, red, sticky skin.</li>
            <li>So I usually cut them in half length wise which makes double for</li>
            <li>The tape or whatever the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; (more like glue) is stuck to is very flimsy and difficult to handle without getting it stuck to your hands, countertop, floor, etc.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my eyebrows, which i have very little of, but wanted to clean up underneath the brow...</li>
            <li>These hurt a lot (even for waxing), didn&#x27;t get most of the hair (just a few random patches) and were not that easy to use.</li>
            <li>They come in several different sizes and you may have to cut them down or in the shape you want, but that&#x27;s easy enough to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these on facial hair and they work amazingly, the oil that comes with the kit removes any wax left behind.</li>
            <li>There is barely any stick to the hair.</li>
            <li>I have gotten professionally waxed multiple times, but couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of paying close to $60 to do my lower legs.  </li>
            <li>it works very well but be careful...</li>
            <li>and it is still red as fire and so sensitive.</li>
            <li>Tried waxing eyebrows and it barely took anything off and it leaves the wax on your face.</li>
            <li>which again was barely any)</li>
            <li>It ripped out all the barely there</li>
            <li>I did exactly as the kit said and washed and dried my face completely.</li>
            <li>What a colossal waste of $7.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>a loose and bend or squeeze the bit holder to make a tight fit</li>
            <li>I should have tried on hidden area first.</li>
            <li>Now I have been waxed before and I am aware that there is slight pain involved</li>
            <li>It will not typically remove 100% of the hair, but it works well enough for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought dozens of boxes for legs over the past 20 years and occasionally the strips for FaceBrowsBikini and was never disappointed with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend that you save your money and use your tweezers because then you have more control and won&#x27;t pluck out little invisible baby hairs that you can&#x27;t even see but will grow back dark because waxing will do that.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really remove hair after any other yank.</li>
            <li>I get the exact hair removal that I am looking for without all the mess and hassle of wax and strips.  </li>
            <li>Other then that it works really well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no fun trying to scrub hot wax off your face...and then dealing with everyone seeing you red, blotchy, and still have the hair it was supposed to remove.</li>
            <li>honestly embarrassed for everyone involved in the production and marketing of these useless pieces of actual garbage</li>
            <li>I had little faith in this product when I bought it but was willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as painful as others, and the finishing oil is amazing!</li>
            <li>It will hurt the first few times, but after a while I forget that it even hurts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product much more than a few times over the past 20 years without a hitch.</li>
            <li>I usually get a little red post wax that lasts for maybe 10 minutes and usually have great results that last a long time.</li>
            <li>For me, this wasn&#x27;t worth the money, as it hardly did the job.</li>
            <li>So its hard to be consistent and not stop for a break, and once you finally do stop it barely takes off my hair.</li>
            <li>I usually cut them down to size, place them on my skin, rub them in the direction of hair growth to warm them up a little, and tear them off.</li>
            <li>These have a clear wax of a &amp;#34;filmy&amp;#34; consistency, rather than a green soft wax I&#x27;ve seen on my Nair and Nad&#x27;s strips.  </li>

            <li> Great precision.  </li>
            <li> sticks to both sides of the plastic, so you don&#x27;t get a great seal onto the skin.  </li>
            <li> Works great for when I&#x27;m in a pinch inbetween waxing appointments.</li>

            <li> Idk why people are bashing this great product.</li>

            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> I used many kinds but this is about the best they have to offer.</li>
            <li> What kind of wax strip is that?!</li>
            <li> Good product for use wherever you want, recommend, great price for what you get.  </li>
            <li> TMI, sure, but someone&#x27;s gotta enlighten others  :D  </li>
            <li> If you want an easy way to wax at home, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Me and my bright ideas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be good</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t ever remember purchasing a product I was as happy with as this.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, I like it.</li>
            <li> This product can be a good product.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> And I always had to repeat which isn&#x27;t a good idea as it irritates the skin and wears skin off and creating scabs.</li>
            <li> This product works fairly well.  </li>
            <li> Really good quality.</li>
            <li> and so it stays sort of melted, which means it can&#x27;t get a good grip on the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so it stays sort of melted, which means it can&#x27;t get a good grip on the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> All in all a good product for home waxing needs.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for eyebrows but will search elsewhere for a good bikini wax.</li>
            <li> this is a good file,,, I recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> Not as good as a salon job of course, but good in a pinch</li>
            <li> They are perfect for cleaning up and waxing eyebrows yourself at home, and the price is right!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> They worked great for more than a decade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always check to make sure I&#x27;m not waxing off hair that I don&#x27;t want to wax off!</li>
            <li> It works best for me when I run a strip under really hot water, instead of using the warmth of my hands.</li>
            <li> I love the results!</li>
            <li> The strips pull out 2-3 hairs at most!</li>
            <li> This product worked sooo much better!</li>
            <li> and I love them!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> So much more convenient and inexpensive than going to the salon each week!</li>
            <li> Could be better, but helps me to save a lot of money!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> but this was so easy, painless and did a great job.</li>
            <li> So these strips work amazing if you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are amazing.</li>
            <li> I suggest taking a blow dryer and warming up these strips to get the wax nice and gooey before applying and tearing off.</li>
            <li> A fraction of the price and the convienence and privacy of your own home.  </li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t pull of the hair effectively.  </li>
            <li> I warm it in the microwave for like 6 seconds, apply it, pull, and all my hair comes off.</li>
            <li> The wax does not pick up hair and does not stay warm when rubbed between your hands.</li>
            <li> I like the microwave kind</li>
            <li> Cut to the shape you need, then warm up with your hands, peel apart &amp; rub onto your skin.</li>
            <li> Basically, each layer of plastic retains some of the wax (kind of like peeling apart a peanut butter sandwich)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try to warm up the stripes with my hands though.</li>
            <li> It kind of works.....</li>
            <li> Really handy home kit.</li>
            <li> This product is a good value, but you need to make sure you allow the hair to gro for two to three weeks before using the waxing strips.</li>
            <li> Usually a good product, but this latest batch didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used my hair dryer to warm it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil included is nice for soothing and removing residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used a hair blower to warm them, and they still don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the way my skin felt after the removal of the lovely \\&quot;down\\&quot; that can come with menopause.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These aren&#x27;t the best, but they&#x27;re decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Instructions can be followed easily and results are good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried using it on my brows, and it does not seem to take out the hairs very easily at all, except perhaps the peach fuzz around the brows.  </li>
            <li> and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a better way to do my own eyebrows.</li>
            <li> it works wonderful as far as im concerned</li>
            <li> This is by far the best inexpensive nail file..</li>
            <li> This is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked al over for these as this kind works so much better.  </li>
            <li> I have always been satisfied using Sally Hansen Wax Strips (the pre-\\&quot;waxed\\&quot; kind) on my face, legs and bikini area.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that grows there</li>
            <li> Really easy to use!</li>
            <li> i have very fine to nonexistent lips hair and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and to take off!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s the first thing we think to do because of a successful history of usage, but also look to your own body and</li>
            <li> Also, be sure to trim the strips before you warm them to get a nice smooth edge.</li>
            <li> using the wax, it is very important to wipe the waxed area with the remover afterwards in order to avoid having sticky and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to warm the strips between your hands, peel apart the two plastic sheets (which is fairly easy to do), and then apply to your face.  </li>
            <li> It does the Job, is good to try for first time and get an idea of what it is to use wax to remove hair, is very strong to be a strip...</li>
            <li> Packaging was nice and neat, everything was there, received quickly, and another great deal was the bits fit perfectly in the other files I had to take the file</li>
            <li> make sure you cut away at the bottom too.</li>
            <li> It seems to pull more off that way.</li>
            <li> I always get complimented on my brows :)</li>
            <li> Such a perfect product.  </li>
            <li> The adhesive hasn&#x27;t been able to be removed with face wash or dish soap, either.</li>
            <li> love this product &amp; you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it many times and it doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It takes significantly more hair off that way.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for 7 bucks.</li>
            <li> I think, with practice, it will work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews complaining that the wax didn&#x27;t come off for days.</li>
            <li> I am trying to review this product on as many websites that I can to warn people of</li>
            <li> (maybe there&#x27;s a better method . . .), but you have to rush to wax your face/bikini/</li>
            <li> She has had much better results with an epilator.</li>
            <li> They remove most of the hair in one go.</li>
            <li> Until recently I thought it was the best I could find until I tried the Veet Wax Strips for face.</li>
            <li> They seem to remove even more hair and haven&#x27;t irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I love these wax strips.</li>
            <li> Great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> However, most of the strips are for eyebrows</li>
            <li> and I just don&#x27;t need that many for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Gets most all the hair.  </li>
            <li> I love pulling my unwanted hair out with these.</li>
            <li> Be sure and read the directions.</li>
            <li> it catches more hairs.</li>
            <li> I love the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Or will I be able to figure it out and be the</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but I know for sure</li>
            <li> it was okay</li>
            <li> and it removed most hairs.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better kits out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great price</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> :)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips on my eyebrows for several years, and they&#x27;ve always worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love that I don&#x27;t have to heat up wax.</li>
            <li> I love this hair remover wax strips....cleans up areas between visits to the beauty parlor....</li>
            <li> it warms better and faster than in the hand method....</li>
            <li> Use Veet or Parissa; both are much better.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s any consolation, the competition isn&#x27;t doing much better either.</li>
            <li> I found that holding the strip against the light bulb on my vanity warmed it nicely.</li>
            <li> I could probably get better results.</li>
            <li> The wax works MUCH better when it&#x27;s been warmed this way rather than rubbing the strip between your hands.</li>
            <li> Overall, very good product, would recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite way to get rid of unwanted hair at home.</li>
            <li> Much better and easier to use than an at home wax kit.</li>
            <li> Its better if you do it with a proffesional...</li>
            <li> started using this kit more than 10 years ago after an aesthetician at a spa used these on me.</li>
            <li> I tried it twice more just to see if it would get that hair out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56, and as I said below, I&#x27;ve used hair removers both SHHRWSK for Face/Bikini for many, many years and an epilator - both without one iota of adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips on my face (chin, upper lip), and it works great!  </li>
            <li> So much more convenient (and money saving) than going to a salon&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am going to try and find another at home waxing kit, which will hopefully work better than this one.</li>
            <li> these worked great for a quick fix when in need, instead of having to bust out the full on kit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how great it is for other areas, but great for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> - the heat gets the wax nice and melted, which always ensures a clean waxing.</li>
            <li> I even tried to warm up my hands first before trying to warm the wax strip in my hands.</li>
            <li> Directions are easy to understand and usally only have to do one area Once and works great!..</li>
            <li> Quick and easy - not as good as a salon wax, but works great for the time in between visits to tidy up the upper lip and eyebrows!</li>
            <li> This was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> but it did pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I first look at the strip and see a good deal of hair....</li>
            <li> I have some fine, blonde fuzz on my face and this works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> Instead of rubbing the strips between my hands, I gently warm them with a lighter by quickly passing the lighter under the strip as I hold the strip with tweezers.</li>
            <li> They warm up quickly with the heat of your hands or blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Love these easy to use wax strips.</li>
            <li> This for me is ok for fine hairs...</li>
            <li> This is product is very good for eyebrow and upper lips.</li>
            <li> I had to cut the eyebrow strips to make them thinner to more precisely wax my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I totally recommend these they are super awesome!</li>
            <li> Its great cause there is no mess involved.</li>
            <li> easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> I also like how easy and convenient they are for traveling.</li>
            <li> These plastic strips are so easy to cut &amp; use.</li>
            <li> But, the product worked well and was easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> SO EASY and no chance of burns or even irritation</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a quick fix and will clean them up nicely.</li>
            <li> Overall good product for doing your own eyebrows and lip.</li>
            <li> I turn on my hot water faucet in the bathroom and when the metal spout warms up, I lay the strip I need on the faucet and warm it...</li>
            <li> It did NOTHING to remove fine eyebrow hair.  </li>
            <li> It did not, however, work on the fine hair on my toes.</li>
            <li> fine on my head but not on the face....</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I follow up on the stubborn hairs with tweezers, but this product does most of the work for me, and it leaves my skin super smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply easy to clean up.  </li>
            <li> This is especially important in the hours after waxing because the trauma of waxing exposes your pores to the outside environment and it&#x27;s easy for bacteria to get in.</li>
            <li> gave this product 3 stars because of the easy clean up, and its easy to use (besides the rubbing in between your hands).&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> They do leave a little hair, but hey, nothing&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, it&#x27;s not as good as a professional wax and sometimes leaves some irritation.</li>
            <li> I cut off all the wax free edges then placed the strip (before separating anything) against my Eyebrow and traced with a pen where my Eyebrow was.</li>
            <li> I use them on my brows and upper lip and they work great.</li>
            <li> There is a finishing oil in the package that feels great and removes the wax residue instantly.  </li>
            <li> Overall, for a at home product, is great.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re smooth and it does stay that way for quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> It works great for eyebrows and any facial hair.</li>
            <li> Pain free-</li>
            <li> Just cut the strips to fit the area you are waxing, rub between your hands for about 5-10 seconds, and then apply and remove.</li>
            <li> I smooth it on and try to judge my placement.</li>
            <li> Plus, when you warm them up in your hands, you warm up two at a time, but only use one at a time -</li>
            <li> A good product for facial use for sure.</li>
            <li> The strips are perfect because you can cut them into just the right shape, and because they are clear you can see how much hair they will take out before you decide to rip them off.</li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to use and much more affordable than going to the salon every month or so.</li>
            <li> Nice,was very  useful for my wife .</li>
            <li> I can never find this particular kind again.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Sally Hansen for years and have found that the majority of their products are high quality and effective.</li>
            <li> the bright side, these don&#x27;t irritate my skin (besides the obvious redness) and the wax is easy to get off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They simply rinse off with warm water, no need even for soap!</li>
            <li> I would give the redness more time to fade if I were to try this for the first time.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this because I had a pool party I was hosting</li>
            <li> Works pretty well at removing MOST hairs but you&#x27;ll still need to do some tweezing.</li>
            <li> The container was is better at getting the hair out first rip</li>
            <li> I planned to have this as more of an experiment than a actual routine, but now I am sure to stock up!</li>
            <li> When I discovered these wax strips, I was beyond excited.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a way to make your own sizes or more smaller sizes for eyebrow areas.  </li>
            <li> Clean.</li>
            <li> Ive been waxing my own eyebrows for about 10 years and tried many different products.</li>
            <li> people having problems with the wax sticking to their face make sure you warm the strips enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many waxes and other methods of obliterating my mustache: this is the most convenient and works the best for me, so long as I follow the directions to the letter.</li>
            <li> This was sent to me right on time!</li>
            <li> Also, really easy to heat up; it literally only took like 45 seconds of rubbing at most to get it to the temp it needed to be at!</li>
            <li> Sure beats tweezing every single hair at a time, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> Play fast and free with the scissors when working with your eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I did this on a Friday since I didn&#x27;t leave the house the whole weekend.</li>
            <li> Then I let the wax cool on my face, &amp; yank it up.</li>
            <li> good enough, so i don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> the friction and the warmth of your hands are supposed to be good enough .</li>
            <li> I have tried these strips several times and none of them did it give a good result.</li>
            <li> Although the box says you can use it for more than just your face, it doesn&#x27;t really work anywhere but your face.&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the product formulation had changed was to blame for my current issue: the right side of my face is incredibly itchy and looks like I have about two dozen large mosquito bites.</li>
            <li> : it appears that my hormones have caused my skin to now be sensitive to hair removal of any kind on my face.</li>
            <li> I also cut the shape I like for the top arch and do the same, easy breezy!</li>
            <li> The finishing oil is really nice, and it&#x27;s convenient that, since the wax is already on the strip, there&#x27;s no mess.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face for fine hair and it did the job perfectly without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> , pull quickly.</li>
            <li> You have to pull them off QUICKLY in one swift movement AGAINST the direction of hair growth and NOT pull them up when you&#x27;re tearing them</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying a waxing product with such a low price, but I was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> the key to the strips also is rubbing them on area a bit more - a bit longer to make sure it adheres to your face....</li>
            <li> I quickly use the finishing oil in hopes of removing the sticky from my eyelid and calming to the burning.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li> Works great for me on the brows and lip - small strips - easy to handle and travel with.</li>
            <li> First, cut the strips with scissors to fit your eyebrows/whatever you want to wax.</li>
            <li> Once you get your technique down these strips works great.</li>
            <li> Works very well and quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I just opened a new kit and was able to remove just 1 hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so happy I won&#x27;t have to take time out of my day to stop by the salon and can spend a lot less with this kit.</li>
            <li> and I thought also worked better than the clear stuff!</li>
            <li> this product does exactly what it promises and does it well when used as described!  </li>
            <li> These remaining hairs are easily pluckable though, so I continue to use this product even though I&#x27;d be very open to suggestions for a better alternative.  </li>
            <li> They are so easy to use and most of the time it only takes one go to get out all the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for quick touch ups as they are much easier than heating up hard wax, no risk of burns.</li>
            <li> This product seemed like a great buy at first, but even when I followed the directions carefully and pulled off the paper in the correct direction, it ripped off my skin, and not my hair!  </li>
            <li> plan on using it again with extra olive oil handy</li>
            <li> Be sure your skin is oil free and the hair is brushed all in one direction.</li>
            <li> Just a 3-2-1 pull that sucker fast HAH :D</li>
            <li> I thought maybe my hands weren&#x27;t warm enough to warm the wax properly, so I held a strip to my (warmer) torso instead.  </li>
            <li> Works good on upper lip hair, not so much else where.</li>
            <li> I felt comfortable using this because I have used many different Sally Hansen products over the years without any adverse effects.</li>
            <li> I could only stomach that for 1 try, so now that I&#x27;m more comfortable with them</li>
            <li> Bigger pieces can be cut to the size you need BEFORE you warm them.</li>
            <li> But that is rare.  </li>
            <li> No mess, easy use, clean results.</li>
            <li> To avoid this, I make sure to clean off the wax residue and keep my skin clean and dry.</li>
            <li> But when you need a quick and fast fix, this will work.!</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use, all you have to do is warm them in your hands for a few seconds and you are ready.</li>
            <li> This product is good at grabbing every hair, as long as you warm it thoroughly before applying and allow it to cool slightly before pulling.</li>
            <li> It takes the wax right off.</li>
            <li> You have to cut the strips into the right shape and then rub them between your hands to activate the wax.</li>
            <li> Also, it was a bit sticky but the finishing oil included took it right off.</li>
            <li> just right for these to work...</li>
            <li> I can take care of it right away.  </li>
            <li> First of all it was a pain to get the strips warm enough to use (you do it by rubbing the strips .</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use by simply rubbing them between your palms.</li>
            <li> You should actually be able to cut some of the strips to specific shapes for doing eyebrows, for example, and the plastic is see-through so you can mostly avoid pressing against places you don&#x27;t want to (i.e., if you don&#x27;t want to completely remove your eyebrows!).  </li>

            <li> Why Sally WHY??? What happened to that wonderful white chocolate cold wax??? It smells so good I could eat it</li>
            <li> Being a full time college student, I don&#x27;t have much time or money on my hands for the salon.</li>
            <li> It says make the area warm and then says later don&#x27;t take a hot bath first...</li>
            <li> Shipping was kind of long...</li>
            <li> No matter how long I rub to warm them, they do not work.  </li>
            <li> Also removed like 99% of hair off my upper lip (better than the hot wax i get to use at my mom&#x27;s place!)</li>
            <li> works pretty great for the price, very little redness afterwards with the soothing oil</li>
            <li> Works for soft hair but not for strong hairs.</li>
            <li> The wax never gets warm enough to really do the job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge problem, but definitely not the best idea to put them together.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easily concealable if your a touch on the modest side, (as I am).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and the only side effect I have experienced is occasional redness and of course discomfort at the moment I yank the wax strip off.</li>
            <li> 2nd it hurts like Hell fire which would be worth it if it actually worked but 3rd, at most no matter how many times I tried, it rips out at most 20% of the hairs and leaves the rest to laugh at you.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use, convenient, and no mess whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> It also hurts quite a lot for something that doesn&#x27;t remove very much hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for sending it.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I just use a little bit of oil to remove any residual wax and am good to go.</li>
            <li> I think the medium or big will work better.</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t have the money to splurge with or don&#x27;t have time to get to the salon, it is pretty</li>
            <li> I repeated this FOUR MORE TIMES on the same spot in hopes that it would do something</li>
            <li> Took the whole flipping thing off!</li>
            <li> The strips are nice and wide</li>
            <li> (no makeup or moisturizer) and don&#x27;t use them if it&#x27;s a hot day and your face has perspiration</li>
            <li> There are no bumps or stickiness afterwards either thanks to the oil it comes with!</li>
            <li> After a disaster with hot wax, I decided to purchase these.</li>
            <li> I use either alcohol or a hot washcloth.</li>
            <li> They definitely get all the fine/invisible hairs that I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be able to remove.  </li>
            <li> I used it first for my lip.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d ever bought a waxing kit.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the wax with the separate strips but thought \\&quot;oh how nice!</li>
            <li> The oil also works really well and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling oily like baby oil does!</li>
            <li> I really did like it!</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says it will do...</li>
            <li> After scrubbing my face with soap &amp; hot water, then cleanser (yes, even cleanser), then finally rubbing alcohol and more hot water and soap</li>
            <li> First time using them &amp; waxing ...</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product for the first time.</li>
            <li> But I plan to buy another product next time that will get the job done more efficiently and won&#x27;t cause so much irritation.</li>
            <li> so I have tried everything from nightly tweezing to the roll on hot wax, (what a mess that was)and to be honest</li>
            <li> This is MUCH easier to use than wax and much cleaner too!</li>
            <li> Luckily, my reaction was nearly immediate, but often an allergic reaction can take hours to appear.  </li>
            <li> Not one single hair was lifted, so I read reviews on the Bliss wax strips, and someone said she had better luck after using her hair dryer to heat them.</li>
            <li> hope eyebrow hair grows back quickly, thank goodness for eyebrow pencils!</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s easier to do eyebrows with a pot of wax then with these little strips, these are great for larger areas.</li>
            <li> I applied the wax strip to my chin, yank, and...not much.</li>
            <li> Yank and...not much.</li>
            <li> These work really well for the price.</li>
            <li> Smooth on in the direction the hair is growing (and this should be the way you have brushed it).  </li>
            <li> I really do like these wax strips, once I tried them nothing else compares to the ease of use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove that much hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get to master the art</li>
            <li> These strips work very well.  </li>
            <li> Of course it hurt a bit, but these strips use real wax so its not going to be pain-free</li>
            <li> but since that was not the point of this whole trial, I would have to recommend others to AVOID this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and find them very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> - 23 female, light complexion.</li>
            <li> Broke me out where I applied the strips on my face like really and didnt even really take hair off .</li>
            <li> But I decided to try the strips that are ready for use.</li>
            <li> worked very well.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very affordable.  </li>
            <li> BUT, the strips are VERY sticky, so handle with care.  </li>
            <li> but i dont have that much hair to deal with.  </li>
            <li> I have been using wax (the one I have to heat up) for a while now and thought maybe the strips would be very convenient.</li>
            <li> Well, the idea is great but the execution is poor.</li>
            <li> I tried fast motions for peeling the strips off and I tried slower motions.  </li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t adhere to the plastic very well, so it stays on your face instead of staying on the plastic and taking your hairs with it.  </li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t adhere to the plastic very well, so it stays on your face instead of staying on the plastic and taking your hairs with it.  </li>
            <li> Absolute garbage ...</li>
            <li> It is a much cheaper option, of course, than going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove hair very well.</li>
            <li> to use&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is fast and not-messy&lt;br /&gt;Double</li>
            <li> I regret so much that i buy the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, but not really &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> next time i&#x27;ll cut the strip in 1/2 lengthwise for a better fit as it was too wide...</li>
            <li> Absolutely does not do the job.</li>
            <li> Fast.</li>
            <li> Rub them to get the wax adhered really well and pull.  </li>
            <li> Pull fast, don&#x27;t hesitate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient that there are two strips stuck together, so you can get symmetry when waxing your face.</li>
            <li> but hey, it&#x27;s a ready made wax strip, of course it will hurt..</li>
            <li> Simpley warm the wax by rubbing it between hands, cut the ready to use double sided wax, paste it on where you want the hair gone and rip it off the opposite direction of hair growth, use provided oil to remove the wax</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s basically smelly water that doesn&#x27;t help at all, I was still very sticky.</li>
            <li> It was delivered fast</li>
            <li> but I have never felt this much pain before when waxing.</li>
            <li> TO MUCH HAIR.</li>
            <li> Did not work very well</li>
            <li> They go much farther if you cut them.</li>
            <li> The instructions say the wax will be warm enough to use after simply rubbing them between your hands - ha!</li>
            <li> You have to use at least three strips to get off a good amount of hair.</li>
            <li> OMG I just used these for the first time, and wow these work very well!</li>
            <li> Simply rubbing the strips between your hands does not get the wax warm enough.</li>
            <li> My biggest tip for using this product is to blast the strip with your blow-drier for a few seconds to get it really warm</li>
            <li> Once the wax is warmed up, you&#x27;re placing it on your skin, which is also warm; it can&#x27;t cool back down</li>
            <li> Once the wax is warmed up, you&#x27;re placing it on your skin, which is also warm; it can&#x27;t cool back down</li>
            <li> I waxed my upper lip and it was so easy and mess free!  </li>
            <li> I like this at home waxing brand better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works better than all other products that I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> Is effective on quite short hair and you really don&#x27;t want to grow your hair long on your face before you can pull it.</li>
            <li> Other Sally Hansen products have better results than this one.</li>
            <li> At first I was impressed that removing the strip wasn&#x27;t as painful as I had anticipated.  </li>
            <li> I smooth and smooth with my finger to be sure all the hair is coated, then hold your skin tight with one hand and quickly rip back in the opposite direction the hair grew, holding the strip as close to your skin as possible</li>
            <li> Only problem I&#x27;ve had is that, occasionally, it doesn&#x27;t work on very fine hair(s) on my chin.  </li>
            <li> But its so simple and easy and I think it looks salon professional.</li>
            <li> It was less intense than the epilator and seemed to grab much more hair.  </li>
            <li> really wish Sally  Hansen would go back to the more traditional</li>
            <li> I trim the strips to small rectangles, warm, apply, and pull off.</li>
            <li> wax strip is double sided, true.</li>
            <li> : I use an old hair straightener (use an old one that you never use, you&#x27;re most likely going to get wax on it!), put it on its lowest setting, and use that to heat the wax.</li>
            <li> I was initially excited to see the new design with the white paper framing the waxy portion of strip.  </li>
            <li> May need more wax per strips to use less.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, does what I expected.</li>
            <li> Just used these tonight and the MAIN THING I can recommend is not to follow their sizes.</li>
            <li> I always end up going back to these for quick, at-home jobs.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand any of the negative comments on here but to each their own.</li>
            <li> it probably will not work well for you and cause you mild to moderate annoyance trying.  </li>
            <li> When I shave, the hair grows back so quickly that I have stubble by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Typically, I am able to get enough weekly uses out of the box to last me 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see on the strips that the hairs are being pulled out by the roots, but I think the next crop of hair then comes in -- so I do have to use it much more often than every 8 weeks to keep my upper lip under control.</li>
            <li> so it sticks more on the hair, instead, the wax sticks on your skin making everything a mess while the hair won&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s very easy to use and very little (if any) wax residue.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist said this is due to the wax strips taking off the top layer of my skin over and over, until there was damage and the skin is excessively sensitive to sun.  </li>
            <li> Tweezing may hurt a little more, but over time you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Removes most unwanted hair off my face with little effort.</li>
            <li> I was really shocked at how perfectly it worked.</li>
            <li> I have tried aloe, gentle face lotion for sensitive skin, and neosporin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for someone who is blond or naturally doesn&#x27;t have much body hair at all because that seems to be all it can handle.</li>
            <li> I pretty much have the same amount of hair that I had before using it.</li>
            <li> I had okay results with Nads in the green jar and thought this would work.</li>
            <li> The first time my skin got really irritated/dry but the second time I used it</li>
            <li> I prefer other strips I&#x27;ve used which were not so sticky but seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li> in other words if you need it for fine hairs on your face</li>
            <li> I used this product several times on my eyebrows, but it took a lot of time and practice to get it working right.</li>
            <li> so I thought surely it would be ripped out like all the barely there hairs on the other side.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to have completely clean and dry skin and to warm the strips very well, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine facial hair and the wax gets every last hair!</li>
            <li> I keep trying their other products because they&#x27;re so widely available</li>
            <li> These strips are my new go to now.</li>
            <li> BUT THE NEW STRIPS DO NOT WORK.  </li>
            <li> that might be the difference in the comments between dark, dense hair and fine almost not there hair.  </li>
            <li> Sally Hansen USED to make the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used(their white chocolate cold wax).  </li>
            <li> It takes several tries for the strip to pull out the hair, and each go-round irritates my skin a bit more.</li>
            <li> They work great on facial hair, I have tried it on my bikini area as well with poor results.</li>
            <li> i tried these strips more than once, and on different body areas, to make sure i wasn&#x27;t just doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> and WOW does it ever!</li>
            <li> , I was surprised!  </li>
            <li> I bought this for the first time last night at the store.</li>
            <li> They usually get most of the hair, but I have no problem tweezing 1-3 stray hairs it missed.</li>
            <li> And first two days treated areas were very red and burning.</li>
            <li> and I seem to get it wrong more times than right!</li>
            <li> When I ended up with a face full of wax, I read the directions a second time and ended up with wax coating my face a second time.  </li>
            <li> until the next morning when I woke up to my entire face full of bumps.</li>
            <li> I tried alcohol to clean the area first but by the time I would get the strip ready a small layer of perspiration would come back</li>
            <li> It was huge sticky itchy mess.</li>
            <li> a mess free solution\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, the oil in the little bottle that comes with the wax strips was actually pretty good at removing all the wax left behind by the strips.  </li>
            <li> Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, the oil in the little bottle that comes with the wax strips was actually pretty good at removing all the wax left behind by the strips.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re strong enough to get lots of hair and the blue oil will get off any residue left.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Wax Strips have removed most of the hair when used on my face, but occasionally it takes a little bit of skin with it.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions, and while the strips do remove the fine (near invisible) hairs on my eyebrows, they do not remove the thick ones which is the whole point of waxing your eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> The strips are held between two clear layers of plastic (one layer has a Sally Hansen logo on it).  </li>
            <li> The warnings do not appear clearly on the box or instructions booklet, they come after the instructions.</li>
            <li> These strips are a great IDEA, but there are not enough of them to do the job (even reapplying until it won&#x27;t stick anymore) and the residue left behind is a pain.  </li>
            <li> But the instructions CLEARLY states, not to repeat waxing the same area within a 24 hr period, but like some of you I felt \\&quot;a few more times won&#x27;t hurt\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have used 4 of the strips so far.</li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the container of wax as it is not messy.</li>
            <li> I had been getting Brazillians professionally done over the summer</li>
            <li> :  Doesn&#x27;t actually remove much hair.  </li>
            <li> Works really well on facial hair, but not on body hair.</li>
            <li> Complete failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been getting professional waxes for years and decided to save some money and wax my lip at home.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the glowing reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> and I will now go and shave the old fashioned way...</li>
            <li> I even went as far as trying once again and, as anticipated, the hairs would not budge.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin to begin with but something in this strip is unlike anything I have come across.</li>
            <li> It worked very well for me except for the tiny hair.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for bikini use, doesn&#x27;t get almost any hair, for face only really.</li>
            <li> its been nearly 20 mins since I used the strips</li>
            <li> The hair that grows in is soft, not stubbly feeling.</li>
            <li> My routine is to take a shower and then do the waxing since my face and hands are completely oil-free after the shower.</li>
            <li> I think from now on I will stick to my razor or going to see a professional.</li>
            <li> For some reason Sally Hansen has changed this product to one that you rub together but doesn&#x27;t have near the sticky power as these.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my eyebrows and sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> It takes me a minute or so to be sure I have it in the proper placement and then with a firm pull, against the grain, I visously rip out my eyebrow.</li>
            <li> If you go slowly, you&#x27;ll just leave more wax on your skin and not remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> next to professional Laser hair removal or Pro hair waxing I would definately recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Only thing is, your skin must be clean and dry!</li>
            <li> The latter work fine for waxing the legs as long as the hairs are long enough, but these Sally Hansen strips absolutely do not work on the body (they make some for the body that are just like these, only bigger), and are just OK for the much finer hair on the face.  </li>
            <li> No mess.  </li>
            <li> However, if you have had success with similar products in the past, this one might be worth trying.overall.  </li>
            <li> However, if you have had success with similar products in the past, this one might be worth trying.</li>
            <li> After cutting the shape, warm up the strips with a hair dryer and quickly pull strips apart, put on the area of the eyebrow to be waxed, wait about 30 second, and pull.</li>
            <li> Plus, none of the strips are small enough to wax under eyebrows without taking off more brow than you intended.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the small strips for the lip area and the results are salon worthy.</li>
            <li> In other words, don&#x27;t go jogging or cake on make-up right after you wax.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for occasion use in waxing your eyebrows or upper lip (don&#x27;t wax my bikini area).</li>
            <li> Wish they would go back to the green color; easy to see placement on skin</li>
            <li> I read the instructions carefully and applied the strips even more carefully, but I still ended up with no hair removed and blotchy, red, sticky skin.</li>
            <li> So I usually cut them in half length wise which makes double for</li>
            <li> The tape or whatever the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; (more like glue) is stuck to is very flimsy and difficult to handle without getting it stuck to your hands, countertop, floor, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my eyebrows, which i have very little of, but wanted to clean up underneath the brow...</li>
            <li> These hurt a lot (even for waxing), didn&#x27;t get most of the hair (just a few random patches) and were not that easy to use.</li>
            <li> They come in several different sizes and you may have to cut them down or in the shape you want, but that&#x27;s easy enough to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these on facial hair and they work amazingly, the oil that comes with the kit removes any wax left behind.</li>
            <li> There is barely any stick to the hair.</li>
            <li> I have gotten professionally waxed multiple times, but couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of paying close to $60 to do my lower legs.  </li>
            <li> it works very well but be careful...</li>
            <li> and it is still red as fire and so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Tried waxing eyebrows and it barely took anything off and it leaves the wax on your face.</li>
            <li> which again was barely any)</li>
            <li> It ripped out all the barely there</li>
            <li> I did exactly as the kit said and washed and dried my face completely.</li>
            <li> What a colossal waste of $7.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> a loose and bend or squeeze the bit holder to make a tight fit</li>
            <li> I should have tried on hidden area first.</li>
            <li> Now I have been waxed before and I am aware that there is slight pain involved</li>
            <li> It will not typically remove 100% of the hair, but it works well enough for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought dozens of boxes for legs over the past 20 years and occasionally the strips for FaceBrowsBikini and was never disappointed with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend that you save your money and use your tweezers because then you have more control and won&#x27;t pluck out little invisible baby hairs that you can&#x27;t even see but will grow back dark because waxing will do that.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove hair after any other yank.</li>
            <li> I get the exact hair removal that I am looking for without all the mess and hassle of wax and strips.  </li>
            <li> Other then that it works really well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no fun trying to scrub hot wax off your face...and then dealing with everyone seeing you red, blotchy, and still have the hair it was supposed to remove.</li>
            <li> honestly embarrassed for everyone involved in the production and marketing of these useless pieces of actual garbage</li>
            <li> I had little faith in this product when I bought it but was willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as painful as others, and the finishing oil is amazing!</li>
            <li> It will hurt the first few times, but after a while I forget that it even hurts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product much more than a few times over the past 20 years without a hitch.</li>
            <li> I usually get a little red post wax that lasts for maybe 10 minutes and usually have great results that last a long time.</li>
            <li> For me, this wasn&#x27;t worth the money, as it hardly did the job.</li>
            <li> So its hard to be consistent and not stop for a break, and once you finally do stop it barely takes off my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually cut them down to size, place them on my skin, rub them in the direction of hair growth to warm them up a little, and tear them off.</li>
            <li> These have a clear wax of a &amp;#34;filmy&amp;#34; consistency, rather than a green soft wax I&#x27;ve seen on my Nair and Nad&#x27;s strips.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t remove any dark hair, only the very light, thin hair in all of these areas.</li>
            <li> This residue was extremely sticky and when I tried to wipe it away with an old cotton wash cloth, it actually pulled lint off the wash cloth that I could NOT get off my hair/skin without picking at it with tweezers.</li>
            <li> I got overzealous and waxed my upper lip a few times in the same spot trying to remove a few stubborn hairs that I should have just tweezed and took off a little bit of skin which left a red splotch and very light scab for a day.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for long for facial areas like eyebrows, upper lips etc.</li>
            <li> Then you just stick them on, press into them a little, wait for the wax to cool a little, and pull!</li>
            <li> so while you&#x27;re using one warmed-up strip in a set, the other one cools down and it&#x27;s hard to warm it back up without making a mess.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it would do on the body because there&#x27;s  not that much wax on the plastic paper.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used it and honestly I do not like it</li>
            <li> inbetween the two sides of my flat iron</li>
            <li> The one downside is that it will occasionally cause minor bumps and breakouts.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t long enough, maybe I can&#x27;t read instructions as well as I thought.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t long enough...</li>
            <li> Although, the first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t follow the directions entirely and I made the mistake of trying to take off the few additional hairs that were left and the next day I had a few burn marks on my chin (they were not permanent).</li>
            <li> I have super thick dark hair (some of the perks of being MIddle Eastern...)</li>
            <li> The wax is super thin and of the &#x27;sticky&#x27; variety.  </li>
            <li> I have tried SEVERAL other facial hair removal solutions and</li>
            <li> A little bit of residual wax gets left behind, but it&#x27;s no big deal to clean.</li>
            <li> really well you don&#x27;t have to rub hard.  </li>
            <li> As for dark, coarse hair (ahem, bikini line), did nada, even after multiple retries.</li>
            <li> I usually thread my eyebrows but my upper lip is way to sensitive and I can&#x27;t bear the pain.</li>
            <li> They can be a bit harsh on my skin since I have sensitive skin but applying pressure immediately after use and using the oil provided helps with that.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these in the long term as they damage your skin.</li>
            <li> It did remove some hair, just not nearly all of it.</li>
            <li> Sided, so this box goes a long way</li>
            <li> As long as I thoroughly wash the area after waxing, I have no</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try this product for those pesky chin hairs</li>
            <li> Colossal waste of money and waste of time!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it it left behind a sticky residue and did not pick up any of the hairs.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course hair that is very prickly, so I have been trying to find an alternative to shaving for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> I find that plucking the remaining hairs is less inconvenient than heating, stirring, and applying warm wax.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Sally&#x27;s, not this seller, but the reviews seem far less than I expected.</li>
            <li> When I bought this kit I was very excited, however I ended up in disappointment.</li>
            <li> The finishing oil helps for sure, but the white chocolate and their other cold wax, the honey, have NO residue.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried these on any other part of my body, so using them just for eyebrows make the strips last a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually have very sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li> I then repeated twice on the other side of my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just use one and save the other for later.</li>
            <li> Now, this wax is different from other pre-waxed strips I&#x27;ve seen before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other at home wax kits, this is definitely the easiest.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> They work really well for pulling out little hairs, but I have a few tips.</li>
            <li> But since then I&#x27;ve purchased two other boxes with the same results.</li>
            <li> This is a sticky mess and fails to remove the fine hairs above my lip and the stray bits of brow hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they&#x27;re not easy to customize to your exact eyebrow shape or &amp;#34;fine tuning&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t remove a single hair, but still hurt pulling it off, and it made my skin sticky.</li>
            <li> I think I may have gotten just a single hair when I did my lip</li>
            <li> One strip got every single hair it was laying over.</li>
            <li> I tried every single strip in the box.</li>
            <li> Alot of pain for only 30% hair removal - not worth it.</li>
            <li> but I noticed a dark hair on my upper lip</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and if I did not wax, I have dark, medium textured hair on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> Wax was uneven on strips and had barely any stick.</li>
            <li> Second of all, after the hassle, not only do you have raw hands</li>
            <li> The neosporin has been the only thing to start calming down the redness and taking away the million bee sting feeling.</li>
            <li> but I only need half a strip for that.</li>
            <li> if you do this one half of the wax sandwich at a time, the second part has cooled by the time you get to use it.  </li>
            <li> I typically use Nair or Veet wax strips, but found these for a bargain and couldn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to get them instead of one of my regular brands.</li>
            <li> It made it easier to separate the 2 sides and less likely I&#x27;d get wax on my fingers.  </li>
            <li> It does not pull out hair, it only leaves a goopy mess.</li>
            <li> I was left with a waxy mess on my face.</li>
            <li> (my hands tend to be very cold and won&#x27;t warm the strips) and then use it immediately.</li>
            <li> The little bottle that comes with it to remove excess wax left over works</li>
            <li> The hair has to be long enough to grab, just small stubble won&#x27;t be removed.</li>
            <li> and I do some minimal removal with a tweezer.</li>
            <li> , I read the directions carefully, warmed it and applied as directed.&lt;br /&gt;Glue</li>
            <li> I read and followed the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The skin irritation is minimal if I apply pressure, then an ice pack immediately afterward.</li>
            <li> Did not expect such sticky, messy strips.  </li>
            <li> It is so convenient to not have to take out that sticky, bulky and messy wax just to do my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Did not remove hair as expected.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Not as messy as the last Sally Hanson invention.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> The pain that this product causes really is not a factor to me.  </li>
            <li> I read the notes that came with this set and followed them carefully.  </li>
            <li> please be careful.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions carefully,  warming th strips with my hand to no avail.  </li>
            <li> but it was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Within the last few years they&#x27;ve changed their formula and they don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> but theres not much else</li>
            <li> And My eyelid is pink and swollen and holy hell it burns.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes a couple tries for my lip but eyebrows are always done with one try.</li>
            <li> It removed all my hair and for some reason, it actually hurt less than getting waxed at the salon!</li>
            <li> I have a major event coming up this weekend and now have a large, painful red burn on my face.</li>
            <li> The second attempt only lifted some of the hair and left half of it behind.</li>
            <li> Now I have patches of hair mixed with patches of raw skin.</li>
            <li> Not only did it leave half the hair behind in some spots but it completely stripped the skin in others.</li>
            <li> and it hurts to have to keep waxing the same spot again and again with little results!</li>
            <li> i used this product to wax my eyebrows, and it worked well, just not always in one strip as other products.  </li>
            <li> I have to agree with everything said in the other One-Star reviews.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about use for other body parts.</li>
            <li> Yet know these would work well on other body parts as well.  </li>
            <li> becareful as if u drop it on anything other then the area you put it, buy buy hair or eyebrow...</li>
            <li> other wax and tweezing even make my skin freak out.</li>
            <li> since there are two strips connected to each other, once you pull the strips apart, you have to use both.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ll have to spend time and money either at a salon or trying other products.</li>
            <li> It works well for eyebrows, but I would not use again for other areas.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, literally, I went back with a pair of tweezers and got more hair and less pain than I did when I used half a dozen strips of this crap.</li>
            <li> Very thick and sticky residue that is extremely painful when you snatch it off the treated area and doesn&#x27;t work as good as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Difficult to remove remaining hair after initial strip applied without using several other strips, and this becomes uncomfortable quickly.</li>
            <li> Once or twice I&#x27;ve waxed whatever sideburns I have (also peach fuzz), and this wax left me broken out in those areas only!  </li>
            <li> These wax strips are very small, and barely get off any hair.</li>
            <li> When I thought I may have skipped a step in the instruction manual, I read it again and attempted to wax the other brow with no success.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the patience to pluck individual hairs out of my upper lip area with tweezers, and I&#x27;ve previously had poor results with a depilatory cream.  </li>
            <li> at least 5 or 6 years of waxing my upper lip every 2 months or so.  </li>
            <li> I use the SH wax strips for face (under lip area) and I now have dark, reddened patches that resemble a mustache.</li>
            <li> I also tried this with my underarm area, also with no success.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I expected it to hurt a lot worse, but there was barely any pain at all.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth your money or hassle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much dark hair on my face</li>
            <li> but the dark hair was still there mocking me.</li>
            <li> It got 10% of my upper lip hair and I don&#x27;t even have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my brows for years now and have never experienced such a waste of time and money in my entire years of waxing.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product years ago because when I would get my eyebrows professionally done, they always made them too thin.</li>
            <li> I have THICK coarse hair</li>
            <li> After a few seconds I pull the plastic apart and ever so carefully place the wax against the offending hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick of having to try all these new products (none of which I like) because I can&#x27;t find the old ones (that did work)!</li>
            <li> The redness goes down after about 45 minutes or so, although my skin is used to them.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re working with your eyebrow you should cut the strips down to the size you want.</li>
            <li> NOT for my lady-stache or down under...</li>
            <li> I even tried heating the darned strips for 30 seconds before application - only then did a small amount of hair come off on any body part!</li>
            <li> I previous purchased 2 and they were 2 thumbs down compared to this one.</li>
            <li> Not subjecting any other body area to the waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I typically use these for my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I can typically get away with using these strips every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I think I used half of the box, attempting to get all the hair off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t figure this out until I had used half of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on black peoples pubes.</li>
            <li> half?....</li>
            <li> For me, this product worked about half as well as it should have but can suffice if you have a couple hairs under your brow</li>
            <li> It was just a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I have used the large strips for the bikini area in the past, but I find it difficult at times to do this area on yourself.  </li>
            <li> Pull the skin tight after the strip is applied and hold it as you remove the strip.</li>
            <li> I look in the mirror and discover half my eyebrow missing.</li>
            <li> I am missing half my eyebrow</li>
            <li> Have gone to a salon for the past 10 years every other month for waxing.  </li>
            <li> even if I had one strand (trust me, I tried on one strand with no success!)</li>
            <li> the plastic cover is a failure, won&#x27;t make the wax dry a little</li>
            <li> They worked extremely well!!</li>
            <li> so only do a little at a time because it can and will remove all your eyebrows or make them too thin.</li>
            <li> its painful but worth it.</li>
            <li> A few hairs came away but the majority stayed.</li>
            <li> and I would not have wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just tweeze off whatever it leaves behind, so it&#x27;s really no big deal.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble and just keep tweezing.</li>
            <li> So turn up your AC before you use it or don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> He gave me some recommendations for GENTLER  wax strips that aren&#x27;t so harsh.</li>
            <li> , I feel like wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I never go to a salon anymore and waste 20 dollars for an eyebrow waxing.</li>
            <li> but it can be messy.</li>
            <li> Buying this product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> using it was a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It is ineffective and will be a waste of your money and time.</li>
            <li> It left even my longer hairs behind.  </li>
            <li> People who rated this poorly because it &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t work&amp;#34; did not know how to use them properly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t shave for another few days</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Press the hand-warmed wax pieces firmly downward then RIP upward and</li>
            <li> For the legs it is a waste of money unless you just want torture.</li>
            <li> Run, don&#x27;t walk away from considering this option; it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The wax on the strips seems dried up.  </li>
            <li> The second attempt (after I re-read the instructions) was even worse.</li>
            <li> a few hours andsee how your skin reacts.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t cut them before peeling apart you will waste them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a few years and they work well for me.</li>
            <li> well last night I followed the directions to the t &amp; nothing but a sticky mess that was horrible to clean up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It takes less than 5 minutes, even though I usually miss a few hairs and have to tweeze them to finish the job.</li>
            <li> lot less than going to the salon!</li>
            <li> If I could give this less stars I would!</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I try, this product only removes one or two hairs per use; that&#x27;s ridiculous</li>
            <li> The plastic backing wasn&#x27;t made for difficult or curved areas and the hassle of trying to heat these and apply them was a major pain.</li>
            <li> Much faster then plucking and since it is all at once less painful.</li>
            <li> One of them landed face down on my floor and I am having a hard time getting the wax off.</li>
            <li> It burn bad and left a red mark.</li>
            <li> A little hard to manage</li>
            <li> However, I tried them on my bikini line, and they removed very little hair.</li>
            <li> I used the small strips, but after trial and error</li>
            <li> I wax about every 2-4 weeks depending on how lazy I am at the time.</li>
            <li> I usually heat it up by holding the wax strip</li>
            <li> I think there might be a couple of things wrong with the system, overall.  </li>
            <li> first time was miserable BUT second time I got.</li>
            <li> I like to also wipe the area with a cotton ball soaked in Witch Hazel to remove all of the residue, otherwise I will notice small bumps appear within 24 hours of the waxing.</li>
            <li> is instructions, but all it did was pull at my skin when I took it off as instructed, and it did not take off any hairs :/</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past, with minimum issues.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but almost every woman has facial hair.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s usually the thicker, darker hair that doesn&#x27;t come off with the wax).</li>
            <li> I could tell something was wrong almost immediately and stopped, so I only did the one side.  </li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> Usually I notice a problem at home in the evening, so</li>
            <li> Thought I did it wrong and tried it again with the same results.</li>
            <li> still have to do some plucking afterwards because it does leave a few hairs behind, but that might have a bit to do with the fact that I have dark hair, so it&#x27;s a bit tougher.</li>
            <li> didnt take off any hair at all,left a sticky film that was horrible to get off,wouldn&#x27;t recomend this product to anyone.dont buy its a huge waste of money</li>
            <li> They get all the small hairs as well as the thick ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sally Hansen wax in the past but this sucks.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was so tired of plucking my eyebrows (dark brown) and shaving my bikini line and face</li>
            <li> , it was really hard to use and the wax stayed on my skin.</li>
            <li> but when I use the strips on my chin it hardly works.</li>
            <li> 1st some of the strips are hard to find the separating point.</li>
            <li> Also the wax residue is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Something happened (hormones no doubt) that has now caused me to be highly reactive to some skincare products I&#x27;ve been testing, too.  :(</li>
            <li> I am no stranger to waxing in the least and decided to try waxing at home with this kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the fact that it was awfully late coming in, the product works just as it was designed for.</li>
            <li> i got this thinking it would work at least somewhat</li>
            <li> after all that, you get fruitless results (at least I got fruitless results) . .</li>
            <li> I tried it for my bikini line and although it does remove some hairs - and thus makes it relatively painful it by far does not remove everything</li>
            <li> Received this and attempted to use it, does not warm up or remove the unwanted hair..</li>
            <li> This sucks.</li>
            <li> , it is messier and no less painful.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for my upper lip and I have to go over a couple time just to remove the hair, don&#x27;t bother with this product hardly works and the oil they give you for when your done has made me break out with acne and the wax stick to your skin and is very difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> I have used kits in the past and have hated the whole waxing idea.</li>
            <li> The pain factor was not that bad at all, but the strips barely pulled off any of my hair, and the hair it did manage to take off (</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money and time. :(</li>
            <li> Salons are too expensive, the wax that you melt in the microwave is too messy and hard to regulate temperature.</li>
            <li> Typically once a month when I find myself unable to keep up with tweezing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> But I must say this is too hard to use,especially on my face!</li>
            <li> This product sucks !</li>
            <li> I had to scrub the area with soap and water and then keep an ice cold compress on my skin for it to go down.  </li>
            <li> So, it appears that I no longer have the tough, can-take-anything skin of my yoot.</li>
            <li> BTW I have very thick, course body hair</li>
            <li> What a waste!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible!!!!! What a waste of money. Not only did it get maybe 10% of the hairs</li>
            <li> /&gt;So cut your strips thinly for your eyebrows!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This item is the worse wax kit i have ever used.  </li>
            <li> But the way it is shipped is irritating (see images.)</li>
            <li> OMG I wish this product would work because I hate dealing with traditional wax (the one that you heat up in a microwave or crock-pot).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think I would have rather had the minor fuzz,  than this. :(</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I am scheduled to take pictures this evening.</li>
            <li> She was not happy with them.</li>
            <li> Just leaves glue residue behind</li>
            <li> Trying to position the film accurately is nearly impossible because there is about a half an inch margin around the glue.</li>
            <li> new Sally Hansen wax strips are TERRIBLE!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really uncomfortable to get wax on your eyelid because even if it didn&#x27;t pull out eyelashes or other painful things, the wax will stick to your skin and make blinking a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It ripped my skin off and left a very painful and burning feeling.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my mom and the same thing, just painful with bad results</li>
            <li> i had them tatted on a few years ago and they faded off after about a year  :(  .</li>
            <li> I hate it half?</li>
            <li> and I was SO wrong.</li>
            <li> These strips left a horrible residue on my skin that would NOT wash away for days.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> have thin hair!</li>
            <li> I think I pulled wrong.</li>
            <li> When all else fails, READ THE DIRECTIONS.</li>
            <li> Well, needless to say, I learned my lesson</li>
            <li> .Has failed me.</li>
            <li> If my skin continues to look angry, I apply Neosporin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they&#x27;re not working for me either.  </li>
            <li> This product did not remove ANY hair and left a terrible wax paste on my face that was extremely difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> I used it the wrong way</li>
            <li> and i have this awful red rash.</li>
            <li> worthless and a waste of money</li>
            <li> This is just about useless.</li>
            <li> so basically I bought the wrong one</li>
            <li> My one eyebrow that I attempted is still burning,  and the sad thing is none of the hair even came off</li>
            <li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t leave my poor wife a scare!</li>
            <li> and I am now extremely sad.</li>
            <li> Ripping hair out by it&#x27;s roots leaves a vulnerable pore no matter where on your body, but it&#x27;s not just hair removal by those two mechanisms.</li>
            <li> It is painful and unpleasant to use, and did not remove the few pesky hairs I bought the kit for.</li>
            <li> These are the least painful waxing strips that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Just be patient when you are cutting and take your time during the application and removal.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work on underarm hair, bikini area or legs which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few wax strip kits, and this is the worst product ever!</li>
            <li> Useless!</li>
            <li> When I saw the user had to determine the &#x27;direction&#x27; of hair growth, I couldn&#x27;t believe how complicated wax strips could be!</li>
            <li> i angled it wrong and it took off 1/2 of my eyebrow :(  </li>
            <li> I was so fearful of having to pull out the giant wax bottle and so fearful of threading that I ended up revealing my stache to the world :( .</li>
            <li> very difficult to use</li>
            <li> Now the area has to scab over before it heals which makes for trying to conceal it impossible.</li>
            <li> it irritated my skin so bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for about 2 years and never had a bad experience</li>
            <li> Bad decision.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t reflect badly on the seller, they gave me what is pictured, it&#x27;s the product.</li>
            <li> Bad product.</li>
            <li> I thought I had just gotten a bad box.</li>
            <li> My wife Had a bad experience with this product...</li>
            <li> Works well on face or anywhere else you need a mildly painful hair removal method.  </li>
            <li> it was terribly painful</li>
            <li> Ooohhh they are painful m not going to use it ever.</li>
            <li> and I keep being disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product to work with my eyebrows and mid-brow region but was disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> and I was severely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate when my products don&#x27;t arrive with everything it says it comes with.</li>
            <li> The solvent masquerading as &amp;#34;finishing oil&amp;#34; burned the CRAP out of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Crap, don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> I hate those waxing strips I used it to wax between my eyebrows and</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> Just rip it off with these bad boys!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Benadryl to try and counteract the reaction, but it&#x27;s still feeling and looking horrible  :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> It is horrible and inhuman.</li>
            <li> These wax strips are awful!</li>
            <li> These are horrible!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> This was just awful.</li>
            <li> What a terrible disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> The worst I could say about them was I sometimes struggled to separate the strips, but, boy, did they work.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just used these tonight and the MAIN THING I can recommend is not to follow their sizes. Play fast and free with the scissors when working with your eyebrows! I used the small strips, but after trial and error I think the medium or big will work better. I cut off all the wax free edges then placed the strip (before separating anything) against my Eyebrow and traced with a pen where my Eyebrow was. Then I cut on that line so that I could get the strip close to the hair I wanted to keep without pulling out too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure you cut away at the bottom too. It&#x27;s really uncomfortable to get wax on your eyelid because even if it didn&#x27;t pull out eyelashes or other painful things, the wax will stick to your skin and make blinking a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So cut your strips thinly for your eyebrows!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, pull quickly. This is not a bandaid situation. If you go slowly, you&#x27;ll just leave more wax on your skin and not remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an alternative to a salon, it is messier and no less painful. But if you don&#x27;t have the money to splurge with or don&#x27;t have time to get to the salon, it is pretty handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using it again with extra olive oil handy so I can rub off the wax on my fingers as I work. I&#x27;ve heard that olive oil works just as well as the finishing oil that comes with the kit to remove wax.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen USED to make the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used(their white chocolate cold wax).  I keep trying their other products because they&#x27;re so widely available and I keep being disappointed.  These strips are a great IDEA, but there are not enough of them to do the job (even reapplying until it won&#x27;t stick anymore) and the residue left behind is a pain.  The finishing oil helps for sure, but the white chocolate and their other cold wax, the honey, have NO residue.  They simply rinse off with warm water, no need even for soap! The blue one, the purple one and this one all leave that residue which just isn&#x27;t necessary. Why Sally WHY??? What happened to that wonderful white chocolate cold wax??? It smells so good I could eat it but I restrained myself!!! I&#x27;ll be good I promise, please bring it back!</li>
            <li> I am no stranger to waxing in the least and decided to try waxing at home with this kit. I did exactly as the kit said and washed and dried my face completely. I applied the wax strip to my chin, yank, and...not much. A few hairs came away but the majority stayed. I tried again. Yank and...not much. I repeated this FOUR MORE TIMES on the same spot in hopes that it would do something and I would not have wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add insult to injury, a lot of wax stayed on my skin so I was still hairy AND sticky. I do not have stubborn hair or anything, so all I can say is that this product is useless and I would have been better served going to the salon.</li>
            <li> I use this for upper lip waxing. it works great. remove all the hair. its painful but worth it. easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> These work really well for the price. They do leave a little hair, but hey, nothing&#x27;s perfect. I suggest taking a blow dryer and warming up these strips to get the wax nice and gooey before applying and tearing off. It seems to pull more off that way. I just tweeze off whatever it leaves behind, so it&#x27;s really no big deal. Sure beats tweezing every single hair at a time, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> I thought these strips would be great and I was SO wrong. These strips left a horrible residue on my skin that would NOT wash away for days. Plus they also left this residue on any hair that they did not pull out that, again, would NOT wash away. This residue was extremely sticky and when I tried to wipe it away with an old cotton wash cloth, it actually pulled lint off the wash cloth that I could NOT get off my hair/skin without picking at it with tweezers. I&#x27;m glad that I did this on a Friday since I didn&#x27;t leave the house the whole weekend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these wax strips for almost 5 years now. Typically once a month when I find myself unable to keep up with tweezing my eyebrows. They can be a bit harsh on my skin since I have sensitive skin but applying pressure immediately after use and using the oil provided helps with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years for eyebrow waxing. I don&#x27;t know how great it is for other areas, but great for eyebrows. After cutting the shape, warm up the strips with a hair dryer and quickly pull strips apart, put on the area of the eyebrow to be waxed, wait about 30 second, and pull. Does it feel great? No. Does it get every last hair? No - but pulls the great majority and I do some minimal removal with a tweezer. But its so simple and easy and I think it looks salon professional. I&#x27;ve had compliments on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I always come back to these because they&#x27;re so simple to use. Better than epilators but not perfect, as with any hair removal system.</li>
            <li> i tried these strips more than once, and on different body areas, to make sure i wasn&#x27;t just doing it wrong. maybe i&#x27;m just not heating it enough in my hands, but these wax strips are ALL THE PAIN WITH NONE OF THE BENEFITS. didn&#x27;t remove a single hair, but still hurt pulling it off, and it made my skin sticky. i&#x27;m going to try to get a refund.</li>
            <li> I have tried it all..and this is by far the best.  I have always found it embarrasing to sit in the beauty shop to have a lip and chin wax so I have tried everything from nightly tweezing to the roll on hot wax, (what a mess that was)and to be honest I had little faith in this product when I bought it but was willing to try anything.  I was really shocked at how perfectly it worked. Warming between your fingers for a minute is all you need...trim the excess plastic away from around the wax pocket. Be sure your skin is oil free and the hair is brushed all in one direction. Smooth on in the direction the hair is growing (and this should be the way you have brushed it).  I smooth and smooth with my finger to be sure all the hair is coated, then hold your skin tight with one hand and quickly rip back in the opposite direction the hair grew, holding the strip as close to your skin as possible (meaning do not pull UP...pull BACK.)  Does every bit as good a job as the beauty shop!!  A fraction of the price and the convienence and privacy of your own home.  The oil included is soothing and takes away any left over wax instantly. I honestly can&#x27;t ever remember purchasing a product I was as happy with as this.  If you can read and follow directions, this will be the best thing you have ever used!</li>
            <li> these worked great for a quick fix when in need, instead of having to bust out the full on kit.</li>
            <li> I have used this for some time, it is a great product for home use.</li>
            <li> Good quality, I like it.</li>
            <li> Thinking about trying instead of going to salon, but it was a big mistake. I read and follow the instruction, applied to my upper lip (that&#x27;s a big no no), then pull the strip according to instruction. It burn bad and left a red mark. I should have tried on hidden area first. Please do yourself a favor, do not BUY this production. I am going to write my review to all sites related to this product. It is horrible and inhuman. STAY AWAY.</li>
            <li> Works great for removing unwanted hair. It will not typically remove 100% of the hair, but it works well enough for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been using this kit for years now. I can&#x27;t find a better way to do my own eyebrows. Just be patient when you are cutting and take your time during the application and removal.</li>
            <li> I have used these for over five years. I use them on my brows and upper lip and they work great. I also use them to take out blackheads by my nose. The redness goes down after about 45 minutes or so, although my skin is used to them. I would give the redness more time to fade if I were to try this for the first time. It will hurt the first few times, but after a while I forget that it even hurts. Instead of rubbing the strips between my hands, I gently warm them with a lighter by quickly passing the lighter under the strip as I hold the strip with tweezers. The strips are perfect because you can cut them into just the right shape, and because they are clear you can see how much hair they will take out before you decide to rip them off. I always check to make sure I&#x27;m not waxing off hair that I don&#x27;t want to wax off! I follow up on the stubborn hairs with tweezers, but this product does most of the work for me, and it leaves my skin super smooth afterwards. I wax about every 2-4 weeks depending on how lazy I am at the time. I always get complimented on my brows :)</li>
            <li> Worked well on lighter, finer hairs.  As for dark, coarse hair (ahem, bikini line), did nada, even after multiple retries.</li>
            <li> The wax strips remove hair, but only about a third of it. You have to use a lot of strips just to wax your bikini line. Plus, when you warm them up in your hands, you warm up two at a time, but only use one at a time - so while you&#x27;re using one warmed-up strip in a set, the other one cools down and it&#x27;s hard to warm it back up without making a mess. It also hurts quite a lot for something that doesn&#x27;t remove very much hair.</li>
            <li> This was sent to me right on time! Thank you. But I must say this is too hard to use,especially on my face! OWWWW! but I think I will try it again. If I get another friend to help me with it. Thank you very much for sending it.[[ASIN:B000AAAVZE Sally Hansen Hair Remover Wax Strip Kit, for Face, Brows &amp; Bikini]]</li>
            <li> Such a perfect product.  No mess.  Great precision.  No stray hairs.  Just perfect every time!</li>
            <li> It is a good waxing strip but not the perfect one</li>
            <li> I thought that you just pressed where you wanted the hair removed, but nope! Took the whole flipping thing off! And I can&#x27;t get through to their 800 number. Don&#x27;t use these unless you want it all gone!</li>
            <li> These wax strips are awful! I read the instructions carefully and applied the strips even more carefully, but I still ended up with no hair removed and blotchy, red, sticky skin. The adhesive hasn&#x27;t been able to be removed with face wash or dish soap, either. Plus, none of the strips are small enough to wax under eyebrows without taking off more brow than you intended. Colossal waste of money and waste of time! Save yourself the trouble and just keep tweezing.</li>
            <li> Of all the strip kits on the market this is the best, None are really great. But when you need a quick and fast fix, this will work.! I used many kinds but this is about the best they have to offer.</li>
            <li> I really do like these wax strips, once I tried them nothing else compares to the ease of use. For the eye brow I simply cut them to the shape of my arch under the brow and then pull the strips apart, which makes two strips, one for each eye. I also cut the shape I like for the top arch and do the same, easy breezy! The strips are nice and wide So I usually cut them in half length wise which makes double for want I need. So one strip will do both eye brows. Same goes for the upper lip but I only need half a strip for that. The little bottle that comes with it to remove excess wax left over works really well you don&#x27;t have to rub hard.  Only thing is, your skin must be clean and dry! (no makeup or moisturizer) and don&#x27;t use them if it&#x27;s a hot day and your face has perspiration, they won&#x27;t work. I tried alcohol to clean the area first but by the time I would get the strip ready a small layer of perspiration would come back and it never worked. So turn up your AC before you use it or don&#x27;t waste your time it will just hurt and the hair will not come off.</li>
            <li> I always end up going back to these for quick, at-home jobs. Perfect for quick touch ups as they are much easier than heating up hard wax, no risk of burns. Once you get your technique down these strips works great. I just use a little bit of oil to remove any residual wax and am good to go.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this because I had a pool party I was hosting and I wanted to neaten up my bikini area. I ordered 2 weeks in advance and it didn&#x27;t come until a MONTH after I ordered! I ended up buying it at the drugstore when I didn&#x27;t show up on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the fact that it was awfully late coming in, the product works just as it was designed for. The strips come in 3 sizes. If you&#x27;re working with your eyebrow you should cut the strips down to the size you want. They are double sided. This was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> i used this product to wax my eyebrows, and it worked well, just not always in one strip as other products.  sometimes i would have to wax the same area 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li> I used these for years... at least 5 or 6 years of waxing my upper lip every 2 months or so.  I have very fine hair that grows there that starts to become visible after 6-8 weeks of growth.  THESE STRIPS WORK.  don&#x27;t get me wrong. You only have to use the strip once and it gets all the hair.  I used the Azulene oil before and after just like it says, but now I suffer from melasma, where the skin on my upper lip is darker than the rest of the skin on my face.  My dermatologist said this is due to the wax strips taking off the top layer of my skin over and over, until there was damage and the skin is excessively sensitive to sun.  I have to stay out of the sun and use SPF 5000, or else I look like I have a permanent chocolate milk mustache.  He gave me some recommendations for GENTLER  wax strips that aren&#x27;t so harsh. I would not recommend these in the long term as they damage your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before which is why I ordered it again. If you&#x27;re looking to buy a home waxing kit, this is the one you should purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it doesn&#x27;t appear that there are a lot of wax strip in the box, they go alot further than you would think.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product &amp; you will too.</li>
            <li> Just like avons but cheaper</li>
            <li> It got 10% of my upper lip hair and I don&#x27;t even have thick hair. I tried it on my mom and the same thing, just painful with bad results</li>
            <li> What a colossal waste of $7.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I read the directions carefully, warmed it and applied as directed.&lt;br /&gt;Glue sticks to both sides of the plastic, so you don&#x27;t get a great seal onto the skin.  Alot of pain for only 30% hair removal - not worth it.</li>
            <li> Very thick and sticky residue that is extremely painful when you snatch it off the treated area and doesn&#x27;t work as good as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the product once and didn&#x27;t like it...i&#x27;ve used it on my legs and arms..it irritated my skin so bad and it didn&#x27;t remove all the hair...I don&#x27;t recommend it..</li>
            <li> I like this at home waxing brand better than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> perfect sizes for the face-my eyebrows are perfect every time-you can cut the strips too. works well</li>
            <li> I have to agree with everything said in the other One-Star reviews.  It did NOTHING to remove fine eyebrow hair.  Not subjecting any other body area to the waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> These are horrible!!! The instructions say the wax will be warm enough to use after simply rubbing them between your hands - ha! Not one single hair was lifted, so I read reviews on the Bliss wax strips, and someone said she had better luck after using her hair dryer to heat them. I tried this with the Sally Hansen strips and still had no luck! So I tried a second strip and ended up waxing a layer of skin off of my lip... ouch. Save yourself the misery and do NOT buy these!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove that much hair. My box arrived with no azulene finishing oil. I hate when my products don&#x27;t arrive with everything it says it comes with. What a waste!!!</li>
            <li> i got this thinking it would work at least somewhat but it didnt work for me at all. all it did was leave my skin red and sticky and took off no hair.</li>
            <li> This is MUCH easier to use than wax and much cleaner too! Although it&#x27;s easier to do eyebrows with a pot of wax then with these little strips, these are great for larger areas. There are no bumps or stickiness afterwards either thanks to the oil it comes with!</li>
            <li> Shipping was kind of long... Doesn&#x27;t really remove hair after any other yank.</li>
            <li> Horrible! I&#x27;ve tried it many times and it doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;I kept thinking maybe it was something I did.... well last night I followed the directions to the t &amp; nothing but a sticky mess that was horrible to clean up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair!</li>
            <li> If I could give this no stars I would. It ripped my skin off and left a very painful and burning feeling. Now the area has to scab over before it heals which makes for trying to conceal it impossible. Please stay away from this brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Sally&#x27;s, not this seller, but the reviews seem far less than I expected. This product can be a good product. It works best for me when I run a strip under really hot water, instead of using the warmth of my hands. Then I let the wax cool on my face, &amp; yank it up. It takes significantly more hair off that way. I use this exclusively for my face. I don&#x27;t know about use for other body parts.</li>
            <li> I typically use these for my eyebrows.  I get the exact hair removal that I am looking for without all the mess and hassle of wax and strips.  Yet know these would work well on other body parts as well.  I can typically get away with using these strips every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> After a disaster with hot wax, I decided to purchase these. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for 7 bucks. I read and followed the directions carefully. It did remove some hair, just not nearly all of it. I think I pulled wrong. I pulled UP but think maybe I should have pulled OUT away from my face. I think, with practice, it will work better. I&#x27;ve read many reviews complaining that the wax didn&#x27;t come off for days. You have to use the blue liquid that came with the kit. When all else fails, READ THE DIRECTIONS. It tells you to apply it with a cotton ball afterward. It takes the wax right off. My only concern now is stubble. It seems today that my upper lip feels stubbly, similar to the way your legs feel the day after you shave them. I didn&#x27;t want stubble!</li>
            <li> I am trying to review this product on as many websites that I can to warn people of it&#x27;s dangers.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product twice now and EACH TIME it has RIPPED OFF a chunk of my skin. I use the SH wax strips for face (under lip area) and I now have dark, reddened patches that resemble a mustache. EXACTLY what I want to look like when on STAGE!!!!!! Yes. I have to sing at a wedding at 3pm.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU, DALLY HANSEN!!!!&lt;br /&gt;NEVER again.</li>
            <li> I used this product several times on my eyebrows, but it took a lot of time and practice to get it working right. You have to cut the strips into the right shape and then rub them between your hands to activate the wax. I didn&#x27;t really get to master the art good enough, so i don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!! I have tried SEVERAL other facial hair removal solutions and next to professional Laser hair removal or Pro hair waxing I would definately recommend it!!! Although, the first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t follow the directions entirely and I made the mistake of trying to take off the few additional hairs that were left and the next day I had a few burn marks on my chin (they were not permanent). But the instructions CLEARLY states, not to repeat waxing the same area within a 24 hr period, but like some of you I felt \\&quot;a few more times won&#x27;t hurt\\&quot;. Well, needless to say, I learned my lesson and I have been following the instuctions since then and it has paid off BIG time. Not only does the waxing strips remove 97% of the hair, when the hair does grow back it takes longer and is finer in texture. Also, an extra added bonus is the oil wax remover that comes along with it, it doesn&#x27;t sting and is actually soothing to the skin.... I HIGHLY recommend!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen . . .Has failed me. First of all it was a pain to get the strips warm enough to use (you do it by rubbing the strips . .apparently the friction and the warmth of your hands are supposed to be good enough . .HA). Second of all, after the hassle, not only do you have raw hands (maybe there&#x27;s a better method . . .), but you have to rush to wax your face/bikini/whatever . . .And after all that, you get fruitless results (at least I got fruitless results) . . .The only thing it worked for was my bikini area/stomach (and even then there were multiple stray hairs . . .I had to do it again and again and again) . . . lips and eyebrows were a no go . . ..I think I may have gotten just a single hair when I did my lip (but then again . .I have yet to find anything that works for my lip).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, do yourself a favor and try something else . . .</li>
            <li> These strips work very well.  I used them for my eyebrows and they removed every hair I wanted removed with ease. Of course it hurt a bit, but these strips use real wax so its not going to be pain-free and it doesn&#x27;t claim to be.  They are very easy to use, all you have to do is warm them in your hands for a few seconds and you are ready. They come in several different sizes and you may have to cut them down or in the shape you want, but that&#x27;s easy enough to do. There is a finishing oil in the package that feels great and removes the wax residue instantly.  If you want an easy way to wax at home, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> These work! I tried it out on my cheek to see if it does and WOW does it ever! It takes all the hair off! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin either. I&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
            <li> I would give this 0 stars if possible. It took none of my leg hair, and is barely enough to do the shin area of one leg. There is barely any stick to the hair. It all sticks to your leg! I also tried this with my underarm area, also with no success. 0/10</li>
            <li> Works great for when I&#x27;m in a pinch inbetween waxing appointments.</li>
            <li> I have used 4 of the strips so far. I will be throwing away the rest and not wasting my time with it anymore. Using on my legs after letting my hair grow to 1/4 inch was a non-success. My hair is coarse and it still couldn&#x27;t grab on and remove properly. Maybe one or two hairs per entire strip. Total waste of time and money. Using on underarms, arms, and face, removed nothing.</li>
            <li> My gf tried these and they pulled out like two of her hairs. Lol. Maybe it was just her type of hair, but they were difinately lengthy enough, obviously, if it pulled out the two. She followed the direction to a T. This product sucks ! Consider an epilator instead or something. She has had much better results with an epilator.</li>
            <li> These always work great- been using them for years!</li>
            <li> it doe not work out all , I feel like wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Being a full time college student, I don&#x27;t have much time or money on my hands for the salon. These strips are great for In between salon visits. My only complaint is that they&#x27;re not easy to customize to your exact eyebrow shape or &amp;#34;fine tuning&amp;#34; your look. But it&#x27;s a quick fix and will clean them up nicely. I&#x27;ve used them for about 2 years and never had a bad experience</li>
            <li> Best wax strip on the market. They warm up quickly with the heat of your hands or blow dryer. They remove most of the hair in one go. They can be trimmed before application. A little bit of residual wax gets left behind, but it&#x27;s no big deal to clean. I don&#x27;t care for the included oil. I use either alcohol or a hot washcloth. It hurts of, of course.....you&#x27;re pulling out patches of hair. The skin irritation is minimal if I apply pressure, then an ice pack immediately afterward. If my skin continues to look angry, I apply Neosporin. The hair has to be long enough to grab, just small stubble won&#x27;t be removed.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Wax Strips have removed most of the hair when used on my face, but occasionally it takes a little bit of skin with it. Until recently I thought it was the best I could find until I tried the Veet Wax Strips for face. They seem to remove even more hair and haven&#x27;t irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I love these wax strips. I never go to a salon anymore and waste 20 dollars for an eyebrow waxing. Just cut them to the shape you want and put them on the hair you want gone from your eyebrows, press, and pull in the opposite direction of hair growth. The hair is gone and you still have the money you would have given to the salon. It takes practice so only do a little at a time because it can and will remove all your eyebrows or make them too thin. Also you have to rub the azulene oil on them to get some of the sticky stuff off, but it also reduces redness. Great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been waxing for years and when I saw this on sale at a local drugstore, I thought I&#x27;d give them a try. Bad decision. These hurt a lot (even for waxing), didn&#x27;t get most of the hair (just a few random patches) and were not that easy to use. The plastic backing wasn&#x27;t made for difficult or curved areas and the hassle of trying to heat these and apply them was a major pain.The only thing that worked was the wax removing liquid but since that was not the point of this whole trial, I would have to recommend others to AVOID this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and find them very convenient to use. They are very easy to use by simply rubbing them between your palms. If you have sweaty/clammy hands, rub the strip between your hand and your shirt tail. Some reviews have stated that they have scarring or darkened skin; I have never had this issue. I mainly use the small strips for the lip area and the results are salon worthy. I have used the large strips for the bikini area in the past, but I find it difficult at times to do this area on yourself.  - 23 female, light complexion.</li>
            <li> The wax doesn&#x27;t pull of the hair effectively.  I had to use several strips on one area without it working.</li>
            <li> Did not expect such sticky, messy strips.  I&#x27;ll use them but don&#x27;t care for this product.  I prefer other strips I&#x27;ve used which were not so sticky but seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well at removing MOST hairs but you&#x27;ll still need to do some tweezing. DO NOT attempt to re-apply this stuff on the same place either. It WILL hurt, maybe even remove some skin, &amp; leave scars/marks! Don&#x27;t risk it, ladies! 4/5</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to work with my eyebrows and mid-brow region but was disappointed with the results. I assure you, I followed every instruction provided, did as the box said, but got no results. Maybe one or two hairs was plucked out, but that&#x27;s it, and I was left with a gross sticky waxy residue that took DAYS of hardcore washing to get off. I ended up just using my trustworthy tweezers. This product does not work at all. I recommend that you save your money and use your tweezers because then you have more control and won&#x27;t pluck out little invisible baby hairs that you can&#x27;t even see but will grow back dark because waxing will do that. It&#x27;s not worth it. Tweezing may hurt a little more, but over time you get used to it. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> These are the best ones I have found. I heat them up with the hair dryer first.&lt;br /&gt;You can cut these to a smaller size if needed.&lt;br /&gt;A lot less than going to the salon!</li>
            <li> Broke me out where I applied the strips on my face like really and didnt even really take hair off .</li>
            <li> I bought this kit with doubt. I have used kits in the past and have hated the whole waxing idea. But I decided to try the strips that are ready for use. Boy was I surprised. They worked extremely well!! One strip got every single hair it was laying over. I am so happy I won&#x27;t have to take time out of my day to stop by the salon and can spend a lot less with this kit.</li>
            <li> Works as stated - Ouch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these wax strips for years to shape and trim my brow area.  They work beautifully.  I usually heat it up by holding the wax strip inbetween the two sides of my flat iron - the heat gets the wax nice and melted, which always ensures a clean waxing.</li>
            <li> I swear by Sally Hansen. I prefer this to the container of wax as it is not messy. It does a good job. The container was is better at getting the hair out first rip but it can be messy.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t get to a wax shop and let someone do it for you, this is an excellent way to go. I won&#x27;t buy another brand. This product is good at grabbing every hair, as long as you warm it thoroughly before applying and allow it to cool slightly before pulling. The hardest part is that you have to do it yourself.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all.  Tried numerous time and this should not be sold anywhere. Save your money. This item is the worse wax kit i have ever used.  its not even was it was something else they just called it wax</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand any of the negative comments on here but to each their own. I highly recommend this product for occasion use in waxing your eyebrows or upper lip (don&#x27;t wax my bikini area). It is so convenient to not have to take out that sticky, bulky and messy wax just to do my upper lip. I usually thread my eyebrows but my upper lip is way to sensitive and I can&#x27;t bear the pain. This is literally 1-2-3. I warm it in the microwave for like 6 seconds, apply it, pull, and all my hair comes off. This was my second purchase and I regret not having tried it before. I was so fearful of having to pull out the giant wax bottle and so fearful of threading that I ended up revealing my stache to the world :( . BTW I have very thick, course body hair so if this can pull mines out, I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s it cant.</li>
            <li> Do not buy, does not work. The wax does not pick up hair and does not stay warm when rubbed between your hands.</li>
            <li> Great value and item just as described.</li>
            <li> This was just awful. The wax sticks to you and you cannot get it off. It&#x27;s sticky and you have to scrub to get all the sticky off. I ended up throwing it out. I would never buy this again</li>
            <li> These did not work. Did not remove hair as expected.</li>
            <li> These strips pick up about 70% of the hair.  They definitely get all the fine/invisible hairs that I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be able to remove.  However, they do leave visible hair even after a second attempt.  These remaining hairs are easily pluckable though, so I continue to use this product even though I&#x27;d be very open to suggestions for a better alternative.  I find that plucking the remaining hairs is less inconvenient than heating, stirring, and applying warm wax.</li>
            <li> Did not work, I&#x27;ve tried them 3 times now and maybe got a total of 5 hairs out. Save your money!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply easy to clean up.  worked very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these on facial hair and they work amazingly, the oil that comes with the kit removes any wax left behind. I also like how easy and convenient they are for traveling. They don&#x27;t work on underarm hair, bikini area or legs which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> The product works great - it&#x27;s very easy to use and very little (if any) wax residue.  However, most of the strips are for eyebrows and I just don&#x27;t need that many for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The tape or whatever the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; (more like glue) is stuck to is very flimsy and difficult to handle without getting it stuck to your hands, countertop, floor, etc. One of them landed face down on my floor and I am having a hard time getting the wax off. Trying to position the film accurately is nearly impossible because there is about a half an inch margin around the glue. I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> Perfect for at home eyebrow waxing!</li>
            <li> This is product is very good for eyebrow and upper lips. You can cut it or shape it according to your requirements.</li>
            <li> Buying this product was a waste of money. using it was a waste of time. It did not work. It was huge sticky itchy mess. If it wasn&#x27;t 8 days away from Christmas, I would have took it back to target where I got it from. I tried every single strip in the box. The result I pretty much have the same amount of hair that I had before using it. I tried it in several different places.</li>
            <li> Which is to say, if you are a dark-skinned male with coarse hair it probably will not work well for you and cause you mild to moderate annoyance trying.  It&#x27;s for finer hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Yeah, literally, I went back with a pair of tweezers and got more hair and less pain than I did when I used half a dozen strips of this crap. Horrible!!!!! What a waste of money. Not only did it get maybe 10% of the hairs, it was really hard to use and the wax stayed on my skin. I had okay results with Nads in the green jar and thought this would work. NOPE. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Ugh!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have gone to a salon for the past 10 years every other month for waxing.  I decided to use a gift card to purchase these wax strips.  They are wonderful!  Doesn&#x27;t hurt, doesn&#x27;t leave residue on you.  Gets most all the hair.  I&#x27;m going on 5 days now and still no regrowth.  Will definitely use again!</li>
            <li> A little hard to manage but it works.</li>
            <li> I can always count on this quality product from Sally Hansen!</li>
            <li> Really easy to use! I am very pleased with this. And it&#x27;s very affordable.  I will order again next time.</li>
            <li> I love pulling my unwanted hair out with these. They are so easy to use and most of the time it only takes one go to get out all the unwanted hair. Much faster then plucking and since it is all at once less painful. Just a 3-2-1 pull that sucker fast HAH :D</li>
            <li> Wax was uneven on strips and had barely any stick.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK. Literally not at all. Removes no hair and then leaves your skin sticky. I wish I could return this. Do not buy this! It is ineffective and will be a waste of your money and time.</li>
            <li> This product worked perfectly! I expected it to hurt a lot worse, but there was barely any pain at all. I planned to have this as more of an experiment than a actual routine, but now I am sure to stock up!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product. I had been getting Brazillians professionally done over the summer and once it grew out again, I decided to give this kit a go.  It worked sooo well, I was surprised!  The only thing is that I have to get another kit to finish the rest but for 5.60 a pop thats not a problem.  Beats $59.00 at the salon. Also, it was a bit sticky but the finishing oil included took it right off.</li>
            <li> I tried this product just once for my eyebrows... or shall I say eyebrow.  At first I was impressed that removing the strip wasn&#x27;t as painful as I had anticipated.  I put the lotion on and examined the results.  Within seconds I started to break out in hives that looked like blisters!  I had to scrub the area with soap and water and then keep an ice cold compress on my skin for it to go down.  After the hives finally went away, I examined the area- the hair was still there!  That was last night.  This morning I woke up and my skin was STILL red where I used the strip.  So this wax somehow miraculously removed my flesh, but didn&#x27;t take my hair with it.  I will NEVER use this again!</li>
            <li> Really easy to use, convenient, and no mess whatsoever.  BUT, the strips are VERY sticky, so handle with care.  I got overzealous and waxed my upper lip a few times in the same spot trying to remove a few stubborn hairs that I should have just tweezed and took off a little bit of skin which left a red splotch and very light scab for a day.  BUT, if you follow directions--these work like a dream--I use them on my 12-year-old daughter, just in the very middle of her brows to get rid of unibrow (at her request, not my suggestion!) And it&#x27;s over in seconds with no lasting effects.</li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to use and much more affordable than going to the salon every month or so. Be sure and read the directions.</li>
            <li> May need more wax per strips to use less. Overall, for a at home product, is great. It says it comes with an oil to use after the waxing is done. It does not. The box implies it does and the instructions say to use after waxing to remove extra wax left. Your only getting the strips and is two application per strip!</li>
            <li> This for me is ok for fine hairs...but it didn&#x27;t do as well for others.And I always had to repeat which isn&#x27;t a good idea as it irritates the skin and wears skin off and creating scabs.I like the microwave kind it catches more hairs.,but becareful as if u drop it on anything other then the area you put it, buy buy hair or eyebrow...</li>
            <li> Pros:  Not as messy as the last Sally Hanson invention.  I love the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Doesn&#x27;t actually remove much hair.  The wax is super thin and of the &#x27;sticky&#x27; variety.  It left even my longer hairs behind.  Not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish Sally  Hansen would go back to the more traditional was kits they did 10 years ago.  I&#x27;m sick of having to try all these new products (none of which I like) because I can&#x27;t find the old ones (that did work)!</li>
            <li> So these strips work amazing if you know what you&#x27;re doing. You have to pull them off QUICKLY in one swift movement AGAINST the direction of hair growth and NOT pull them up when you&#x27;re tearing them away- you have to keep them as low to the skin as possible while pulling them off. I usually cut them down to size, place them on my skin, rub them in the direction of hair growth to warm them up a little, and tear them off. They get all the small hairs as well as the thick ones. People who rated this poorly because it &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t work&amp;#34; did not know how to use them properly. The one downside is that it will occasionally cause minor bumps and breakouts. To avoid this, I make sure to clean off the wax residue and keep my skin clean and dry. This is especially important in the hours after waxing because the trauma of waxing exposes your pores to the outside environment and it&#x27;s easy for bacteria to get in. In other words, don&#x27;t go jogging or cake on make-up right after you wax. I would definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> This product works fairly well.  Didn&#x27;t get all the hair off but it did pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> This product ripped off my sisters skin and left scars. I personally would not refer this product to you. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Works well on face or anywhere else you need a mildly painful hair removal method.  You won&#x27;t regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Total waste of your money. This doesn&#x27;t reflect badly on the seller, they gave me what is pictured, it&#x27;s the product.</li>
            <li> great discovery. Will save me a lot of money. Works very well and quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice,was very  useful for my wife .</li>
            <li> Works really well on facial hair, but not on body hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t long enough, maybe I can&#x27;t read instructions as well as I thought. Either way. these just don&#x27;t work. Sticking with my epilator.</li>
            <li> These wax strips are very small, and barely get off any hair. You have to use at least three strips to get off a good amount of hair. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I ended up covered with sticky gunk that wouldn&#x27;t come off and the hair was still there!</li>
            <li> i bought this product for around my lips.  i have very fine to nonexistent lips hair and eyebrows.  it works wonderful as far as im concerned but i dont have that much hair to deal with.  that might be the difference in the comments between dark, dense hair and fine almost not there hair.  i dont use it on my brows because i basically have none.  i had them tatted on a few years ago and they faded off after about a year  :(  . back to drawing them on.  it was terribly painful and i swore i would never do it again!!</li>
            <li> Salons are too expensive, the wax that you melt in the microwave is too messy and hard to regulate temperature. I have some fine, blonde fuzz on my face and this works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> You have to get the temperature just right for these to work...and I seem to get it wrong more times than right! It&#x27;s no fun trying to scrub hot wax off your face...and then dealing with everyone seeing you red, blotchy, and still have the hair it was supposed to remove.</li>
            <li> works pretty great for the price, very little redness afterwards with the soothing oil</li>
            <li> These plastic strips are so easy to cut &amp; use. Cut to the shape you need, then warm up with your hands, peel apart &amp; rub onto your skin. They&#x27;re strong enough to get lots of hair and the blue oil will get off any residue left. I love the results!</li>
            <li> Really good quality. Works better than all other products that I have used over the years. Is effective on quite short hair and you really don&#x27;t want to grow your hair long on your face before you can pull it. That would defeat the purpose.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, it&#x27;s not as good as a professional wax and sometimes leaves some irritation. But the way it is shipped is irritating (see images.) If you don&#x27;t mind a smashed box then I guess it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> The idea of wax strips seems great. I have been using wax (the one I have to heat up) for a while now and thought maybe the strips would be very convenient. Well, the idea is great but the execution is poor. I have tried these strips several times and none of them did it give a good result. The strips pull out 2-3 hairs at most! What kind of wax strip is that?! Complete failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, this leaves a sticky residue when you take off the strip. Don&#x27;t buy this, it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Works for soft hair but not for strong hairs. Very easy to use and not messy. The oil used to remove stickiness works well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the first time last night at the store. I had planned on using it for my bikni/brazilian. I bought the kit that contains 44 stripes. I think I used half of the box, attempting to get all the hair off. Hairs came off here and there. For me, this wasn&#x27;t worth the money, as it hardly did the job. As the box says, &amp;#34;individual results may vary.&amp;#34; I ended up finishing with my epilator.</li>
            <li> I tried an epilator (which I bought on Amazon and then returned) for about $70.  This product worked sooo much better! I have gotten professionally waxed multiple times, but couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of paying close to $60 to do my lower legs.  I have thick, course hair that is very prickly, so I have been trying to find an alternative to shaving for quite some time.  When I shave, the hair grows back so quickly that I have stubble by the end of the day.  I can&#x27;t shave for another few days otherwise I get irritation bumps.  The pain that this product causes really is not a factor to me.  It was less intense than the epilator and seemed to grab much more hair.  I didn&#x27;t have to go over the same area twice with these wax strips.  Here are some tips that I thought would be helpful that aren&#x27;t included in the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spread baby powder on the area to be waxed.  Decreases the ouch factor and stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the same wax strip 2 or 3 times! I didn&#x27;t figure this out until I had used half of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could buy these things in bulk!</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking I could save some money waxing myself. I don&#x27;t know if the hair on my face is just stubborn but when I use the strips on my chin it hardly works. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the patience to pluck individual hairs out of my upper lip area with tweezers, and I&#x27;ve previously had poor results with a depilatory cream.  These wax strips were next on my list.  Unfortunately, they&#x27;re not working for me either.  I read the directions, then got to work.  When I ended up with a face full of wax, I read the directions a second time and ended up with wax coating my face a second time.  I then repeated twice on the other side of my upper lip.  However, all the hairs I had been trying to remove were still in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get strips in a couple of different shapes and sizes.  The strips are held between two clear layers of plastic (one layer has a Sally Hansen logo on it).  You are supposed to warm the strips between your hands, peel apart the two plastic sheets (which is fairly easy to do), and then apply to your face.  Basically, each layer of plastic retains some of the wax (kind of like peeling apart a peanut butter sandwich) so you end up having warmed two strips at a time.  You then put the strip on your face and rub in the direction of hair growth.  After that, you peel off in the opposite direction of hair growth.  Note: if you do this one half of the wax sandwich at a time, the second part has cooled by the time you get to use it.  A workaround would be to apply both halves of the sandwich to different areas before peeling either off, since you can&#x27;t re-warm once the wax strips are separated (or you&#x27;ll end up waxing your palms).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried every variation on the directions I could think of, and I still did not get results.  I thought maybe my hands weren&#x27;t warm enough to warm the wax properly, so I held a strip to my (warmer) torso instead.  I tried pulling the strips off immediately and I tried waiting a couple of minutes after applying the strips before peeling them off.  I tried fast motions for peeling the strips off and I tried slower motions.  I think there might be a couple of things wrong with the system, overall.  (1) The wax doesn&#x27;t adhere to the plastic very well, so it stays on your face instead of staying on the plastic and taking your hairs with it.  (2) Once the wax is warmed up, you&#x27;re placing it on your skin, which is also warm; it can&#x27;t cool back down and so it stays sort of melted, which means it can&#x27;t get a good grip on the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get this to work for yourself, that&#x27;s wonderful.  You should actually be able to cut some of the strips to specific shapes for doing eyebrows, for example, and the plastic is see-through so you can mostly avoid pressing against places you don&#x27;t want to (i.e., if you don&#x27;t want to completely remove your eyebrows!).  Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, the oil in the little bottle that comes with the wax strips was actually pretty good at removing all the wax left behind by the strips.  Further, neither the wax nor the removal oil irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this did not work for me and I will not buy it again.  However, if you have had success with similar products in the past, this one might be worth trying.overall.

            <li> Absolute garbage ... Quite literally removed ONE hair , and then left a ton of residue thats still there 2 days later</li>
            <li> Useless! This is a sticky mess and fails to remove the fine hairs above my lip and the stray bits of brow hair. It also hurts like hell when I try to remove hair from my bikini regions.</li>
            <li> When I discovered these wax strips, I was beyond excited. I trim the strips to small rectangles, warm, apply, and pull off. Presto! My eyebrows are amazing. I have not tried these on any other part of my body, so using them just for eyebrows make the strips last a long time. i use them once a week for 2 years, and I am just now running out.&lt;br /&gt; I usually have very sensitive skin, so other wax and tweezing even make my skin freak out. Not these strips! I love them. They usually get most of the hair, but I have no problem tweezing 1-3 stray hairs it missed. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> What a great Idea, but doesn&#x27;t always work that great. The wax never gets warm enough to really do the job</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying a waxing product with such a low price, but I was very happy with the results. I didn&#x27;t try to warm up the stripes with my hands though. I used my hairdryer. It removed all my hair and for some reason, it actually hurt less than getting waxed at the salon! I&#x27;ll be buying theses from now on.</li>
            <li> Works good on upper lip hair, not so much else where.</li>
            <li> I read the notes that came with this set and followed them carefully.  This product did not remove ANY hair and left a terrible wax paste on my face that was extremely difficult to remove.  The solvent masquerading as &amp;#34;finishing oil&amp;#34; burned the CRAP out of my skin.  I have a major event coming up this weekend and now have a large, painful red burn on my face.</li>
            <li> Other Sally Hansen products have better results than this one.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these out since I didn&#x27;t feel like making a trip to the salon and let me tell you I was just happy with the results. I purchased them at my local Walmart for $5. You can cut them into pieces and use the wax strips on different spots, they also don&#x27;t hurt or irritate my skin.  These strips are my new go to now. It&#x27;s been a week and my eyebrows  are barely starting to grow back out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on black peoples pubes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a while now and I love them!</li>
            <li> Wish they would go back to the green color; easy to see placement on skin and I thought also worked better than the clear stuff!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. These strips don&#x27;t take off any hair</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I waxed my upper lip and it was so easy and mess free!  Not sure how well it would do on the body because there&#x27;s  not that much wax on the plastic paper.  Definitely for lips and eyebrows!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even pick up any hair.  I have used this product for my upper lip and I have to go over a couple time just to remove the hair, don&#x27;t bother with this product hardly works and the oil they give you for when your done has made me break out with acne and the wax stick to your skin and is very difficult to get off.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. I have been getting professional waxes for years and decided to save some money and wax my lip at home. It takes several tries for the strip to pull out the hair, and each go-round irritates my skin a bit more. The finishing oil is really nice, and it&#x27;s convenient that, since the wax is already on the strip, there&#x27;s no mess. It is a much cheaper option, of course, than going to the salon. But I plan to buy another product next time that will get the job done more efficiently and won&#x27;t cause so much irritation.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions but i dont know why it still burns, i used the oil and stuff but it doesnt work. please be careful.</li>
            <li> Removes most unwanted hair off my face with little effort. Instructions can be followed easily and results are good. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> after reading all the reviews..i ordered got it and thought am I going to be the I hate it half? Or will I be able to figure it out and be the I love it half?....first time was miserable BUT second time I got. I will buy this again. The trick is to cut the wax smaller to shape and then use. Good luck</li>
            <li> Does not work! Does not stick! Do not waste your money and time. :(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove hair very well.</li>
            <li> It kind of works.....&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is fast and not-messy&lt;br /&gt;Double Sided, so this box goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a liquid solution that you apply after waxing, and that solution makes your skin so soft!&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;Barely works, so you have to do it over, and over again until all the hair is off that one spot.&lt;br /&gt;The wax strip is double sided, true. However the wax strip is in a plastic pouch and in order to heat up the wax you have to rub the plastic pouch in between your hands continuously for 3 mins (that is a lot rubbing...promise). So its hard to be consistent and not stop for a break, and once you finally do stop it barely takes off my hair. OMG I wish this product would work because I hate dealing with traditional wax (the one that you heat up in a microwave or crock-pot).&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 3 stars because of the easy clean up, and its easy to use (besides the rubbing in between your hands).&lt;br /&gt;Use with caution I guess....</li>
            <li> Crap, don&#x27;t use this product. It does not pull out hair, it only leaves a goopy mess.</li>
            <li> Love these easy to use wax strips. They are perfect for cleaning up and waxing eyebrows yourself at home, and the price is right! Typically, I am able to get enough weekly uses out of the box to last me 4-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the wax, it is very important to wipe the waxed area with the remover afterwards in order to avoid having sticky and irritated skin. I like to also wipe the area with a cotton ball soaked in Witch Hazel to remove all of the residue, otherwise I will notice small bumps appear within 24 hours of the waxing. As long as I thoroughly wash the area after waxing, I have no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using these strips for years, and will continue on! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Have been using it for long for facial areas like eyebrows, upper lips etc. Works great, saves money and also can be cut to suit needs.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a way to make your own sizes or more smaller sizes for eyebrow areas.  But, the product worked well and was easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> I hate those waxing strips I used it to wax between my eyebrows and it removed the skin in that area and it bled a lot I don&#x27;t know it I used it the wrong way but I know for sure I&#x27;m not going to purchase them again</li>
            <li> Does not work; followed all is instructions, but all it did was pull at my skin when I took it off as instructed, and it did not take off any hairs :/ Try it if you want anyways.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the glowing reviews on this product. It is painful and unpleasant to use, and did not remove the few pesky hairs I bought the kit for. When I saw the user had to determine the &#x27;direction&#x27; of hair growth, I couldn&#x27;t believe how complicated wax strips could be! I will never purchase this again...especially when I saw it could cause damage to the skin.</li>
            <li> If I could give this less stars I would! I have used this product in the past, with minimum issues. So I noticed I had some fuzz on the cheeks of my face and decided to use the longer strips. It removed the hair, without an issue. Then a day or so later. I look in the mirror and i have this awful red rash. I have never had this reaction before. I think I would have rather had the minor fuzz,  than this. :(</li>
            <li> I used it first for my lip. The first time my skin got really irritated/dry but the second time I used it it was okay and it removed most hairs. I tried it for my bikini line and although it does remove some hairs - and thus makes it relatively painful it by far does not remove everything and I will now go and shave the old fashioned way... in other words if you need it for fine hairs on your face it&#x27;s okay but for everything else (I tried for legs and under arms too) it does not work...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Sally Hansen for years and have found that the majority of their products are high quality and effective. However, this wax strip set is garbage! I typically use Nair or Veet wax strips, but found these for a bargain and couldn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to get them instead of one of my regular brands. What a terrible disappointment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These DO NOT remove hair at all. I have been waxing my brows for years now and have never experienced such a waste of time and money in my entire years of waxing. Out of all of the stray hairs on my brows, only THREE were removed with these strips. When I thought I may have skipped a step in the instruction manual, I read it again and attempted to wax the other brow with no success. I even went as far as trying once again and, as anticipated, the hairs would not budge. The only thing this product managed to do was irritate my skin and leave me with red blotches above the eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not working well at all. the plastic cover is a failure, won&#x27;t make the wax dry a little so it sticks more on the hair, instead, the wax sticks on your skin making everything a mess while the hair won&#x27;t go. It&#x27;s not even cheaper than the cloth-covered strip. I regret so much that i buy the product.</li>
            <li> Really handy home kit. Use it all the time and recommend</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d ever bought a waxing kit. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, but not really &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m sure there are better kits out there.&lt;br /&gt;I still have to do some plucking afterwards because it does leave a few hairs behind, but that might have a bit to do with the fact that I have dark hair, so it&#x27;s a bit tougher. Although the box says you can use it for more than just your face, it doesn&#x27;t really work anywhere but your face.&lt;br /&gt;Also, since there are two strips connected to each other, once you pull the strips apart, you have to use both. You can&#x27;t just use one and save the other for later. It&#x27;s not a huge problem, but definitely not the best idea to put them together.&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, these don&#x27;t irritate my skin (besides the obvious redness) and the wax is easy to get off.&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t the best, but they&#x27;re decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Received this and attempted to use it, does not warm up or remove the unwanted hair.. Just leaves the &amp;#34;wax&amp;#34; stuck to you and a pain to get off. Definitely not worth your money or hassle.</li>
            <li> worthless and a waste of money</li>
            <li> These are OK..just don&#x27;t work as well as I was hoping for...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great price</li>
            <li> This product is a good value, but you need to make sure you allow the hair to gro for two to three weeks before using the waxing strips. They come in three sizez and heat up when rubbed between your palms. All in all a good product for home waxing needs.</li>
            <li> Just rip it off with these bad boys! Sorry, but almost every woman has facial hair. If your girlfriend says she doesn&#x27;t- then she is either 13 or lying. These take care of the job quite well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. All it did was irritate my skin and leave a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my eyebrows, which i have very little of, but wanted to clean up underneath the brow...it works very well but be careful...i angled it wrong and it took off 1/2 of my eyebrow :(  next time i&#x27;ll cut the strip in 1/2 lengthwise for a better fit as it was too wide...hope eyebrow hair grows back quickly, thank goodness for eyebrow pencils!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to try this product for those pesky chin hairs but now I&#x27;m glad I did.  Press the hand-warmed wax pieces firmly downward then RIP upward and presto quicko you&#x27;re smooth and it does stay that way for quite awhile.  A good product for facial use for sure.</li>
            <li> This product does not always get all of the hair off in the area it is put and needs to be used repeatedly in one spot. For me, this product worked about half as well as it should have but can suffice if you have a couple hairs under your brow you want gone.</li>
            <li> I have used Sally Hansen waxing products for about 10 years now and have also had profession waxing done. I usually get a little red post wax that lasts for maybe 10 minutes and usually have great results that last a long time. I usually buy the wax with the separate strips but thought \\&quot;oh how nice! a mess free solution\\&quot;. I felt comfortable using this because I have used many different Sally Hansen products over the years without any adverse effects. However, something in these strips has irritated my face like nothing else ever had. I am 18 hours post wax and it is still red as fire and so sensitive. I have tried aloe, gentle face lotion for sensitive skin, and neosporin. The neosporin has been the only thing to start calming down the redness and taking away the million bee sting feeling. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin to begin with but something in this strip is unlike anything I have come across. To make matters worse, I am scheduled to take pictures this evening. I would have rather had the unwanted hair!</li>
            <li> Does not remove all the hair even done multiple times in one spot! which you should not do unless you want to irritate your face and end up with reddening and scab! The warnings do not appear clearly on the box or instructions booklet, they come after the instructions. It says make the area warm and then says later don&#x27;t take a hot bath first... Maybe that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work but the warning should have been made clearer.</li>
            <li> OMG I just used these for the first time, and wow these work very well! I have super thick dark hair (some of the perks of being MIddle Eastern...) and these strips took all the hairs off! I had to cut the eyebrow strips to make them thinner to more precisely wax my eyebrows and it totally did the trick. Also removed like 99% of hair off my upper lip (better than the hot wax i get to use at my mom&#x27;s place!) Also, really easy to heat up; it literally only took like 45 seconds of rubbing at most to get it to the temp it needed to be at! The oil also works really well and doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling oily like baby oil does! I totally recommend these they are super awesome!</li>
            <li> Terrible! Absolutely does not do the job.</li>
            <li> I really did like it! No hassle. Clean. Fast. The lotion/oil attached is also very handy and just works well.</li>
            <li> This is just about useless. It is messy, and only removes the finest of hairs, as opposed to the advertised use for the whole body.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it took off a ton of skin from my face...i used it on the sides of my face and now ive got burns on my skin...called the company and they were not helpful at all...buyer beware!!</li>
            <li> This product worked great on my bikini line and on my knees. It did not, however, work on the fine hair on my toes. (I&#x27;ve never used it on my face)&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars since the package says doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s for toes. :)&lt;br /&gt;I would definately use it again for a bikini wax. No mess, easy use, clean results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips on my eyebrows for several years, and they&#x27;ve always worked perfectly. However, I tried them on my bikini line, and they removed very little hair. They aren&#x27;t as painful as others, and the finishing oil is amazing! I would recommend these for eyebrows but will search elsewhere for a good bikini wax.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It works great for eyebrows and any facial hair. I have extremely fine facial hair and the wax gets every last hair! I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I like it but it seems to make me break out when I use it on my face. But some people have different reactions to stuff. Other then that it works really well and I love that I don&#x27;t have to heat up wax.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this several times to do my eyebrows and my upper lip.  (Do girls call it a mustache? lol)  Anyway these strips work great!  They have always done a great job for me. I trim them to the shape I want my brows to look and them apply.  Rub them to get the wax adhered really well and pull.  (Oh and yell OW!)  I have never tried them anywhere else, though.</li>
            <li> For the legs it is a waste of money unless you just want torture. 1st some of the strips are hard to find the separating point. 2nd it hurts like Hell fire which would be worth it if it actually worked but 3rd, at most no matter how many times I tried, it rips out at most 20% of the hairs and leaves the rest to laugh at you.</li>
            <li> Always been a Sally Hansen fan...It comes in travel size packaging, so you can take it on the go and it&#x27;s easily concealable if your a touch on the modest side, (as I am). I&#x27;ve used this product on my eyebrows, upper lip and forearems. Directions are easy to understand and usally only have to do one area Once and works great!.. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ooohhh they are painful m not going to use it ever.</li>
            <li> These things are my fave.  NOT for my lady-stache or down under...but perfect for my brows!</li>
            <li> very difficult to use</li>
            <li> I hate this product. I&#x27;ve used sally Hansen wax in the past but this sucks. Pain free- definitely not.  Didn&#x27;t remove even 20% of hair.</li>
            <li> Usually a good product, but this latest batch didn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li> I love this hair remover wax strips....cleans up areas between visits to the beauty parlor....I take meds that make my hair grow...the meds are for my kidney but the side effect from it is hair growth...fine on my head but not on the face....ugh!!!  This does exactly what it says it will do...I turn on my hot water faucet in the bathroom and when the metal spout warms up, I lay the strip I need on the faucet and warm it...it warms better and faster than in the hand method....the key to the strips also is rubbing them on area a bit more - a bit longer to make sure it adheres to your face....pull the opposite way your hair grows....I like.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best inexpensive nail file.. I previous purchased 2 and they were 2 thumbs down compared to this one. Packaging was nice and neat, everything was there, received quickly, and another great deal was the bits fit perfectly in the other files I had to take the file a loose and bend or squeeze the bit holder to make a tight fit.. this is a good file,,, I recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> Bad product. I get lots of pimples after using it and the wax/glue won&#x27;t wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair. Works great for me on the brows and lip - small strips - easy to handle and travel with.</li>
            <li> Ive been waxing my own eyebrows for about 10 years and tried many different products. This is by far the best. Its great cause there is no mess involved. Just cut the strips to fit the area you are waxing, rub between your hands for about 5-10 seconds, and then apply and remove. SO EASY and no chance of burns or even irritation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many waxes and other methods of obliterating my mustache: this is the most convenient and works the best for me, so long as I follow the directions to the letter.</li>
            <li> This product seemed like a great buy at first, but even when I followed the directions carefully and pulled off the paper in the correct direction, it ripped off my skin, and not my hair!  Now my face has been hurting for a week.  Save yourself some pain and just don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all. It was just a sticky mess. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It worked very well for me except for the tiny hair. I didn&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s another one for the underarm so basically I bought the wrong one but it&#x27;s been great for me! I&#x27;m buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few wax strip kits, and this is the worst product ever! I followed the directions for each strip for each body part and the strips had no effect whatsoever. There was practically NO hair removal. I even tried heating the darned strips for 30 seconds before application - only then did a small amount of hair come off on any body part! Now, I&#x27;m not hairy Hannah or anything, but these strips wouldn&#x27;t help even if I had one strand (trust me, I tried on one strand with no success!) Run, don&#x27;t walk away from considering this option; it&#x27;s a waste of money. Use Veet or Parissa; both are much better.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use for waxing my mustache, or whatever I have of one.  Now, this wax is different from other pre-waxed strips I&#x27;ve seen before.  These have a clear wax of a &amp;#34;filmy&amp;#34; consistency, rather than a green soft wax I&#x27;ve seen on my Nair and Nad&#x27;s strips.  The latter work fine for waxing the legs as long as the hairs are long enough, but these Sally Hansen strips absolutely do not work on the body (they make some for the body that are just like these, only bigger), and are just OK for the much finer hair on the face.  It does get my mustache hairs out, but of course, it leaves the skin red until the next morning or so.  I&#x27;ve also tried using it on my brows, and it does not seem to take out the hairs very easily at all, except perhaps the peach fuzz around the brows.  Once or twice I&#x27;ve waxed whatever sideburns I have (also peach fuzz), and this wax left me broken out in those areas only!  Now, I no longer wax the sides of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use these on my upper lip until I run out, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Sally&#x27;s strips are a total rip off... of my time and money but not my leg and bikini hair (I tried both products). Don&#x27;t even bother with these strips, they are just glorified fly paper. I shouldn&#x27;t have to grow my leg and bikini-line hair out to gorilla length for an at-home waxing product to work as advertized. Try again Sally&#x27;s. If it&#x27;s any consolation, the competition isn&#x27;t doing much better either.</li>
            <li> didnt take off any hair at all,left a sticky film that was horrible to get off,wouldn&#x27;t recomend this product to anyone.dont buy its a huge waste of money</li>
            <li> Have been using this for several years. Works awesome.</li>
            <li> Great for removing my girl-stach lol.</li>
            <li> they kinda work. Not recommended for bikini use, doesn&#x27;t get almost any hair, for face only really.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product years ago because when I would get my eyebrows professionally done, they always made them too thin. Simply rubbing the strips between your hands does not get the wax warm enough. I found that holding the strip against the light bulb on my vanity warmed it nicely. (low wattage and with the strips un-separated obviously lol) I&#x27;ve also used my hair dryer to warm it. Also, be sure to trim the strips before you warm them to get a nice smooth edge. They work great on facial hair, I have tried it on my bikini area as well with poor results. I could only stomach that for 1 try, so now that I&#x27;m more comfortable with them I could probably get better results. I&#x27;ve tried other at home wax kits, this is definitely the easiest.&lt;br /&gt;For people having problems with the wax sticking to their face make sure you warm the strips enough. Pull the skin tight after the strip is applied and hold it as you remove the strip. Pull fast, don&#x27;t hesitate.&lt;br /&gt;The oil included is nice for soothing and removing residue.</li>
            <li> My one eyebrow that I attempted is still burning,  and the sad thing is none of the hair even came off but the wax stayed on my skin and was hell to get off,  even with the oil that comes with it.  I followed the directions carefully,  warming th strips with my hand to no avail.  Save your money.  Wish I would have spent it going to the salon getting them professionally done.</li>
            <li> Good product for use wherever you want, recommend, great price for what you get.  I used it on my face for fine hair and it did the job perfectly without irritating my skin.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use these strips for my eyebrows, and occasionally my upper lip. They work really well for pulling out little hairs, but I have a few tips. First, cut the strips with scissors to fit your eyebrows/whatever you want to wax. Now here&#x27;s what I do differently: I use an old hair straightener (use an old one that you never use, you&#x27;re most likely going to get wax on it!), put it on its lowest setting, and use that to heat the wax. It&#x27;s very convenient that there are two strips stuck together, so you can get symmetry when waxing your face. The wax works MUCH better when it&#x27;s been warmed this way rather than rubbing the strip between your hands. Then you just stick them on, press into them a little, wait for the wax to cool a little, and pull! Then you use the oil that comes with the kit to reduce redness and get rid of any wax residue. Then you just pluck out any hair that&#x27;s left over (there&#x27;s going to be some, I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s usually the thicker, darker hair that doesn&#x27;t come off with the wax). Overall, very good product, would recommend!</li>
            <li> Used it once. Loved it!... until the next morning when I woke up to my entire face full of bumps.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy - not as good as a salon wax, but works great for the time in between visits to tidy up the upper lip and eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and very affordable. It makes waxing a breeze without all the hassle of heating the wax, all the prepping and all the pain considered. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product</li>
            <li> one of my fave Sally Henson products..It needs a getting used to but hey, it&#x27;s a ready made wax strip, of course it will hurt..</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used them yet but it was what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite way to get rid of unwanted hair at home. Much better and easier to use than an at home wax kit.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product doesn&#x27;t do the brand justice. No matter how hard I try, this product only removes one or two hairs per use; that&#x27;s ridiculous and it hurts to have to keep waxing the same spot again and again with little results!</li>
            <li> My wife used these while deployed. She was not happy with them. I did not care to question her on the specifics.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t all what it&#x27;s cracked up to be. Tried waxing eyebrows and it barely took anything off and it leaves the wax on your face. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years! It&#x27;s easy to apply and to take off! Simpley warm the wax by rubbing it between hands, cut the ready to use double sided wax, paste it on where you want the hair gone and rip it off the opposite direction of hair growth, use provided oil to remove the wax and bam done. I have THICK coarse hair and it works great. Eye brows, bikini, arm pits, you name it-it yanks it.</li>
            <li> It does the Job, is good to try for first time and get an idea of what it is to use wax to remove hair, is very strong to be a strip... Its better if you do it with a proffesional... I will not buy this product again because I already got what I want it from it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used it and honestly I do not like it I have bumps and red marks on my face from using the wax strips and I used the finishing oil to sooth it out but it made my face itchy and inflamed and I do not have any allergies towards anything and its been nearly 20 mins since I used the strips</li>
            <li> Within the last few years they&#x27;ve changed their formula and they don&#x27;t work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this kit more than 10 years ago after an aesthetician at a spa used these on me. They worked great for more than a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a year or so ago I picked up a box and the strips didn&#x27;t work. I thought I had just gotten a bad box. But since then I&#x27;ve purchased two other boxes with the same results. They don&#x27;t work. Save your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> When I bought this kit I was very excited, however I ended up in disappointment. The pain factor was not that bad at all, but the strips barely pulled off any of my hair, and the hair it did manage to take off (which again was barely any) it grew back in a week. Used on bikini area.</li>
            <li> I followed all the directions. I even tried to warm up my hands first before trying to warm the wax strip in my hands. The hairs I was trying to remove on upper lip and chin were longer, so there was something to grab onto. I put the wax strips on and smoothed it. Let it sit. Then I tried to pull it off per directions. I was left with a waxy mess on my face. Not one hair came off. The wax didn&#x27;t come off either. After scrubbing my face with soap &amp; hot water, then cleanser (yes, even cleanser), then finally rubbing alcohol and more hot water and soap I finally got waxy stuff off.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was so tired of plucking my eyebrows (dark brown) and shaving my bikini line and face and I was severely disappointed. I followed the directions perfectly to a T and it didn&#x27;t remove any dark hair, only the very light, thin hair in all of these areas. I don&#x27;t have much dark hair on my face but I noticed a dark hair on my upper lip so I thought surely it would be ripped out like all the barely there hairs on the other side. NO. SUCH. LUCK. It ripped out all the barely theres but the dark hair was still there mocking me. I tried it twice more just to see if it would get that hair out and it didn&#x27;t. Also the wax residue is hard to remove. They give you an oil to use to get it off but it&#x27;s basically smelly water that doesn&#x27;t help at all, I was still very sticky. I would recommend this for someone who is blond or naturally doesn&#x27;t have much body hair at all because that seems to be all it can handle.</li>
            <li> Not as good as a salon job of course, but good in a pinch</li>
            <li> These are the least painful waxing strips that I have ever used! I have used multiple different brands but nothing compares to the Sally Hansens wax strip kit!!! I used them for my back and I am not joking when I say zero pain at all. These things are every women&#x27;s dream!</li>
            <li> First time using them &amp; waxing ... Maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t long enough... Didn&#x27;t seem to work for me !!! Gonna give it another try ... It was delivered fast</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and if I did not wax, I have dark, medium textured hair on my upper lip. I have been using this product for years and the only side effect I have experienced is occasional redness and of course discomfort at the moment I yank the wax strip off. The oil helps immensely to soothe the skin and get all the sticky stuff off. I apply the oil with a cotton swab and then finish with a tissue.  I wax my upper lip only, and the box will last me for several months. I do have to use this weekly in order to keep my perimenopausal mustache under control. I can see on the strips that the hairs are being pulled out by the roots, but I think the next crop of hair then comes in -- so I do have to use it much more often than every 8 weeks to keep my upper lip under control. The hair that grows in is soft, not stubbly feeling. My biggest tip for using this product is to blast the strip with your blow-drier for a few seconds to get it really warm (my hands tend to be very cold and won&#x27;t warm the strips) and then use it immediately. Bigger pieces can be cut to the size you need BEFORE you warm them. My routine is to take a shower and then do the waxing since my face and hands are completely oil-free after the shower. It takes less than 5 minutes, even though I usually miss a few hairs and have to tweeze them to finish the job. So much more convenient and inexpensive than going to the salon each week! And it is totally private. Highly recommended. Just be sure to have completely clean and dry skin and to warm the strips very well, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> this stuff does not work well at all and also there are not enough strips included. honestly embarrassed for everyone involved in the production and marketing of these useless pieces of actual garbage</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sally Hansen wax strips for years and they WERE great.  The worst I could say about them was I sometimes struggled to separate the strips, but, boy, did they work.&lt;br /&gt;The new Sally Hansen wax strips are TERRIBLE!!! No matter how long I rub to warm them, they do not work.  The wax on the strips seems dried up.  I was initially excited to see the new design with the white paper framing the waxy portion of strip.  It made it easier to separate the 2 sides and less likely I&#x27;d get wax on my fingers.  BUT THE NEW STRIPS DO NOT WORK.  I&#x27;ve even used a hair blower to warm them, and they still don&#x27;t work. I just opened a new kit and was able to remove just 1 hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please improve the wax.  Now I&#x27;ll have to spend time and money either at a salon or trying other products.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product for the first time. I had bought it to get rid of problem hairs on my bikini line that my razor would not pick up. The first time I tried it it left behind a sticky residue and did not pick up any of the hairs. The second attempt (after I re-read the instructions) was even worse. The second attempt only lifted some of the hair and left half of it behind. Now I have been waxed before and I am aware that there is slight pain involved but I have never felt this much pain before when waxing. Not only did it leave half the hair behind in some spots but it completely stripped the skin in others. Now I have patches of hair mixed with patches of raw skin. I have applied oil, as well as bikini zone but theres not much else I can do.  I think from now on I will stick to my razor or going to see a professional.</li>
            <li> My wife Had a bad experience with this product... She used it just like the directions said and when she did her eye brows, not only did it take her hair but it took a layer of skin!!...I hope it doesn&#x27;t leave my poor wife a scare!...I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product....</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using it on the face. I had irritated skin for almost a week. And first two days treated areas were very red and burning.</li>
            <li> I have never waxed my eyebrows at home but this was so easy, painless and did a great job. Highly recommend and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Overall good product for doing your own eyebrows and lip. Could be better, but helps me to save a lot of money!</li>
            <li> This sucks. Just leaves glue residue behind</li>
            <li> Idk why people are bashing this great product. It took care of my upper lip hair, and it didn&#x27;t even hurt at all! Love this!</li>
            <li> For some reason Sally Hansen has changed this product to one that you rub together but doesn&#x27;t have near the sticky power as these.  I&#x27;ve looked al over for these as this kind works so much better.  I&#x27;ve stocked up on these in case I can never find this particular kind again.</li>
            <li> Me and my bright ideas. So it&#x27;s the wee hours of Easter morning and I have the Vail idea I should look my best. Off to the bathroom I go, locating the box of wax strips! I read the directions set my products out and begin the process of rubbing the eyebrow strip between my hands. After a few seconds I pull the plastic apart and ever so carefully place the wax against the offending hair. I smooth it on and try to judge my placement. It takes me a minute or so to be sure I have it in the proper placement and then with a firm pull, against the grain, I visously rip out my eyebrow. I first look at the strip and see a good deal of hair....TO MUCH HAIR. I look in the mirror and discover half my eyebrow missing. And My eyelid is pink and swollen and holy hell it burns. I quickly use the finishing oil in hopes of removing the sticky from my eyelid and calming to the burning.  NEVER AGAIN! I am missing half my eyebrow and I am now extremely sad.</li>
            <li> BOTTOM LINE: this product does exactly what it promises and does it well when used as described!  I have always been satisfied using Sally Hansen Wax Strips (the pre-\\&quot;waxed\\&quot; kind) on my face, legs and bikini area. I&#x27;ve bought dozens of boxes for legs over the past 20 years and occasionally the strips for FaceBrowsBikini and was never disappointed with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the product formulation had changed was to blame for my current issue: the right side of my face is incredibly itchy and looks like I have about two dozen large mosquito bites. I could tell something was wrong almost immediately and stopped, so I only did the one side.  I&#x27;ve used this product much more than a few times over the past 20 years without a hitch. I&#x27;ve always loved the way my skin felt after the removal of the lovely \\&quot;down\\&quot; that can come with menopause. TMI, sure, but someone&#x27;s gotta enlighten others  :D  I&#x27;ve been taking Benadryl to try and counteract the reaction, but it&#x27;s still feeling and looking horrible  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: August 8, 2013: it appears that my hormones have caused my skin to now be sensitive to hair removal of any kind on my face. After the issues I stated below using the Sally Hansen Hair Remover Wax Strip for Face, I then used the Braun epilator on the left side of my face. The very same reaction appeared to my skin and just on that side!  So, it appears that I no longer have the tough, can-take-anything skin of my yoot. :/  Ripping hair out by it&#x27;s roots leaves a vulnerable pore no matter where on your body, but it&#x27;s not just hair removal by those two mechanisms. I also had the SAME REACTION after shaving my bikini area last week.  Don&#x27;t blame the product. I know it&#x27;s the first thing we think to do because of a successful history of usage, but also look to your own body and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to do a small test area first. Follow the instructions of the product and cleanliness is key here.&lt;br /&gt;Wait a few hours andsee how your skin reacts. Luckily, my reaction was nearly immediate, but often an allergic reaction can take hours to appear.  I&#x27;m 56, and as I said below, I&#x27;ve used hair removers both SHHRWSK for Face/Bikini for many, many years and an epilator - both without one iota of adverse reaction. Something happened (hormones no doubt) that has now caused me to be highly reactive to some skincare products I&#x27;ve been testing, too.  :(</li>
            <li> Did not work very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. I use them on my eyebrows, upper lip, and sometimes even under my chin or on my jaw if needed. If you don&#x27;t cut them before peeling apart you will waste them. They go much farther if you cut them. These wouldn&#x27;t work on course hair, like underarms or bikini lines, but for facial hair they&#x27;ve always done the trick. Sometimes it takes a couple tries for my lip but eyebrows are always done with one try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a few years and they work well for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my eyebrows and sensitive areas.  Difficult to remove remaining hair after initial strip applied without using several other strips, and this becomes uncomfortable quickly. It works well for eyebrows, but I would not use again for other areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips on my face (chin, upper lip), and it works great!  Only problem I&#x27;ve had is that, occasionally, it doesn&#x27;t work on very fine hair(s) on my chin.  But that is rare.  So much more convenient (and money saving) than going to a salon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also immediate and portable.  Usually I notice a problem at home in the evening, so I can take care of it right away.  Once I took a strip to work with me - and used it in the ladies&#x27; room at work!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, does what I expected. Will be a regular for me.</li>
            <li> I am no stranger to waxing my eyebrows but thought I would try doing it at home instead of going to the salon to save some money.  I picked these up at Target and I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.  Followed the instructions, and while the strips do remove the fine (near invisible) hairs on my eyebrows, they do not remove the thick ones which is the whole point of waxing your eyebrows.  Thought I did it wrong and tried it again with the same results. I am going to try and find another at home waxing kit, which will hopefully work better than this one.</li>
