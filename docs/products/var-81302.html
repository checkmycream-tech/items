            <li>The brush is perfect for the job, and gives a good control as you work, so you don&#x27;t come out looking like Grouco Marx!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried applying the powder before the wax and that looks great as well.</li>
            <li>Great product and price.</li>
            <li>I was happy with Smashbox and vowed never to stray.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>( I found an angled brush at Ulta that works great)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the Laura Gellar brow pens to be great, but pricey.</li>
            <li>Great price too</li>
            <li>color great.</li>
            <li>It stays on great with primer.</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>lol....</li>
            <li>Great product for thinning, lightening brows.  </li>
            <li>This works great for the price.</li>
            <li>the powder is great for the begining of the brow or if you just want a suttle fill in.</li>
            <li>This is honestly the best brow kit.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>but the product is very nice.</li>
            <li>but it is amazing!</li>
            <li>Goes on good but the wear time isn&#x27;t so great.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply!</li>
            <li>amazing, dont sweat though lol</li>
            <li>But it is not as good as Benefit brand.</li>
            <li>But good for price.</li>
            <li>that is a good tone.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff.</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>Seems good for the price and product seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>, it seems good quality.</li>
            <li>Good purchase</li>
            <li>Get yourself a couple of good brushes.  </li>
            <li>It is inexpensive and fundamental to a good face.</li>
            <li>gives my brows good definition and color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good buy</li>
            <li>and then the definition of your brows won&#x27;t look as good.  </li>
            <li>A really good brow kit for the price.</li>
            <li>its the perfect shade of cool brown.</li>
            <li>Great product for doing my eyebrows real quick.</li>
            <li>Love this product, works great</li>
            <li>Works a lot better than powder, great staying power.  </li>
            <li>the gel portion of the kit is great for a more bolder look.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fully satisfied by it! ^^</li>
            <li>TIP: Check out the elf site before buying on Amazon, they have a lot of products on sale most of the time!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>to order another one for me since she wouldn&#x27;t let go of it!&lt;br /&gt;Two pleased sisters!</li>
            <li>I used this eyebrow kit - applying the wax first, then the powder - and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It really is outstanding !</li>
            <li>but this one takes the top spot!</li>
            <li>WAY better than eyebrow pencils!</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love using this product!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Color payoff is excellent and I use it in conjunction with a brow pencil to get a more exact line!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>my eyebrows look amazing.</li>
            <li>I did try the product out and it was creamy and a great texture, ran on smooth</li>
            <li>THIS however is the absolute best!</li>
            <li>so I use my own brow brush.</li>
            <li>Love the product, its just at good as Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow</li>
            <li>For such a great price this product is awesome.</li>
            <li>The powder is nice though.</li>
            <li>The brush it comes with is nice too.</li>
            <li>it does look nice.  </li>
            <li>This product fills them in nicely.</li>
            <li>Settles on nicely</li>
            <li>it is so nice too.</li>
            <li>The colors were perfect for my eyebrows and it really lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Although the powder is much lighter than the wax it works great!</li>
            <li>My brows look great now, very good purchase and will definitely buy again when the time comes</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s probably the BEST kit you can find especially for the good price, lasts all day</li>
            <li>This is the best eyebrow kit I&#x27;ve owned by far!</li>
            <li>I use a nicer, stiffer brush than the included flimsy brush - but love, love this product - have purchased it twice now!</li>
            <li>The compact came in good shape and the product worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Nice for gray eyebrows, now my eyebrows show up :)</li>
            <li>The gel is great for light shading, the powder is great for finishing and they stay on really well, even with oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin, light brown hair and medium/dark brown brows</li>
            <li>very pleased with this product (and even more pleased with the price tag)</li>
            <li>I STRONGLY recommend for people to buy it for their eyebrows!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE !</li>
            <li>love love love!</li>
            <li>Plan to use your own brushes and you&#x27;ll be more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference and it made my face and eyebrows look amazing.</li>
            <li>I recommend this over any eyebrow pencil, since pencils tend to look more unnatural (unless you like the look of more unnatural/drawn on brows).</li>
            <li>But this product makes what I have look better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used much better powder that don&#x27;t make you look like a freak.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many in between and thrown them out after a couple uses.</li>
            <li>it was so much better</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC BUY!</li>
            <li>Yeah eyeshadow not even for eyebrows powder was better then</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>My eyebrow never look better</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have learned and I love it.</li>
            <li>This looks cute on me</li>
            <li>have gotten so many complements on my eyebrows since I have started using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li>have tried so many brow products already</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I watched reviews and demos on youtube and everyone seemed to love it.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m still looking for a better product.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes them look SO much better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Extremely happy and received it fast.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Even better.</li>
            <li>Love e.l.f.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have tried too many brow products to list here.  </li>
            <li>I have had sparse brows for years and this is the most natural-looking product I have used.  </li>
            <li>I sure didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow kit.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a wax-based product and a powder.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>I use this for my eyebrows every day and have had many refills.</li>
            <li>I love e.l.f. products.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite brow products.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, starting there gives me a steadier application :) It matches my brows perfectly, it lasts FOREVER (like 6 months!), and it doesn&#x27;t melt off!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>do find you have to use more product than you think.</li>
            <li>Love the simplicity of brow powder and tinted brow wax in one case.</li>
            <li>honestly better than my 32$ eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>I love legs products and their prices.</li>
            <li>Went to drug store and got something way better.</li>
            <li>Got it with free 2-day shipping!</li>
            <li>My sister enjoyed this product however.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>You have to do a good blend of the two colors to get it right.</li>
            <li>Very good product, goes on easy and evenly, looks very natural and adds texture to the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This is actually easier for me, and hold up so much better!!!</li>
            <li>High recommend this product! !!!!</li>
            <li>Was very happy with this, stays on well - I am in a very humid hot climate</li>
            <li>it was easy to shape my brows and the gel kept them in place and the powder filled them in nicely....</li>
            <li>I loved it at first...</li>
            <li>Perfect color the gel doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I want it too</li>
            <li>I always thought I had pretty good brows until I started filling them</li>
            <li>Quality is pretty good for the cost.</li>
            <li>This eyebrow kit stays on better than the pencils or felt pens, and even though it lasts all day it can be removed easily with water and a dab of soap.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and cheap!</li>
            <li>Goes on great and looks natural!</li>
            <li>The colors match perfectly and make my eyebrows look natural and sculpted just right.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price I love Elf</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look great and natural.</li>
            <li>It works like a charm for something so cheap :-)</li>
            <li>This eyebrow kit was ok, just too light for me.</li>
            <li>Too waxy,didn&#x27;t stay put,rubs off too easily</li>
            <li>The product takes some fiddling, I use a bit of both wax colors, it can easily get to looking like you took a Crayola to yourself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and convenient to carry in a makeup bag when traveling.</li>
            <li>This stuff is easy to use and you get the hang of it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I suggest using a full size dual brush for better results.</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it is not extremely useful in creating the perfect eyebrow.</li>
            <li>this is the best eyebrow kit for dark brown brows.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, stays on and looks fabulous and polished.</li>
            <li>The color is fine, but the brush isn&#x27;t even angled so I don&#x27;t even use the product.</li>
            <li>I would be fine with this</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, but the free, included brush/applicator is commiserate with being &amp;#34;free.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product as compared to what I was using, this is very inexpensive and very useful.</li>
            <li>Goes on very easily, allows you to shape your brow exactly as you wish.  </li>
            <li>HUGE TIP:</li>
            <li>and I thought I would give it a try on my own but didn&#x27;t want to invest as much money.  </li>
            <li>It was a great last minute add on choice for me!</li>
            <li>but it makes me wonder what kinda of ingredients the company uses that allows them to sell it for so cheap....</li>
            <li>I have medium/dark brown hair and hoped that the colors in this kit would not be too light.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great find for me.</li>
            <li>ENJOY</li>
            <li>but overall great purchase.</li>
            <li>I used my elf angled brush (not the one in the kit, but the separate $3 one because it&#x27;s longer and makes it easier to apply imo) and just lightly dabbed it once in the powder and began to apply to my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I like the light brown</li>
            <li>As someone else here noted, buying light and medium works for me.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it goes on and makes a smooth arch.</li>
            <li>The color was too light.</li>
            <li>I have light to medium brown hair, and I always get the medium shade.</li>
            <li>I find this applies rather light.</li>
            <li>my hair is mostly light brown but a bit darker on the ends</li>
            <li>I will be ordering the light, too.</li>
            <li>I think this kit gives really good and natural looking results.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I&#x27;ve purchased an additional one as a backup. :)</li>
            <li>ELF&#x27;s brunette eyebrow powder was not the right tone for me any more, with the lighter hair it enhanced redness in my skin.</li>
            <li>you get the hang of it, it is super easy.</li>
            <li>and I think this became my new favorite !</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and the price was right (very inexpensive).</li>
            <li>The end result is nicely defined, natural looking eyebrows!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t understand at first but now that I do I love this product.</li>
            <li>but I was not disappointed</li>
            <li>First, with their Mist and Set, then the translucent powder and now with this fantastic brow kit!</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>The little brush is good quality, the product is great, and the case is high quality as well.</li>
            <li>I like this brand , its cheap and good at the same time ,i will always be ordering items of this brand , its affordable for all</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this hasn&#x27;t been raved about a lot more, it&#x27;s a great product, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of high and low end brow products and this is def one of my favs</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t find it to be anything special.</li>
            <li>I love certain e.l.f products</li>
            <li>This is a very good product, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I just love how easy it is to use and how natural it makes my brows look every time!</li>
            <li>This works pretty good so far...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any kind of reaction to make up before, and i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it really suits light/pale skin better.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use a high quality angled brush!</li>
            <li>good and really low cost.</li>
            <li>Then on top of that it felt very greasy</li>
            <li>Easy to use for first timer.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>and I do love my high end brow kits ..</li>
            <li>If I have a little bit more time or want nicer and more defined brows I will use the powder on top of the wax using the fluffier end of the brush.</li>
            <li>It provides a natural look that doesn&#x27;t rub off easily, but removes easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a makeup junkie and love adding new things to my collection.</li>
            <li>I liked this because it does exactly what I bought it for...fills up my brows in a natural way.</li>
            <li>For the past year I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice eyebrow kit, with a good price, as I wanted to try one without spending too much money on it.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, soft brushes, smooth textures.</li>
            <li>I love the super soft prostle of the tip you use for the powder.</li>
            <li>I picked up this product at Target just to try it out for fun.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s worth it)</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the natural shape of my eyebrows, but they seem to be getting a bit lighter in color.</li>
            <li>Simple to use, good quality for a low price, and I love how I look with defined eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I was nervous to attempt doing my own eyebrows, but it&#x27;s so simple with this kit.</li>
            <li>you can make your eyebrows darker without having to draw distinct lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wax sets the hairs and lays a color basis and the powder smooths the look out making it even more natural looking.</li>
            <li>However, I know that filled in eyebrows can really make a difference on the face so for years I have been trying to find the right product and color.</li>
            <li>The powder was significantly lighter than my brows and really did not blend well or fill in any gaps.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use this routinely, it&#x27;s too time-consuming, but when I get it right</li>
            <li>I am gonna try ti again to see if it was maybe just me, but right now I know I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look like pencil either, very natural look and its easy to remove with makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Really easy to use and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>The included tools will get you a barely passable job, so you might want to use it with better brushes.</li>
            <li>Nice product, long wearing &amp; affordable, but a word of advice ...</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I generally lean toward higher end cosmetics, because for me, they tend to work better-</li>
            <li>When I first saw what this was</li>
            <li>first, I used the gel.</li>
            <li>so I decided to give this a try it looks exactly like the benefit eyebrow kit</li>
            <li>I have to admit it at first</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m looking for but has no red tones in it which I love.</li>
            <li>and now they are stellar.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wish I had known about this stuff before now!</li>
            <li>Be aware:</li>
            <li>I was worried it would smudge but went to a pool party here in Texas the other day and was freaking hot and sweaty and thought for sure I had lost an eyebrow...checked in the mirror, they were both still there and no smudging!</li>
            <li>Brush that is included is lacking and the color block fell out when I first opened it.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this product elsewhere and paid less for it than is advertised here, but even the price on Amazon is very fair for this product.  </li>
            <li>If I am in a hurry I only apply the wax real quick following the shape of my eyebrows using the smooth end of the brush.</li>
            <li>I used pencil for a long time but like the coverage this gives better, even though it it a tad trickier to apply.</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it is kind of poor quality though, especially considering ELF makes really good brushes.</li>
            <li>So I researched a few products and found this to be, not only the easiest but most effective product in my search.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You get a large quantity of product for your buck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had surprise red, dark, and light, so this color is a nice change.</li>
            <li>this is definitely the product to get its cheap and very reliable</li>
            <li>, I definitely recommend getting the Light Kit  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed, and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>very displeased 👎🏻</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now because my real eyebrows seem to have fallen out.  </li>
            <li>I cannot store it and it was too much hassle to return it for the $5 or</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like how it felt on my eyebrows either</li>
            <li>the price,.you can&#x27;t really complain..</li>
            <li>And really affordable.</li>
            <li>I have light skin and dark hair and eyebrows (dark brown), and I found this to match very well and look good as well.</li>
            <li>reasonable price as well</li>
            <li>(and mine are really sparse</li>
            <li>The darker color didn&#x27;t apply very well and seemed to have a waxy texture to it.</li>
            <li>next time I think I will try the light...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on very well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>the brush is flimsy and the gel doesn&#x27;t really do much :</li>
            <li>The little mirror also helps close-up to make sure things turn out just right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, easy to use, and long lasting!</li>
            <li>Always be sure you have a sharp angle too.  </li>
            <li>But with this my eyebrows look naturally full, and it makes such a difference.</li>
            <li>The dark brown works great but the light brown seems a little orangey red when putting it on.</li>
            <li>The wet n wild brow kit is a lot more pigmented than this.</li>
            <li>the wax part of the kit doesn&#x27;t particularly hold the brow in place, so</li>
            <li>but I wish they had different brushes other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>I love that there are different colors because all eyebrows are not created equally.</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with this product is not very good, however, so I recommend using your own angle brush.</li>
            <li>I love this for when I mess up tweezing my eyebrows...easy to apply and stays on</li>
            <li>I do not know why this has a high review.</li>
            <li>highly reccomended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend 😊</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a brow set for sometime now that is not so expensive and that works great.</li>
            <li>purchase!it is a waste their are way cheaper products that work 100 times better</li>
            <li>I would also add that the wax tends to flake a bit, but the two step process is indeed good for those who have thin or sparse brows.</li>
            <li>, hopefully I get it right the next time around.</li>
            <li>Eyebrows don&#x27;t seem like a big deal, but just defining them really makes my whole face look prettier.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look very natural.</li>
            <li>This kit makes my eyebrows look very natural</li>
            <li>This kit gives you a defined, yet very natural eyebrow look.</li>
            <li>I bought the Medium Kit first because I thought it would be like enough</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have olive color skin not to dark or to light</li>
            <li>The dark side (cream) is for shaping and filling, and the light side (powder) is to lift the eyebrows and make it look sharper.</li>
            <li>n cheap that it wasn&#x27;t that dark on the brows.</li>
            <li>I was also worried (I have dark brown hair) that this color would be too light.</li>
            <li>Even if you get it on too heavy, you can go over it again with a clean angled brush (buy two long-handled brushes while you&#x27;re at it), and that tends to soften the intensity if you happened to apply too much.</li>
            <li>Though I have olive-toned skin and black hair, my eyebrows are a bit on the light side.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a little bit more dark then I expected, but it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li>This kit is very inexpensive and does the job better than other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>The medium color is neutral without red, and really medium, not too dark or light.</li>
            <li>Color was darker than expected .Arrived quickly item sold at old Navy for $4.00 found out after I placed the order</li>
            <li>After trying this out I have decided that I prefer dark powder and clear gel/wax to set it, not dark gel and light powder.</li>
            <li>There are much better solutions for thin brows, but they will cost quite a bit more, so if you are on a tight budget, this will work in a pinch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so glad that I purchased this, and recommend it to anyone to give your brows a little something extra!</li>
            <li>I use a clear mascara by CoverGirl and it works</li>
            <li>Literally just one dab for each eyebrow was all I needed to completely fill in my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It gives natural color after applying..</li>
            <li>I like it and when i apply it looks natural</li>
            <li>When in doubt choose a lighter color than your natural color.  </li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;m thinking I will try it again.</li>
            <li>The dark cream adds the color and full ness while the powder softens the look, making it natural.</li>
            <li>and at first I was skeptical about being this product since it is very cheap</li>
            <li>I ordered a separate, longer brush - but the small enclosed brush worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Decent for a low end product.</li>
            <li>but need a better brush, the one in the kit is too small and fragile.</li>
            <li>High quality at a low price.</li>
            <li>The long handled brush is much easier to use, trust me.  </li>
            <li>I use only a little &amp; lighten it by using light translucent powder</li>
            <li>Not too dark but just right.</li>
            <li>reference, I have very pale skin and light brown hair.</li>
            <li>What I usually do is I either use a small amount of the wax or apply a primer or gloss first, then apply the brow powder and set the wax on top with a touch of translucent powder</li>
            <li>So far, I keep coming back to this.  </li>
            <li>and will definitely keep using it to complete my makeup</li>
            <li>but my eyebrows are pretty dark</li>
            <li>I think the gel is too slippery but barely any product comes out on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>if you have dark eyebrows, this may not be exactly what you need.</li>
            <li>formula also lasts a long time, so you aren&#x27;t having to go buy new product all the time, so in that way, it beats a pencil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American woman with very dark, full brows, so I don&#x27;t need this to draw on my eyebrows but to fill them in and sculpt them a bit.</li>
            <li>The color was not dark enough for my eye brows.</li>
            <li>I recently had my brows shaped and they were kind of thin, with a bit of grey showing.  </li>
            <li>Before completely giving up I decided I would try ONLY the powder the next day.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and fairly full eyebrows, but this was definitely darker than expected.</li>
            <li>so I do sometimes have to reapply, but I don&#x27;t think you would normally have to in other climates</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are very thin and arent too full and this really helps make the, fuller.</li>

            <li> ( I found an angled brush at Ulta that works great)</li>

            <li> This is honestly the best brow kit.</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> but the product is very nice.</li>
            <li> but it is amazing!</li>
            <li> Goes on good but the wear time isn&#x27;t so great.</li>

            <li> It is inexpensive and fundamental to a good face.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a good buy</li>
            <li> and then the definition of your brows won&#x27;t look as good.  </li>

            <li> to order another one for me since she wouldn&#x27;t let go of it!&lt;br /&gt;Two pleased sisters!</li>
            <li> I used this eyebrow kit - applying the wax first, then the powder - and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It really is outstanding !</li>
            <li> but this one takes the top spot!</li>
            <li> WAY better than eyebrow pencils!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>

            <li> Love using this product!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Color payoff is excellent and I use it in conjunction with a brow pencil to get a more exact line!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> my eyebrows look amazing.</li>
            <li> I did try the product out and it was creamy and a great texture, ran on smooth</li>
            <li> THIS however is the absolute best!</li>
            <li> so I use my own brow brush.</li>
            <li> Love the product, its just at good as Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow</li>
            <li> For such a great price this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> The powder is nice though.</li>
            <li> The brush it comes with is nice too.</li>
            <li> it does look nice.  </li>
            <li> This product fills them in nicely.</li>
            <li> Settles on nicely</li>
            <li> it is so nice too.</li>
            <li> The colors were perfect for my eyebrows and it really lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Although the powder is much lighter than the wax it works great!</li>
            <li> My brows look great now, very good purchase and will definitely buy again when the time comes</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s probably the BEST kit you can find especially for the good price, lasts all day</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow kit I&#x27;ve owned by far!</li>
            <li> I use a nicer, stiffer brush than the included flimsy brush - but love, love this product - have purchased it twice now!</li>
            <li> The compact came in good shape and the product worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Nice for gray eyebrows, now my eyebrows show up :)</li>
            <li> The gel is great for light shading, the powder is great for finishing and they stay on really well, even with oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin, light brown hair and medium/dark brown brows</li>
            <li> very pleased with this product (and even more pleased with the price tag)</li>
            <li> I STRONGLY recommend for people to buy it for their eyebrows!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE !</li>
            <li> love love love!</li>
            <li> Plan to use your own brushes and you&#x27;ll be more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> It made a huge difference and it made my face and eyebrows look amazing.</li>
            <li> I recommend this over any eyebrow pencil, since pencils tend to look more unnatural (unless you like the look of more unnatural/drawn on brows).</li>
            <li> But this product makes what I have look better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used much better powder that don&#x27;t make you look like a freak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many in between and thrown them out after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> it was so much better</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC BUY!</li>
            <li> Yeah eyeshadow not even for eyebrows powder was better then</li>
            <li> but I love it</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow never look better</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have learned and I love it.</li>
            <li> This looks cute on me</li>
            <li> have gotten so many complements on my eyebrows since I have started using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE</li>
            <li> have tried so many brow products already</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I watched reviews and demos on youtube and everyone seemed to love it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m still looking for a better product.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes them look SO much better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Extremely happy and received it fast.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Even better.</li>
            <li> Love e.l.f.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have tried too many brow products to list here.  </li>
            <li> I have had sparse brows for years and this is the most natural-looking product I have used.  </li>
            <li> I sure didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow kit.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a wax-based product and a powder.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> I use this for my eyebrows every day and have had many refills.</li>
            <li> I love e.l.f. products.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brow products.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, starting there gives me a steadier application :) It matches my brows perfectly, it lasts FOREVER (like 6 months!), and it doesn&#x27;t melt off!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> do find you have to use more product than you think.</li>
            <li> Love the simplicity of brow powder and tinted brow wax in one case.</li>
            <li> honestly better than my 32$ eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> I love legs products and their prices.</li>
            <li> Went to drug store and got something way better.</li>
            <li> Got it with free 2-day shipping!</li>
            <li> My sister enjoyed this product however.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> You have to do a good blend of the two colors to get it right.</li>
            <li> Very good product, goes on easy and evenly, looks very natural and adds texture to the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This is actually easier for me, and hold up so much better!!!</li>
            <li> High recommend this product! !!!!</li>
            <li> Was very happy with this, stays on well - I am in a very humid hot climate</li>
            <li> it was easy to shape my brows and the gel kept them in place and the powder filled them in nicely....</li>
            <li> I loved it at first...</li>
            <li> Perfect color the gel doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I want it too</li>
            <li> I always thought I had pretty good brows until I started filling them</li>
            <li> Quality is pretty good for the cost.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow kit stays on better than the pencils or felt pens, and even though it lasts all day it can be removed easily with water and a dab of soap.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and cheap!</li>
            <li> Goes on great and looks natural!</li>
            <li> The colors match perfectly and make my eyebrows look natural and sculpted just right.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price I love Elf</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look great and natural.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm for something so cheap :-)</li>
            <li> This eyebrow kit was ok, just too light for me.</li>
            <li> Too waxy,didn&#x27;t stay put,rubs off too easily</li>
            <li> The product takes some fiddling, I use a bit of both wax colors, it can easily get to looking like you took a Crayola to yourself.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and convenient to carry in a makeup bag when traveling.</li>
            <li> This stuff is easy to use and you get the hang of it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I suggest using a full size dual brush for better results.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it is not extremely useful in creating the perfect eyebrow.</li>
            <li> this is the best eyebrow kit for dark brown brows.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, stays on and looks fabulous and polished.</li>
            <li> The color is fine, but the brush isn&#x27;t even angled so I don&#x27;t even use the product.</li>
            <li> I would be fine with this</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, but the free, included brush/applicator is commiserate with being &amp;#34;free.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product as compared to what I was using, this is very inexpensive and very useful.</li>
            <li> Goes on very easily, allows you to shape your brow exactly as you wish.  </li>
            <li> HUGE TIP:</li>
            <li> and I thought I would give it a try on my own but didn&#x27;t want to invest as much money.  </li>
            <li> It was a great last minute add on choice for me!</li>
            <li> but it makes me wonder what kinda of ingredients the company uses that allows them to sell it for so cheap....</li>
            <li> I have medium/dark brown hair and hoped that the colors in this kit would not be too light.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great find for me.</li>
            <li> ENJOY</li>
            <li> but overall great purchase.</li>
            <li> I used my elf angled brush (not the one in the kit, but the separate $3 one because it&#x27;s longer and makes it easier to apply imo) and just lightly dabbed it once in the powder and began to apply to my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I like the light brown</li>
            <li> As someone else here noted, buying light and medium works for me.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it goes on and makes a smooth arch.</li>
            <li> The color was too light.</li>
            <li> I have light to medium brown hair, and I always get the medium shade.</li>
            <li> I find this applies rather light.</li>
            <li> my hair is mostly light brown but a bit darker on the ends</li>
            <li> I will be ordering the light, too.</li>
            <li> I think this kit gives really good and natural looking results.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I&#x27;ve purchased an additional one as a backup. :)</li>
            <li> ELF&#x27;s brunette eyebrow powder was not the right tone for me any more, with the lighter hair it enhanced redness in my skin.</li>
            <li> you get the hang of it, it is super easy.</li>
            <li> and I think this became my new favorite !</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and the price was right (very inexpensive).</li>
            <li> The end result is nicely defined, natural looking eyebrows!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand at first but now that I do I love this product.</li>
            <li> but I was not disappointed</li>
            <li> First, with their Mist and Set, then the translucent powder and now with this fantastic brow kit!</li>
            <li> I love this so much!</li>
            <li> The little brush is good quality, the product is great, and the case is high quality as well.</li>
            <li> I like this brand , its cheap and good at the same time ,i will always be ordering items of this brand , its affordable for all</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this hasn&#x27;t been raved about a lot more, it&#x27;s a great product, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of high and low end brow products and this is def one of my favs</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t find it to be anything special.</li>
            <li> I love certain e.l.f products</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I just love how easy it is to use and how natural it makes my brows look every time!</li>
            <li> This works pretty good so far...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any kind of reaction to make up before, and i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it really suits light/pale skin better.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to use a high quality angled brush!</li>
            <li> good and really low cost.</li>
            <li> Then on top of that it felt very greasy</li>
            <li> Easy to use for first timer.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> and I do love my high end brow kits ..</li>
            <li> If I have a little bit more time or want nicer and more defined brows I will use the powder on top of the wax using the fluffier end of the brush.</li>
            <li> It provides a natural look that doesn&#x27;t rub off easily, but removes easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup junkie and love adding new things to my collection.</li>
            <li> I liked this because it does exactly what I bought it for...fills up my brows in a natural way.</li>
            <li> For the past year I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice eyebrow kit, with a good price, as I wanted to try one without spending too much money on it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, soft brushes, smooth textures.</li>
            <li> I love the super soft prostle of the tip you use for the powder.</li>
            <li> I picked up this product at Target just to try it out for fun.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s worth it)</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the natural shape of my eyebrows, but they seem to be getting a bit lighter in color.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, good quality for a low price, and I love how I look with defined eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to attempt doing my own eyebrows, but it&#x27;s so simple with this kit.</li>
            <li> you can make your eyebrows darker without having to draw distinct lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The wax sets the hairs and lays a color basis and the powder smooths the look out making it even more natural looking.</li>
            <li> However, I know that filled in eyebrows can really make a difference on the face so for years I have been trying to find the right product and color.</li>
            <li> The powder was significantly lighter than my brows and really did not blend well or fill in any gaps.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use this routinely, it&#x27;s too time-consuming, but when I get it right</li>
            <li> I am gonna try ti again to see if it was maybe just me, but right now I know I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like pencil either, very natural look and its easy to remove with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> The included tools will get you a barely passable job, so you might want to use it with better brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice product, long wearing &amp; affordable, but a word of advice ...</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I generally lean toward higher end cosmetics, because for me, they tend to work better-</li>
            <li> When I first saw what this was</li>
            <li> first, I used the gel.</li>
            <li> so I decided to give this a try it looks exactly like the benefit eyebrow kit</li>
            <li> I have to admit it at first</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;m looking for but has no red tones in it which I love.</li>
            <li> and now they are stellar.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish I had known about this stuff before now!</li>
            <li> Be aware:</li>
            <li> I was worried it would smudge but went to a pool party here in Texas the other day and was freaking hot and sweaty and thought for sure I had lost an eyebrow...checked in the mirror, they were both still there and no smudging!</li>
            <li> Brush that is included is lacking and the color block fell out when I first opened it.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product elsewhere and paid less for it than is advertised here, but even the price on Amazon is very fair for this product.  </li>
            <li> If I am in a hurry I only apply the wax real quick following the shape of my eyebrows using the smooth end of the brush.</li>
            <li> I used pencil for a long time but like the coverage this gives better, even though it it a tad trickier to apply.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it is kind of poor quality though, especially considering ELF makes really good brushes.</li>
            <li> So I researched a few products and found this to be, not only the easiest but most effective product in my search.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You get a large quantity of product for your buck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had surprise red, dark, and light, so this color is a nice change.</li>
            <li> this is definitely the product to get its cheap and very reliable</li>
            <li> , I definitely recommend getting the Light Kit  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed, and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> very displeased 👎🏻</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now because my real eyebrows seem to have fallen out.  </li>
            <li> I cannot store it and it was too much hassle to return it for the $5 or</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like how it felt on my eyebrows either</li>
            <li> the price,.you can&#x27;t really complain..</li>
            <li> And really affordable.</li>
            <li> I have light skin and dark hair and eyebrows (dark brown), and I found this to match very well and look good as well.</li>
            <li> reasonable price as well</li>
            <li> (and mine are really sparse</li>
            <li> The darker color didn&#x27;t apply very well and seemed to have a waxy texture to it.</li>
            <li> next time I think I will try the light...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on very well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> the brush is flimsy and the gel doesn&#x27;t really do much :</li>
            <li> The little mirror also helps close-up to make sure things turn out just right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, easy to use, and long lasting!</li>
            <li> Always be sure you have a sharp angle too.  </li>
            <li> But with this my eyebrows look naturally full, and it makes such a difference.</li>
            <li> The dark brown works great but the light brown seems a little orangey red when putting it on.</li>
            <li> The wet n wild brow kit is a lot more pigmented than this.</li>
            <li> the wax part of the kit doesn&#x27;t particularly hold the brow in place, so</li>
            <li> but I wish they had different brushes other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> I love that there are different colors because all eyebrows are not created equally.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with this product is not very good, however, so I recommend using your own angle brush.</li>
            <li> I love this for when I mess up tweezing my eyebrows...easy to apply and stays on</li>
            <li> I do not know why this has a high review.</li>
            <li> highly reccomended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend 😊</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a brow set for sometime now that is not so expensive and that works great.</li>
            <li> purchase!it is a waste their are way cheaper products that work 100 times better</li>
            <li> I would also add that the wax tends to flake a bit, but the two step process is indeed good for those who have thin or sparse brows.</li>
            <li> , hopefully I get it right the next time around.</li>
            <li> Eyebrows don&#x27;t seem like a big deal, but just defining them really makes my whole face look prettier.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look very natural.</li>
            <li> This kit makes my eyebrows look very natural</li>
            <li> This kit gives you a defined, yet very natural eyebrow look.</li>
            <li> I bought the Medium Kit first because I thought it would be like enough</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have olive color skin not to dark or to light</li>
            <li> The dark side (cream) is for shaping and filling, and the light side (powder) is to lift the eyebrows and make it look sharper.</li>
            <li> n cheap that it wasn&#x27;t that dark on the brows.</li>
            <li> I was also worried (I have dark brown hair) that this color would be too light.</li>
            <li> Even if you get it on too heavy, you can go over it again with a clean angled brush (buy two long-handled brushes while you&#x27;re at it), and that tends to soften the intensity if you happened to apply too much.</li>
            <li> Though I have olive-toned skin and black hair, my eyebrows are a bit on the light side.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little bit more dark then I expected, but it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> This kit is very inexpensive and does the job better than other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The medium color is neutral without red, and really medium, not too dark or light.</li>
            <li> Color was darker than expected .Arrived quickly item sold at old Navy for $4.00 found out after I placed the order</li>
            <li> After trying this out I have decided that I prefer dark powder and clear gel/wax to set it, not dark gel and light powder.</li>
            <li> There are much better solutions for thin brows, but they will cost quite a bit more, so if you are on a tight budget, this will work in a pinch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so glad that I purchased this, and recommend it to anyone to give your brows a little something extra!</li>
            <li> I use a clear mascara by CoverGirl and it works</li>
            <li> Literally just one dab for each eyebrow was all I needed to completely fill in my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It gives natural color after applying..</li>
            <li> I like it and when i apply it looks natural</li>
            <li> When in doubt choose a lighter color than your natural color.  </li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;m thinking I will try it again.</li>
            <li> The dark cream adds the color and full ness while the powder softens the look, making it natural.</li>
            <li> and at first I was skeptical about being this product since it is very cheap</li>
            <li> I ordered a separate, longer brush - but the small enclosed brush worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Decent for a low end product.</li>
            <li> but need a better brush, the one in the kit is too small and fragile.</li>
            <li> High quality at a low price.</li>
            <li> The long handled brush is much easier to use, trust me.  </li>
            <li> I use only a little &amp; lighten it by using light translucent powder</li>
            <li> Not too dark but just right.</li>
            <li> reference, I have very pale skin and light brown hair.</li>
            <li> What I usually do is I either use a small amount of the wax or apply a primer or gloss first, then apply the brow powder and set the wax on top with a touch of translucent powder</li>
            <li> So far, I keep coming back to this.  </li>
            <li> and will definitely keep using it to complete my makeup</li>
            <li> but my eyebrows are pretty dark</li>
            <li> I think the gel is too slippery but barely any product comes out on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> if you have dark eyebrows, this may not be exactly what you need.</li>
            <li> formula also lasts a long time, so you aren&#x27;t having to go buy new product all the time, so in that way, it beats a pencil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with very dark, full brows, so I don&#x27;t need this to draw on my eyebrows but to fill them in and sculpt them a bit.</li>
            <li> The color was not dark enough for my eye brows.</li>
            <li> I recently had my brows shaped and they were kind of thin, with a bit of grey showing.  </li>
            <li> Before completely giving up I decided I would try ONLY the powder the next day.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and fairly full eyebrows, but this was definitely darker than expected.</li>
            <li> so I do sometimes have to reapply, but I don&#x27;t think you would normally have to in other climates</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are very thin and arent too full and this really helps make the, fuller.</li>
            <li> and yet when I apply the gel (left) you hardly notice it even after putting on the right side.</li>
            <li> Back in the 90&#x27;s, I over plucked my eyebrows WAY too much just like a lot of people did back then, and I have been trying for the past 5 yrs to get them to grow back in.</li>
            <li> i have very thin eyebrows, so i was very excited to find this product.</li>
            <li> The color on my eyebrows wasn&#x27;t too dark, just darkened enough to look natural.</li>
            <li> Would buy gain long lasting.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical because let&#x27;s face it, E.L.F. is pretty inexpensive and that means lesser quality, right?</li>
            <li> and this kit is just slightly too dark if applied too heavily although it  can be sheered down to match better</li>
            <li> and I use an old mascara wand to apply instead of the little brush which I now use to apply my liquid liner.</li>
            <li> , the end for the waxy stuff is flat, not slanted, and not stiff; the brushy end is too loose, even fluffy.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this, complete waste of money</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, on your face and in the compact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not thin and they&#x27;re not too thick.</li>
            <li> Also the fluffy side of the brush is kinda useless but I still use this product most days...</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m a dark skin asian.</li>
            <li> The case has a small mirror, but with my 50+ year old eyes, I cannot see my eyebrows in that mirror.</li>
            <li> However, since it lasts so long, it&#x27;s not really an issue.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is a medium to dark brown, however the medium brown looks so very  dark on me</li>
            <li> Color is horrid, looks super fake on....</li>
            <li> Buy yourself an angled eyebrow brush (long handle, comes in a plastic container and can usually be found with all the other make-up brushes out there) at your local pharmacy&#x27;s make-up counter or a big box store.  </li>
            <li> It should last for a long time since I use very little to get the job done.</li>
            <li> This product serves the purpose for it&#x27;s price, however, it does go on darker than expected.</li>
            <li> Got this 6 days before the expected date.</li>
            <li> I expected the product to be a gel of sorts which the darker color is but the lighter one is like an eyeshadow...</li>
            <li> whatever I spent on it.  </li>
            <li> A bit darker than I expected</li>
            <li> Okay let me say it came packaged neat &amp; the only complaint I have is that it took kinda long to get to me :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about</li>
            <li> side is a colored gel, and the other is a colored setting powder.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I decided to give it a shot</li>
            <li> I use a small angled brush (doesn&#x27;t matter the brand) and apply it starting at the bottom of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> (I was skeptical at first about that).</li>
            <li> Naturally, my eyebrows aren&#x27;t really that bad.</li>
            <li> i ordered it with a few other items and almost missed it entirely because it was so small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;m in the process of going blonde, and it&#x27;s hard to find anything for my brows</li>
            <li> I have dark and sparse eyebrows and this kit</li>
            <li> It was too dark and my eye brows looked like I drew them on.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t go on too dark.</li>
            <li> I use medium color and I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> The brush to apply this is awful, without a good brush</li>
            <li> I have thin eyebrows and it makes them fuller and keeps a natural look.</li>
            <li> Was not easy to apply and when it arrived the powder was completely crushed.</li>
            <li> I dont like having black eyebrows</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look waxy or feel odd when it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li> it borders appearing black.  </li>
            <li> I have nearly black eyebrows</li>
            <li> I dye my hair darker and my eyebrows are blonde so its hard to try to find something that grooms/darkens them and makes them look natural without making me look weird.</li>
            <li> but it was VERY DARK</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are thin, and the consistency makes it possible to &amp;#34;layer&amp;#34; until you get the look you want.</li>
            <li> This product has been my go-to for a few years now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what you&#x27;re supposed to do with it, but it&#x27;s definitely not useful to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking foreward to using this product everyday.</li>
            <li> After watching a few beauty tutorial videos on YouTube, I saw that this kit was recommended over and over again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The darker shade to fill in areas that are missing; lighter shade to even out.  </li>
            <li> Eyebrow pencils are way to harsh, and that stuff in a tube with fibers in it always looks painted on.  </li>
            <li> Read my full review on Jennbizzle.com:[...]</li>
            <li> and i use it everyday</li>
            <li> I have dark brown skin and at the time my eye brows were sparse and needed a small fill in.</li>
            <li> ) powder on a wax base is really the ONLY way to go.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last long and is impossible to find in stores, and even for all that it was just average.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i wish the application stick was a little longer and easier to hold, but i guess that&#x27;s the price of having a small package.</li>
            <li> It is too small for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I HATED it because it was just way too dark and looked super unnatural.</li>
            <li> I have very dark thick brows</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pointless.</li>
            <li> (usually the wax in these kinds of kits is the lighter tint)</li>
            <li> I usually just use the eyebrow pencils to shade in my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I usually use benifit eyebrow kit but 40 dollars is a bit pricy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and not too late.</li>
            <li> I have always hated how my eyebrows look, they are thin and very light brown (I dye my hair darker brown).</li>
            <li> The miniature dual brush is not effective.  </li>
            <li> This stuff sucks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about my eyebrow stuff but decided I wanted to start trying to find something less expensive than the pricey designer brands I usually use.</li>
            <li> The accompanying small thin brush also works well with the product.</li>
            <li> The dark brown wax I never use it made my brows look weird</li>
            <li> BUT I do recommend to buy a brush because the one given is really small &amp; hard to work with !!</li>
            <li> this my eyebrows looked to fake and drawer in not ok</li>
            <li> the brush that comes with it is difficult to grasp because it&#x27;s so small.  </li>
            <li> I have never used any thing for my thin and almost invisible eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Game changer.</li>
            <li> Now I have found it!&lt;br /&gt;I lost quite a bit of my eyebrow hairs so needed something that fixes them without it looking like its poorly</li>
            <li> and this seems a little darker than I wanted...not too bad once I&#x27;ve gotten my eyeliner and mascara on to draw the attention away from it</li>
            <li> but after about 1 week of using it everyday the skin of my eyebrows started to get a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> and this is by far the worst product I ever used.</li>
            <li> but sometimes when I put it on my eyebrows, then when I wore my hair down it wore smear everywhere which was annoying me.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t care for how fake the brows look when done.  </li>
            <li> The brush is useless</li>
            <li> Pencils just looked weird and unnatural on me</li>
            <li> this product is useless.</li>
            <li> Pencils always made my brows look too fake, and</li>
            <li> I however managed to get the wrong color.</li>
            <li> but I chose the wrong color so of course it couldn&#x27;t blend with my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The double-ended brush just stinks</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t always done my eyebrows because I was afraid of that &amp;#34;sharpie&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Thicker, and darker without looking fake!</li>
            <li> Too bad..</li>
            <li> but nothing comes out on my brows :(</li>
            <li> I hate this eyebrow kit!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product for doing my eyebrows real quick. I have medium brown eyebrows and this kit matches my eyebrow color almost perfectly. It comes with a wax, a powder, and a two sided brush. If I am in a hurry I only apply the wax real quick following the shape of my eyebrows using the smooth end of the brush. If I have a little bit more time or want nicer and more defined brows I will use the powder on top of the wax using the fluffier end of the brush. The end result is nicely defined, natural looking eyebrows!! I have tried applying the powder before the wax and that looks great as well. You can apply this kit almost any way you can think of, but the above method is just my preferred method of applying. I think this kit gives really good and natural looking results. It lasts all day with no need to reapply. I recommend this over any eyebrow pencil, since pencils tend to look more unnatural (unless you like the look of more unnatural/drawn on brows).</li>
            <li> This is lighter than it looks upon aplication.</li>
            <li> Not too dark but just right.</li>
            <li> I have never used any thing for my thin and almost invisible eyebrows.  Some one recently introduced me to a similar product and I thought I would give it a try on my own but didn&#x27;t want to invest as much money.  This is actually easier for me, and hold up so much better!!! It was a great last minute add on choice for me!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and fairly full eyebrows, but this was definitely darker than expected. After trying this out I have decided that I prefer dark powder and clear gel/wax to set it, not dark gel and light powder. The powder was significantly lighter than my brows and really did not blend well or fill in any gaps.</li>
            <li> Decent for a low end product. I use it a lot. But it is not as good as Benefit brand. But good for price.</li>
            <li> Wish I had eyebrows! But this product makes what I have look better. I used pencil for a long time but like the coverage this gives better, even though it it a tad trickier to apply. The medium color is neutral without red, and really medium, not too dark or light. I&#x27;ve had surprise red, dark, and light, so this color is a nice change.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t care for how fake the brows look when done.  I&#x27;ve used much better powder that don&#x27;t make you look like a freak.</li>
            <li> I picked up this product at Target just to try it out for fun. I had low expectations because it was a cheaper line and thus seemed like it would be low quality, but I was actually blown away! I dye my hair darker and my eyebrows are blonde so its hard to try to find something that grooms/darkens them and makes them look natural without making me look weird. The little brush is good quality, the product is great, and the case is high quality as well. I will definitley be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at target after a friend (who has great eyebrows!) recommended it. I loved it at first... it was easy to shape my brows and the gel kept them in place and the powder filled them in nicely....but after about 1 week of using it everyday the skin of my eyebrows started to get a bad reaction. I might be allergic to it but it makes me wonder what kinda of ingredients the company uses that allows them to sell it for so cheap.... I&#x27;ve never had any kind of reaction to make up before, and i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. Wish i didn&#x27;t have to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, stays on and looks fabulous and polished. Great product and price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of different brands of eyebrow makeup. I used to always use the Almay brown pencil but it didn&#x27;t last long and is impossible to find in stores, and even for all that it was just average. I&#x27;ve tried many in between and thrown them out after a couple uses. THIS however is the absolute best! Color goes on evenly, beautifully and stays on. The dark cream adds the color and full ness while the powder softens the look, making it natural. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this product. Was not easy to apply and when it arrived the powder was completely crushed.</li>
            <li> I hate this eyebrow kit! DO NOT buy this, complete waste of money</li>
            <li> This product has very low pigmentation. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. The wet n wild brow kit is a lot more pigmented than this.</li>
            <li> HUGE TIP: I bought the Medium Kit first because I thought it would be like enough but it was VERY DARK, I definitely recommend getting the Light Kit  it was so much better and it really suits light/pale skin better. FANTASTIC BUY!</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Smashbox&#x27;s eyebrow wax/powder product for well over a year now. This is after trying what seems like every brand of eyebrow pencil/powder/gel on the market, and they all sucked. I was happy with Smashbox and vowed never to stray.&lt;br /&gt;Then someone gave me an ELF Eyebrow kit they did not want. I was VERY skeptical because let&#x27;s face it, E.L.F. is pretty inexpensive and that means lesser quality, right? NO. NO way. Not in the case of this eyebrow product! I have tried brands from Cover Girl to Anastasia and E.L.F. is my holy grail eyebrow product right now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side is a colored gel, and the other is a colored setting powder. The included tools will get you a barely passable job, so you might want to use it with better brushes. ( I found an angled brush at Ulta that works great) Unlike Smashbox I cannot feel the ELF product on my brows, and that occasional itchiness I got on my brows is gone. (Ooops, Smashbox!) It also stays put all day!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product! I won&#x27;t go back to Smashbox for eyebrow color unless ELF stops making this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;m in the process of going blonde, and it&#x27;s hard to find anything for my brows that is a good tone. I&#x27;ve found the Laura Gellar brow pens to be great, but pricey. I&#x27;m currently using the LG pens, and a NYX automatic eyebrow pencil in charcoal gray. ELF&#x27;s brunette eyebrow powder was not the right tone for me any more, with the lighter hair it enhanced redness in my skin.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, and looks natural. My eyebrows are thin, and the consistency makes it possible to &amp;#34;layer&amp;#34; until you get the look you want.</li>
            <li> Love this product, works great and I don&#x27;t  have to use a pencil anymore. Great price too</li>
            <li> I liked this because it does exactly what I bought it for...fills up my brows in a natural way. I have brown skin and the darker color perfectly suits me.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day...color great.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow kit I&#x27;ve owned by far! the wax part of the kit doesn&#x27;t particularly hold the brow in place, so I couple this with the E.L.F. eyebrow gloss. Both are just great and come with perfect tools!</li>
            <li> For the past year I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice eyebrow kit, with a good price, as I wanted to try one without spending too much money on it. After reading the other reviews, I decided to give it a shot and I&#x27;m fully satisfied by it! ^^</li>
            <li> Too waxy,didn&#x27;t stay put,rubs off too easily</li>
            <li> The brush to apply this is awful, without a good brush it&#x27;s pointless. The color is fine, but the brush isn&#x27;t even angled so I don&#x27;t even use the product.</li>
            <li> This product serves the purpose for it&#x27;s price, however, it does go on darker than expected. I would also add that the wax tends to flake a bit, but the two step process is indeed good for those who have thin or sparse brows. The miniature dual brush is not effective.  It is too small for everyday use. I suggest using a full size dual brush for better results. There are much better solutions for thin brows, but they will cost quite a bit more, so if you are on a tight budget, this will work in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Work great! The brush that comes with it is kind of poor quality though, especially considering ELF makes really good brushes.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m a dark skin asian. lots of tanning and swimming. I dont like having black eyebrows so I opted for this. The brush is useless so I use my own brow brush. I mix both colors before i apply. The dark brown works great but the light brown seems a little orangey red when putting it on. You have to do a good blend of the two colors to get it right. It stays on great with primer.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks I order this because I was using eyeshadow on my eyebrows that I bought at the dollar store but after using this elk stuff I returned this and went back to my dollar store eyeshadow.  Yeah eyeshadow not even for eyebrows powder was better then this my eyebrows looked to fake and drawer in not ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and I loved it! I will forever keep buying this product. It&#x27;s cheap, easy to use, and long lasting! It comes with a mirror as well which helps for when you&#x27;re on the road for last minute or so. I STRONGLY recommend for people to buy it for their eyebrows!</li>
            <li> The elf Eyebrow Kit for medium tones is wonderful!!! I have dark and sparse eyebrows and this kit works wonders at filling them in. What I usually do is I either use a small amount of the wax or apply a primer or gloss first, then apply the brow powder and set the wax on top with a touch of translucent powder then let it set. TIP: Check out the elf site before buying on Amazon, they have a lot of products on sale most of the time!</li>
            <li> Nice for gray eyebrows, now my eyebrows show up :)</li>
            <li> What can I say. It is great.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. Just what I needed, and fast delivery. It lasts a long time, on your face and in the compact.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all. I been doing my eyebrows for years and this is by far the worst product I ever used.</li>
            <li> They make u give a star rating...I&#x27;d give this product ZERO STARS...Color is horrid, looks super fake on....it&#x27;s like u drew on your eyebrows with a crayon....very displeased 👎🏻</li>
            <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t look like pencil either, very natural look and its easy to remove with makeup remover. It doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge.</li>
            <li> Game changer. Will NEVER use a brow pencil,  again. I can play a tennis match and it stays put. Very easy to apply! Love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like a brown it gives some red tone.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I love it I swatched the color and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> lighter shade than I thought it was going to be. Goes on good but the wear time isn&#x27;t so great. Plus you can pick it up at Target for cheaper.</li>
            <li> The brush: perfect&lt;br /&gt;The colors: perfect&lt;br /&gt;The price: beats most&lt;br /&gt;I ordered one and later found it on my sisters purse! xD&lt;br /&gt;Had to order another one for me since she wouldn&#x27;t let go of it!&lt;br /&gt;Two pleased sisters!</li>
            <li> I have medium/dark brown hair and hoped that the colors in this kit would not be too light. They were perfect. I like that the brown tint is wax (usually the wax in these kinds of kits is the lighter tint) so it stayed where I put it. The accompanying small thin brush also works well with the product. It should last for a long time since I use very little to get the job done. Incredible buy for the price.</li>
            <li> it came on time and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, soft brushes, smooth textures.</li>
            <li> I like this brand , its cheap and good at the same time ,i will always be ordering items of this brand , its affordable for all</li>
            <li> I ordered and received the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; color eyebrow kit. Actually, I ordered 2. I tried the kit - the darker color is like a wax (or is a wax color) and the lighter side is a powder. Though I have olive-toned skin and black hair, my eyebrows are a bit on the light side. I used this eyebrow kit - applying the wax first, then the powder - and it was perfect. The color on my eyebrows wasn&#x27;t too dark, just darkened enough to look natural. You cannot tell my eyebrows had been &amp;#34;colored&amp;#34; with the kit. The brush is tiny, but usable. I ordered a separate, longer brush - but the small enclosed brush worked perfectly fine. I am very pleased with this product and the price was right (very inexpensive). I&#x27;ve used another brand - which last for over a year - however, I&#x27;m not a convert. I like the wax/powder combination a lot! The case has a small mirror, but with my 50+ year old eyes, I cannot see my eyebrows in that mirror. Overall, a great find for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this product. Brush gets clumpy.</li>
            <li> Its alright. No i woubuy it again. I think im going to stick with Rimmel.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. It lasts all day, does not fade away. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the brush, but I use the one that I have that is bigger. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good product, goes on easy and evenly, looks very natural and adds texture to the eyebrows. Very pleased with the product as compared to what I was using, this is very inexpensive and very useful.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand at first but now that I do I love this product.</li>
            <li> Okay let me say it came packaged neat &amp; the only complaint I have is that it took kinda long to get to me :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the product, it&#x27;s probably the BEST kit you can find especially for the good price, lasts all day BUT I do recommend to buy a brush because the one given is really small &amp; hard to work with !! :) ENJOY (it&#x27;s worth it)</li>
            <li> When I first saw what this was I didn&#x27;t think I could use it ,but it only took a couple of times and I realize it works vary well.</li>
            <li> I am a brunette and the color is lighter than my eyebrows but it works okay.  I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE ! I have very dark thick brows and at first I was skeptical about being this product since it is very cheap and I do love my high end brow kits .. but I was not disappointed and I think this became my new favorite !</li>
            <li> I generally lean toward higher end cosmetics, because for me, they tend to work better-I have oily/combination skin and have used a bunch of different types of brow cosmetics ranging from pencils, gels, powders and combos.  So far, I keep coming back to this.  The gel is great for light shading, the powder is great for finishing and they stay on really well, even with oily skin.  Just be sure to use a high quality angled brush!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Saves money in between brow arching appts. I LOOOOOVE THIS Brow kit. Every woman needs this fab find.</li>
            <li> Seems good for the price and product seems to work well.  I usually just use the eyebrow pencils to shade in my eyebrows but I had been wanting to try this type of product for a while. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great for beginners !!!</li>
            <li> Perfect color the gel doesn&#x27;t stay as long as I want it too but overall great purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it! It really is outstanding !</li>
            <li> Got this 6 days before the expected date. Love the product, its just at good as Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow</li>
            <li> Was very happy with this, stays on well - I am in a very humid hot climate so I do sometimes have to reapply, but I don&#x27;t think you would normally have to in other climates, it seems good quality.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow never look better</li>
            <li> Naturally, my eyebrows aren&#x27;t really that bad. They&#x27;re not thin and they&#x27;re not too thick. However, I know that filled in eyebrows can really make a difference on the face so for years I have been trying to find the right product and color. Pencils just looked weird and unnatural on me so I decided to try this eyebrow kit/powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I used the gel. I HATED it because it was just way too dark and looked super unnatural. Before completely giving up I decided I would try ONLY the powder the next day. I used my elf angled brush (not the one in the kit, but the separate $3 one because it&#x27;s longer and makes it easier to apply imo) and just lightly dabbed it once in the powder and began to apply to my eyebrows. It made a huge difference and it made my face and eyebrows look amazing. Literally just one dab for each eyebrow was all I needed to completely fill in my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even bother using the gel. To make my brows stay in place I use a clear mascara by CoverGirl and it works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product (and even more pleased with the price tag) and will definitely keep using it to complete my makeup look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have very pale skin and light brown hair.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow kit! For such a great price this product is awesome. My brows look great now, very good purchase and will definitely buy again when the time comes</li>
            <li> Goes on great and looks natural!</li>
            <li> I love this product! !! I usually use benifit eyebrow kit but 40 dollars is a bit pricy so I decided to give this a try it looks exactly like the benefit eyebrow kit and it&#x27;s amazing just for $5 !!! High recommend this product! !!!!</li>
            <li> This brow kit is excellent for eye brows... It gives natural color after applying..</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift.  She hasn&#x27;t asked me to return it or throw it out for her, so I guess she likes it.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow gel for the price.  I don&#x27;t have a desire to try anything else.  This product has been my go-to for a few years now, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an emergency alternative to the powder I prefer to use to define my brows.  This is actually like a paste and does not apply with an angled brow brush or with the included brush (it&#x27;s too tacky to transfer to/from the bristles).  I&#x27;m not really sure what you&#x27;re supposed to do with it, but it&#x27;s definitely not useful to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years now because my real eyebrows seem to have fallen out.  This eyebrow kit stays on better than the pencils or felt pens, and even though it lasts all day it can be removed easily with water and a dab of soap.  I just hope E.L.F. doesn&#x27;t decide to stop making it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have to admit it at first I didn&#x27;t know how to use it. I have learned and I love it. I got to tell you its cheaper at Walmart. I would recommend you buying it there.</li>
            <li> Great eyebrow set! I have finally found a set that is everything I need!</li>
            <li> This looks cute on me but I wish they had different brushes other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a brow set for sometime now that is not so expensive and that works great. Now I have found it!&lt;br /&gt;I lost quite a bit of my eyebrow hairs so needed something that fixes them without it looking like its poorly done.&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten so many complements on my eyebrows since I have started using this.&lt;br /&gt; Will defiantly be buying again and again!!!!</li>
            <li> It was okay. It didn&#x27;t look very natural.</li>
            <li> I expected the product to be a gel of sorts which the darker color is but the lighter one is like an eyeshadow... I would be fine with this but my eyebrows are pretty dark so I wanted to use the lighter brown to fill them in in order to avoid caterpillar brows. Also the fluffy side of the brush is kinda useless but I still use this product most days...</li>
            <li> Works great. The compact came in good shape and the product worked just fine. The color matches my brown african American skin.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many brow products already but this one takes the top spot!</li>
            <li> The colors match perfectly and make my eyebrows look natural and sculpted just right. I will never stop using this product....gonna have to stock up on it! lol</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e had this kit forever it lasts for months. I like the light brown it is darker then I&#x27;m looking for but has no red tones in it which I love. The dark brown wax I never use it made my brows look weird and I use an old mascara wand to apply instead of the little brush which I now use to apply my liquid liner. Good purchase Fantastic price I love Elf</li>
            <li> works okay you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Color was darker than expected .Arrived quickly item sold at old Navy for $4.00 found out after I placed the order</li>
            <li> case came damaged with the acrylic cracked.  I cannot store it and it was too much hassle to return it for the $5 or whatever I spent on it.  Too bad..</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing the recommendation on Paula&#x27;s Choice and thought I would try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a longer brush for the purposes of applying the gel/powder and that seems to work best for me.&lt;br /&gt;Once you get the hang of it, it is super easy. It stays put all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge.&lt;br /&gt;The formula also lasts a long time, so you aren&#x27;t having to go buy new product all the time, so in that way, it beats a pencil.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look great and natural. Great product</li>
            <li> I watched reviews and demos on youtube and everyone seemed to love it. When i tried to use it, it just didnt come out. I think the gel is too slippery but barely any product comes out on my eyebrows. When i put it on my hand it comes out but nothing comes out on my brows :( The powder is nice though. The brush it comes with is nice too.</li>
            <li> amazing, dont sweat though lol</li>
            <li> As someone else here noted, buying light and medium works for me.  The double-ended brush just stinks, the end for the waxy stuff is flat, not slanted, and not stiff; the brushy end is too loose, even fluffy.  Get yourself a couple of good brushes.  The mirror is also a joke, I can&#x27;t even see one eyebrow in it.  The product takes some fiddling, I use a bit of both wax colors, it can easily get to looking like you took a Crayola to yourself.  The powder is easier to work with, but again, I need a bit of both colors together.  I won&#x27;t use this routinely, it&#x27;s too time-consuming, but when I get it right it does look nice.  I won&#x27;t buy it again, though, I&#x27;m still looking for a better product.</li>
            <li> It was too dark and my eye brows looked like I drew them on. I didn&#x27;t really like how it felt on my eyebrows either</li>
            <li> If you have eyebrows....USE THIS. I always thought I had pretty good brows until I started filling them and now they are stellar. Easy to use and cheap!</li>
            <li> the brush this product comes with is a joke, but the pigments themselves are great.</li>
            <li> I use a longer brush to apply. I do not use the lighter side though. I like the way it goes on and makes a smooth arch. Would purchase again</li>
            <li> Wow! I REALLY wish I had known about this stuff before now! Back in the 90&#x27;s, I over plucked my eyebrows WAY too much just like a lot of people did back then, and I have been trying for the past 5 yrs to get them to grow back in. This stuff makes them look SO much better. Thicker, and darker without looking fake! WAY better than eyebrow pencils! Thank you e.l.f.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> great! but need a better brush, the one in the kit is too small and fragile. but the product is very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup junkie and love adding new things to my collection. This is definitely a product I&#x27;m getting a lot of use out of.  It is inexpensive and fundamental to a good face. It&#x27;s a lighter version of the product I was already using and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I love this for when I mess up tweezing my eyebrows...easy to apply and stays on</li>
            <li> I do not know why this has a high review. I gave it a try as I never wear gel eyebrow products. I do not see how this defines brows. I have olive color skin not to dark or to light and yet when I apply the gel (left) you hardly notice it even after putting on the right side.</li>
            <li> Elf is always a hit. Shape with wax/cream and set with powder.</li>
            <li> I used brow zing before but this works just as well. Love it</li>
            <li> Great product. Extremely happy and received it fast.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use and looks very natural.  I recently had my brows shaped and they were kind of thin, with a bit of grey showing.  This product fills them in nicely.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the natural shape of my eyebrows, but they seem to be getting a bit lighter in color. The Studio Eyebrow Kit by e.l.f. gives my brows good definition and color. The brush is perfect for the job, and gives a good control as you work, so you don&#x27;t come out looking like Grouco Marx!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I purchased this, and recommend it to anyone to give your brows a little something extra!</li>
            <li> A bit darker than I expected</li>
            <li> this product is useless. the colors are horrible.do not purchase!it is a waste their are way cheaper products that work 100 times better</li>
            <li> Beautiful product! I&#x27;m an African American woman with very dark, full brows, so I don&#x27;t need this to draw on my eyebrows but to fill them in and sculpt them a bit. My skin tone is medium-dark and I purchased the &#x27;medium&#x27; shade. The brush that comes with this product is not very good, however, so I recommend using your own angle brush. I&#x27;m looking foreward to using this product everyday.</li>
            <li> I like this brow bar. Settles on nicely and.for the price,.you can&#x27;t really complain..</li>
            <li> Easy to use for first timer. And really affordable. Would buy gain long lasting.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It works like a charm for something so cheap :-)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t always done my eyebrows because I was afraid of that &amp;#34;sharpie&amp;#34; look. After watching a few beauty tutorial videos on YouTube, I saw that this kit was recommended over and over again. I have light skin and dark hair and eyebrows (dark brown), and I found this to match very well and look good as well. It&#x27;s easy to use and convenient to carry in a makeup bag when traveling. The little mirror also helps close-up to make sure things turn out just right. This kit is very inexpensive and does the job better than other more expensive brands. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to others! Give it a try, you&#x27;ll be happy you did! Now I couldn&#x27;t dream of not doing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s not too heavy and not too late. The dark side (cream) is for shaping and filling, and the light side (powder) is to lift the eyebrows and make it look sharper. It&#x27;s definitely a good buy</li>
            <li> This did not work well for me. The color was too light. The product went on okay but I didn&#x27;t find it to be anything special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a make-up person.  But as an aesthetician, I&#x27;m asked about make-up and brows (shaping, correcting, etc).  So I researched a few products and found this to be, not only the easiest but most effective product in my search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The darker shade to fill in areas that are missing; lighter shade to even out.  Couldn&#x27;t be simpler!</li>
            <li> I use a nicer, stiffer brush than the included flimsy brush - but love, love this product - have purchased it twice now!</li>
            <li> It works well but I find that the brush gets really gummy after using it for only a few weeks.  Even after cleaning the brush, the brush remains sticky and it does not work as well.  I&#x27;d probably buy a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> I like it and when i apply it looks natural</li>
            <li> If you wanna do your eye brows perfect this is definitely the product to get its cheap and very reliable</li>
            <li> For me is like perfection ... my eyebrows look amazing. Yay! And the price?! Even better. Love e.l.f. products because the&#x27;re good and really low cost.</li>
            <li> best brow kit! reasonable price as well</li>
            <li> I hit pan with this product regularly. It is a part of my daily makeup routine and I don&#x27;t know what I was doing with out it.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product elsewhere and paid less for it than is advertised here, but even the price on Amazon is very fair for this product.  This stuff is easy to use and you get the hang of it very quickly.  Wax and color powder.  Simple.  If you have sparse brows like mine (and mine are really sparse) powder on a wax base is really the ONLY way to go.  Eyebrow pencils are way to harsh, and that stuff in a tube with fibers in it always looks painted on.  Hint for this product: the brush that comes with it is difficult to grasp because it&#x27;s so small.  Buy yourself an angled eyebrow brush (long handle, comes in a plastic container and can usually be found with all the other make-up brushes out there) at your local pharmacy&#x27;s make-up counter or a big box store.  The long handled brush is much easier to use, trust me.  Always be sure you have a sharp angle too.  As your brush ages the hairs tend to splay (like a paintbrush) and then the definition of your brows won&#x27;t look as good.  Anyway, I have tried too many brow products to list here.  This one is the one with which I&#x27;m sticking.  Even if you get it on too heavy, you can go over it again with a clean angled brush (buy two long-handled brushes while you&#x27;re at it), and that tends to soften the intensity if you happened to apply too much. I have had sparse brows for years and this is the most natural-looking product I have used.  The wax makes all the difference but it doesn&#x27;t look waxy or feel odd when it&#x27;s on.  You&#x27;ll forget you have it on!</li>
            <li> While I do like Elf products, this is one I sure didn&#x27;t care for. The darker color didn&#x27;t apply very well and seemed to have a waxy texture to it. I am gonna try ti again to see if it was maybe just me, but right now I know I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> A really good brow kit for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow kit. I love that it comes with a wax-based product and a powder. I love that there are different colors because all eyebrows are not created equally. Read my full review on Jennbizzle.com:[...]</li>
            <li> This eyebrow kit was ok, just too light for me. Gave it to my sister instead, but still trying to find a kit that works for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My eyebrows are very thin and arent too full and this really helps make the, fuller.</li>
            <li> e.l.f. continues to impress me. First, with their Mist and Set, then the translucent powder and now with this fantastic brow kit! I just love how easy it is to use and how natural it makes my brows look every time! The brush taht came with it is so nice too.I love the super soft prostle of the tip you use for the powder.</li>
            <li> not what i was looking for</li>
            <li> Nice product, long wearing &amp; affordable, but a word of advice ... When in doubt choose a lighter color than your natural color.  My natural hair color is a medium to dark brown, however the medium brown looks so very  dark on me it borders appearing black.  I use only a little &amp; lighten it by using light translucent powder</li>
            <li> I love this product.. It&#x27;s just a little bit more dark then I expected, but it&#x27;s fine! makes my brows fuller</li>
            <li> This kit makes my eyebrows look very natural and it doesn&#x27;t go on too dark. you might want to use a different brush to apply it</li>
            <li> This product is great for the price. I use this for my eyebrows every day and have had many refills. I use medium color and I have dark brown hair. The brush that comes with it is not extremely useful in creating the perfect eyebrow. Color and pigment are great. I love e.l.f. products. High quality at a low price.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brow products. I have light to medium brown hair, and I always get the medium shade. I ONLY use the gel and not the powder. I use a small angled brush (doesn&#x27;t matter the brand) and apply it starting at the bottom of my eyebrows. For whatever reason, starting there gives me a steadier application :) It matches my brows perfectly, it lasts FOREVER (like 6 months!), and it doesn&#x27;t melt off!&lt;br /&gt;I do find you have to use more product than you think. However, since it lasts so long, it&#x27;s not really an issue. Be aware: if you have dark eyebrows, this may not be exactly what you need. I find this applies rather light.</li>
            <li> Beautiful eyebrow kit in a nice sleek packaging! The colors were perfect for my eyebrows and it really lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the simplicity of brow powder and tinted brow wax in one case. Easy to apply, but the free, included brush/applicator is commiserate with being &amp;#34;free.&amp;#34;  Plan to use your own brushes and you&#x27;ll be more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about my eyebrow stuff but decided I wanted to start trying to find something less expensive than the pricey designer brands I usually use. This works pretty good so far...next time I think I will try the light...my hair is mostly light brown but a bit darker on the ends and this seems a little darker than I wanted...not too bad once I&#x27;ve gotten my eyeliner and mascara on to draw the attention away from it lol....so far I&#x27;m thinking I will try it again. I was worried it would smudge but went to a pool party here in Texas the other day and was freaking hot and sweaty and thought for sure I had lost an eyebrow...checked in the mirror, they were both still there and no smudging!</li>
            <li> I like this but sometimes when I put it on my eyebrows, then when I wore my hair down it wore smear everywhere which was annoying me. Then on top of that it felt very greasy n cheap that it wasn&#x27;t that dark on the brows. I mean for $6 you couldn&#x27;t gave me something a little better but what do you expect it a e.l.f brand</li>
            <li> Great product for thinning, lightening brows.  Goes on very easily, allows you to shape your brow exactly as you wish.  Works a lot better than powder, great staying power.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> love love love! honestly better than my 32$ eyebrow pencil. highly reccomended</li>
            <li> This works great for the price.</li>
            <li> this is the best eyebrow kit for dark brown brows. the powder is great for the begining of the brow or if you just want a suttle fill in. the gel portion of the kit is great for a more bolder look. its the perfect shade of cool brown. -XOAuriBeauty&lt;br /&gt;XOAuriBeauty.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> it has lasted me since i ordered it months ago and i use it everyday</li>
            <li> I love legs products and their prices. This is honestly the best brow kit. Love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on very well. Went to drug store and got something way better.</li>
            <li> I love this so much! Simple to use, good quality for a low price, and I love how I look with defined eyebrows. I have always hated how my eyebrows look, they are thin and very light brown (I dye my hair darker brown). Pencils always made my brows look too fake, and powder alone didn&#x27;t define them enough. But with this my eyebrows look naturally full, and it makes such a difference. Eyebrows don&#x27;t seem like a big deal, but just defining them really makes my whole face look prettier. I bought another shade for my mother and have recommended these kits to friends. Best makeup purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, I use it everyday. The reason I gave it two stars is because you can buy this at Target for $3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a long time.  It provides a natural look that doesn&#x27;t rub off easily, but removes easily with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this hasn&#x27;t been raved about a lot more, it&#x27;s a great product, and I&#x27;ve tried lots of high and low end brow products and this is def one of my favs</li>
            <li> Oh my word, this stuff is GREAT! I was nervous to attempt doing my own eyebrows, but it&#x27;s so simple with this kit. I was also worried (I have dark brown hair) that this color would be too light. It was perfect. Elf has done it again. I considered buying a more expensive kit, but when my salon recommended this one, I tried it. I love it so much that I&#x27;ve purchased an additional one as a backup. :)</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. Product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Got it with free 2-day shipping! Great product</li>
            <li> Love using this product! Arrived on time and no issues!</li>
            <li> Everything SHIPPED perfectly and well within time before prom. I however managed to get the wrong color. The color was not dark enough for my eye brows. I have dark brown skin and at the time my eye brows were sparse and needed a small fill in.I did try the product out and it was creamy and a great texture, ran on smooth but I chose the wrong color so of course it couldn&#x27;t blend with my eyebrows. My sister enjoyed this product however. I have nearly black eyebrows, hopefully I get it right the next time around.</li>
            <li> I love certain e.l.f products but i wasnt a fan of the eyebrow gel i had to cake on a lot in order to see any difference when filling in my brow</li>
            <li> This product works well and is as described. It stays put if you use the powder after the gel.</li>
            <li> Well..I am not a fan..the brush is flimsy and the gel doesn&#x27;t really do much :(..waste of money!</li>
            <li> The best! Leaves my brows on fleek 😉</li>
            <li> i have very thin eyebrows, so i was very excited to find this product. i ordered it with a few other items and almost missed it entirely because it was so small. i like the gel and powder duo, and it works just like it says it does. you can make your eyebrows darker without having to draw distinct lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i wish the application stick was a little longer and easier to hold, but i guess that&#x27;s the price of having a small package.</li>
            <li> I got this today and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but it is amazing! I have thin eyebrows and it makes them fuller and keeps a natural look. So happy with the product, will keep on buying! Highly recommend 😊</li>
            <li> Works well for the price!</li>
            <li> Love this item. Quality is pretty good for the cost. I have fair skin, light brown hair and medium/dark brown brows and this kit is just slightly too dark if applied too heavily although it  can be sheered down to match better (which is how i use it) Color payoff is excellent and I use it in conjunction with a brow pencil to get a more exact line! I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. What can I say? e.l.f. products rock! I will be ordering the light, too.</li>
            <li> Brush that is included is lacking and the color block fell out when I first opened it.</li>
            <li> This kit gives you a defined, yet very natural eyebrow look. The wax sets the hairs and lays a color basis and the powder smooths the look out making it even more natural looking. Although the powder is much lighter than the wax it works great! (I was skeptical at first about that). You get a large quantity of product for your buck. Also, this is $3 on the ELF website so a great value!</li>
            <li> I love this! I&#x27;ve used it every day for three months and I only just hit the pan!!! And there&#x27;s still a ton left in it!!! It&#x27;s awesome, my only gripe is that the brush is annoying to use, lol.</li>
