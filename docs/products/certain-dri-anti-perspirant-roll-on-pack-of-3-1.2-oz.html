            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I still had a great deal of burning and stinging.</li>

            <li>well can&#x27;t be good for you...</li>
            <li>I gave this product 1 star even though it does work really good.</li>
            <li>Prior to this, I&#x27;ve always looked for the perfect anti-perspirant, trying to find that perfect one for me.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It could take days, weeks or even months to find the right amount of usage that will produce perfect results.</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>

            <li>I LOVE this deodorant!  </li>
            <li>In fact, it worked better than the prescription my doctor gave me!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>Perfect, does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Husband and son love it!</li>
            <li>Will order more as needed!</li>

            <li>Product works amazing, hope everyone having doubts on this product will try it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Amazing anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>Amazing thats all I can say.</li>
            <li>As the others reviews said, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It feels so amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is still working amazing.</li>
            <li>This deodorant used to work amazingly on me...until they changed to the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; thicker formula.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>now i am in my 40&#x27;s and have discovered this product, and it was really amazing that no sweat is shown in my armpit anymore.</li>
            <li>Nowadays, I use this every time I go to bed, no matter what, and since 3 months of use I can honestly say that it has changed my life.</li>
            <li>I no longer need any kind of daytime antiperspirant or deodorant</li>
            <li>Well, it looked like it was from the 80&#x27;s and kind of hokey, but why not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really the best way to kill sweat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the product to work effectively</li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance</li>
            <li>you do kind of build up a tolerance to it</li>
            <li>/&gt;if applied abundantly</li>
            <li>then I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I might as well start my own water-purification plant and start selling my own bottle water from my perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rather, what it contains is quite a lot of aluminum chloride and this blend is highly effective in dramatically reducing the amount you sweat.</li>
            <li>if you jump in a pool and swim some, when you get out this product will still be surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li>I wear, and I have no issue taking my coat off even if I was warm for an extended period.</li>
            <li>With that kind of effectiveness, this product is a 10 out of 5</li>

            <li>With that kind of effectiveness, this product is a 10 out of 5</li>
            <li>To be honest I didn&#x27;t think it would work</li>
            <li>Not recommended and don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so popular.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a sweating issue, but did find that deodorants kind of quit on me by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It works great and is very economical.</li>
            <li>Especially my right one.</li>
            <li>I hear the roll-on is much more effective than the bar kind of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great, changed my life, pain goes away with time, don&#x27;t apply directly after a shower.orks great, changed my life</li>
            <li>Overall, a good deal on an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I still use deodorant just for the good smell, but am fine going without, still don&#x27;t sweat.</li>
            <li>I still use deodorant just for the good smell, but am fine going without, still don&#x27;t sweat.</li>
            <li>, honestly, you made my life so much better.</li>
            <li>I know I sound like an ad for this product, but that&#x27;s just how good it&#x27;s been for me.</li>
            <li>I believe that it is more effective.</li>
            <li>good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)</li>
            <li>I have found it works the most effectively, lasts the longest, and doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li>All of my expectation with this product is by far the best I&#x27;ve used for my under arm</li>
            <li>It seems to be the most effective this way.</li>
            <li>heck if you ask me, I&#x27;d go through a good amount of pain knowing that I can freely lift my arms up and not look like I have 2</li>
            <li>good news is that it costs less than Gillette Clinical Strength to which makes me happy lol.</li>
            <li>so I bought this one and now I&#x27;m extremely happy, since the first application my arm pits aren&#x27;t sweaty anymore</li>
            <li>(the solid is also very good!)</li>
            <li>love this product, been using it for years and years now when nothing else has ever worked (prescriptions, clinical strengths, etc etc).</li>
            <li>love the 3 pack</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>Most others have like 15 ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>After using it for one day I can say that I am incredibly satisfied.</li>
            <li>I must say that I am extremely pleased about how this product works.</li>
            <li>By chance I happened upon this product online, and now I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anywho, I know this works for many people</li>
            <li>I bough this product and i love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this</li>
            <li>Is this magic?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than satisfied, I&#x27;m amazed.</li>
            <li>Boy was I glad I did.</li>
            <li>, my face perspires more.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I took a shower and made sure all the deodorant remnants were gone and didn&#x27;t shave.</li>
            <li>I woke up in the morning and took a shower and didn&#x27;t wash my armpits to make sure it stayed on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so great not to be embarrassed about sweating so much.</li>
            <li>Stockpile it too, before someone realizes that it works TOO good and raises the price to the hundreds of dollars, because that&#x27;s what its really worth.</li>

            <li>Stockpile it too, before someone realizes that it works TOO good and raises the price to the hundreds of dollars, because that&#x27;s what its really worth.</li>
            <li>This product does control sweating better than most over the counter anti-perspirants, but after using a couple days, it burned when applying.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to follow directions, and NEVER use it after you shave.  </li>
            <li>They are much better than any antipersperant roll-on that I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>But I LOVE this anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>My intention is to warn people to MAKE SURE this stuff dries BEFORE you put your shirt on.</li>
            <li>Of course if you put this on at night &amp; go to bed without a shirt on you&#x27;ll be ok</li>
            <li>, from a biological standpoint, if you cut sweat off somewhere, it&#x27;s gonna pop up elsewhere on your body, so don&#x27;t be alarmed if you start to sweat more from say your neck or wider body surface area.</li>
            <li>then, if it works for a gal like me with typical/moderate hyperhidrosis, I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>, so don&#x27;t be alarmed if you start to sweat more from say your neck or wider body surface area.</li>
            <li>then, if it works for a gal like me with typical/moderate hyperhidrosis, I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>sure to pick up a DEODORANT, in addition to this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how many doubts you have...</li>
            <li>you still sweat, try applying more swipes.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think this product could impress me any more than it did 4 months ago...</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t think this product could impress me any more than it did 4 months ago...</li>
            <li>Now I can wear a suit or dress more than once without needing to get it drycleaned to get rid of the pit stains.  </li>
            <li>Seems most of the anti-perspirants on the market today have aluminum.</li>
            <li>Does what it says it will do, and for a fraction of the cost of many competing brands.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure when I go out</li>
            <li>you travel, be sure to place this inside a ziplock bag.</li>
            <li>Have to make sure you put it on EVERY night and</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>I just make sure I trim my armpits on the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; day.</li>
            <li>and it seems most people use it that way),</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried it</li>
            <li>and I feel like I sweat more with the roll on method.  </li>
            <li>And remember; it&#x27;s okay to skip a day or two now and then.</li>
            <li>And remember; it&#x27;s okay to skip a day or two now and then.</li>
            <li>With this product, I&#x27;m able to wear anything I want.</li>
            <li>second time of purchasing this product is a excellent sweat preventer.</li>
            <li>The study online says most users witnessed a reduction of perspiration for 5 days.</li>
            <li>:) :) :)</li>
            <li>, the next day I didn&#x27;t sweat, great!</li>
            <li>Ok, so like many of the people who have commented on this, I sweat a ton from my underarms.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of the over the counter \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 stars - it&#x27;s given me a lot more confidence to know that I don&#x27;t look like a sweaty pig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It used to be my favorite product</li>
            <li>I am sooooo pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The thing that worried me most about it was the itching.</li>
            <li>Did still sweat more</li>
            <li>Now I do use more on both underarms then recommended.</li>
            <li>It said 2 swipes on each arm, I do more then that.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more then that.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work, but according to the review I saw before I bought the item, some people have much more severe condition than I do, and they said the product worked 100%.</li>
            <li>And it makes me incredibly self conscious about myself.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>Some sweat more than others, and some sweat has a more noticeable odor.</li>
            <li>Stress can accelerate not just the quantity of sweat, but also make a more concentrated odor.</li>
            <li>For most people, that means applying around bedtime.</li>

            <li>, I tried many antiperspirant brands with no avail (rexona, degree, gillete etc).  </li>
            <li>I use to think it was because I was over weight that I over-sweated but have recently lost 80 pounds and in the best shape of my life and visiting the gym 4 days a week.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>it was more of a prolonging before I started sweating.</li>
            <li>I am very happy to say this actually works.</li>
            <li>I have been using this since 2008, and love it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to store upright so that the bottle doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, I had astronomical expectations for the sweat that was pouring from my armpits</li>
            <li>Stuff really does work!!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will buy again for this great price.</li>
            <li>Very good! , ues for a long times per bottle /  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>This is an absolutely wonderful product at keeping you dry.</li>
            <li>This is the best product, it truly works, I could never live without it.</li>
            <li>Go right to the top!</li>
            <li>This brand is very good for those people who have pit wetting problems (PWP) but their PWP is not severe enough to be medicated.</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>This Certain Dri PM roll-on is more effective than the PM stick version, containing a more aggressive antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>This Certain Dri PM roll-on is more effective than the PM stick version, containing a more aggressive antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>Be safe and hopefully sweat free.</li>
            <li>it is most effective for the first 36-48 hours.)</li>
            <li>it is most effective for the first 36-48 hours.)</li>
            <li>This Roll-On can stain clothing when freshly applied, and so applying it at night makes it easier to avoid staining your nice dress</li>

            <li>When I used it for the first time in February, I can honestly say that that was the best $8.00 I ever spent.</li>
            <li>This bothered me greatly, often accelerating stress, and ultimately making me sweat more.</li>
            <li>If I used 8 or so to cover my whole pit, it was more effective, but the itching was too severe then to make it usable</li>
            <li>The product is too strong and corrosive for my underarms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very in love with Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>but this is the first time I experienced this whilst using certain dri.</li>
            <li>I have even had to avoid buying tops in certain fabrics and colors but not any more!  </li>
            <li>It works fine whether I shower it off in the morning OR leave it on.</li>
            <li>I find that applying it an hour or so after showering is best because skin is clean, pores are open, and the medication can be effectively absorbed.</li>
            <li>For others, 48-72 hours is fine.</li>

            <li>For others, 48-72 hours is fine.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ok for a quick spray of deodorant in the morning</li>
            <li>I have been using Certain Dry for many years with reliably excellent results.  </li>
            <li>Certain Dri lives up to it&#x27;s claim of combating underarm wetness and does an amazing job at that.</li>
            <li>What I do, because its NOT a deodorant, I put certain dri on at night then give a swipe of my daily deodorant in te morning and it works flawlessly!</li>
            <li>Friends and family would comment on the huge sweat stains on my shirts because of my armpits :</li>
            <li>But heck if you ask me, I&#x27;d go through a good amount of pain knowing that I can freely lift my arms up and not look like I have 2 sexually aroused underarms.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>My adderall prescription made me very likely to sweat a great deal.  </li>
            <li>It is important to take the time to read the instructions that come in the box just once and \\&quot;use as directed\\&quot;, if you do this it will lead to satisfactory results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not wear light colored shirts because of sweat stains.</li>
            <li>, I no longer have to worry about anti-perspirant stains on my clothes or about cheap anti-perspirant fragrance smells either.</li>
            <li>although I can tell that it&#x27;s wearing off by then (although even on the last day, sweating is still greatly reduced from the level it was before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am anxiety free now</li>
            <li>Important thing is to follow instructions.</li>
            <li>Living without fear of wet armpits is incredibly freeing.</li>
            <li>It may burn more, but it is entirely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a definite win if you have underarm wetness</li>
            <li>It used to be that my shirts were soaked by noon, and now, I&#x27;m sweat free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the fourth day and it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
            <li>The anti-perspirant is effective in my case, so I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>just when I know I will have an important event or if I want to wear a white/light colored clothes that will show sweat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1) I start perspiring once I get out of the showers, although it&#x27;s light perspiration&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable and don&#x27;t perspire at all.</li>
            <li>wear colored and light shirts now, I wear tighter shirts with confidence again.</li>
            <li>To boost the effectiveness, I also bought the A.M. solid, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I no longer have a monochromatic wardrobe, I can use color shirts and will not stain them, there is absolutely NOTHING that gives more confidence for someone who suffered from hyperhidrosys than being able to lift your arms without any sign of sweat.</li>
            <li>Overall, this can really help people out and thats awesome.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that is fresh and appropriate for both guys and girls.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that is fresh and appropriate for both guys and girls.</li>
            <li>totally worth it in my opinion!  </li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>You apply it in the evening before you go to bed - it is NOT scented and yes it will burn on a freshly shaved underarm ( but it tells you so in the instructions !) .</li>
            <li>So the first night I put it on and it did itch some, but at the most I noticed the itch off and on for about an hour.</li>
            <li>I was finally able to wear normal clothes again!!</li>
            <li>This really helped me, having sweaty free hands made me feel better and over time it stopped.</li>
            <li>It is a strong product and does make me itch and burn for a while after I apply it but is worth it to not feel embarrassed all the time by perspiration stains.</li>
            <li>Certain dri was about $5 a box and worked so much better.</li>
            <li>found Certain Dri on Amazon about two months ago and it has been fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Both my daughter and I use Certain Dri and we love it.</li>
            <li>nothing special, so i will never buy it again</li>
            <li>Certain Dri Roll-On many months ago</li>
            <li>It’s nice when a product works EXACTLY as advertised, which Certain Dri PM Roll-On does.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri Roll-On the best, hands down.</li>
            <li>This strictly only stops the sweating, and it&#x27;s damn good at it.</li>
            <li>Everything you hear about this product is true.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a roller ball on top and underneath is the liquid, which is very water-like.</li>
            <li>To start off you might need to apply 3 nights or more in a row before it really kicks in -</li>
            <li>Some nights more than others, probably depending on how much I put on.  </li>
            <li>is their daily-use stick product that contains both an antiperspirant AND a deodorant, and is often considered more gentle on skin than the AM Roll-On.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The other \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; products out there (you know the ones, that come in a more traditional deodorant form), but this one works the best, by FAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a pretty strong burn/itch for 15-20 minutes after I apply the stuff.</li>
            <li>But certain dri really works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I just used this product for the first time last night, and I am so happy with it that I decided to review it right away.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found a solution.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that it worked so well so quickly.</li>
            <li>I had super sweaty hands and it was embarrassing.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that my life has returned to normal, and this product has honestly gone a long way towards improving my daily happiness.</li>
            <li>I am a big man, so I have to use more than the 2 recommended rolls of the bottle, more like 4.</li>
            <li>I washed it with mild soap and had to put ointment on there.</li>
            <li>it super dries armpits...</li>
            <li>I still have 1.5 bottles left, and when I&#x27;m finished, I&#x27;ll be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li>Now I can wear wool and several layers of clothing, which I love in winter, and not hesitate buying the looks I love because of fear of perspiration problems.</li>
            <li>After using this I can honestly say that no other antiperspirant/deodorant products should exist, and I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it for people who perspire a lot.</li>
            <li>Sounds like Review Spamming, probably in an effort to have high reviews and thus more sales of the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true miracle in how fast it works, you get obvious results right away which is great.</li>
            <li>Better than just normal deodorant in that it is odorless</li>
            <li>and it is very hot</li>
            <li>: Ok its been a few months, and I have decided that maybe this isn&#x27;t quite soooo amazing as I made it out to be originally.</li>
            <li>for guys: I also found trimming down your pit hair (i&#x27;m a beast) helps a lot in its own, but also helps since this stuff can make better contact with your skin.</li>
            <li>You need to use this a day in between at first, then your body gets used to it and it becomes a once a month thing!</li>
            <li>I went to the zoo, on a hot day, and nothing!</li>
            <li>As it is, I apply it right before bed, and take melatonin to help me fall asleep quickly</li>
            <li>Being able to use it every few days makes this even GREATER of a deal!</li>
            <li>Use the Certain Dri AM every morning as a regular deoderant and you&#x27;ll be good to go.  </li>
            <li>Even tried the Certain Dri solid and it was not as good as the roll-on.</li>
            <li>But let&#x27;s be honest, if you&#x27;re buying this product, you probably prefer a little stinging to sweating profusely through your sweater on a winter day, I might be exxagerating here :), not to mention the heat of summer.</li>
            <li>I would definally recommend this product to anyone with presperation issues and wants a prescription free treatment that works[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I was recently at a symposium to watch some presentations and noticed many of the nervous speakers had huge sweat stains.</li>
            <li>short, this baby is frigging amazing.</li>
            <li>In short, this baby is frigging amazing.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Hope others find some success with this too.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money-</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>But they also figured, heh it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li>product!o keep a fresh smell in your underarms, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been buying colorful tops because I no longer have to worry about pit stains.  </li>
            <li>you must apply it at night for it to be effective the next day</li>
            <li>I use any old brand on top of it just for a scent I like.  </li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t completely eliminate my sweat, I wouldn&#x27;t have used it more than once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also taken to keeping an aloe lotion beside my bed, and sometimes applying this is effective enough to reduce the itching to a bearable level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the confidence that comes with knowing I don&#x27;t have sweat spots on my clothing is worth the temporary discomfort and disruptions to my sleep.</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>everything(Even using powder to absorbed some sweat),</li>
            <li>As someone who has suffered from overactive sweatglands finding a good antiperspirant has been a lifelong challenge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $12 to even just try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>know this review is early, but I will be sure to give another one in a couple of months to see if it&#x27;s still working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fresh all day&#x27;s long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>relay difference is that you will need to apply this product more frequently than say using Drysol.  </li>
            <li>Its totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Irritation was mild for the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Def better than the high price anti per spirants but be ware of the possibility of it ruining certain colored clothes.</li>
            <li>Yet this had been on the shelf right in front of me for years.</li>
            <li>reading reviews - and buy this right now.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably because I used it right after I got out of the shower</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways my underarm stayed dry for a good 2 full days, and since i had some important function on the 3rd, i decided to apply again before I sleep.</li>
            <li>Anyways my underarm stayed dry for a good 2 full days, and since i had some important function on the 3rd, i decided to apply again before I sleep.</li>
            <li>Health wise; I&#x27;m not sure how healthy such strong antiperspirant can be for the body.</li>
            <li>Drysol continues to be the only home remedy that is effective enough to control the problem in most individuals suffering from this</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if my armpits are that attractive, sweaty or not sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product; I have used 3 other clinical strength deodorants that didn&#x27;t reduce my sweat, let alone eliminate it for 3 full days like this product does.</li>
            <li>I tried Certain Dri, but found just 1-2 strokes wasn&#x27;t effective enough for me.</li>
            <li>but I recommend finding it locally and just purchasing one bottle for about $5 just to make sure it works first!</li>
            <li>Have noticed a little more sweating in my feet but would gladly trade armpit sweating for that.  </li>
            <li>I use this every other night and it strong most of the wetness</li>
            <li>This approach paired up with a Thompson Tee (new company that makes t-shirts with sew-in sweat guards under the armpits that are WAY more comfortable than any other sweat guards I have used (tried a bunch) - gotta search it on Google) for those more intense circumstances where my hyperhidrosis may act up, has been a bullet proof solution for me.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t live in fear of having huge pit stains as i walk around town.</li>
            <li>Will always re-purchase Certain Dri!</li>
            <li>Thank you, Certain Dri!</li>
            <li>Thank you Certain Dri!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product because my job requires me to wear clothing with sleeves, and it was embarrassing how I would show sweat spots on my shirt when in situations with high heat, stress or activity.</li>
            <li>Product arrived very quickly and WORKS-IF you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It really works from the very first day.</li>
            <li>When you sweat as much as I do (and I&#x27;m sure that there&#x27;s a big chance that you do), you can&#x27;t reach up to grab items off high shelves, give someone a good hug, write something on the high portion of a whiteboard, and so many other things.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I found a very unusual use for this product: I had a kitten who kept me awake all night licking my face.</li>
            <li>I have been using the solid and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Felt the immediate difference on the first day</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered the three pack (with such outstanding reviews</li>
            <li>After looking up the treatment I saw that most of the antiperspirants listed were prescription only.</li>
            <li>This was the only product that I was easily able to find that was not.</li>
            <li>My first try was Secrect clinical protection, however the results weren&#x27;t as well as I hoped expectially for $9 a stick.</li>
            <li>I imagine most of it was just a psychological response to not wanting to sweat.  </li>
            <li>so be aware and plan ahead.</li>
            <li>Obviously at first they figured...</li>
            <li>My underarm sweat has decreased incredibly since using this product,</li>
            <li>It does burn at first</li>
            <li>I use the roll-on (works better for me than the solid)</li>
            <li>At first I was apprehensive to buying it because I didn&#x27;t think it will work.  </li>
            <li>First off, what you&#x27;re wanting to know, does it work?</li>
            <li>This is exactly how this product makes your hands feel.</li>
            <li>The first day I got the product, I put it to the test.</li>
            <li>at first I thought this was for people who sweat at night, but you have to do this no matter what.&lt;br</li>
            <li>C&#x27;mon, if you&#x27;re really hot no matter what you will sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure that it a deodorant only, because this WON&#x27;T protect you against odor, it&#x27;s not supposed to.</li>
            <li>only wish I found my love for this product sooner in life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, and I read many of the reviews before deciding to trust the product, I thought that this would definitely help my issue.</li>
            <li>first time I used it</li>
            <li>First night I decided to try it one more time next night and see.</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>For some reason when the summer rolls around and I am on BC, my pits destroys my pretty dresses and summer tops.</li>
            <li>First: the product.</li>
            <li>Nearly everyone gives it a 5 start rating and many of the reviews sound the same.</li>
            <li>Use it exactly how it says.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t use too much of it at once!</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t use too much of it at once!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to exaggerate, but if any product on Amazon has ever changed my life for the better, this is definitely it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the next morning everything would be ok</li>
            <li>so he gets pretty hot and</li>
            <li>The first day I applied it there was some stinging</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last more then 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is known as a first try for hyperhydrosis though,</li>
            <li>I tried it on the first time</li>
            <li>applied at night it will visibly dimish sweat over the next day (says it hold for more days...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real confidence booster and worth a shot.</li>
            <li>This is one of only two deodorants I have been able to use because of allergies.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>at best leave your clothes smelling like stale deodorant anyway or don&#x27;t work like promised.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Now, be aware this product may create a burning or itching sensation during the first 30 minutes after application.</li>
            <li>It stung the first time I applied this.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it would.</li>
            <li>Still on the first one from the three pack after about of 6-7 month of sporadic use.</li>
            <li>first thing that&#x27;s gonna hit you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty damn</li>
            <li>It still stings, and it still hurts pretty intensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different deodorant/antiperspirant products, including some of the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; products sold over the counter.</li>
            <li>but in the first week when u miss it sweat will come again..</li>
            <li>I used it first time for three nights in a row, and it lasted for 48 hours.</li>
            <li>I used it again for two more nights and it actually lasted for three days.  </li>
            <li>Yesterday I put on the product for the first time and today....</li>
            <li>This product really does work!</li>
            <li>This performs exactly as it is suppose to perform.  </li>
            <li>just an FYI: if you try ZeroSweat exactly according to directions</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My cursory examination of several products on the shelf at the drug store revealed that most contain 10-12% aluminum.</li>
            <li>I have had a super sweaty underarm problem since high school</li>
            <li>Actually, any amount of sweating would be much more than with Certain Dri</li>
            <li>Combine this with Old Spice original scent deodorant and the women will come flocking to you in droves.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not something pleasant to talk about, but I historically would have to specifically only buy certain color shirts, and refrain from taking my outer coat off because I felt it was noticeable.</li>
            <li>Some skin types are more sensitive than others, naturally.</li>
            <li>Some skin types are more sensitive than others, naturally.</li>
            <li>I use it the night or two before an important event because I usually sweat when I am nervous or excited and had a huge problem with having sweaty underarms.</li>
            <li>as much as this society would like you to believe that it is a medical &amp;#34; condition&amp;#34; - in reality it would actually present an advantage in warm climates as sweat has the function to cool your body.</li>
            <li>I pretty much gave up on it and had lived with the embarrassment for years afterwards.  </li>
            <li>best characterization of this product is that it is a heavy duty type of antiperspirant for normal people that will work for those who do not suffer the type of excessive sweating that those who have hyperhidrosis do, but who sweat more than normal</li>
            <li>First, it is a miracle product - it really does work as advertised.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m sitting at my desk at work, I pretty much just sweat non-stop sometimes</li>
            <li>, I had a pretty intense day, running/jogging around + lifting stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I had a pretty intense day, running/jogging around + lifting stuff.    </li>
            <li>It still stings, and it still hurts pretty intensely.    </li>
            <li>The severity of my sweating is pretty intense like sweating through jackets.</li>
            <li>The product soaks into your sweat pores and pretty much clogs them up.</li>
            <li>First let me mention that I live in Southeast Asia where it is very very humid and always hot.</li>
            <li>I had incredible results right away; I went from heavy to minimal perspiration.</li>
            <li>Following these directions, I&#x27;ve had good results, staying pretty dry even in stressful summer heat.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your armpits are completely dry when applying it.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it as directed, which is applying it to a dry underarm at night before bed.</li>
            <li>3 strokes will do the job and make sure your underarms are dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pretty much given up really, and was looking towards going to the doctors to get some sorta prescription strength</li>
            <li>Might be possible with how strong it is.</li>
            <li>Might be possible with how strong it is.</li>
            <li>At any rate sweat is meant to keep you cool and rid your body of a few toxins so it wouldn&#x27;t be rational or healthy to expect ZERO sweat from your body</li>
            <li>At any rate sweat is meant to keep you cool and rid your body of a few toxins so it wouldn&#x27;t be rational or healthy to expect ZERO sweat from your body</li>
            <li>The product isn&#x27;t as strong as Drysol but works almost the same.  </li>
            <li>FYI, the Certain Dri does have a strong talc smell when you apply it, which is also why I like to use the nice-smelling Certain Dri AM as my daily deoderant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Certain Dri for over a year now.</li>
            <li>but since the Certain Dri Roll-On Anti-Perspirant 1.2</li>
            <li>I have come to realized that Certain dri is a treatment.</li>
            <li>so I guess I never considered Certain Dri because it was a roll on.</li>
            <li>, I tried certain dri.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews about Certain Dri here on Amazon</li>
            <li>-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>Certain</li>
            <li>I discovered Certain Dri.  </li>
            <li>Certain Dri claims to stop perspiration for 72 hours ...</li>
            <li>so I went on-line, looking at another product, and found Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>and I wil certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li>Then one day on the bottom shelf I saw Certain Dri and thought what the heck it is cheaper than what I had in my basket.</li>
            <li>There are two things you need to know about Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri</li>
            <li>Up popped suggestions for Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re having an underarm sweating problem, get Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want to apply it, before using the Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>use antiperspirant deodorant in conjunction with certain dri.</li>
            <li>After my Prosthetist recommend Certain DRI and gave me a sample,  I knew it would be a permanent part of my routine.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the Certain Dri anywhere.</li>
            <li>because when I use Certain Dri, I don&#x27;t sweat at ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, using the product does make your underarms sting.</li>
            <li>After reading about Certain Dri on a blog I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>That is, until I found Certain Dri here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>After finding Certain Dri</li>
            <li>Certain Dri Clinical Strength Anti-Perspirant Roll-On” AKA the PM</li>
            <li>It does not have a scent and is a pure antiperspirant (i.e., not a deodorant.)</li>
            <li>It does not have a scent and is a pure antiperspirant (i.e., not a deodorant.)</li>
            <li>WELL DOES CERTAIN DRI WORK???&lt;br /&gt;Certain</li>
            <li>This PM Roll-On is the workhorse of the Certain Dri family.</li>
            <li>As this is a pure antiperspirant, it needs to be applied a period of time BEFORE being required to work as the act of shrinking the pores is not immediate.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri&#x27;s PM Roll-On literally has made this a non-issue for me.</li>
            <li>As this is a pure antiperspirant, it needs to be applied a period of time BEFORE being required to work as the act of shrinking the pores is not immediate.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri&#x27;s PM Roll-On literally has made this a non-issue for me.</li>
            <li>The day after I started using Certain Dri</li>
            <li>Used to botox my pits, now I just use certain dri.</li>
            <li>After browsing the internet for a solution, I came upon Certain Dri Roll-On Antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>This item really worked as described, and in my case for a little more than 72 hours!</li>
            <li>It got to the point that I had to avoid wearing certain types of colors or even tops (think nice tight tank tops with sleeves) or leggings on certain days to avoid embarrassment.</li>
            <li>I hope this doesn&#x27;t scare you off :) Even despite the slight discomfort, it&#x27;s still SO worth it.</li>
            <li>Works so good while I&#x27;m sweating at the gym, the only dry spots are my underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t clear up your pit sweat after the first use, don&#x27;t give up!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;IF you use Certain Dri as instructed, at night and use daily for a week or two then gradually start skipping days, the results are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started using Certain Dri a few weeks ago and it works great.</li>
            <li>Recently I started using it in conjuction with the Chlorophyll  gel tablets, a fantastic body deodorizer, and I don&#x27;t need to use Certain Dri as much.</li>
            <li>While giving a presentation, using hand gestures or writing on the whiteboard only to reveal huge puddles of sweat.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>started using this product a few months ago after I read some amazing reviews online.</li>
            <li>I use this every few days and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>and you will never have burning or itching no matter how much you use it.</li>
            <li>This discovery was thanks to my husband who forgot to bring his deodorant on vacation.  </li>
            <li>I either had to run around in my camisole with the blazer off (very unprofessional looking) or try to hide the growing pit stains by lunch (</li>
            <li>My armpits used to be very sweaty and I have tried almost every product out there.</li>
            <li>You have to use it before bed, not before you take a shower at night because then it gets very itchy.</li>
            <li>This is a drastic improvement that really drastically improved my self confidence throughout the day.</li>
            <li>cause my pits itched too much).</li>
            <li>Sweat Block works for me, but it&#x27;s really expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell if its really working.</li>
            <li>Its crazy amazing how it works!!!</li>
            <li>but it was very manageable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I started to sweat so profusely in my armpits, but it was a real problem and it caused me distress.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well on my hands</li>
            <li>but I got really sweaty hands.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Nanoshu it every morning after a shower and forget the whole day.</li>
            <li>I am very displeased with the product</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a very liberating experience.  </li>
            <li>I used to sweat like that, no matter how much anti-perspirant I put on.</li>
            <li>and it absolutely worked wonders for me.  </li>
            <li>I always thought that I sweat so much because I was nervous.</li>
            <li>Turns out sweating so much was what was making me nervous.</li>
            <li>just so I don&#x27;t forget to put it on, but have gone whole weekends without putting any on and it has worked for the whole time.</li>
            <li>Very thankful I found this stuff.</li>
            <li>Did not irritate my skin and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>it really does put an end to perspiration.  </li>
            <li>does feel itchy if you use too much.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t put on too much or it can burn a bit, I would recommend using it every couple of days, and not every day.</li>
            <li>I am wearing light clothing so as not to draw attention to the massive sweat stain.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I think that is caused by using too much.  </li>
            <li>applied the product before going to bed really thinking</li>
            <li>but i was ready to try anything ( even considered botox injections in the sweat glands) and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product in stores and it really, really works and for that I give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>I figure if I put in on every 24 hours, it really doesn&#x27;t matter what time of day I put it on.  </li>
            <li>This has been a real life-saver.  </li>
            <li>this really works.</li>
            <li>Piling up the product WILL make it more painful and will most likely (as it did for me) turn your underarms bright red.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>product works but be ready to get the side effects.</li>
            <li>I could not believe it, I even had a light gray(almost white in colour), and not a drop.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the price is quite reasonable, too.</li>
            <li>I was putting on so much deodorant that my clothes were getting stained.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Before finding this deodorant I tried everything and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>Works VERY well...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend , works as promised!</li>
            <li>I ordered mine (which showed up much sooner then the estimated shipment date) and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>This really helps with sweaty underarms.</li>
            <li>and I applied too much.</li>
            <li>Not so much because of the smell</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not unbearable, but they are intense.</li>
            <li>a whole day of errand running.</li>
            <li>3, Went for a whole afternoon of wakeboarding + party after that.</li>
            <li>It really does, and it really</li>
            <li>they are intense.</li>
            <li>a whole day of errand running.</li>
            <li>Day 3, Went for a whole afternoon of wakeboarding + party after that.</li>
            <li>It really does, and it really hurts.    </li>
            <li>dont put on too much.</li>
            <li>It is not as aggressive of an antiperspirant as the Roll-On version, but it is still quite capable.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think it would work</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and this didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>Drysol works on severe hyperhidrosis but it may only be available through prescription.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>The bar version didn&#x27;t work for me at all really...</li>
            <li>to be clear - you need to follow the instructions (depending on your condition though you might need more swipes initially than the bottle says).</li>
            <li>I waited a few months before writing my review because I thought the effects might wear off, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I ordered the solid which is supposed to be better for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>In 20 years, I only ruined one top (an old t-shirt)</li>
            <li>: DO NOT USE WITH OLD SPICE PRODUCTS#!!!</li>
            <li>I have been using Certain Dri for over 15 years now, and it is easily the one product I could not live without.  </li>
            <li>All they ever did was stain my clothes with a lovely, hard to clean gunk + sweat</li>
            <li>I tried this for 6 days hoping it would start working for me like it does for so many other people.</li>
            <li>but I find that it starts losing the fight after more like 50 or so, so I re-apply every other night.</li>
            <li>It does cost more than other deodorants</li>
            <li>Losing your favorite work shirts due to sweat stains in the armpit</li>
            <li>Has really improved my confidence, and generally made my life better (for example: not having to carry around an extra dress shirt for work because the one I put on in the morning had pitted out).</li>
            <li>I am finally able to wear some shirts (in lighter colors) that I couldn&#x27;t even two weeks ago due to armpit stains.</li>
            <li>Well, search no more - if used properly, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>The only problem is having to apply it every night, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the joy of stopping unwanted sweat.</li>
            <li>The first week or two, I used it nearly every day, but as others have mentioned, you begin not needing it as much anymore.</li>
            <li>So i thought ok maybe its not wet enough to soak through.</li>
            <li>So i thought ok maybe its not wet enough to soak through.</li>
            <li>It will prevent excessive perspiring for 1-3 days but make sure you use some kind of moisturizer on your underarms the day after you applied certain dri if you have dry or sensitive</li>
            <li>Even while using a clinical deodorant (which does make me sweat less than a bargain-brand deodorant), the amount of sweat I have is much more than with Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>However - if applied like suggested on skin that is not broken or shaved it should not burn ( and this comes from someone with a very sensitive skin and eczema! ).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product because of how much a difference it made for me.</li>
            <li>Almost no wetness on super hot days and no wetness on other hot days or normal days!</li>
            <li>I live in a tropical climate and even after a full day of work/travel I do not wet</li>
            <li>This product is the first one ever that shows results and works even for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If I even skip one day, the problem begins to come back in full force</li>
            <li>It’s antiperspirant action is comparable to many other premium over-the-counter antiperspirants, but is nowhere near as strong as the Certain Dri PM products above.</li>
            <li>It’s antiperspirant action is comparable to many other premium over-the-counter antiperspirants, but is nowhere near as strong as the Certain Dri PM products above.</li>
            <li>I use Certain Dri, the roll on kind, on my forehead before I go to bed, and I hardly sweat from my head anymore.</li>
            <li>This is supposedly a new and improved formula but it simply does not work as well as the original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special, but it will make you feel a little better since you only apply this one once a day at night.</li>
            <li>The more you use it the less it burns.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that that gives me more than enough anti-perspirant to last two days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought several more bottles since then and will keep buying it in the future.</li>
            <li>For most of my life anti-perspirant did the opposite for me - it actually made my armpits sweat profusely.</li>
            <li>I used to have to avoid buying certain shirt types because I&#x27;d soak right through my undershirt into the outside</li>
            <li>sure it works differently for different people.</li>
            <li>It puts just everything else you can buy without a prescription (and some you can buy only with a prescription) to shame, and many physicians consider it the product of choice to manage a medical condition that can cause profuse sweating.</li>
            <li>It puts just everything else you can buy without a prescription (and some you can buy only with a prescription) to shame, and many physicians consider it the product of choice to manage a medical condition that can cause profuse sweating.</li>
            <li>I tried every single available anti-perspiration deodorant.</li>
            <li>I happily endured it every night and found it a small price to pay for dry pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helped the sweating just like the other antiperspirants (nothing special) but it broke me out on my face!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I still highly recommend the product though.</li>
            <li>Over the next few weeks it actually seemed like the product was working better and better.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>If you have problems with sweating, I would highly recommend trying this.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend that you purchase it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend that you purchase it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend this product.</li>

            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I always feared the high five, anything that required me to lift my arms for the sweat stain and disgust that would follow.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>My first application was probably double recommended strength, and as such it burned a fair bit and kept me up for an hour or two before it calmed down.</li>
            <li>This product flat out works, more than I ever thought possible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second: I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up with the reviews on this product, but all of them seem a little to good to be true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve delt with sweaty armpits my whole adult life.</li>
            <li>a shower and have clean and dry pits before you apply this.</li>
            <li>The only &amp;#34;sweatproof&amp;#34; deorderant around that really works consistently well</li>
            <li>It can be the dead of winter, in a tank top</li>
            <li>For the last few months I had noticed that I had begun to sweat much more than normal to the point that my shirts were becoming drenched in sweat under the armpits after only 15-20 minutes of wearing them.</li>
            <li>Some people on here say if you use it enough you close the glands for good, I&#x27;m not sure about that.</li>
            <li>Some people on here say if you use it enough you close the glands for good, I&#x27;m not sure about that.</li>
            <li>First application didn&#x27;t really work, after the second it was like I just stopped sweating.  </li>
            <li>For several years I have avoided wearing anything gray or colorful because the sweat was so visible.</li>
            <li>I follow the instructions to use it at night, and I use some normal deodorant in the morning.</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s sole purpose is to protect against wetness, which it excels at; however, you will need to combine it with a deodorant of your liking in order to keep a fresh smell in your underarms, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>also use a normal antiperspirant deodorant in the morning.</li>
            <li>I read that this was a normal side effect</li>
            <li>like I sweat like a normal person, now, Instead of it being Niagara Falls.</li>
            <li>You need to read the instructions and apply it before you go to bed because it works its magic over night and is a waste if you apply it during the day...</li>
            <li>My son has had allergic reactions to other common brands, but this product Certain Dri works great.  </li>
            <li>This works better than the prescription ever did and causes less irritation!  </li>
            <li>The only problem that I encounter is that is takes a long time to dry - if I want the job done right, I take the extra couple of minutes to dry it with a hairdryer - first warm and then cool.  </li>
            <li>This makes the itching go away completely so that I can sleep soundly and awake with dry (and well moisturized) pits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely gone through many in an attempt to stay dry.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply this product sparingly because the quantity required to work is far less than it would seem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply this product sparingly because the quantity required to work is far less than it would seem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have gone through dozens of different anti-perspirant products and none of them was strong enough to stop the sweat.</li>
            <li>VOILA, I&#x27;ve put it to the test in 91 degree heat, with light colored clothing (even a top tight under the armpits) and in a meeting that had me super nervous - and having followed instructions, my pits (and other areas), remained dry (give or take a bit of sweat)</li>
            <li>About ten minutes after applying (right about when the itching starts to kick in), I apply a generous glob of lotion to each pit.</li>
            <li>The ONLY downside right now that this s</li>
            <li>The ONLY downside right now that this s</li>
            <li>So minus 1/2 for the stinging and minus 1/2 for the general inconvenience of application, but otherwise a good product</li>
            <li>, when I first put it on I get a little bit of a burning tingle, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Will post how the new one arrives.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update - Amazon sent a replacement overnight and the new boxes did not leak.</li>
            <li>Now instead of buying new shirts about every month, I have never had to throw out a shirt from underarm stain damage.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>so i felt i could live with it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it where I live</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without- remember to follow</li>
            <li>I live in the South</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 20 years, and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Finally found something that ended my underarm wetness and constant search of relevant tops and blouses to wear.</li>
            <li>It comes in a light blue &amp; white box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also comes in a light blue &amp; white box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was embarassing and making me self conscience, so, since I am a third year medical student I decided to look up the treatment for hyperhidrosis, which is the medical term for sweating more than normal.</li>
            <li>It stung a little when I applied it for the very first time, but after the first week</li>
            <li>I occasionally rotate between  dove, old spice, and right guard deodorant products</li>
            <li>I applied a little more that morning and after it dried I put a light coating of deodorant on over it.</li>
            <li>This product permantly stained two $85-$100 dress shirts because i was in too much of a hurry to let it dry on my arms first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used dozens of other \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; deo, and only CD has been able to mitigate the sweaty pits.</li>
            <li>I am almost done with my first bottle and I am going to order the 3-Pack next.</li>
            <li>I first tried the Sweat Block product that is currently the leading antiperspirant product in the market</li>
            <li>especially if its hot out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>especially if its hot out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Inability to wear normal t-shirts at home (had to wear old shirts) because they would get ruined by sweat no matter the temperature of the environment.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>have finally finished my first roll of this stuff.</li>
            <li>have finally finished my first roll of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because I have been suffering from extreme sweating for the longest time.</li>
            <li>It looks like the chemical make up is pretty similar to Drysol</li>
            <li>I applied it just one time the first night like the directions said, and I wasn&#x27;t sweating abnormally for the next 3-4 days!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t at first, but they made a big difference when I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Followed instructions exactly as stated and it simply does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, if you click on the purchaser to see other items reviews, you will notice that many have this listed as their only product.</li>
            <li>I tried CertainDri for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>I started using this product last April 2013 and for the first 2 weeks it was doing well.</li>
            <li>First time I tried it, the next day I didn&#x27;t sweat.</li>
            <li>The day after my first night of using it, I had not even a drop of sweat in my armpit the next day.</li>
            <li>The very next day after using it the first night I had no problems.</li>
            <li>so now I only use this when it&#x27;s really hot.</li>
            <li>I am wearing a silk blouse right now with no dark patches under the arms which is something I never could get away with before, even after using all the different varieties of over the counter heavy-duty antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li>Please test small amounts with different brands on different parts of your body to see if there is any reaction with your favorite types of deodorant before full blown use.</li>
            <li>The entire shirt was dark gray with sweat, except for under my arms, it was comical to the point I was showing strangers in the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Certainly better than past products but not amazing like most people describe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found a good dose amount that nearly never burns or irritates, and even if it does it only lasts a few minutes for me now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is one of the few products I have used that TRULY works through a strong antiperspirant action.</li>
            <li>Putting it on only before bed and only a few times a week sounded a little too good to be true to me, looks like it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>heartfelt thank you from my part to the people of Certain Dri</li>
            <li>Then I decided to make a compromise and give certain dri a try because while it does have aluminum in it, it doesn&#x27;t have fragrance or preservatives which is what I guess allowed it to get a low toxicity rating from ewg.org.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri Anti-Perspirant, Solid, 1.7 oz.]].</li>
            <li>It is largely ineffective for such a problem.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri is the only thing that works for me, and I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>After going through all of the anti-perspirant deodorants in the grocey store, I finally found Certain Dri on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It only took 3 days for it to begin fully working and now, i havent had sweat pits since i started using Certain Dri.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just make sure you screw the cap in as tight as possible after each use, if not the product will leak out.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the Certain Dri solid.  </li>
            <li>story short, Certain Dri is a miracle product.</li>
            <li>I then threw my open bottle of Certain Dri in the trash.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri Clinical Strength Solid Anti-Perspirant”</li>
            <li>Up until I tried Certain Dri, I went through dozens of different anti-antiperspirants to no avail.</li>
            <li>I used it again and the next day SWEAT FREE not a drop of sweat to be found, my armpits were as dry as the desert!</li>
            <li>Certain dri is a clear, roll on liquid that dries several minutes after you put it on and has never stained any of my shirts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pictures and descriptions on amazon have not been updated, the OLD formula for Certain Dri used to contain only three ingredients: Aluminum Chloride (Antiperspirant), Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), and Water.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference for everyday life</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference for everyday life</li>
            <li>To be clear ...</li>
            <li>This product would be worth the cost even if it was 10 times more expensive.</li>
            <li>However it can itch and burn if you put it directly on.</li>
            <li>Package says for sensitive skin try the stick.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice clinical strength, Gillette clinical strength, Mitchum,</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 5 days now, and the sweat on my armpits has completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>Word of advice, however, don&#x27;t ever let it near your lady&#x27;s lady-bits; Certain-Dri takes no prisoners in the war on wetness...</li>
            <li>Stops sweating completely for 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>- just wow.</li>
            <li>every day.&lt;br /&gt;During a stressful week, I completely forgot to use it,</li>
            <li>every day.&lt;br /&gt;During a stressful week, I completely forgot to use it,</li>
            <li>so I stopped using it and just stuck with Lady Mitchum (which was almost completely ineffective as an anti-perspirant).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so I was surprised of my reaction to this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin or allergies, aluminum chloride gives off a lot of acid.</li>
            <li>Now..it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li>Wow, so I have been suffering from sweaty armpit for years.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything including natural remedies and nothing has worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if I didn&#x27;t put enough on, then my sweat wouldn&#x27;t be properly absorbed and I&#x27;d get wet patches and feel really itchy.</li>
            <li>I wish they would sell me the old formula for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m extrememly self conscious about, and I feel embarrassed because of it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly two weeks and notice my sweating has reduced dramatically.</li>
            <li>People say it burns, but I felt nothing so far.</li>
            <li>obviously, I sweat too much.</li>
            <li>sexually aroused</li>
            <li>I used to use the old formula years ago that was clear and runny.</li>
            <li>before I would get out of the shower and start sweating instantly carrying on through the whole day.</li>
            <li>, pain goes away with time, don&#x27;t apply directly after a shower.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different clinical strength antiperspirants and this is the only one that I don&#x27;t have to worry about wet underarms when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to over apply, it can cause skin irritation, but 3 swipes per pit and you&#x27;ll be golden,</li>
            <li>I sweat heavily under my arms, and ruined many shirts back in the day.</li>
            <li>I roll this on at night only once a week and barely sweat (only time is 95 plus weather in full uniform with 30 lbs of gear on</li>
            <li>They have improved it by making it more thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li>NO WET SPOTS!!!</li>
            <li>In the mornings I wear just a plain old anti-perspirant/deordant more for psychological reasons or habit.</li>
            <li>It bleached the color right out of them leaving big white tie-die looking splotches on the armpits of the shirts.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with regular deodorant, however, now I&#x27;m able to just put a very thin layer of deodorant on and still feel comfortable throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I felt some burning when I was first using the product, but try to apply it on a dry underarm to lessen it.</li>
            <li>If you put it on and have water on your underarms, it seems to sting a bit, dry yourself off first.  </li>
            <li>I wait for my skin to dry some first.</li>
            <li>For me that&#x27;s my neck, which is not a bad at all, just a slight dampness.</li>
            <li>For me that&#x27;s my neck, which is not a bad at all, just a slight dampness.</li>
            <li>The first day or or two I still had a little armpit sweat but after about a week of using it every other day, my pits are nice and dry!  </li>
            <li>Before bed, I use 2-4 strokes of the Certain Dri roll-on, then leave it for just a bit to dry, and then use 4-6 swipes of the Certain Dri solid anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>After trading out my regular, bargain-brand deodorant for a clinical deodorant, I found that my sweating disappeared completely.&lt;br /&gt;About a month ago, I lost my Certain Dri bottle for a few days, which meant that my perspiration went back to a more minimal level (with the Certain Dri having been \\&quot;built up\\&quot; over time and still using a clinical deodorant).</li>
            <li>You can also try the solid version if you are particularly concerned about having overly sensitive</li>
            <li>No sweat because of Certain Dri, no smell because of regular deodorant, no wet shirts and embarrassing telltale hype rings.</li>
            <li>Definately worth a try if other anti-perspirants have not worked well for you.</li>
            <li>While shaving my armpits this morning there was some discomfort due to sensitivity of the underarm, but again, worth it for not a drop of sweat all day.</li>
            <li>the fact that you only need a small amount to work effectively, plus you do not need to apply it daily, can help reduce the risk of skin irritation.</li>
            <li>the fact that you only need a small amount to work effectively, plus you do not need to apply it daily, can help reduce the risk of skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Experienced a distinctly unpleasant burning sensation on the skin directly where I had applied it, which did not subside for quite some time.</li>
            <li>By the time I wake up, there is a faint smell of sweat, but I feel dry, and that makes me infinitely more comfortable.</li>
            <li>it really keeps you dry, I also use a day antiperspirant but finally found a product that really helped for that matter</li>
            <li>Use every other day, works better than any other product out there.</li>
            <li>Cold, warm, hot, didn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>Itch like crazy for a couple of hours, but pretty effective.</li>
            <li>My shirts never lasted long as I had to throw them away because of the stains (and smell) and I certainly would never put them in the dryer after washing, because the sweat stains would have \\&quot;set in\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>You have to be careful with how much you apply and letting it dry before doing things, but I put this on every other day on my hands and feet and am a 100% satisfied, repeat customer.</li>
            <li>It is SO nice to not have to worry about soaking shirts everyday, and keeping my arms down to hide it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone on Amazon, and in a year when I graduate and am a medical doctor, I will recommend it to all my patients as well.</li>
            <li>The next morning I was in a high stress situation, went to the restroom and checked for damage.  </li>
            <li>I read some of the reviews and was very optimistic especially when some people were reporting having to only use the product once in a couple of months after several weeks of straight use.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin,  I&#x27;d recommend slowing down the applications to ever other day or more.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it stings badly, but it eventually stops, and I have to be sure not to use too much (I&#x27;ve always used so much deodorant!!).  </li>
            <li>I read the hundreds of positive reviews (for the single bottle) and figured, for $4 or $5 each...what the heck.</li>
            <li>I am an axillary hyperhidrosis sufferer (some excessive sweating of the pits) and in a quest for some relief tried almost all types of anti-perspirant available.</li>
            <li>This is the first day in my life since puberty that I have not had wet underarms or sweat stains on my shirt.</li>
            <li>A minimal amount of stinging is perfectly normal, especially when you first start to use it.</li>
            <li>I have used many other products with no success - Not and issue here.  </li>
            <li>But you really are covered for a few days with just one application, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I use Certain Dry</li>
            <li>saw Certain Dry here on Amazon and figured what the heck it can&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li>I happened upon certain dry by chance, while at CVS.</li>
            <li>Have not hardly sweat at all except when working out at the gym which is totally acceptable to me!  </li>
            <li>With only 2-4 strokes of the roll-on it&#x27;s not as itchy, and even if it is a bit, I find the Certain Dri solid provides a bit of relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still use my regular deodorant (Degree), but that&#x27;s only because the Certain Dri has no scent</li>
            <li>Certain dri is the ONLY thing to ever stop me from constantly sweating under my arms.</li>
            <li>I had it shipped to a friend in the US because I live outside the US.</li>
            <li>It does dry fast, but if you happen to be in a humid place it might take a tad longer.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really keep me dry at all</li>
            <li>/&gt;The solid did absolutely nothing for me, and it burned my skin, despite what I think was a proper application.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but I can&#x27;t tell you how appreciative I am to have dry pits!</li>
            <li>since middle school I have worn extra clothing and always dark clothing because of the huge pit stains I would get, even in cold/rainy weather.</li>
            <li>my Dri like no other)</li>
            <li>For about the first week I used it I put it on every other day.  </li>
            <li>After trying every leading brand and choosing all of the ones that say \\&quot;guaranteed dry all day\\&quot; blah blah blah, only to be visibly sweating within the first half-hour, I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li>To give an understanding of my problem: On cool days, I don&#x27;t sweat that much (or even in cool environments), but once it&#x27;s hot, or I get nervous even if the AC is on (think a job interview or even a date or even having a difficult conversation or a hard work-out at the gym), my armpits (even my tummy and areas that shall remain unmentioned) start to sweat.</li>
            <li>my pits tend to sweat a lot even if i&#x27;m not being active so this has been the first thing besides stick antiperspirant that i&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes still get a little stinging, but the benefits are definitely worth</li>
            <li>Normally, I would say any product claiming this is making a ridiculous claim that is anything but true.</li>
            <li>Normally, I would say any product claiming this is making a ridiculous claim that is anything but true.</li>
            <li>There are several other brands of clinical strength antiperspirants available but the only one that actually works is ZeroSweat.</li>
            <li>Long story short, Certain Dri is a miracle product.</li>
            <li>It took a major problem that bothered me immensely and totally &amp; completely resolved it.</li>

            <li>Not going to repeat all the other positive reviews.</li>
            <li>- to complete and total dryness ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have spent that much each month for the peace of mind that I get.</li>
            <li>I barely even notice it now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I barely even notice it now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow, it is an anti-perspirant that actually works.  </li>
            <li>I had higher hopes, but the product works average.  </li>
            <li>Dri offers 4 different products:&lt;br /&gt;---1.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just BARELY)</li>
            <li>Kind of creepy that it stops sweat in one day.</li>
            <li>However, the PM roll-on can be more irritating to skin, so the PM stick gives you an alternative if irritation occurs.</li>

            <li>I decided not to return because the product wasnt worth the trouble..</li>
            <li>if that is the case with you, just until you get used to the certain dry, which for me was a week later.</li>
            <li>antiperspirants can be more irritating than other products, and there are two Certain Dri PM products consumers can choose from.</li>

            <li>Even in an air conditioned room, my underarms can get pretty damp/wet just from sitting down and getting my work done.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>It costs a little more than the other big name brands</li>
            <li>A friend who suffered from the same issue recommended this Certain Dri, and specifically this Certain Dri PM Roll-On (found in a green and white</li>
            <li>So I gave up on Certain Dri and tried other approaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a single spot!</li>
            <li>The roll on Certain Dri is, definitely, not my first choice.  </li>
            <li>I apply this every other night, before bed, and then apply the Certain Dri AM in the morning</li>
            <li>I really wish they had specified that it was a different formula which is not apparent until you open the package.</li>
            <li>Certain Dri is the only product that has kept my underarms dry!</li>
            <li>Some people complain of stinging arm pits, and mine felt a slight sting when i first used it.  </li>
            <li>Certain Dri bottle recently dried completely up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other clinical strength anti-perspirants which didn&#x27;t seem to do too much.  </li>
            <li>and all I have to say is that it really works, unlike other deodorants that promise to work up to 24, 48, 72 hours but</li>
            <li>It stings and itches a little bit for about ten minutes, but it&#x27;s worth that.</li>
            <li>The package said it might take a few days to start working, but I saw a big difference from the first time!</li>
            <li>applied maybe 10 total swipes around each entire armpit before bed the first night I received the product.&lt;br /&gt;The very next day, I did not sweat a SINGLE DROP (in my armpits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a single drop of sweat in my armpits, yet.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Some worked better than others, but none had dramatic results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and can&#x27;t remember the last time I developed big armpit sweat</li>
            <li>If you apply your standard deodorant directly over it the next morning the pain goes away.</li>
            <li>the only problem is that the liquid is so thin that sometimes, after a trip, for example, more liquid than needed pours out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>unless you have some crazy exceptional sweating, it will work for you...</li>
            <li>unless you have some crazy exceptional sweating, it will work for you...</li>
            <li>My dermatologist said to try certain dri as a non-prescription option, but warned me that the area needed to be totally dry, or there would be a reaction on my skin making hydrochloric acid, clearly not something I wanted.</li>
            <li>It will dry your armpits out when you first put it on and they do get a little itchy, but since you put it on at night before bed I usually fall asleep and my armpits are fine in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>The first night I used it my armpits burned a little</li>
            <li>the first 10-20 minutes, my armpits get a little stinging</li>
            <li>i applied the first night I felt a little itchy, but that Is just the feeling of the sweat goblins dying.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>The first day I used it I noticed a little bit of an improvement.</li>
            <li>I will say that the product does tingle a little at first and sometimes itches, but as you get used to it (over a month or two) you don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li>and I want y&#x27;all to know that I during my most recent old spice rotation I got pretty bad chemical burns around my armpit areas.</li>
            <li>still no relief on other approaches, I came back to Certain Dri, but in combination with the [[ASIN:B002BMB1MG</li>
            <li>When I first starting using it, I wasn&#x27;t sweating at all, but I guess its effectiveness wanes slightly with time.</li>
            <li>You have to apply it at night (as per the directions) and it normally gives you dry days by the fourth day of consecutive use.</li>
            <li>but if you can take the rash it is worth it as I&#x27;ve been out to social events I avoided in the past .</li>
            <li>now I use this product maybe once a week or so, and just a simple, light deodorant (which, as I discovered is actually quite hard to find, seems like just about everything on the grocery store shelf is anti-perspirant) in between.  </li>
            <li>I have tried every anti perspirant on the market - either they did not work or burned and caused ugly rashes - including the prescription kind!</li>
            <li>I generally apply this every between 48 and 72 hours, and I use this alongside a regular scented deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I did have some sensativity for the first few weeks, but it soon went away.</li>
            <li>*** lasts at least 2 full days.</li>
            <li>*** lasts at least 2 full days.</li>
            <li>Previously, I had a problem to pick up a dozodorant until I tried Certain.</li>
            <li>Seriously, stop reading reviews and buy this and then go put on a light blue dress shirt and go running in 100 degree heat.</li>
            <li>Thanks for all the other reviews that sold this to me!</li>
            <li>That first day I did have some sweat show through but much less than before!</li>
            <li>Not sure if it matters--it&#x27;s more out of habit and for a little freshness under the pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels like you shaved pits with a super dull knife.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that when some people apply this for the first few weeks it tends to burn or sting.</li>
            <li>This is the antiperspirant I recommend most, for people with trouble with excessive sweating.</li>
            <li>I had red welts under my arms from this, and minor irritation the next day, but to my absolute delight I was not sweating even a single drop.</li>
            <li>ZeroSweat is the only one that still contains just the three basic ingredients of Aluminum Chloride, Baking Soda and Water; all the other brands are loaded with too much junk to actually work effectively.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>The rest of the day my pits stayed DRY -- in the middle of the summer, no less!</li>
            <li>rushed back and forth all over the place, and when I&#x27;d normally have these 2 giant wet patches on my shirt at the underarm area, this time there was NOTHING.</li>
            <li>rushed back and forth all over the place, and when I&#x27;d normally have these 2 giant wet patches on my shirt at the underarm area, this time there was NOTHING.</li>
            <li>The Certain Dry did cause a bit of skin irritation if used too frequently, hence my mention to use it every few nights instead of every night.</li>
            <li>In the morning I recommend using Clinique antiperspirant-deodorant or other product with similar % of aluminum chlorohydrate for high level of protection all day.  </li>
            <li>And black shirts were getting white stains from there being too much of it.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and it only took a day or 2 to get back to my normal smelling self, plus this stuff is completely clear liquid</li>
            <li>I find that this is very effective at cutting down my armpit sweating.</li>
            <li>A few years ago I came across Certain Dri.</li>
            <li>“Everyday Strength Certain Dri AM Underarm Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Roll-On”&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first week or two that I used this stuff, I found myself waking up in the middle of the night scratching my underarms raw.</li>
            <li>deodorant is a little watery, but you&#x27;ll get used to it once you notice that you really don&#x27;t perspire or at the end of the day, there&#x27;s no residual smell on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>“Everyday Strength Certain Dri AM Underarm Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Solid”&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe in writing reviews if a product is exceptionally good or exceptionally bad -in</li>

            <li> Your own body will influence how often you need to reapply…for some people, every 24 hours works best.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know where the sweating came from, and no doctor seemed to have a good explanation.</li>
            <li> Not so good.</li>
            <li> it a try and good luck!!weat</li>
            <li> It does delivered a good job, I just didn&#x27;t like the underarm darkening, but it&#x27;s a good product that works.</li>

            <li> I applied a good 5 - 8 swabs on each underarm, and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well can&#x27;t be good for you...</li>
            <li> I gave this product 1 star even though it does work really good.</li>
            <li> Prior to this, I&#x27;ve always looked for the perfect anti-perspirant, trying to find that perfect one for me.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> It could take days, weeks or even months to find the right amount of usage that will produce perfect results.</li>

            <li> Perfect, does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Husband and son love it!</li>
            <li> Will order more as needed!</li>
            <li> Will definately buy more of this product when this runs out!  </li>

            <li> Product works amazing, hope everyone having doubts on this product will try it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Amazing anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> Amazing thats all I can say.</li>
            <li> As the others reviews said, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It feels so amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is still working amazing.</li>
            <li> This deodorant used to work amazingly on me...until they changed to the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; thicker formula.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> now i am in my 40&#x27;s and have discovered this product, and it was really amazing that no sweat is shown in my armpit anymore.</li>
            <li> Nowadays, I use this every time I go to bed, no matter what, and since 3 months of use I can honestly say that it has changed my life.</li>
            <li> I no longer need any kind of daytime antiperspirant or deodorant</li>
            <li> Well, it looked like it was from the 80&#x27;s and kind of hokey, but why not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really the best way to kill sweat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the product to work effectively</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance</li>
            <li> you do kind of build up a tolerance to it</li>
            <li> /&gt;if applied abundantly</li>
            <li> then I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I might as well start my own water-purification plant and start selling my own bottle water from my perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rather, what it contains is quite a lot of aluminum chloride and this blend is highly effective in dramatically reducing the amount you sweat.</li>
            <li> if you jump in a pool and swim some, when you get out this product will still be surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li> I wear, and I have no issue taking my coat off even if I was warm for an extended period.</li>
            <li> With that kind of effectiveness, this product is a 10 out of 5</li>

            <li> With that kind of effectiveness, this product is a 10 out of 5</li>
            <li> To be honest I didn&#x27;t think it would work</li>
            <li> Not recommended and don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so popular.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a sweating issue, but did find that deodorants kind of quit on me by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It works great and is very economical.</li>
            <li> Especially my right one.</li>
            <li> I hear the roll-on is much more effective than the bar kind of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great, changed my life, pain goes away with time, don&#x27;t apply directly after a shower.orks great, changed my life</li>
            <li> Overall, a good deal on an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I still use deodorant just for the good smell, but am fine going without, still don&#x27;t sweat.</li>
            <li> I still use deodorant just for the good smell, but am fine going without, still don&#x27;t sweat.</li>
            <li> , honestly, you made my life so much better.</li>
            <li> I know I sound like an ad for this product, but that&#x27;s just how good it&#x27;s been for me.</li>
            <li> I believe that it is more effective.</li>
            <li> good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)</li>
            <li> I have found it works the most effectively, lasts the longest, and doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li> All of my expectation with this product is by far the best I&#x27;ve used for my under arm</li>
            <li> It seems to be the most effective this way.</li>
            <li> heck if you ask me, I&#x27;d go through a good amount of pain knowing that I can freely lift my arms up and not look like I have 2</li>
            <li> good news is that it costs less than Gillette Clinical Strength to which makes me happy lol.</li>
            <li> so I bought this one and now I&#x27;m extremely happy, since the first application my arm pits aren&#x27;t sweaty anymore</li>
            <li> (the solid is also very good!)</li>
            <li> love this product, been using it for years and years now when nothing else has ever worked (prescriptions, clinical strengths, etc etc).</li>
            <li> love the 3 pack</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> Most others have like 15 ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> After using it for one day I can say that I am incredibly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am extremely pleased about how this product works.</li>
            <li> By chance I happened upon this product online, and now I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anywho, I know this works for many people</li>
            <li> I bough this product and i love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this</li>
            <li> Is this magic?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than satisfied, I&#x27;m amazed.</li>
            <li> Boy was I glad I did.</li>
            <li> , my face perspires more.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I took a shower and made sure all the deodorant remnants were gone and didn&#x27;t shave.</li>
            <li> I woke up in the morning and took a shower and didn&#x27;t wash my armpits to make sure it stayed on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so great not to be embarrassed about sweating so much.</li>
            <li> Stockpile it too, before someone realizes that it works TOO good and raises the price to the hundreds of dollars, because that&#x27;s what its really worth.</li>

            <li> This product does control sweating better than most over the counter anti-perspirants, but after using a couple days, it burned when applying.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to follow directions, and NEVER use it after you shave.  </li>
            <li> They are much better than any antipersperant roll-on that I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> But I LOVE this anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> My intention is to warn people to MAKE SURE this stuff dries BEFORE you put your shirt on.</li>
            <li> Of course if you put this on at night &amp; go to bed without a shirt on you&#x27;ll be ok</li>
            <li> , from a biological standpoint, if you cut sweat off somewhere, it&#x27;s gonna pop up elsewhere on your body, so don&#x27;t be alarmed if you start to sweat more from say your neck or wider body surface area.</li>
            <li> then, if it works for a gal like me with typical/moderate hyperhidrosis, I&#x27;m sure</li>

            <li> then, if it works for a gal like me with typical/moderate hyperhidrosis, I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> sure to pick up a DEODORANT, in addition to this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how many doubts you have...</li>
            <li> you still sweat, try applying more swipes.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think this product could impress me any more than it did 4 months ago...</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think this product could impress me any more than it did 4 months ago...</li>
            <li> Now I can wear a suit or dress more than once without needing to get it drycleaned to get rid of the pit stains.  </li>
            <li> Seems most of the anti-perspirants on the market today have aluminum.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do, and for a fraction of the cost of many competing brands.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure when I go out</li>
            <li> you travel, be sure to place this inside a ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> Have to make sure you put it on EVERY night and</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I just make sure I trim my armpits on the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; day.</li>
            <li> and it seems most people use it that way),</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried it</li>
            <li> and I feel like I sweat more with the roll on method.  </li>
            <li> And remember; it&#x27;s okay to skip a day or two now and then.</li>
            <li> And remember; it&#x27;s okay to skip a day or two now and then.</li>
            <li> With this product, I&#x27;m able to wear anything I want.</li>
            <li> second time of purchasing this product is a excellent sweat preventer.</li>
            <li> The study online says most users witnessed a reduction of perspiration for 5 days.</li>
            <li> :) :) :)</li>
            <li> , the next day I didn&#x27;t sweat, great!</li>
            <li> Ok, so like many of the people who have commented on this, I sweat a ton from my underarms.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the over the counter \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars - it&#x27;s given me a lot more confidence to know that I don&#x27;t look like a sweaty pig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It used to be my favorite product</li>
            <li> I am sooooo pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The thing that worried me most about it was the itching.</li>
            <li> Did still sweat more</li>
            <li> Now I do use more on both underarms then recommended.</li>
            <li> It said 2 swipes on each arm, I do more then that.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more then that.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work, but according to the review I saw before I bought the item, some people have much more severe condition than I do, and they said the product worked 100%.</li>
            <li> And it makes me incredibly self conscious about myself.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> Some sweat more than others, and some sweat has a more noticeable odor.</li>
            <li> Stress can accelerate not just the quantity of sweat, but also make a more concentrated odor.</li>
            <li> For most people, that means applying around bedtime.</li>
            <li> For most people, that means applying around bedtime.</li>
            <li> , I tried many antiperspirant brands with no avail (rexona, degree, gillete etc).  </li>
            <li> I use to think it was because I was over weight that I over-sweated but have recently lost 80 pounds and in the best shape of my life and visiting the gym 4 days a week.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo glad I did.</li>
            <li> it was more of a prolonging before I started sweating.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to say this actually works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since 2008, and love it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to store upright so that the bottle doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I had astronomical expectations for the sweat that was pouring from my armpits</li>
            <li> Stuff really does work!!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will buy again for this great price.</li>
            <li> Very good! , ues for a long times per bottle /  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely wonderful product at keeping you dry.</li>
            <li> This is the best product, it truly works, I could never live without it.</li>
            <li> Go right to the top!</li>
            <li> This brand is very good for those people who have pit wetting problems (PWP) but their PWP is not severe enough to be medicated.</li>
            <li> Very cool.</li>
            <li> This Certain Dri PM roll-on is more effective than the PM stick version, containing a more aggressive antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> This Certain Dri PM roll-on is more effective than the PM stick version, containing a more aggressive antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> Be safe and hopefully sweat free.</li>
            <li> it is most effective for the first 36-48 hours.)</li>
            <li> it is most effective for the first 36-48 hours.)</li>
            <li> This Roll-On can stain clothing when freshly applied, and so applying it at night makes it easier to avoid staining your nice dress</li>
            <li> This Roll-On can stain clothing when freshly applied, and so applying it at night makes it easier to avoid staining your nice dress</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time in February, I can honestly say that that was the best $8.00 I ever spent.</li>
            <li> This bothered me greatly, often accelerating stress, and ultimately making me sweat more.</li>
            <li> If I used 8 or so to cover my whole pit, it was more effective, but the itching was too severe then to make it usable</li>
            <li> The product is too strong and corrosive for my underarms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very in love with Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> but this is the first time I experienced this whilst using certain dri.</li>
            <li> I have even had to avoid buying tops in certain fabrics and colors but not any more!  </li>
            <li> It works fine whether I shower it off in the morning OR leave it on.</li>
            <li> I find that applying it an hour or so after showering is best because skin is clean, pores are open, and the medication can be effectively absorbed.</li>
            <li> For others, 48-72 hours is fine.</li>

            <li> For others, 48-72 hours is fine.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ok for a quick spray of deodorant in the morning</li>
            <li> I have been using Certain Dry for many years with reliably excellent results.  </li>
            <li> Certain Dri lives up to it&#x27;s claim of combating underarm wetness and does an amazing job at that.</li>
            <li> What I do, because its NOT a deodorant, I put certain dri on at night then give a swipe of my daily deodorant in te morning and it works flawlessly!</li>
            <li> Friends and family would comment on the huge sweat stains on my shirts because of my armpits :</li>
            <li> But heck if you ask me, I&#x27;d go through a good amount of pain knowing that I can freely lift my arms up and not look like I have 2 sexually aroused underarms.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> My adderall prescription made me very likely to sweat a great deal.  </li>
            <li> It is important to take the time to read the instructions that come in the box just once and \\&quot;use as directed\\&quot;, if you do this it will lead to satisfactory results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not wear light colored shirts because of sweat stains.</li>
            <li> , I no longer have to worry about anti-perspirant stains on my clothes or about cheap anti-perspirant fragrance smells either.</li>
            <li> although I can tell that it&#x27;s wearing off by then (although even on the last day, sweating is still greatly reduced from the level it was before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am anxiety free now</li>
            <li> Important thing is to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> Living without fear of wet armpits is incredibly freeing.</li>
            <li> It may burn more, but it is entirely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a definite win if you have underarm wetness</li>
            <li> It used to be that my shirts were soaked by noon, and now, I&#x27;m sweat free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fourth day and it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
            <li> The anti-perspirant is effective in my case, so I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> just when I know I will have an important event or if I want to wear a white/light colored clothes that will show sweat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1) I start perspiring once I get out of the showers, although it&#x27;s light perspiration&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable and don&#x27;t perspire at all.</li>
            <li> wear colored and light shirts now, I wear tighter shirts with confidence again.</li>
            <li> To boost the effectiveness, I also bought the A.M. solid, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I no longer have a monochromatic wardrobe, I can use color shirts and will not stain them, there is absolutely NOTHING that gives more confidence for someone who suffered from hyperhidrosys than being able to lift your arms without any sign of sweat.</li>
            <li> Overall, this can really help people out and thats awesome.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent that is fresh and appropriate for both guys and girls.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent that is fresh and appropriate for both guys and girls.</li>
            <li> totally worth it in my opinion!  </li>
            <li> but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> You apply it in the evening before you go to bed - it is NOT scented and yes it will burn on a freshly shaved underarm ( but it tells you so in the instructions !) .</li>
            <li> So the first night I put it on and it did itch some, but at the most I noticed the itch off and on for about an hour.</li>
            <li> I was finally able to wear normal clothes again!!</li>
            <li> This really helped me, having sweaty free hands made me feel better and over time it stopped.</li>
            <li> It is a strong product and does make me itch and burn for a while after I apply it but is worth it to not feel embarrassed all the time by perspiration stains.</li>
            <li> Certain dri was about $5 a box and worked so much better.</li>
            <li> found Certain Dri on Amazon about two months ago and it has been fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I use Certain Dri and we love it.</li>
            <li> nothing special, so i will never buy it again</li>
            <li> Certain Dri Roll-On many months ago</li>
            <li> It’s nice when a product works EXACTLY as advertised, which Certain Dri PM Roll-On does.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri Roll-On the best, hands down.</li>
            <li> This strictly only stops the sweating, and it&#x27;s damn good at it.</li>
            <li> Everything you hear about this product is true.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a roller ball on top and underneath is the liquid, which is very water-like.</li>
            <li> To start off you might need to apply 3 nights or more in a row before it really kicks in -</li>
            <li> Some nights more than others, probably depending on how much I put on.  </li>
            <li> is their daily-use stick product that contains both an antiperspirant AND a deodorant, and is often considered more gentle on skin than the AM Roll-On.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The other \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; products out there (you know the ones, that come in a more traditional deodorant form), but this one works the best, by FAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a pretty strong burn/itch for 15-20 minutes after I apply the stuff.</li>
            <li> But certain dri really works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time last night, and I am so happy with it that I decided to review it right away.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I found a solution.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that it worked so well so quickly.</li>
            <li> I had super sweaty hands and it was embarrassing.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that my life has returned to normal, and this product has honestly gone a long way towards improving my daily happiness.</li>
            <li> I am a big man, so I have to use more than the 2 recommended rolls of the bottle, more like 4.</li>
            <li> I washed it with mild soap and had to put ointment on there.</li>
            <li> it super dries armpits...</li>
            <li> I still have 1.5 bottles left, and when I&#x27;m finished, I&#x27;ll be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> Now I can wear wool and several layers of clothing, which I love in winter, and not hesitate buying the looks I love because of fear of perspiration problems.</li>
            <li> After using this I can honestly say that no other antiperspirant/deodorant products should exist, and I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend it for people who perspire a lot.</li>
            <li> Sounds like Review Spamming, probably in an effort to have high reviews and thus more sales of the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a true miracle in how fast it works, you get obvious results right away which is great.</li>
            <li> Better than just normal deodorant in that it is odorless</li>
            <li> and it is very hot</li>
            <li> : Ok its been a few months, and I have decided that maybe this isn&#x27;t quite soooo amazing as I made it out to be originally.</li>
            <li> for guys: I also found trimming down your pit hair (i&#x27;m a beast) helps a lot in its own, but also helps since this stuff can make better contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> You need to use this a day in between at first, then your body gets used to it and it becomes a once a month thing!</li>
            <li> I went to the zoo, on a hot day, and nothing!</li>
            <li> As it is, I apply it right before bed, and take melatonin to help me fall asleep quickly</li>
            <li> Being able to use it every few days makes this even GREATER of a deal!</li>
            <li> Use the Certain Dri AM every morning as a regular deoderant and you&#x27;ll be good to go.  </li>
            <li> Even tried the Certain Dri solid and it was not as good as the roll-on.</li>
            <li> But let&#x27;s be honest, if you&#x27;re buying this product, you probably prefer a little stinging to sweating profusely through your sweater on a winter day, I might be exxagerating here :), not to mention the heat of summer.</li>
            <li> I would definally recommend this product to anyone with presperation issues and wants a prescription free treatment that works[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I was recently at a symposium to watch some presentations and noticed many of the nervous speakers had huge sweat stains.</li>
            <li> short, this baby is frigging amazing.</li>
            <li> In short, this baby is frigging amazing.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Hope others find some success with this too.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money-</li>
            <li> but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> But they also figured, heh it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li> product!o keep a fresh smell in your underarms, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been buying colorful tops because I no longer have to worry about pit stains.  </li>
            <li> you must apply it at night for it to be effective the next day</li>
            <li> I use any old brand on top of it just for a scent I like.  </li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t completely eliminate my sweat, I wouldn&#x27;t have used it more than once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also taken to keeping an aloe lotion beside my bed, and sometimes applying this is effective enough to reduce the itching to a bearable level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the confidence that comes with knowing I don&#x27;t have sweat spots on my clothing is worth the temporary discomfort and disruptions to my sleep.</li>
            <li> it is worth it.</li>
            <li> everything(Even using powder to absorbed some sweat),</li>
            <li> As someone who has suffered from overactive sweatglands finding a good antiperspirant has been a lifelong challenge.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the $12 to even just try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> know this review is early, but I will be sure to give another one in a couple of months to see if it&#x27;s still working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fresh all day&#x27;s long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> relay difference is that you will need to apply this product more frequently than say using Drysol.  </li>
            <li> Its totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Irritation was mild for the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Def better than the high price anti per spirants but be ware of the possibility of it ruining certain colored clothes.</li>
            <li> Yet this had been on the shelf right in front of me for years.</li>
            <li> reading reviews - and buy this right now.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably because I used it right after I got out of the shower</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways my underarm stayed dry for a good 2 full days, and since i had some important function on the 3rd, i decided to apply again before I sleep.</li>
            <li> Anyways my underarm stayed dry for a good 2 full days, and since i had some important function on the 3rd, i decided to apply again before I sleep.</li>
            <li> Health wise; I&#x27;m not sure how healthy such strong antiperspirant can be for the body.</li>
            <li> Drysol continues to be the only home remedy that is effective enough to control the problem in most individuals suffering from this</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if my armpits are that attractive, sweaty or not sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product; I have used 3 other clinical strength deodorants that didn&#x27;t reduce my sweat, let alone eliminate it for 3 full days like this product does.</li>
            <li> I tried Certain Dri, but found just 1-2 strokes wasn&#x27;t effective enough for me.</li>
            <li> but I recommend finding it locally and just purchasing one bottle for about $5 just to make sure it works first!</li>
            <li> Have noticed a little more sweating in my feet but would gladly trade armpit sweating for that.  </li>
            <li> I use this every other night and it strong most of the wetness</li>
            <li> This approach paired up with a Thompson Tee (new company that makes t-shirts with sew-in sweat guards under the armpits that are WAY more comfortable than any other sweat guards I have used (tried a bunch) - gotta search it on Google) for those more intense circumstances where my hyperhidrosis may act up, has been a bullet proof solution for me.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t live in fear of having huge pit stains as i walk around town.</li>
            <li> Will always re-purchase Certain Dri!</li>
            <li> Thank you, Certain Dri!</li>
            <li> Thank you Certain Dri!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product because my job requires me to wear clothing with sleeves, and it was embarrassing how I would show sweat spots on my shirt when in situations with high heat, stress or activity.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and WORKS-IF you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It really works from the very first day.</li>
            <li> When you sweat as much as I do (and I&#x27;m sure that there&#x27;s a big chance that you do), you can&#x27;t reach up to grab items off high shelves, give someone a good hug, write something on the high portion of a whiteboard, and so many other things.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I found a very unusual use for this product: I had a kitten who kept me awake all night licking my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using the solid and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Felt the immediate difference on the first day</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the three pack (with such outstanding reviews</li>
            <li> After looking up the treatment I saw that most of the antiperspirants listed were prescription only.</li>
            <li> This was the only product that I was easily able to find that was not.</li>
            <li> My first try was Secrect clinical protection, however the results weren&#x27;t as well as I hoped expectially for $9 a stick.</li>
            <li> I imagine most of it was just a psychological response to not wanting to sweat.  </li>
            <li> so be aware and plan ahead.</li>
            <li> Obviously at first they figured...</li>
            <li> My underarm sweat has decreased incredibly since using this product,</li>
            <li> It does burn at first</li>
            <li> I use the roll-on (works better for me than the solid)</li>
            <li> At first I was apprehensive to buying it because I didn&#x27;t think it will work.  </li>
            <li> First off, what you&#x27;re wanting to know, does it work?</li>
            <li> This is exactly how this product makes your hands feel.</li>
            <li> The first day I got the product, I put it to the test.</li>
            <li> at first I thought this was for people who sweat at night, but you have to do this no matter what.&lt;br</li>
            <li> C&#x27;mon, if you&#x27;re really hot no matter what you will sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure that it a deodorant only, because this WON&#x27;T protect you against odor, it&#x27;s not supposed to.</li>
            <li> only wish I found my love for this product sooner in life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, and I read many of the reviews before deciding to trust the product, I thought that this would definitely help my issue.</li>
            <li> first time I used it</li>
            <li> First night I decided to try it one more time next night and see.</li>
            <li> Really works!  </li>
            <li> For some reason when the summer rolls around and I am on BC, my pits destroys my pretty dresses and summer tops.</li>
            <li> First: the product.</li>
            <li> Nearly everyone gives it a 5 start rating and many of the reviews sound the same.</li>
            <li> Use it exactly how it says.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t use too much of it at once!</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t use too much of it at once!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to exaggerate, but if any product on Amazon has ever changed my life for the better, this is definitely it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the next morning everything would be ok</li>
            <li> so he gets pretty hot and</li>
            <li> The first day I applied it there was some stinging</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last more then 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is known as a first try for hyperhydrosis though,</li>
            <li> I tried it on the first time</li>
            <li> applied at night it will visibly dimish sweat over the next day (says it hold for more days...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real confidence booster and worth a shot.</li>
            <li> This is one of only two deodorants I have been able to use because of allergies.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> at best leave your clothes smelling like stale deodorant anyway or don&#x27;t work like promised.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Now, be aware this product may create a burning or itching sensation during the first 30 minutes after application.</li>
            <li> It stung the first time I applied this.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it would.</li>
            <li> Still on the first one from the three pack after about of 6-7 month of sporadic use.</li>
            <li> first thing that&#x27;s gonna hit you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty damn</li>
            <li> It still stings, and it still hurts pretty intensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different deodorant/antiperspirant products, including some of the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; products sold over the counter.</li>
            <li> but in the first week when u miss it sweat will come again..</li>
            <li> I used it first time for three nights in a row, and it lasted for 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I used it again for two more nights and it actually lasted for three days.  </li>
            <li> Yesterday I put on the product for the first time and today....</li>
            <li> This product really does work!</li>
            <li> This performs exactly as it is suppose to perform.  </li>
            <li> just an FYI: if you try ZeroSweat exactly according to directions</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> My cursory examination of several products on the shelf at the drug store revealed that most contain 10-12% aluminum.</li>
            <li> I have had a super sweaty underarm problem since high school</li>
            <li> Actually, any amount of sweating would be much more than with Certain Dri</li>
            <li> Combine this with Old Spice original scent deodorant and the women will come flocking to you in droves.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not something pleasant to talk about, but I historically would have to specifically only buy certain color shirts, and refrain from taking my outer coat off because I felt it was noticeable.</li>
            <li> Some skin types are more sensitive than others, naturally.</li>
            <li> Some skin types are more sensitive than others, naturally.</li>
            <li> I use it the night or two before an important event because I usually sweat when I am nervous or excited and had a huge problem with having sweaty underarms.</li>
            <li> as much as this society would like you to believe that it is a medical &amp;#34; condition&amp;#34; - in reality it would actually present an advantage in warm climates as sweat has the function to cool your body.</li>
            <li> I pretty much gave up on it and had lived with the embarrassment for years afterwards.  </li>
            <li> best characterization of this product is that it is a heavy duty type of antiperspirant for normal people that will work for those who do not suffer the type of excessive sweating that those who have hyperhidrosis do, but who sweat more than normal</li>
            <li> First, it is a miracle product - it really does work as advertised.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m sitting at my desk at work, I pretty much just sweat non-stop sometimes</li>
            <li> , I had a pretty intense day, running/jogging around + lifting stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I had a pretty intense day, running/jogging around + lifting stuff.    </li>
            <li> It still stings, and it still hurts pretty intensely.    </li>
            <li> The severity of my sweating is pretty intense like sweating through jackets.</li>
            <li> The product soaks into your sweat pores and pretty much clogs them up.</li>
            <li> First let me mention that I live in Southeast Asia where it is very very humid and always hot.</li>
            <li> I had incredible results right away; I went from heavy to minimal perspiration.</li>
            <li> Following these directions, I&#x27;ve had good results, staying pretty dry even in stressful summer heat.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your armpits are completely dry when applying it.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use it as directed, which is applying it to a dry underarm at night before bed.</li>
            <li> 3 strokes will do the job and make sure your underarms are dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pretty much given up really, and was looking towards going to the doctors to get some sorta prescription strength</li>
            <li> Might be possible with how strong it is.</li>
            <li> Might be possible with how strong it is.</li>
            <li> At any rate sweat is meant to keep you cool and rid your body of a few toxins so it wouldn&#x27;t be rational or healthy to expect ZERO sweat from your body</li>
            <li> At any rate sweat is meant to keep you cool and rid your body of a few toxins so it wouldn&#x27;t be rational or healthy to expect ZERO sweat from your body</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t as strong as Drysol but works almost the same.  </li>
            <li> FYI, the Certain Dri does have a strong talc smell when you apply it, which is also why I like to use the nice-smelling Certain Dri AM as my daily deoderant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Certain Dri for over a year now.</li>
            <li> but since the Certain Dri Roll-On Anti-Perspirant 1.2</li>
            <li> I have come to realized that Certain dri is a treatment.</li>
            <li> so I guess I never considered Certain Dri because it was a roll on.</li>
            <li> , I tried certain dri.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about Certain Dri here on Amazon</li>
            <li> -(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> Certain</li>
            <li> I discovered Certain Dri.  </li>
            <li> Certain Dri claims to stop perspiration for 72 hours ...</li>
            <li> so I went on-line, looking at another product, and found Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> and I wil certainly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Then one day on the bottom shelf I saw Certain Dri and thought what the heck it is cheaper than what I had in my basket.</li>
            <li> There are two things you need to know about Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri</li>
            <li> Up popped suggestions for Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having an underarm sweating problem, get Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want to apply it, before using the Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> use antiperspirant deodorant in conjunction with certain dri.</li>
            <li> After my Prosthetist recommend Certain DRI and gave me a sample,  I knew it would be a permanent part of my routine.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the Certain Dri anywhere.</li>
            <li> because when I use Certain Dri, I don&#x27;t sweat at ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, using the product does make your underarms sting.</li>
            <li> After reading about Certain Dri on a blog I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> That is, until I found Certain Dri here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> After finding Certain Dri</li>
            <li> Certain Dri Clinical Strength Anti-Perspirant Roll-On” AKA the PM</li>
            <li> It does not have a scent and is a pure antiperspirant (i.e., not a deodorant.)</li>
            <li> It does not have a scent and is a pure antiperspirant (i.e., not a deodorant.)</li>
            <li> WELL DOES CERTAIN DRI WORK???&lt;br /&gt;Certain</li>
            <li> This PM Roll-On is the workhorse of the Certain Dri family.</li>
            <li> As this is a pure antiperspirant, it needs to be applied a period of time BEFORE being required to work as the act of shrinking the pores is not immediate.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri&#x27;s PM Roll-On literally has made this a non-issue for me.</li>
            <li> As this is a pure antiperspirant, it needs to be applied a period of time BEFORE being required to work as the act of shrinking the pores is not immediate.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri&#x27;s PM Roll-On literally has made this a non-issue for me.</li>
            <li> The day after I started using Certain Dri</li>
            <li> Used to botox my pits, now I just use certain dri.</li>
            <li> After browsing the internet for a solution, I came upon Certain Dri Roll-On Antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> This item really worked as described, and in my case for a little more than 72 hours!</li>
            <li> It got to the point that I had to avoid wearing certain types of colors or even tops (think nice tight tank tops with sleeves) or leggings on certain days to avoid embarrassment.</li>
            <li> I hope this doesn&#x27;t scare you off :) Even despite the slight discomfort, it&#x27;s still SO worth it.</li>
            <li> Works so good while I&#x27;m sweating at the gym, the only dry spots are my underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t clear up your pit sweat after the first use, don&#x27;t give up!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;IF you use Certain Dri as instructed, at night and use daily for a week or two then gradually start skipping days, the results are fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using Certain Dri a few weeks ago and it works great.</li>
            <li> Recently I started using it in conjuction with the Chlorophyll  gel tablets, a fantastic body deodorizer, and I don&#x27;t need to use Certain Dri as much.</li>
            <li> While giving a presentation, using hand gestures or writing on the whiteboard only to reveal huge puddles of sweat.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> started using this product a few months ago after I read some amazing reviews online.</li>
            <li> I use this every few days and it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> and you will never have burning or itching no matter how much you use it.</li>
            <li> This discovery was thanks to my husband who forgot to bring his deodorant on vacation.  </li>
            <li> I either had to run around in my camisole with the blazer off (very unprofessional looking) or try to hide the growing pit stains by lunch (</li>
            <li> My armpits used to be very sweaty and I have tried almost every product out there.</li>
            <li> You have to use it before bed, not before you take a shower at night because then it gets very itchy.</li>
            <li> This is a drastic improvement that really drastically improved my self confidence throughout the day.</li>
            <li> cause my pits itched too much).</li>
            <li> Sweat Block works for me, but it&#x27;s really expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if its really working.</li>
            <li> Its crazy amazing how it works!!!</li>
            <li> but it was very manageable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I started to sweat so profusely in my armpits, but it was a real problem and it caused me distress.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well on my hands</li>
            <li> but I got really sweaty hands.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Nanoshu it every morning after a shower and forget the whole day.</li>
            <li> I am very displeased with the product</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a very liberating experience.  </li>
            <li> I used to sweat like that, no matter how much anti-perspirant I put on.</li>
            <li> and it absolutely worked wonders for me.  </li>
            <li> I always thought that I sweat so much because I was nervous.</li>
            <li> Turns out sweating so much was what was making me nervous.</li>
            <li> just so I don&#x27;t forget to put it on, but have gone whole weekends without putting any on and it has worked for the whole time.</li>
            <li> Very thankful I found this stuff.</li>
            <li> Did not irritate my skin and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> it really does put an end to perspiration.  </li>
            <li> does feel itchy if you use too much.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put on too much or it can burn a bit, I would recommend using it every couple of days, and not every day.</li>
            <li> I am wearing light clothing so as not to draw attention to the massive sweat stain.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I think that is caused by using too much.  </li>
            <li> applied the product before going to bed really thinking</li>
            <li> but i was ready to try anything ( even considered botox injections in the sweat glands) and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product in stores and it really, really works and for that I give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> I figure if I put in on every 24 hours, it really doesn&#x27;t matter what time of day I put it on.  </li>
            <li> This has been a real life-saver.  </li>
            <li> this really works.</li>
            <li> Piling up the product WILL make it more painful and will most likely (as it did for me) turn your underarms bright red.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> product works but be ready to get the side effects.</li>
            <li> I could not believe it, I even had a light gray(almost white in colour), and not a drop.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the price is quite reasonable, too.</li>
            <li> I was putting on so much deodorant that my clothes were getting stained.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Before finding this deodorant I tried everything and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> Works VERY well...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend , works as promised!</li>
            <li> I ordered mine (which showed up much sooner then the estimated shipment date) and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> This really helps with sweaty underarms.</li>
            <li> and I applied too much.</li>
            <li> Not so much because of the smell</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not unbearable, but they are intense.</li>
            <li> a whole day of errand running.</li>
            <li> 3, Went for a whole afternoon of wakeboarding + party after that.</li>
            <li> It really does, and it really</li>
            <li> they are intense.</li>
            <li> a whole day of errand running.</li>
            <li> Day 3, Went for a whole afternoon of wakeboarding + party after that.</li>
            <li> It really does, and it really hurts.    </li>
            <li> dont put on too much.</li>
            <li> It is not as aggressive of an antiperspirant as the Roll-On version, but it is still quite capable.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think it would work</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and this didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> Drysol works on severe hyperhidrosis but it may only be available through prescription.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> The bar version didn&#x27;t work for me at all really...</li>
            <li> to be clear - you need to follow the instructions (depending on your condition though you might need more swipes initially than the bottle says).</li>
            <li> I waited a few months before writing my review because I thought the effects might wear off, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I ordered the solid which is supposed to be better for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> In 20 years, I only ruined one top (an old t-shirt)</li>
            <li> : DO NOT USE WITH OLD SPICE PRODUCTS#!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Certain Dri for over 15 years now, and it is easily the one product I could not live without.  </li>
            <li> All they ever did was stain my clothes with a lovely, hard to clean gunk + sweat</li>
            <li> I tried this for 6 days hoping it would start working for me like it does for so many other people.</li>
            <li> but I find that it starts losing the fight after more like 50 or so, so I re-apply every other night.</li>
            <li> It does cost more than other deodorants</li>
            <li> Losing your favorite work shirts due to sweat stains in the armpit</li>
            <li> Has really improved my confidence, and generally made my life better (for example: not having to carry around an extra dress shirt for work because the one I put on in the morning had pitted out).</li>
            <li> I am finally able to wear some shirts (in lighter colors) that I couldn&#x27;t even two weeks ago due to armpit stains.</li>
            <li> Well, search no more - if used properly, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> The only problem is having to apply it every night, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the joy of stopping unwanted sweat.</li>
            <li> The first week or two, I used it nearly every day, but as others have mentioned, you begin not needing it as much anymore.</li>
            <li> So i thought ok maybe its not wet enough to soak through.</li>
            <li> So i thought ok maybe its not wet enough to soak through.</li>
            <li> It will prevent excessive perspiring for 1-3 days but make sure you use some kind of moisturizer on your underarms the day after you applied certain dri if you have dry or sensitive</li>
            <li> Even while using a clinical deodorant (which does make me sweat less than a bargain-brand deodorant), the amount of sweat I have is much more than with Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> However - if applied like suggested on skin that is not broken or shaved it should not burn ( and this comes from someone with a very sensitive skin and eczema! ).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product because of how much a difference it made for me.</li>
            <li> Almost no wetness on super hot days and no wetness on other hot days or normal days!</li>
            <li> I live in a tropical climate and even after a full day of work/travel I do not wet</li>
            <li> This product is the first one ever that shows results and works even for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If I even skip one day, the problem begins to come back in full force</li>
            <li> It’s antiperspirant action is comparable to many other premium over-the-counter antiperspirants, but is nowhere near as strong as the Certain Dri PM products above.</li>
            <li> It’s antiperspirant action is comparable to many other premium over-the-counter antiperspirants, but is nowhere near as strong as the Certain Dri PM products above.</li>
            <li> I use Certain Dri, the roll on kind, on my forehead before I go to bed, and I hardly sweat from my head anymore.</li>
            <li> This is supposedly a new and improved formula but it simply does not work as well as the original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special, but it will make you feel a little better since you only apply this one once a day at night.</li>
            <li> The more you use it the less it burns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that that gives me more than enough anti-perspirant to last two days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought several more bottles since then and will keep buying it in the future.</li>
            <li> For most of my life anti-perspirant did the opposite for me - it actually made my armpits sweat profusely.</li>
            <li> I used to have to avoid buying certain shirt types because I&#x27;d soak right through my undershirt into the outside</li>
            <li> sure it works differently for different people.</li>
            <li> It puts just everything else you can buy without a prescription (and some you can buy only with a prescription) to shame, and many physicians consider it the product of choice to manage a medical condition that can cause profuse sweating.</li>

            <li> I tried every single available anti-perspiration deodorant.</li>
            <li> I happily endured it every night and found it a small price to pay for dry pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helped the sweating just like the other antiperspirants (nothing special) but it broke me out on my face!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I still highly recommend the product though.</li>
            <li> Over the next few weeks it actually seemed like the product was working better and better.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> If you have problems with sweating, I would highly recommend trying this.</li>

            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I always feared the high five, anything that required me to lift my arms for the sweat stain and disgust that would follow.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> My first application was probably double recommended strength, and as such it burned a fair bit and kept me up for an hour or two before it calmed down.</li>
            <li> This product flat out works, more than I ever thought possible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second: I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up with the reviews on this product, but all of them seem a little to good to be true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve delt with sweaty armpits my whole adult life.</li>
            <li> a shower and have clean and dry pits before you apply this.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;sweatproof&amp;#34; deorderant around that really works consistently well</li>
            <li> It can be the dead of winter, in a tank top</li>
            <li> For the last few months I had noticed that I had begun to sweat much more than normal to the point that my shirts were becoming drenched in sweat under the armpits after only 15-20 minutes of wearing them.</li>
            <li> Some people on here say if you use it enough you close the glands for good, I&#x27;m not sure about that.</li>
            <li> Some people on here say if you use it enough you close the glands for good, I&#x27;m not sure about that.</li>
            <li> First application didn&#x27;t really work, after the second it was like I just stopped sweating.  </li>
            <li> For several years I have avoided wearing anything gray or colorful because the sweat was so visible.</li>
            <li> I follow the instructions to use it at night, and I use some normal deodorant in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s sole purpose is to protect against wetness, which it excels at; however, you will need to combine it with a deodorant of your liking in order to keep a fresh smell in your underarms, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> also use a normal antiperspirant deodorant in the morning.</li>
            <li> I read that this was a normal side effect</li>
            <li> like I sweat like a normal person, now, Instead of it being Niagara Falls.</li>
            <li> You need to read the instructions and apply it before you go to bed because it works its magic over night and is a waste if you apply it during the day...</li>
            <li> My son has had allergic reactions to other common brands, but this product Certain Dri works great.  </li>
            <li> This works better than the prescription ever did and causes less irritation!  </li>
            <li> The only problem that I encounter is that is takes a long time to dry - if I want the job done right, I take the extra couple of minutes to dry it with a hairdryer - first warm and then cool.  </li>
            <li> This makes the itching go away completely so that I can sleep soundly and awake with dry (and well moisturized) pits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely gone through many in an attempt to stay dry.</li>
            <li> Be sure to apply this product sparingly because the quantity required to work is far less than it would seem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to apply this product sparingly because the quantity required to work is far less than it would seem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have gone through dozens of different anti-perspirant products and none of them was strong enough to stop the sweat.</li>
            <li> VOILA, I&#x27;ve put it to the test in 91 degree heat, with light colored clothing (even a top tight under the armpits) and in a meeting that had me super nervous - and having followed instructions, my pits (and other areas), remained dry (give or take a bit of sweat)</li>
            <li> About ten minutes after applying (right about when the itching starts to kick in), I apply a generous glob of lotion to each pit.</li>

            <li> So minus 1/2 for the stinging and minus 1/2 for the general inconvenience of application, but otherwise a good product</li>
            <li> , when I first put it on I get a little bit of a burning tingle, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Will post how the new one arrives.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update - Amazon sent a replacement overnight and the new boxes did not leak.</li>
            <li> Now instead of buying new shirts about every month, I have never had to throw out a shirt from underarm stain damage.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> so i felt i could live with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it where I live</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without- remember to follow</li>
            <li> I live in the South</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 20 years, and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Finally found something that ended my underarm wetness and constant search of relevant tops and blouses to wear.</li>
            <li> It comes in a light blue &amp; white box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also comes in a light blue &amp; white box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was embarassing and making me self conscience, so, since I am a third year medical student I decided to look up the treatment for hyperhidrosis, which is the medical term for sweating more than normal.</li>
            <li> It stung a little when I applied it for the very first time, but after the first week</li>
            <li> I occasionally rotate between  dove, old spice, and right guard deodorant products</li>
            <li> I applied a little more that morning and after it dried I put a light coating of deodorant on over it.</li>
            <li> This product permantly stained two $85-$100 dress shirts because i was in too much of a hurry to let it dry on my arms first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of other \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; deo, and only CD has been able to mitigate the sweaty pits.</li>
            <li> I am almost done with my first bottle and I am going to order the 3-Pack next.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Sweat Block product that is currently the leading antiperspirant product in the market</li>
            <li> especially if its hot out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> especially if its hot out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Inability to wear normal t-shirts at home (had to wear old shirts) because they would get ruined by sweat no matter the temperature of the environment.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> have finally finished my first roll of this stuff.</li>
            <li> have finally finished my first roll of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because I have been suffering from extreme sweating for the longest time.</li>
            <li> It looks like the chemical make up is pretty similar to Drysol</li>
            <li> I applied it just one time the first night like the directions said, and I wasn&#x27;t sweating abnormally for the next 3-4 days!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t at first, but they made a big difference when I did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Followed instructions exactly as stated and it simply does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, if you click on the purchaser to see other items reviews, you will notice that many have this listed as their only product.</li>
            <li> I tried CertainDri for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> I started using this product last April 2013 and for the first 2 weeks it was doing well.</li>
            <li> First time I tried it, the next day I didn&#x27;t sweat.</li>
            <li> The day after my first night of using it, I had not even a drop of sweat in my armpit the next day.</li>
            <li> The very next day after using it the first night I had no problems.</li>
            <li> so now I only use this when it&#x27;s really hot.</li>
            <li> I am wearing a silk blouse right now with no dark patches under the arms which is something I never could get away with before, even after using all the different varieties of over the counter heavy-duty antiperspirants.  </li>
            <li> Please test small amounts with different brands on different parts of your body to see if there is any reaction with your favorite types of deodorant before full blown use.</li>
            <li> The entire shirt was dark gray with sweat, except for under my arms, it was comical to the point I was showing strangers in the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Certainly better than past products but not amazing like most people describe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found a good dose amount that nearly never burns or irritates, and even if it does it only lasts a few minutes for me now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products I have used that TRULY works through a strong antiperspirant action.</li>
            <li> Putting it on only before bed and only a few times a week sounded a little too good to be true to me, looks like it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> heartfelt thank you from my part to the people of Certain Dri</li>
            <li> Then I decided to make a compromise and give certain dri a try because while it does have aluminum in it, it doesn&#x27;t have fragrance or preservatives which is what I guess allowed it to get a low toxicity rating from ewg.org.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri Anti-Perspirant, Solid, 1.7 oz.]].</li>
            <li> It is largely ineffective for such a problem.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri is the only thing that works for me, and I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> After going through all of the anti-perspirant deodorants in the grocey store, I finally found Certain Dri on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only took 3 days for it to begin fully working and now, i havent had sweat pits since i started using Certain Dri.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just make sure you screw the cap in as tight as possible after each use, if not the product will leak out.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the Certain Dri solid.  </li>
            <li> story short, Certain Dri is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I then threw my open bottle of Certain Dri in the trash.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri Clinical Strength Solid Anti-Perspirant”</li>
            <li> Up until I tried Certain Dri, I went through dozens of different anti-antiperspirants to no avail.</li>
            <li> I used it again and the next day SWEAT FREE not a drop of sweat to be found, my armpits were as dry as the desert!</li>
            <li> Certain dri is a clear, roll on liquid that dries several minutes after you put it on and has never stained any of my shirts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pictures and descriptions on amazon have not been updated, the OLD formula for Certain Dri used to contain only three ingredients: Aluminum Chloride (Antiperspirant), Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), and Water.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference for everyday life</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference for everyday life</li>
            <li> To be clear ...</li>
            <li> This product would be worth the cost even if it was 10 times more expensive.</li>
            <li> However it can itch and burn if you put it directly on.</li>
            <li> Package says for sensitive skin try the stick.  </li>
            <li> Old Spice clinical strength, Gillette clinical strength, Mitchum,</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 5 days now, and the sweat on my armpits has completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> Word of advice, however, don&#x27;t ever let it near your lady&#x27;s lady-bits; Certain-Dri takes no prisoners in the war on wetness...</li>
            <li> Stops sweating completely for 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> - just wow.</li>
            <li> every day.&lt;br /&gt;During a stressful week, I completely forgot to use it,</li>
            <li> every day.&lt;br /&gt;During a stressful week, I completely forgot to use it,</li>
            <li> so I stopped using it and just stuck with Lady Mitchum (which was almost completely ineffective as an anti-perspirant).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so I was surprised of my reaction to this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin or allergies, aluminum chloride gives off a lot of acid.</li>
            <li> Now..it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li> Wow, so I have been suffering from sweaty armpit for years.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything including natural remedies and nothing has worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if I didn&#x27;t put enough on, then my sweat wouldn&#x27;t be properly absorbed and I&#x27;d get wet patches and feel really itchy.</li>
            <li> I wish they would sell me the old formula for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m extrememly self conscious about, and I feel embarrassed because of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly two weeks and notice my sweating has reduced dramatically.</li>
            <li> People say it burns, but I felt nothing so far.</li>
            <li> obviously, I sweat too much.</li>
            <li> sexually aroused</li>
            <li> I used to use the old formula years ago that was clear and runny.</li>
            <li> before I would get out of the shower and start sweating instantly carrying on through the whole day.</li>
            <li> , pain goes away with time, don&#x27;t apply directly after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different clinical strength antiperspirants and this is the only one that I don&#x27;t have to worry about wet underarms when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to over apply, it can cause skin irritation, but 3 swipes per pit and you&#x27;ll be golden,</li>
            <li> I sweat heavily under my arms, and ruined many shirts back in the day.</li>
            <li> I roll this on at night only once a week and barely sweat (only time is 95 plus weather in full uniform with 30 lbs of gear on</li>
            <li> They have improved it by making it more thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> NO WET SPOTS!!!</li>
            <li> In the mornings I wear just a plain old anti-perspirant/deordant more for psychological reasons or habit.</li>
            <li> It bleached the color right out of them leaving big white tie-die looking splotches on the armpits of the shirts.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with regular deodorant, however, now I&#x27;m able to just put a very thin layer of deodorant on and still feel comfortable throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I felt some burning when I was first using the product, but try to apply it on a dry underarm to lessen it.</li>
            <li> If you put it on and have water on your underarms, it seems to sting a bit, dry yourself off first.  </li>
            <li> I wait for my skin to dry some first.</li>
            <li> For me that&#x27;s my neck, which is not a bad at all, just a slight dampness.</li>
            <li> For me that&#x27;s my neck, which is not a bad at all, just a slight dampness.</li>
            <li> The first day or or two I still had a little armpit sweat but after about a week of using it every other day, my pits are nice and dry!  </li>
            <li> Before bed, I use 2-4 strokes of the Certain Dri roll-on, then leave it for just a bit to dry, and then use 4-6 swipes of the Certain Dri solid anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> After trading out my regular, bargain-brand deodorant for a clinical deodorant, I found that my sweating disappeared completely.&lt;br /&gt;About a month ago, I lost my Certain Dri bottle for a few days, which meant that my perspiration went back to a more minimal level (with the Certain Dri having been \\&quot;built up\\&quot; over time and still using a clinical deodorant).</li>
            <li> You can also try the solid version if you are particularly concerned about having overly sensitive</li>
            <li> No sweat because of Certain Dri, no smell because of regular deodorant, no wet shirts and embarrassing telltale hype rings.</li>
            <li> Definately worth a try if other anti-perspirants have not worked well for you.</li>
            <li> While shaving my armpits this morning there was some discomfort due to sensitivity of the underarm, but again, worth it for not a drop of sweat all day.</li>
            <li> the fact that you only need a small amount to work effectively, plus you do not need to apply it daily, can help reduce the risk of skin irritation.</li>
            <li> the fact that you only need a small amount to work effectively, plus you do not need to apply it daily, can help reduce the risk of skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Experienced a distinctly unpleasant burning sensation on the skin directly where I had applied it, which did not subside for quite some time.</li>
            <li> By the time I wake up, there is a faint smell of sweat, but I feel dry, and that makes me infinitely more comfortable.</li>
            <li> it really keeps you dry, I also use a day antiperspirant but finally found a product that really helped for that matter</li>
            <li> Use every other day, works better than any other product out there.</li>
            <li> Cold, warm, hot, didn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li> Itch like crazy for a couple of hours, but pretty effective.</li>
            <li> My shirts never lasted long as I had to throw them away because of the stains (and smell) and I certainly would never put them in the dryer after washing, because the sweat stains would have \\&quot;set in\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful with how much you apply and letting it dry before doing things, but I put this on every other day on my hands and feet and am a 100% satisfied, repeat customer.</li>
            <li> It is SO nice to not have to worry about soaking shirts everyday, and keeping my arms down to hide it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone on Amazon, and in a year when I graduate and am a medical doctor, I will recommend it to all my patients as well.</li>
            <li> The next morning I was in a high stress situation, went to the restroom and checked for damage.  </li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews and was very optimistic especially when some people were reporting having to only use the product once in a couple of months after several weeks of straight use.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin,  I&#x27;d recommend slowing down the applications to ever other day or more.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it stings badly, but it eventually stops, and I have to be sure not to use too much (I&#x27;ve always used so much deodorant!!).  </li>
            <li> I read the hundreds of positive reviews (for the single bottle) and figured, for $4 or $5 each...what the heck.</li>
            <li> I am an axillary hyperhidrosis sufferer (some excessive sweating of the pits) and in a quest for some relief tried almost all types of anti-perspirant available.</li>
            <li> This is the first day in my life since puberty that I have not had wet underarms or sweat stains on my shirt.</li>
            <li> A minimal amount of stinging is perfectly normal, especially when you first start to use it.</li>
            <li> I have used many other products with no success - Not and issue here.  </li>
            <li> But you really are covered for a few days with just one application, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I use Certain Dry</li>
            <li> saw Certain Dry here on Amazon and figured what the heck it can&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> I happened upon certain dry by chance, while at CVS.</li>
            <li> Have not hardly sweat at all except when working out at the gym which is totally acceptable to me!  </li>
            <li> With only 2-4 strokes of the roll-on it&#x27;s not as itchy, and even if it is a bit, I find the Certain Dri solid provides a bit of relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still use my regular deodorant (Degree), but that&#x27;s only because the Certain Dri has no scent</li>
            <li> Certain dri is the ONLY thing to ever stop me from constantly sweating under my arms.</li>
            <li> I had it shipped to a friend in the US because I live outside the US.</li>
            <li> It does dry fast, but if you happen to be in a humid place it might take a tad longer.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really keep me dry at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;The solid did absolutely nothing for me, and it burned my skin, despite what I think was a proper application.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but I can&#x27;t tell you how appreciative I am to have dry pits!</li>
            <li> since middle school I have worn extra clothing and always dark clothing because of the huge pit stains I would get, even in cold/rainy weather.</li>
            <li> my Dri like no other)</li>
            <li> For about the first week I used it I put it on every other day.  </li>
            <li> After trying every leading brand and choosing all of the ones that say \\&quot;guaranteed dry all day\\&quot; blah blah blah, only to be visibly sweating within the first half-hour, I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li> To give an understanding of my problem: On cool days, I don&#x27;t sweat that much (or even in cool environments), but once it&#x27;s hot, or I get nervous even if the AC is on (think a job interview or even a date or even having a difficult conversation or a hard work-out at the gym), my armpits (even my tummy and areas that shall remain unmentioned) start to sweat.</li>
            <li> my pits tend to sweat a lot even if i&#x27;m not being active so this has been the first thing besides stick antiperspirant that i&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes still get a little stinging, but the benefits are definitely worth</li>
            <li> Normally, I would say any product claiming this is making a ridiculous claim that is anything but true.</li>
            <li> Normally, I would say any product claiming this is making a ridiculous claim that is anything but true.</li>
            <li> There are several other brands of clinical strength antiperspirants available but the only one that actually works is ZeroSweat.</li>
            <li> Long story short, Certain Dri is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> It took a major problem that bothered me immensely and totally &amp; completely resolved it.</li>

            <li> Not going to repeat all the other positive reviews.</li>
            <li> - to complete and total dryness ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have spent that much each month for the peace of mind that I get.</li>
            <li> I barely even notice it now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I barely even notice it now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wow, it is an anti-perspirant that actually works.  </li>
            <li> I had higher hopes, but the product works average.  </li>
            <li> Dri offers 4 different products:&lt;br /&gt;---1.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just BARELY)</li>
            <li> Kind of creepy that it stops sweat in one day.</li>
            <li> However, the PM roll-on can be more irritating to skin, so the PM stick gives you an alternative if irritation occurs.</li>

            <li> I decided not to return because the product wasnt worth the trouble..</li>
            <li> if that is the case with you, just until you get used to the certain dry, which for me was a week later.</li>
            <li> antiperspirants can be more irritating than other products, and there are two Certain Dri PM products consumers can choose from.</li>

            <li> Even in an air conditioned room, my underarms can get pretty damp/wet just from sitting down and getting my work done.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> It costs a little more than the other big name brands</li>
            <li> A friend who suffered from the same issue recommended this Certain Dri, and specifically this Certain Dri PM Roll-On (found in a green and white</li>
            <li> So I gave up on Certain Dri and tried other approaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a single spot!</li>
            <li> The roll on Certain Dri is, definitely, not my first choice.  </li>
            <li> I apply this every other night, before bed, and then apply the Certain Dri AM in the morning</li>
            <li> I really wish they had specified that it was a different formula which is not apparent until you open the package.</li>
            <li> Certain Dri is the only product that has kept my underarms dry!</li>
            <li> Some people complain of stinging arm pits, and mine felt a slight sting when i first used it.  </li>
            <li> Certain Dri bottle recently dried completely up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other clinical strength anti-perspirants which didn&#x27;t seem to do too much.  </li>
            <li> and all I have to say is that it really works, unlike other deodorants that promise to work up to 24, 48, 72 hours but</li>
            <li> It stings and itches a little bit for about ten minutes, but it&#x27;s worth that.</li>
            <li> The package said it might take a few days to start working, but I saw a big difference from the first time!</li>
            <li> applied maybe 10 total swipes around each entire armpit before bed the first night I received the product.&lt;br /&gt;The very next day, I did not sweat a SINGLE DROP (in my armpits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a single drop of sweat in my armpits, yet.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Some worked better than others, but none had dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and can&#x27;t remember the last time I developed big armpit sweat</li>
            <li> If you apply your standard deodorant directly over it the next morning the pain goes away.</li>
            <li> the only problem is that the liquid is so thin that sometimes, after a trip, for example, more liquid than needed pours out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> unless you have some crazy exceptional sweating, it will work for you...</li>
            <li> unless you have some crazy exceptional sweating, it will work for you...</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said to try certain dri as a non-prescription option, but warned me that the area needed to be totally dry, or there would be a reaction on my skin making hydrochloric acid, clearly not something I wanted.</li>
            <li> It will dry your armpits out when you first put it on and they do get a little itchy, but since you put it on at night before bed I usually fall asleep and my armpits are fine in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> The first night I used it my armpits burned a little</li>
            <li> the first 10-20 minutes, my armpits get a little stinging</li>
            <li> i applied the first night I felt a little itchy, but that Is just the feeling of the sweat goblins dying.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> The first day I used it I noticed a little bit of an improvement.</li>
            <li> I will say that the product does tingle a little at first and sometimes itches, but as you get used to it (over a month or two) you don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li> and I want y&#x27;all to know that I during my most recent old spice rotation I got pretty bad chemical burns around my armpit areas.</li>
            <li> still no relief on other approaches, I came back to Certain Dri, but in combination with the [[ASIN:B002BMB1MG</li>
            <li> When I first starting using it, I wasn&#x27;t sweating at all, but I guess its effectiveness wanes slightly with time.</li>
            <li> You have to apply it at night (as per the directions) and it normally gives you dry days by the fourth day of consecutive use.</li>
            <li> but if you can take the rash it is worth it as I&#x27;ve been out to social events I avoided in the past .</li>
            <li> now I use this product maybe once a week or so, and just a simple, light deodorant (which, as I discovered is actually quite hard to find, seems like just about everything on the grocery store shelf is anti-perspirant) in between.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every anti perspirant on the market - either they did not work or burned and caused ugly rashes - including the prescription kind!</li>
            <li> I generally apply this every between 48 and 72 hours, and I use this alongside a regular scented deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> *** lasts at least 2 full days.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had a problem to pick up a dozodorant until I tried Certain.</li>
            <li> Seriously, stop reading reviews and buy this and then go put on a light blue dress shirt and go running in 100 degree heat.</li>
            <li> Thanks for all the other reviews that sold this to me!</li>
            <li> That first day I did have some sweat show through but much less than before!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it matters--it&#x27;s more out of habit and for a little freshness under the pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like you shaved pits with a super dull knife.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that when some people apply this for the first few weeks it tends to burn or sting.</li>
            <li> This is the antiperspirant I recommend most, for people with trouble with excessive sweating.</li>
            <li> I had red welts under my arms from this, and minor irritation the next day, but to my absolute delight I was not sweating even a single drop.</li>
            <li> ZeroSweat is the only one that still contains just the three basic ingredients of Aluminum Chloride, Baking Soda and Water; all the other brands are loaded with too much junk to actually work effectively.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The rest of the day my pits stayed DRY -- in the middle of the summer, no less!</li>
            <li> rushed back and forth all over the place, and when I&#x27;d normally have these 2 giant wet patches on my shirt at the underarm area, this time there was NOTHING.</li>
            <li> rushed back and forth all over the place, and when I&#x27;d normally have these 2 giant wet patches on my shirt at the underarm area, this time there was NOTHING.</li>
            <li> The Certain Dry did cause a bit of skin irritation if used too frequently, hence my mention to use it every few nights instead of every night.</li>
            <li> In the morning I recommend using Clinique antiperspirant-deodorant or other product with similar % of aluminum chlorohydrate for high level of protection all day.  </li>
            <li> And black shirts were getting white stains from there being too much of it.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and it only took a day or 2 to get back to my normal smelling self, plus this stuff is completely clear liquid</li>
            <li> I find that this is very effective at cutting down my armpit sweating.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I came across Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> “Everyday Strength Certain Dri AM Underarm Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Roll-On”&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first week or two that I used this stuff, I found myself waking up in the middle of the night scratching my underarms raw.</li>
            <li> deodorant is a little watery, but you&#x27;ll get used to it once you notice that you really don&#x27;t perspire or at the end of the day, there&#x27;s no residual smell on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> “Everyday Strength Certain Dri AM Underarm Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Solid”&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe in writing reviews if a product is exceptionally good or exceptionally bad -in</li>
            <li> That first week the product did irritate me a little, but after that the irritation stopped, ant the dry underarms just kept going.  </li>
            <li> right now the only negative thought I have about this product is &amp;</li>
            <li> When at least 15 other deodorant/antiperspirant products didn’t, THIS is the product that allows me to wear light blue shirts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and a few minutes after applying, I started to notice sharp stinging and intense itching.</li>
            <li> Warning, don&#x27;t ever use right after shaving(wait at least 24 hours), and wait until it dries before putting on your PJ&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning to dry pits again, and not a single drop of perspiration the entire day.</li>
            <li> I am debating whether or not I received a bad roll-on considering all the other great results.</li>
            <li> I use it every three days and still use my regular deodorant daily (not sure you really even need to do this).  </li>
            <li> Frequent lifting of arms to check armpits due to (2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Frequent lifting of arms to check armpits due to (2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for anyone trying to figure out a way to save a little embarrassment with sweating.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve found that when it gets really bad, it&#x27;s best not to use the product for a few nights or shave the area until the stinging goes down.</li>
            <li> I received this product last week and applied before bed, and the next day I was completely dry that day and the next.  </li>
            <li> wear long sleeve dress shirts at work, and I would constantly sweat through them, this is the only deodorant that has worked for me, don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lately, I have been noticing that my armpits were getting sweatier than usual and set out to find a better ant-perspirant.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to switch between heavy-duty brands to keep my body from getting used to them and therefore not work as well, but I don&#x27;t have that problem with Certain Dri.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it does sting somewhat for about a half hour after application, but that little bit of discomfort is worth it to us.</li>
            <li> only weird thing is that when weather is hot and I was supposed to sweat, I feel like if my armpits were hot and wet, but I touch them and nothing, they&#x27;re</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me, you understand how life-changing something as simple as an effective anti-perspirant can be - and how impossible to find that is.</li>
            <li> I put it on again last night, and same thing today, dry armpits.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews - but this stuff is absolutely</li>
            <li> Each time I wear it, I seem to sweat just as much, if not more.</li>
            <li> (you put this on at night, it is a clear liquid) or use a white t-shirt, because it can discolor clothing (only upon application, not after it has dried)</li>
            <li> And if I forget to put it on for a day, it still lasts long enough to get me through.</li>
            <li> Since I gave the item such a long testing period, I am now being told that I cannot return them because I am out of my 30 day return period.</li>
            <li> But since then, I only notice minor burning when my armpits are already irritated, for example</li>
            <li> actually amazed by how well it preforms and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> invisible roll on, long lasting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally a picky person</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week  and frequently forget it &amp; it has never let me down.</li>
            <li> armpits are FINALLY dry (85-90% reduced or more) after having tried at least 10 other anti-perspirant options (including prescription ones) with no success.</li>
            <li> Now I just use a regular deodorant and I stay dry ALL day.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I am doing something extra to stay dry.</li>
            <li> your pits will stay dry the next day!</li>
            <li> The only dry spots on his shirt were his pits.</li>
            <li> After some time I&#x27;m just using it once a week, or even less frequent.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry for several days at a time too.  </li>
            <li> I use it the way the say to, roll it on before bed and the next day you should be dry, sometimes two days.  </li>
            <li> It dries clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is absolutely critical that this product be used correctly because correct usage will 1) allow it to work to its full potential, 2) reduce the chance of causing irritation, and 3) avoid staining expensive clothing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is absolutely critical that this product be used correctly because correct usage will 1) allow it to work to its full potential, 2) reduce the chance of causing irritation, and 3) avoid staining expensive clothing.</li>
            <li> I would say that I produce an average amount of sweat; mostly in extreme heat, but also during activities with a high level of movement or stress.</li>
            <li> and after two weeks of applying it only at bedtime I am completely dry all day!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why the Aluminum Chloride in this product would be so much better than the Aluminum Chlorohydrate in common store-bought antiperspirants, but it seems to work extremely well.  </li>
            <li> You might be a little sensitive at the beginning (I was) but that goes away.</li>
            <li> It may be a little more expensive per bottle than regular deodorant</li>
            <li> After discovering certain dri a few years ago, I have never purchased any other product for keeping my pits dri!  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the slight stinging  - I shave under my arms every other day and this helps lessen the stinging but after a few days of using the product it was less of a stinging feel and more of a little itchy feel...</li>
            <li> However, it does make my armpits really itchy, which I&#x27;ve heard is common when using this product.</li>
            <li> Yes, love this stuff like crazy.</li>
            <li> so you can stock up for a long time and not worry about it.</li>
            <li> For a person who used to have a constant wet spot under their arms, this product is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> I have 2 teenage sons who have had wet under-arms for years.</li>
            <li> My skin has had some minor irritation off and on</li>
            <li> second thing you need to know is that this stuff has roughly the consistency of battery acid.</li>
            <li> The invoice did say that i had spent $42, which upset me - I contacted them and was reassured that they had only billed me the listed price.  </li>
            <li> you could see the big wet patch under each arm.</li>
            <li> Well I bought this as a last resort with not much hope and</li>
            <li> All my white shirts end up with yellow armpits after only a few wears.  </li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, I have always sweated profusely in my under-arms.</li>
            <li> minor drawbacks</li>
            <li> the only problem I had after long term used is that, it left my underarm dark,</li>
            <li> 3 days later, the sweat was so minimal.</li>
            <li> As long as you apply it once per day then you don&#x27;t need to reapply after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have had heavy underarm sweat since about 14 years old.</li>
            <li> The strange part: they tell you to use this product at night, just before going to sleep -- not after a bath/shower.  </li>
            <li> I work from home and find myself sitting at my desk for long stretches.</li>
            <li> It was embarrassing and gross and I had to be careful of the kinds of shirts I could wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since and will be as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I apply certain dri at night, usually every other night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and have found that if I apply sparingly, then rub in with my fingertips, THEN blot my underarms gently with a slightly damp towel, it doesn&#x27;t burn or itch.  </li>
            <li> I honestly would sweat like crazy for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> and it keeps me dry all day long.</li>
            <li> It might be hard to get used to if your skin is sensitive, but the minor itchiness was no big deal for me.  </li>
            <li> Certain Dri was one I tried skeptically optimistic and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Also, I only apply this stuff every other night -</li>
            <li> I know there are other similar products out there</li>
            <li> I find that if irritation occurs, I only apply every other day.  </li>
            <li> i think it is the same like other deodorants</li>
            <li> so i tried applying this only every other night.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to dose the liquid because it isn&#x27;t particularly sticky, it sort of just drips off the roller ball.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m bone dry all week.</li>
            <li> Bone dry.</li>
            <li> It keeps me so dry.</li>
            <li> and you had I never had time to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> They became dry and I just applied a bit of lotion to help.</li>
            <li> When I used bleach to wash the dishes it would leave my hands dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone 3-4 days without applying this at night and have kept dry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> If you have issues with staying dry, do yourself a favor and pick this up and follow it as instructed.</li>
            <li> and there if it means I will be 100% dry all the time.</li>
            <li> This is the roll-on version of the dry stick.</li>
            <li> I took all of my suits and dresses to the dry cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I can put my arm around the babes who flock to my dry embrace without sliming then with pit juice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it as directed: before bed, on dry, unbroken skin, NOT after shaving (did that once</li>
            <li> My shirts stay dry, I&#x27;m not ashamed to raise my arm in class, and no one looks at my underarms anymore</li>
            <li> I tried the Axe dry which had 17% anti-pers, I even tried the Mich. Ultra Advamce(Clinical Strength).</li>
            <li> I am completely dry all the time.</li>
            <li> It was just DRY.</li>
            <li> still dry as a...</li>
            <li> It works, and it keeps your underarm just DRY.</li>
            <li> It was just DRY.</li>
            <li> still dry as a...</li>
            <li> It works, and it keeps your underarm just DRY.</li>
            <li> In that case, lift your arms in front of your fan, or even fanning the area with a piece of cardboard or something (it takes seconds to dry).</li>
            <li> DRY.</li>
            <li> my shirts stayed completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t had itching or burning since following the above routine and I do it everyday.</li>
            <li> For as long as I could remember, I always made clothing choices with armpit sweat in mind - dark colors, extra layers, etc.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient not only gives effectiveness, but also longevity.</li>
            <li> As a person that has tried &amp;#34;the strongest of the strong&amp;#34;  antiperspirants from all the major players, with poor results at best, I had resigned myself to a life of sweaty, stinky pits that became annoying to me within a few hours of my morning shower.  </li>
            <li> every single one.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear dark shirts because then it was extra noticable</li>
            <li> but because of the giant dark patches in my shirts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I am not piling it on every single night, the irritation has gone down immensely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I am not piling it on every single night, the irritation has gone down immensely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling insane underarm wetness most of my adult life, it&#x27;d gotten to the embarrassing point of regularly using paper towels inside my shirts to give the illusion of staying dry and even then having to change them out several times a day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to using it every third day without loss of effect.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> No more yellow stains on white clothes &amp; no white spots on dark clothing.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry!  </li>
            <li> I bet you&#x27;ll be dry under the arms!</li>
            <li> If you put it on at night it&#x27;ll last for up to 72 hours, but for me usually wears off around the second day.</li>
            <li> All of my shirts (including work) was either white or black.</li>
            <li> I tried the solid, which was supposed to be less prone to</li>
            <li> The problem at first was that I didn&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;d applied the roll-on properly, since it comes in this weird ball-roller thing which I&#x27;m not used to.</li>
            <li> A small amount of physical exercise (walking) would produce massive puddles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like may reviewers I used to avoid everything except black and white shirts because of profuse sweating.</li>
            <li> He passed that excessive sweating onto my brother and my teenage son also has the same issue.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m finding its harder to get a product to keep me dry.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for three and a half months which caused it to eat the layers of skin away in a red, burning rash.</li>
            <li> Certain dri is less expensive and has completely stopped my underarm wetness.</li>
            <li> day I was wearing  black shirt outside in 90+ degree heat and digging holes and STILL didn&#x27;t have wet spots under my arms!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> In just two weeks or so of not using Certain Dri, my perspiration has gotten much, much worse again.</li>
            <li> Often I follow up application with secret for the scent and it helps reduce skin irritation that I think the certain dri alone causes.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and only use a little and never after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reapply this product every other night before bed, and I&#x27;ve been dry every day since.  </li>
            <li> gave it one less star only due to the burning.</li>
            <li> gave it one less star only due to the burning.</li>
            <li> Sounds bad but if you stay the course your body gets used to it and you wont have the issue any more.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s bloody amazing because that s</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s bloody amazing because that s</li>
            <li> However, in my opinion, this is a minor annoyance and a small price to pay to not have to throw out pit-stained t-shirts after only having worn them once or twice.</li>
            <li> That night I put it on, and I have not had a wet shirt at my underarm area since.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of getting yellow stains on the underarms of my white shirts and the constant sweating and smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years now and I will never go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> The clothing under my armpits used to get wet and stained and now I don&#x27;t sweat under my arms when using this.</li>
            <li> my underarms are always wet.  </li>
            <li> I think one of the only cons to this is how messy it is.</li>
            <li> I just cannot believe that I&#x27;ve solved my lifelong problem.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d always have wet spots on my shirt, which was embarassing.</li>
            <li> Initially you&#x27;ll have to apply it everynight, but after a few nights, you can apply it once every 4 days or so.</li>
            <li> Partially.</li>
            <li> I suffered for years with underarm stains in my clothes and embarrassing wet spots.  </li>
            <li> Shirts always wet under the arms?</li>
            <li> Be careful when using it with any non-white shirt.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to get my pajamas wet from it.</li>
            <li> I gave it a couple of tries until I gave up.</li>
            <li> but it actually lasts longer because you don&#x27;t have to put it on everyday.</li>
            <li> Put it on the night before and my pits weren&#x27;t wet for work.</li>
            <li> This one is too wet</li>
            <li> The key is just to use a few swipes, just as the instructions say.</li>
            <li> And in school..I&#x27;m always in the center of attention because I&#x27;m in the student council</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re careful I haven&#x27;t seen any stains on clothes(which</li>
            <li> heck, it wasn&#x27;t even remotely damp or clammy or anything of that sorts.</li>
            <li> heck, it wasn&#x27;t even remotely damp or clammy or anything of that sorts.</li>
            <li> It comes in a green and white box, and this listing is for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---2.</li>
            <li> It comes in a green &amp; white box also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth it though, when I think of all the times I am in stress mode at work and my antiperspirant fails me.</li>
            <li> so be careful with that.</li>
            <li> i have carried wet underarm since i was a teenager.</li>
            <li> one of the 3 bottles was empty</li>
            <li> No more embarrassing pit stains, and I can finally wear long sleeved shirts!</li>
            <li> It is very long acting, and it does work for well past the 24-hour mark (mind you,</li>
            <li> It is very long acting, and it does work for well past the 24-hour mark (mind you,</li>
            <li> The waiting to dry issue is the only problem that I have had, so I usually keep a can antiperspirant spray on in the bathroom, too.</li>
            <li> My armpits were still a little damp, but no sweat stains at all, and by the third day, I was certainly dry!!!</li>
            <li> This is particularly worse when I&#x27;m expected to give a pitch or presentation to my office (dark patches are very distracting...)</li>
            <li> Over time I&#x27;ve learned the proper doseage and have discovered that for me, an application every other night keeps me almost entirely dry, with the exception of very heavy labor where I still get some sweat, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Also, on a few occasions I had forgotten to apply it in the evening so applied it in the morning instead, and subsequently noticed dark stains on my white undershirts as they come out of the wash, much worse than with ordinary anti-antiperspirants that have the same effect over time owing to the aluminum (the active ingredient in combating perspiration, apparently).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m dry as can be, even lifting weights with a tight cotton shirt on.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that the roll on tends to pull on armpit hairs, but this is a small price to pay for having NO odor and NO sweat.  </li>
            <li> Ever since Middle School, I&#x27;ve had problems with excessive underarm perspiration.</li>
            <li> that said, as other reviewers have mentioned, there&#x27;s some discomfort after application.</li>
            <li> i use it every 3 days, never after shower and on the other days I don&#x27;t have to use any other antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wet a drips but its works!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if my sweaty hands caused my anxiety or the other way around.</li>
            <li> Tried a bunch of other products but they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I had been having EXTREME underarm sweating for almost a year, and it was legitimately ruining my life.</li>
            <li> saw some other people say it burns</li>
            <li> As others trying this have written, I&#x27;ve used other products including clinical strength antiperspirants (esp.</li>
            <li> is the one I use every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and I like the</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in another universe of effectiveness, compared to other anti-perspirants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have excessive sweating, and this product has been used by me since my teen years.</li>
            <li> Use initally for two days in a row and then every other day or every two days.</li>
            <li> The other 6 days of the week, I apply before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> Not necessary to use every day, but I did not ever have a problem with excessive sweating.  </li>
            <li> I tried a wide assortment of deoderants and found no success...</li>
            <li> The only product that has helped me with excessive perspiration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant (usually bought it at different retail stores) for about 15 years</li>
            <li> Since I found it over a year ago, I haven&#x27;t used any other product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is just the first day ill try and review in about 2 weeks to see if it continues as it started..</li>
            <li> i have tried all other over the counter brands and they did not work.</li>
            <li> YOU AND OTHER PEOPLE WILL COUGH, SNEEZE, HAVE HEADACHES, AND AN IRRITATED THROAT.</li>
            <li> and you may have to stop for a month or so, but I experience this with Shampoo and other antiperspirants all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the other brands out there claiming to fix the issue no</li>
            <li> Other friend have tried this on my recommendation, and they now swear by it too.</li>
            <li> morning I was a little damp, but was dry as bone for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> my underarms get really wet just from walking from point to point (e.g. down a block)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> But after the first few uses, no more excessive sweat!</li>
            <li> I started using this a few years ago and it did not seem to work, then again I did not take it upon myself to follow the instructions, and used it only every few days.</li>
            <li> work in an office and have severe hyperhidrosis in my underarms specifically, so its not from running or being active.</li>
            <li> Now I only use it every 4-5 days and wear regular deodorant/anti-perspirant  (Secret) each morning.</li>
            <li> short, results were equal or worse than over&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> and it was the most miserable night of non-sleep in my life), and it still causes nearly unbearable itching.</li>
            <li> There is an itchiness right after you put it on at night, it could be a little bit uncomfortable, but it is not something that bothers you all day.</li>
            <li> you have trouble with unsightly redness that migrates past your underarms (it can be difficult to apply this precisely, because it is a liquid), try applying body lotion everywhere</li>
            <li> I apply it every other day on average and it does the job for</li>
            <li> Once it kicks in, you can cut down usage to maybe every other night or even less.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> ; Certain Dri contains a bunch of added ingredients which have made the product completely useless.</li>
            <li> minutes after putting on conventional antiperspirant/deodorant combos).</li>
            <li> It is recommended that the product be applied at bedtime when perspiration glands are less active.  </li>
            <li> It has worked especially well these past few 90+ degree days.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it works really well.</li>
            <li> This made my armpit dark though</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sweated very slightly that day, an unbelievable improvement from my entire life before.</li>
            <li> Leaving the house I would already have spots of wetness coming through, and by the afternoon even with my arms down</li>
            <li> Some drops did leak down my sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It virtually shuts down armpit sweat.</li>
            <li> My father has always sweated alot to the point that when he drove a truck at a mine he would shave during the hotter months to try to cut down on the odor.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have sweat rings down to my waist.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just forcing myself to keep my hands down instead of fist pumping the s</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m telling you as someone who has an underarm thats on a perpetual perspiration overdrive EVEN from sitting down in an airconditioned room.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m telling you as someone who has an underarm thats on a perpetual perspiration overdrive EVEN from sitting down in an airconditioned room.</li>
            <li> I find using 5 swipes helps keep down the prickly itching, and using cornstarch when the roll-on dries, or a hydrocortizone creme or both.</li>
            <li> The minute I got out of the shower I would feel sweat running down the inside of my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other products, reapplying deodorant, paper towels on the pits, everything!  </li>
            <li> Well now I have very minimal sweat spots!</li>
            <li> Give it a shot, if it works for you, and you were like me, the price is very minimal compared to the embarrassment!</li>
            <li> I use three or less swipes under each arm before bed</li>
            <li> Before all I could wear was black shirts because I was embarrassed too wear anything else.</li>
            <li> Dove didn&#x27;t even work for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Certain</li>
            <li> I used to buy a lot of black clothes to try and hide them.  </li>
            <li> In the summer I always tried to wear sleeveless shirts so there would be less pit to stain!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a week, too.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t give it a horrible review as continued sweating is more likely my problem than it is the product.  </li>
            <li> I checked the ingredients vs. the one I previously used, which is no longer made.  </li>
            <li> This time I thought that I would reduce the number of swabs to 4 to see if the stinging would be less.    </li>
            <li> Previously I could change shirts and in less than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s crazy because I felt hot and like I should be sweating, I kept expecting to sweat, but I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tends to leak, no matter how tightly you screw on the cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldnt wear tight shirts.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days my hands were dry, but at least they weren&#x27;t sweaty.</li>
            <li> The product let me dry for at least 4 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it to subtle other places and now when I exercise it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve wet my pants.  </li>
            <li> Also, the product stings my underarms a little.</li>
            <li> My experience is that each little 1.2 fl Oz.</li>
            <li> Like someone else said it&#x27;s a little like trying to pour a cup of water under your armpits.</li>
            <li> No more extreme burning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No more extreme burning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No more embarrassing wet marks!  </li>
            <li> I never before noticed that my skin is even a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been extremely self-conscious of my excessive underarm sweating.</li>
            <li> A little itchy feeling in his armpits he said but bearable</li>
            <li> In the morning I just apply a deodorant (not an antiperspirant) or just skip and just a little cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tip</li>
            <li> The stinging sensation comes in little pulses here and there.</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;re all going to die from something...at least I&#x27;ll be dry!</li>
            <li> To gently stop her, one night I applied Certain Dri to my face (it tastes terrible).</li>
            <li> I still sweat a little bit after using it, but the level is sweating is definitely drastically decreased.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works, only if I use as directed and wear at night, my skin burns like crazy and leaves a rash, so I just use it in the morning after I shower</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all except make my armpits itchy for a few hours after applying it.</li>
            <li> I did have a period of itching and burning (not severe) that went away as it dried.</li>
            <li> On the days I shave, I shave a few hours before I apply</li>
            <li> On the days I shave, I shave a few hours before I apply</li>
            <li> Also I had to use it everyday during a semester abroad in Mexico</li>
            <li> Use at night and you can follow-up in the morning with your regular antiperspirants (Secret works for me).</li>
            <li> Put on at night, every few days it worked wonders - regardless of the fabrics I wear (synthetic or cotton for example).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing too intolerable or anything, but it&#x27;s certainly not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I got some burning for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> few tips</li>
            <li> waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding this at department stores</li>
            <li> My husband is a heavy sweater.</li>
            <li> so well I didn&#x27;t even need it anymore after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> Now I just put this on before bed every few days</li>
            <li> It did burn a bit a few minutes after I put it on, but if every day will be like today</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing messy to get on the inside of your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be itchy a few minutes after application then</li>
            <li> However, after a few months of using the product during the week and giving myself a break during the weekends, i started to develop a rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy sweater</li>
            <li> This product has had no beneficial effects and I actually feel like my problem is somehow worse than it was before.  </li>
            <li> The next night I used it again and the burning and itching were much worse, when I woke up</li>
            <li> The next day, I noticed a difference in the decreased amount of wetness under my arms already.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday -</li>
            <li> i use it at bed time everyday...</li>
            <li> bought this stuff after reading a few reviews and put it on one night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> few things I&#x27;ve learned over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And of course, using it right after shaving is a bad idea.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> most users, I have tried other clinical products but they did nothing for my nasty pit stains.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> As a person who is relatively active and hardly sits</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned because I have had skin sensitivity to some products in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have always had pretty bad pit stains.  </li>
            <li> the first night my underarms itched so insanely bad that I couldn&#x27;t go to sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty damn painful.    </li>
            <li> It was sweet, but also incredibly annoying.</li>
            <li> must warn you, there is a bit of a down side to this product, at least in my case.</li>
            <li> Give it at least of week or so of using it every other day before you give up on it!</li>
            <li> The itching is a little annoying sometimes on application but the trade off is SO worth it.</li>
            <li> This bad boy REALLY REALLY stings.</li>
            <li> No more ruined shirts caused by pit stains (the stuff in antiperspirants that stain clothes yellow/brown).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed about my excessive sweating.</li>
            <li> husband suffered all his life from excessive perspiration.</li>
            <li> I apply it before I go to bed, usually about 20 minutes before, because it WILL stain your clothes.</li>
            <li> I suffered for years with excessive sweating.</li>
            <li> I was sweating but NOTHING like the usual.  </li>
            <li> It usually costs close to $7 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and these problems are a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product a few days ago, and I have been awe struck!</li>
            <li> Secret) with not much luck.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the difference is.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t take the burning pain (which usually goes away 1 hour after my morning shower and can be ignored), try applying some anti-itch</li>
            <li> It says on the bottle, &amp;#34;stops excessive perspiration (hyperhydrosis) for up to 72 hours&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Imagine the awkwardness of having to explain excessive sweating that store-bought antiperspirants did nothing to solve!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may seem expensive, but one bottle will last me months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is nothing when you suffer from this excessive sweating .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually try to apply it before I go to bed after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> Not sure who would do that, would you?</li>
            <li> No more sweaty pits at work after a day or two</li>
            <li> Took some medication that cause excessive sweating and</li>
            <li> His excessive sweating has always embarrassed him and now that is at an end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> causes excessive itching</li>
            <li> Works like it says, I had problems with over excessive sweating when I would just be sitting in class and this 100% works.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try and remedy the pit stains I get from excessive armpit sweating.</li>
            <li> Again it itched and this time burned alittle, but lasted no more then an hour.</li>
            <li> No more embarrassment, no more worries about what shirts I can or can&#x27;t wear.</li>
            <li> No, this isn&#x27;t the easiest issue to talk about, but having been there I can identify with others and no one should have to go through the distress that excessive underarm sweat can cause.</li>
            <li> No, this isn&#x27;t the easiest issue to talk about, but having been there I can identify with others and no one should have to go through the distress that excessive underarm sweat can cause.</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> It does itch a bit when you use it, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> I have lately been getting some crazy sweat action when I get anxious or nervous.</li>
            <li> This plain ol worked!</li>
            <li> whats really crazy is that when i workout, my underarms barely perspire!</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t too bad either, especially compared to the other stuff that claims to be clinical strength.</li>
            <li> But just thought that I&#x27;d put it out there that there is one very dissatisfied customer :(</li>
            <li> Now I hardly sweat at all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically buy products such as this simply because their claims are often outrageous exaggerations of the truth.</li>
            <li> It made it hard to sleep</li>
            <li> i sweat like crazy and go back immediately.</li>
            <li> (5)Lasts a while (at least 3 months).</li>
            <li> tried this product and found the solution to my icky problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried putting it on in the morning and it is not nearly as effective.</li>
            <li> I put this on after a night shower and I am covered for at least 72 hours.</li>
            <li> I will wake up in the middle of the night, desperate to scratch my arm pits.</li>
            <li> but I still experience pit stains at least 2 or 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> I was using Drysol for years but is was getting rather expensive and harder to obtain being that it is prescription</li>
            <li> If I had to put a percentage on it, I would say it reduces my sweating by at least 95%.</li>
            <li> I tried it for about 3-5 days I believe (from what i remember at least).</li>
            <li> can usually get away with applying it every other day, but I&#x27;m so afraid of sweating I usually apply every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apply wherever your embarrassing sweat glands are (and I do mean WHEREVER).</li>
            <li> The only thing that is kinda of annoying is the stinging for a little bit.</li>
            <li> I seriously thought this wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> FYI, this stuff isn&#x27;t meant to be used daily - apply it every few days as a base.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, a little bit scary, but it works.</li>
            <li> I used to have to bring an extra shirt around some days, that&#x27;s how bad it was.</li>
            <li> I just started my clinical rotations for my doctorate and literally, every second is anxiety provoking, and thus, bad news.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> I purchase this on April 4, 2015 and gave it a chance until now; I figured if it doesn&#x27;t begin to show improvement after two months AT ALL, that the product is not a good one for my needs.</li>
            <li> I woke up and looked at my arm pits in the mirror and was shocked to see the skin was red and inflamed.</li>
            <li> My pits were red and painful when I woke</li>
            <li> Then I decided to try a few all natural deodorants which was a terrible experiment...</li>
            <li> Overall, I am disappointed that this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible- For the people that leave positive reviews...</li>
            <li> even if its just a fluke, i gave this product a 5 star rating for at the very least that one day of dryness...</li>
            <li> the quality of the poor products of both P&amp;G and Colgate.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of sweating like I was.</li>
            <li> Nothing is worse than:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Take it from someone who had THEE WORST sweat pits, this stuff is the real</li>
            <li> I have heavy underarm sweating and this product stops it cold.  </li>
            <li> and once I had children, it got so much worse.</li>
            <li> With that said, I do not find the Roll-On to be excessively irritating and</li>
            <li> With that said, I do not find the Roll-On to be excessively irritating and</li>
            <li> If you are tired of sweating in the pits, fed up with your cloth yellowing, get this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really promote this product for those people who badly swet under arms and that ruins your clothes and makes you feel disgusting.</li>
            <li> It stinks that I wasted almost $20!</li>
            <li> Would usually wake up in the morning with a feeling of (cold) sweat in my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> I usually perspire even when cold</li>
            <li> It burned very badly and barely worked.  </li>
            <li> For me, the difference was dramatic.</li>
            <li> Every single bloody one of them, and none of them works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uncomfortable and sometimes irritating.</li>
            <li> No more papertowl under my arms or embarrassing sweat rings!!!</li>
            <li> So after years of wasting money on products that were ineffective and suffering with uncomfortable underarm wetness</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have never smelled worse in my life!</li>
            <li> I feel like a woman in one of those cheesy Depends commercials.</li>
            <li> useless product though.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to try this because I ran out of my prescription roll on.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product didn&#x27;t work as well as the reviews suggested.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I have been battling nasty, sweaty pits my entire life.  </li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> For some weird reason this product popped up in my suggested items, and I check it out.</li>
            <li> This is expensive and I don&#x27;t see it works.</li>
            <li> it was so uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I still haven&#x27;t sweat a drop.</li>
            <li> It was a very frustrating abv embarrassing problem.</li>
            <li> Had crazy weird peri-menopause sweating issues (what the heck) and my dr. recommended this.</li>
            <li> The product uses a water base solution for application where as Drysol uses an alcohol base solution (will dry and absorb quicker).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had been so used to being miserable and dripping that I found that even when this product had stopped my sweating, I felt phantom sweat dripping down my sides that wasn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> Any of you crazy sweaters out there.</li>
            <li> I used to sweat like crazy under my arms for no reason at all.  </li>
            <li> Whatever the reason, I went through shirts like crazy as they were destroyed by the combination of sweat and antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> so you never get your clothing dirty.</li>
            <li> It will itch and burn like crazy if you put it on after you shave your armpits</li>
            <li> people would notice and I felt awkward.</li>
            <li> but i take my showers in the am and dont like the idea of putting antiperspirant on dirty armpits at night.</li>
            <li> , my underarms started to itch like crazy</li>
            <li> I could be freezing cold, but my underarms would sweat like</li>
            <li> given my history of disappointing encounters, I was not taking any chances.</li>
            <li> Must buy if you have excessive sweat! !!!</li>
            <li> It will sting like mad.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t go without it for two weeks like me, because then it gets scary!</li>
            <li> So sad!</li>
            <li> I wore with a nasty stain and the armpit area would get hard as hell</li>
            <li> That was a bit unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I still feel bad for my yoga classmates who had to deal with that.</li>
            <li> I have a bad problem of hyperhydrosis.  </li>
            <li> condition seemed to develop over the years for me as it was never quite as bad.</li>
            <li> I used this bad boy all through this summer, even on the HOTTEST of days, not a drop of sweat.</li>
            <li> it gets so bad.</li>
            <li> It burns so bad after I put it on that I have to wash it off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> and sometimes my under arms will itch so badly</li>
            <li> Bad news:</li>
            <li> But I was desperate!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been thoroughly disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> Now it makes my armpits itch like crazy!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still too itchy :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is angered by water.</li>
            <li> I am stupid - today is Christmas</li>
            <li> I tried the Degree Clinical Strength and that crap is a joke.</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> me just start by saying this product is BLOODY MINDBLOWINGLY</li>
            <li> My underarm was like the bloody sahara desert.</li>
            <li> My underarm was like the bloody sahara desert.</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical but trust me it works!</li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t hear about this product sooner!</li>
            <li> I hated getting pit stains at work.</li>
            <li> But gave my son a horrible rash.  </li>
            <li> Wearing suits was the worst because I would just pit them within an hour.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very annoying.  </li>
            <li> this may stop the sweating but the side effects are too horrible.</li>
            <li> I was a terrible head sweater (I belonged to head sweaters anonymous).</li>
            <li> How do you make it through the night with the insane itching???</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Any of you crazy sweaters out there. This works great. I havent met anyone this doesnt work for. Prescription deodorant and the stick version of this does not work as well. The only issue is that when some people apply this for the first few weeks it tends to burn or sting. Sounds bad but if you stay the course your body gets used to it and you wont have the issue any more.</li>
            <li> I have been using the solid and I love it.  The liquid makes me itch.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous.  It stops perspiration.  However it can itch and burn if you put it directly on. Put it on your hand and then rub it on your underarm. Do this and you will never have burning or itching no matter how much you use it. This discovery was thanks to my husband who forgot to bring his deodorant on vacation.  I also rub it on my underarm and then follow it with regular deodorant because I like the smell.  My underarms have never perspired since using this product. I also haven&#x27;t had itching or burning since following the above routine and I do it everyday. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I started using this a few years ago and it did not seem to work, then again I did not take it upon myself to follow the instructions, and used it only every few days. Nowadays, I use this every time I go to bed, no matter what, and since 3 months of use I can honestly say that it has changed my life. I no longer have a monochromatic wardrobe, I can use color shirts and will not stain them, there is absolutely NOTHING that gives more confidence for someone who suffered from hyperhidrosys than being able to lift your arms without any sign of sweat. I live in a tropical climate and even after a full day of work/travel I do not wet my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A heartfelt thank you from my part to the people of Certain Dri, honestly, you made my life so much better.</li>
            <li> But gave my son a horrible rash.  Package says for sensitive skin try the stick.  Wish it would have mentioned that in the description before I bought it.  Going to try the stick.</li>
            <li> This is a must! 2-3 strokes under each arm at night does the job. Have not had any irritation problems as mentioned by some. Felt the immediate difference on the first day I tried it out. Use it together with Mitchum for best results. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a decade now and will never use anything else. No longer do I have to worry about pit stains nor smell. It has been so freeing! I recommend it to my students who struggle with smell/wetness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  The only &amp;#34;sweatproof&amp;#34; deorderant around that really works consistently well (the solid is also very good!)</li>
            <li> My adderall prescription made me very likely to sweat a great deal.  Couple this with a work dress code that requires suit dresses and pantsuits or formal blouses and it was a nightmare combination.  I either had to run around in my camisole with the blazer off (very unprofessional looking) or try to hide the growing pit stains by lunch (gross....and unprofessional looking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has stopped that.  I apply it before bed 3x a week in summer and 1x a week in winter.  I no longer need any kind of daytime antiperspirant or deodorant</li>
            <li> love this product, been using it for years and years now when nothing else has ever worked (prescriptions, clinical strengths, etc etc). every time i stop and try using something else i sweat like crazy and go back immediately. love the 3 pack so you can stock up for a long time and not worry about it. love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Certain Dri for over a year now. I&#x27;ve used dozens of other \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; deo, and only CD has been able to mitigate the sweaty pits. Believe me, my pits sweat like a mofo. Use it once or twice per week during the night.</li>
            <li> Item Works as Advertised(keeps my Dri like no other) but since the Certain Dri Roll-On Anti-Perspirant 1.2 Fl Ozs it is a liquid based product it leaked in shipment and soaked there boxes. But I contacted amazon support and they are sending out a replacement at no Charge. Will post how the new one arrives. Otherwise great experience with amazon like usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - Amazon sent a replacement overnight and the new boxes did not leak. Product works amazing, hope everyone having doubts on this product will try it out.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly. My armpits used to be very sweaty and I have tried almost every product out there. Old Spice clinical strength, Gillette clinical strength, Mitchum, Sure. I have come to realized that Certain dri is a treatment. You have to use it before bed, not before you take a shower at night because then it gets very itchy. Make sure your armpits are completely dry when applying it. After that you wake up in the morning, take a shower and use your regular deodorant. I have been using it for 5 days now, and the sweat on my armpits has completely disappeared. There is an itchiness right after you put it on at night, it could be a little bit uncomfortable, but it is not something that bothers you all day. It is a product I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I had tried every brand of anti-perspirant out there and nothing worked for me. Yet this had been on the shelf right in front of me for years. I always used solids so I guess I never considered Certain Dri because it was a roll on. So after years of wasting money on products that were ineffective and suffering with uncomfortable underarm wetness I did my research and gave this a try. I was amazed to see it had only 3 ingredients. Most others have like 15 ingredients. It is a strong product and does make me itch and burn for a while after I apply it but is worth it to not feel embarrassed all the time by perspiration stains. It is important to take the time to read the instructions that come in the box just once and \\&quot;use as directed\\&quot;, if you do this it will lead to satisfactory results.&lt;br /&gt;****Update****&lt;br /&gt;I must say that this product is still working great for me and after I used it for a couple of months the itching and burning went away and after that its been a miracle cure for me. No Fragrance is a plus.</li>
            <li> I had been using one of the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; deodorants for a while which worked well but did leave marks on clothes at times. Then I decided to try a few all natural deodorants which was a terrible experiment...I still feel bad for my yoga classmates who had to deal with that. Then I decided to make a compromise and give certain dri a try because while it does have aluminum in it, it doesn&#x27;t have fragrance or preservatives which is what I guess allowed it to get a low toxicity rating from ewg.org. Anyhow, I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and it only took a day or 2 to get back to my normal smelling self, plus this stuff is completely clear liquid so I havent had any problems with it coming off on my clothes. The price on amazon is great too...I think I paid around $9 for mine at the store.</li>
            <li> I sweat. A lot. It can be the dead of winter, in a tank top and I&#x27;ll still sweat. This stuff works amazing! No more embarrassing pit stains, and I can finally wear long sleeved shirts!</li>
            <li> As a person that has tried &amp;#34;the strongest of the strong&amp;#34;  antiperspirants from all the major players, with poor results at best, I had resigned myself to a life of sweaty, stinky pits that became annoying to me within a few hours of my morning shower.  After discovering certain dri a few years ago, I have never purchased any other product for keeping my pits dri!  No more ruined shirts caused by pit stains (the stuff in antiperspirants that stain clothes yellow/brown).  I just put this on every couple of days and I&#x27;m bone dry all week. I love this stuff.  Combine this with Old Spice original scent deodorant and the women will come flocking to you in droves.  Word of advice, however, don&#x27;t ever let it near your lady&#x27;s lady-bits; Certain-Dri takes no prisoners in the war on wetness...</li>
            <li> I use it all the time.  Some people complain of stinging arm pits, and mine felt a slight sting when i first used it.  But let&#x27;s be honest, if you&#x27;re buying this product, you probably prefer a little stinging to sweating profusely through your sweater on a winter day, I might be exxagerating here :), not to mention the heat of summer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product that is both inexpensive and works well, this is it. It does exactly what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sort of a longer term solution. If you put it on at night it&#x27;ll last for up to 72 hours, but for me usually wears off around the second day. Put it on every night, you&#x27;ll never have a problem with sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t scented, so if you&#x27;re looking for scented stuff- you can use something else to put on in the mornings. This strictly only stops the sweating, and it&#x27;s damn good at it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling insane underarm wetness most of my adult life, it&#x27;d gotten to the embarrassing point of regularly using paper towels inside my shirts to give the illusion of staying dry and even then having to change them out several times a day.  I went to Amazon looking for underarm pads and came across this instead.  I ordered the three pack (with such outstanding reviews I figured I had nothing to lose and it was cheaper) and after two weeks of applying it only at bedtime I am completely dry all day!  I am wearing a silk blouse right now with no dark patches under the arms which is something I never could get away with before, even after using all the different varieties of over the counter heavy-duty antiperspirants.  The only downside is the slight stinging  - I shave under my arms every other day and this helps lessen the stinging but after a few days of using the product it was less of a stinging feel and more of a little itchy feel... totally worth it in my opinion!  I&#x27;ve applied it to subtle other places and now when I exercise it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve wet my pants.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I just used this product for the first time last night, and I am so happy with it that I decided to review it right away. For the last few months I had noticed that I had begun to sweat much more than normal to the point that my shirts were becoming drenched in sweat under the armpits after only 15-20 minutes of wearing them. It was embarassing and making me self conscience, so, since I am a third year medical student I decided to look up the treatment for hyperhidrosis, which is the medical term for sweating more than normal. After looking up the treatment I saw that most of the antiperspirants listed were prescription only. This was the only product that I was easily able to find that was not. After using it for one day I can say that I am incredibly satisfied. I did not sweat at all today! This is a drastic improvement that really drastically improved my self confidence throughout the day. I highly recommend this product to anyone on Amazon, and in a year when I graduate and am a medical doctor, I will recommend it to all my patients as well. Don&#x27;t wait. Buy this product now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Ok its been a few months, and I have decided that maybe this isn&#x27;t quite soooo amazing as I made it out to be originally. I still sweat a little bit after using it, but the level is sweating is definitely drastically decreased. When I first starting using it, I wasn&#x27;t sweating at all, but I guess its effectiveness wanes slightly with time. I still highly recommend the product though.</li>
            <li> It is simple, this product works well. I used drysol before, since I can not find it anymore here, I tried certain dri. I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> Preforms 2x the quality of the poor products of both P&amp;G and Colgate. Try it snd you will see the difference.</li>
            <li> Everything you hear about this product is true.  It&#x27;s amazing. I have only had it a week, but I don&#x27;t sweat AT ALL now, and I don&#x27;t have deodorant goo in my shirts anymore.  The only issue is that the roll on tends to pull on armpit hairs, but this is a small price to pay for having NO odor and NO sweat.  It might be hard to get used to if your skin is sensitive, but the minor itchiness was no big deal for me.  After using this I can honestly say that no other antiperspirant/deodorant products should exist, and I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about Certain Dri here on Amazon I was skeptical. I was moments away from seeking a doctor to help me with my embarrassing armpit sweat. I have the issue of sweating when there is no reason to sweat, such as watching TV, sitting in an air conditioned room with no stress. I would not wear light colored shirts because of sweat stains. All of my shirts (including work) was either white or black. Friends and family would comment on the huge sweat stains on my shirts because of my armpits :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Certain Dri. To be clear ... this product works. I followed the directions on how to apply, what time of day, etc. Please understand that you will have to continue to use the product, just not as often as you needed to when you begin to control your armpit sweat. I recommend this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Ever since Middle School, I&#x27;ve had problems with excessive underarm perspiration. It got so embarrassing that I eventually got a prescription antiperspirant.  It burned very badly and barely worked.  I pretty much gave up on it and had lived with the embarrassment for years afterwards.  I finally decided, on a whim, to look for something online (prescription strength, drug store antiperspirants never did the trick).  I read the reviews for this product and decided to give it a try.  I AM BEYOND ECSTATIC that I did! It actually WORKS. I no longer have to worry about staining my clothes or wearing gray tshirts. And if I forget to put it on for a day, it still lasts long enough to get me through. 5 stars, all the way!</li>
            <li> This item really worked as described, and in my case for a little more than 72 hours! I would start making regular orders. I also got \\&quot;SweatBlock Antiperspirant Wipes - [...], and shall compare both products.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with underarm sweating for a while now and was searching for products that would hopefully help. My first try was Secrect clinical protection, however the results weren&#x27;t as well as I hoped expectially for $9 a stick. Certain dri was about $5 a box and worked so much better. In fact I&#x27;m not worried about underarm sweat anymore. I would definally recommend this product to anyone with presperation issues and wants a prescription free treatment that works[[ASIN:B001F0QX1E Certain Dri Roll-On Anti-Perspirant 1.2 Fl  Ozs, (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> I have been using Certain Dri for over 15 years now, and it is easily the one product I could not live without.  I used to sweat like crazy under my arms for no reason at all.  I imagine most of it was just a psychological response to not wanting to sweat.  Whatever the reason, I went through shirts like crazy as they were destroyed by the combination of sweat and antiperspirant.  For years, I wore a hoodie just to try and hide the sweat under my arms.  Quite by accident I discovered Certain Dri.  That night I put it on, and I have not had a wet shirt at my underarm area since.  That first week the product did irritate me a little, but after that the irritation stopped, ant the dry underarms just kept going.  For a person who used to have a constant wet spot under their arms, this product is a miracle.  Now instead of buying new shirts about every month, I have never had to throw out a shirt from underarm stain damage.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to not sweating, I no longer have to worry about anti-perspirant stains on my clothes or about cheap anti-perspirant fragrance smells either. You put this product on at night, and then in the morning, I take a shower, and I am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I have come out of the gym with a reverse sweat stain.  That is when every part of your shirt is soaked with sweat except your underarms.</li>
            <li> I seriously thought this wouldn&#x27;t work. Nothing else did. I must say that I am extremely pleased about how this product works. The pros: (1)It eliminates or drastically reduces sweating. (2)Applied at bedtime so you never get your clothing dirty. (3)Doesn&#x27;t stain clothing. (4)Low cost in relation to its efficacy: about $4 to $7. (5)Lasts a while (at least 3 months). (6)Does not have to be applied every night. (7)Does not need to be re-applied after showering/swimming.</li>
            <li> I am an axillary hyperhidrosis sufferer (some excessive sweating of the pits) and in a quest for some relief tried almost all types of anti-perspirant available. I tried Certain Dri, but found just 1-2 strokes wasn&#x27;t effective enough for me. If I used 8 or so to cover my whole pit, it was more effective, but the itching was too severe then to make it usable (basically couldn&#x27;t fall asleep cause my pits itched too much). So I gave up on Certain Dri and tried other approaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With still no relief on other approaches, I came back to Certain Dri, but in combination with the [[ASIN:B002BMB1MG Certain Dri Anti-Perspirant, Solid, 1.7 oz.]]. Before bed, I use 2-4 strokes of the Certain Dri roll-on, then leave it for just a bit to dry, and then use 4-6 swipes of the Certain Dri solid anti-perspirant. With only 2-4 strokes of the roll-on it&#x27;s not as itchy, and even if it is a bit, I find the Certain Dri solid provides a bit of relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My armpits are FINALLY dry (85-90% reduced or more) after having tried at least 10 other anti-perspirant options (including prescription ones) with no success. This approach paired up with a Thompson Tee (new company that makes t-shirts with sew-in sweat guards under the armpits that are WAY more comfortable than any other sweat guards I have used (tried a bunch) - gotta search it on Google) for those more intense circumstances where my hyperhidrosis may act up, has been a bullet proof solution for me. Hope others find some success with this too.</li>
            <li> I was tired of getting yellow stains on the underarms of my white shirts and the constant sweating and smell. As a person who is relatively active and hardly sits still- stinking underarms were a no-go in my book. By chance I happened upon this product online, and now I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product and found the solution to my icky problem. I followed the directions for 2 weeks until, finally I stopped sweating. Now, even if I sweat a tiny bit in the 100 degree heat- it doesn&#x27;t smell at all. I use three or less swipes under each arm before bed and I&#x27;m good to go. I also wear anti-persperant just in case. This product is well worth the money- and I plan to use it forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t have to be embarrassed about my excessive sweating. Ever since I hit puberty I would sweat just from standing in the sun or walking briskly. do yourself a favor and try this product.</li>
            <li> For those of you thinking you can use this for hyperhidrosis, think again. It is largely ineffective for such a problem. Drysol continues to be the only home remedy that is effective enough to control the problem in most individuals suffering from this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the best characterization of this product is that it is a heavy duty type of antiperspirant for normal people that will work for those who do not suffer the type of excessive sweating that those who have hyperhidrosis do, but who sweat more than normal</li>
            <li> I tried this for 6 days hoping it would start working for me like it does for so many other people. It didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all except make my armpits itchy for a few hours after applying it. It stinks that I wasted almost $20! Sweat Block works for me, but it&#x27;s really expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, I know this works for many people but I recommend finding it locally and just purchasing one bottle for about $5 just to make sure it works first!</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every over-the-counter antiperspirant there is in order to stop my almost-constant sweating.  This is the only one I can find that works. Certain Dri claims to stop perspiration for 72 hours ... but I find that it starts losing the fight after more like 50 or so, so I re-apply every other night. Your mileage may vary as everyone&#x27;s genetic situation is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, as other reviewers have mentioned, there&#x27;s some discomfort after application. There&#x27;s a pretty strong burn/itch for 15-20 minutes after I apply the stuff. However, in my opinion, this is a minor annoyance and a small price to pay to not have to throw out pit-stained t-shirts after only having worn them once or twice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years now and I will never go back to anything else. I use this once every two days and it keeps me smelling good.  The clothing under my armpits used to get wet and stained and now I don&#x27;t sweat under my arms when using this. I no longer have to worry about going into stressful situations or working out. All my clothes are looking great and it is because of this deodorant. It does cost more than other deodorants but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly and WORKS-IF you have sensitive skin this is NOT for you-but if you can take the rash it is worth it as I&#x27;ve been out to social events I avoided in the past . no terminal FLOP sweats anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can only use this every 3 days.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry!  I have a bad problem of hyperhydrosis.  my underarms are always wet.  Certain Dri is the only product that has kept my underarms dry!</li>
            <li> Use every other day, works better than any other product out there.</li>
            <li> I have hyper-hydrosis and this changed my life. I have been using it for about 4 years and armpit sweat is no worries for me anymore. I used to have to bring an extra shirt around some days, that&#x27;s how bad it was. It will itch and burn like crazy if you put it on after you shave your armpits so be aware and plan ahead. After using it for awhile you can decrease the use of it, now I apply it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have 2 teenage sons who have had wet under-arms for years. They asked if I could find something to help them so I went on-line, looking at another product, and found Certain Dri. I read the hundreds of positive reviews (for the single bottle) and figured, for $4 or $5 each...what the heck. I ended up ordering the 3 pack and gave it to the boys. Obviously at first they figured...ahhh dad found this...probably doesn&#x27;t work. But they also figured, heh it was worth a try. They did and THEY LOVE IT !!!!&lt;br /&gt;It not only immediately stopped their underarm wetness, but like it promised, they only have to us it once every 3 or 4 days!!&lt;br /&gt;They can wear regular clothes now and don&#x27;t have to worry at all.&lt;br /&gt;If you have perspiration problems, TRY this. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Works well when I remember to use it at night, which is only 50% of the time. Also, the product stings my underarms a little. So minus 1/2 for the stinging and minus 1/2 for the general inconvenience of application, but otherwise a good product and I wil certainly purchase again. My underarm sweat has decreased incredibly since using this product,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using this product for years now.  Before I started, I would sweat profusely with the just the smallest bit of heat.  Now I hardly sweat at all.  I still use my regular deodorant (Degree), but that&#x27;s only because the Certain Dri has no scent and I like the smell of sheer powder.</li>
            <li> Great roll-on.  Keep it coming please!</li>
            <li> i use it every 3 days, never after shower and on the other days I don&#x27;t have to use any other antiperspirant. the only problem is that the liquid is so thin that sometimes, after a trip, for example, more liquid than needed pours out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have lately been getting some crazy sweat action when I get anxious or nervous. I just started my clinical rotations for my doctorate and literally, every second is anxiety provoking, and thus, bad news. I tried the Degree Clinical Strength and that crap is a joke. Did nothing. Literally, nothing. I was about to go to a dermatologist when I got a suggestion from a friend to try this stuff out. Well, it looked like it was from the 80&#x27;s and kind of hokey, but why not. AMAZING. Kind of creepy that it stops sweat in one day. Nothing. Bone dry. Overall, this can really help people out and thats awesome. Good things.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if its really working.</li>
            <li> I bough this product and i love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is really the best way to kill sweat.&lt;br /&gt;5****</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband suffered all his life from excessive perspiration. This is the only product which ever worked. I&#x27;d urge anyone with this problem to give this product a try. We were amazed at the results after only one day of wearing it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Better than just normal deodorant in that it is odorless and my wife hates deodorant that has a scent.</li>
            <li> Is this magic?  Works when nothing ever has. I&#x27;m more than satisfied, I&#x27;m amazed. Needs a 6th star.</li>
            <li> This works amazing! I sweat a lot but now I dont!!! Its crazy amazing how it works!!! Buy it and you would be happy! I would recommend the soiled stuff.. This stuff is wet a drips but its works!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 6 months ago and I must say I LOVE it! It keeps me so dry. Before all I could wear was black shirts because I was embarrassed too wear anything else. It does burn at first but it is totally worth it! I apply it before I go to bed, usually about 20 minutes before, because it WILL stain your clothes. I am almost done with my first bottle and I am going to order the 3-Pack next. If you are tired of sweating like I was. This is a MUST HAVE! I would recommend this product to anyone. It does not have a scent so I tried the Certain-Dri AM, I quit using it though because I did not like the smell of it and you had I never had time to wait for it to dry. Now I just use a regular deodorant and I stay dry ALL day.</li>
            <li> I suffered for years with excessive sweating. My shirts never lasted long as I had to throw them away because of the stains (and smell) and I certainly would never put them in the dryer after washing, because the sweat stains would have \\&quot;set in\\&quot;.  I tried all the non-prescription \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; anti-perspirants on the market and nothing worked. Then one day on the bottom shelf I saw Certain Dri and thought what the heck it is cheaper than what I had in my basket. Boy was I glad I did. I use the roll-on (works better for me than the solid) every night (washing with soap and water under my arms and then drying), I then can shave in the morning without the \\&quot;sting\\&quot;. In the mornings I wear just a plain old anti-perspirant/deordant more for psychological reasons or habit. For the product to work effectively it needs to be put on at night as instructed.</li>
            <li> After trying every leading brand and choosing all of the ones that say \\&quot;guaranteed dry all day\\&quot; blah blah blah, only to be visibly sweating within the first half-hour, I decided to try this one.  I was a little concerned because I have had skin sensitivity to some products in the past.  The first night I used it my armpits burned a little but it was very manageable.  The next morning I was in a high stress situation, went to the restroom and checked for damage.  I was sweating but NOTHING like the usual.  I was already impressed.  Over the next few weeks it actually seemed like the product was working better and better.  My skin has had some minor irritation off and on so I try to only use it when I know I have a stressful day coming which has always led me to sweat a lot.  This product would be worth the cost even if it was 10 times more expensive.</li>
            <li> There are two things you need to know about Certain Dri. First, it is a miracle product - it really does work as advertised. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for several months, and it has drastically reduced the amount I sweat. For as long as I could remember, I always made clothing choices with armpit sweat in mind - dark colors, extra layers, etc. And I would almost always keep my arms pinned to my sides so that nobody would see the shame lying underneath. Now, I have the freedom to not think about those things, and the confidence to know that my underarms will be totally (or almost totally) dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing you need to know is that this stuff has roughly the consistency of battery acid. I have sensitive skin, and a few minutes after applying, I started to notice sharp stinging and intense itching. The first week or two that I used this stuff, I found myself waking up in the middle of the night scratching my underarms raw. No good. Luckily, I found a solution. About ten minutes after applying (right about when the itching starts to kick in), I apply a generous glob of lotion to each pit. This makes the itching go away completely so that I can sleep soundly and awake with dry (and well moisturized) pits. Also, I only apply this stuff every other night - I&#x27;ve found that that gives me more than enough anti-perspirant to last two days. Sometimes I&#x27;ll even stretch it a third day, although I can tell that it&#x27;s wearing off by then (although even on the last day, sweating is still greatly reduced from the level it was before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, you understand how life-changing something as simple as an effective anti-perspirant can be - and how impossible to find that is. Well, search no more - if used properly, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I have been using Certain Dry for many years with reliably excellent results.  The only problem that I encounter is that is takes a long time to dry - if I want the job done right, I take the extra couple of minutes to dry it with a hairdryer - first warm and then cool.  It is recommended that the product be applied at bedtime when perspiration glands are less active.  I readin a women&#x27;s magazine that it can be applied to palms when shaking a lot of hands - as at a wedding reception, or if one gets sweaty palms. It actually does work.  When I use Certain Dry and it is very hot, my face perspires more.  The waiting to dry issue is the only problem that I have had, so I usually keep a can antiperspirant spray on in the bathroom, too. This price is good. It usually costs close to $7 a bottle. My experience is that each little 1.2 fl Oz. bottle lasts quite a while.  The invoice did say that i had spent $42, which upset me - I contacted them and was reassured that they had only billed me the listed price.  That was a bit unpleasant. Overall, a good deal on an excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  At first I was apprehensive to buying it because I didn&#x27;t think it will work.  But it totally does!  You do have to buy some deodorant because it doesn&#x27;t block odor.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  No longer do I pit-out my shirts (and eventually ruin them.)  Use as directed - works wonders.</li>
            <li> First off, what you&#x27;re wanting to know, does it work? Heck yes it does. That should be reason enough for you try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always battled underarm sweat. I&#x27;ve tried tons of deodorants, women&#x27;s, men&#x27;s, extra strength, and I&#x27;ve always sweated through them. Leaving the house I would already have spots of wetness coming through, and by the afternoon even with my arms down you could see the big wet patch under each arm. This is extra embarrassing in a work environment and as a female. I couldn&#x27;t wear dark shirts because then it was extra noticable and I couldn&#x27;t wear white because the sweat and deodorant mix would stain the underarms yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I happened across this from all the good reviews. I took a shower and made sure all the deodorant remnants were gone and didn&#x27;t shave. I applied this before I went to bed as it advises. I think one of the only cons to this is how messy it is. There&#x27;s a roller ball on top and underneath is the liquid, which is very water-like. Like someone else said it&#x27;s a little like trying to pour a cup of water under your armpits. Some drops did leak down my sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I did have a period of itching and burning (not severe) that went away as it dried. The more you use it the less it burns. I woke up in the morning and took a shower and didn&#x27;t wash my armpits to make sure it stayed on. I applied a little more that morning and after it dried I put a light coating of deodorant on over it. That first day I did have some sweat show through but much less than before! I was amazed that it worked so well so quickly. I used it again and the next day SWEAT FREE not a drop of sweat to be found, my armpits were as dry as the desert! And it&#x27;s crazy because I felt hot and like I should be sweating, I kept expecting to sweat, but I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought several more bottles since then and will keep buying it in the future. It&#x27;s a true miracle in how fast it works, you get obvious results right away which is great. Some people on here say if you use it enough you close the glands for good, I&#x27;m not sure about that. Might be possible with how strong it is. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the sweat tends to transfer; since it can&#x27;t come out of your armpits your body compensates it someplace else. For me that&#x27;s my neck, which is not a bad at all, just a slight dampness. I still use deodorant just for the good smell, but am fine going without, still don&#x27;t sweat. On the days I shave, I shave a few hours before I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so great not to be embarrassed about sweating so much. Please, please try this. I think it might be the only thing that truly works. Stockpile it too, before someone realizes that it works TOO good and raises the price to the hundreds of dollars, because that&#x27;s what its really worth.Some people on here say if you use it enough you close the glands for good, I&#x27;m not sure about that.

            <li> Bought this while I had anxiety problems. I had super sweaty hands and it was embarrassing. Every time I would shake hands people would notice and I felt awkward. I couldn&#x27;t control my anxiety which caused my sweaty hands. I didn&#x27;t know if my sweaty hands caused my anxiety or the other way around. Anyways, I applied this product to my hands at night and it took like two nights of applying this thing before I saw the effects. After a couple of days my hands were dry, but at least they weren&#x27;t sweaty. They became dry and I just applied a bit of lotion to help. It has no smell and it feel the same as when you use bleach. When I used bleach to wash the dishes it would leave my hands dry. This is exactly how this product makes your hands feel. It works great so anyone with sweaty hands I would recommend this product to you. This really helped me, having sweaty free hands made me feel better and over time it stopped. I am anxiety free now but I think this product helped a lot in controlling the symptoms.</li>
            <li> I first tried the Sweat Block product that is currently the leading antiperspirant product in the market but it didn&#x27;t work for me after  using it a couple of nights. Disapointment didnt stop me from trying a different product so I bought this one and now I&#x27;m extremely happy, since the first application my arm pits aren&#x27;t sweaty anymore I just cannot believe that I&#x27;ve solved my lifelong problem. I bought the three pack and this will last me a while. The only problem is having to apply it every night, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the joy of stopping unwanted sweat. A million stars.</li>
            <li> This product does control sweating better than most over the counter anti-perspirants, but after using a couple days, it burned when applying. Don&#x27;t recommend unless you like pain.</li>
            <li> For most of my life anti-perspirant did the opposite for me - it actually made my armpits sweat profusely. So I&#x27;d always have wet spots on my shirt, which was embarassing. A few years ago I came across Certain Dri. Problem solved! Certain Dri is the only thing that works for me, and I sweat a lot. Initially you&#x27;ll have to apply it everynight, but after a few nights, you can apply it once every 4 days or so. I know there are other similar products out there but I haven&#x27;t tried them yet. Hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> In amatter of 3 days you will see &amp; feel the difference of using this product.  Important thing is to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> Tried a bunch of other products but they didn&#x27;t work. I use this every other night and it strong most of the wetness</li>
            <li> Best solution for hyperhidrosis. Partially.</li>
            <li> I started using this when I was a summer camp counselor. I have never smelled worse in my life! I was looking for something to help with sweating and odor. This delivered. Also I had to use it everyday during a semester abroad in Mexico and it was a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I suffered for years with underarm stains in my clothes and embarrassing wet spots.  I have been using this product for years, and these problems are a thing of the past.  Just be sure to follow directions, and NEVER use it after you shave.  It will sting like mad.  I use it twice a week  and frequently forget it &amp; it has never let me down.</li>
            <li> I had been having EXTREME underarm sweating for almost a year, and it was legitimately ruining my life. I don&#x27;t know where the sweating came from, and no doctor seemed to have a good explanation. My dermatologist said to try certain dri as a non-prescription option, but warned me that the area needed to be totally dry, or there would be a reaction on my skin making hydrochloric acid, clearly not something I wanted. So after being freaked out by this I tried the solid, which was supposed to be less prone to irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solid did absolutely nothing for me, and it burned my skin, despite what I think was a proper application. After that I switched to the roll-on, and I was immediately impressed with the results. The problem at first was that I didn&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;d applied the roll-on properly, since it comes in this weird ball-roller thing which I&#x27;m not used to. My first application was probably double recommended strength, and as such it burned a fair bit and kept me up for an hour or two before it calmed down. I had red welts under my arms from this, and minor irritation the next day, but to my absolute delight I was not sweating even a single drop. Over time I&#x27;ve learned the proper doseage and have discovered that for me, an application every other night keeps me almost entirely dry, with the exception of very heavy labor where I still get some sweat, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I&#x27;ve also found a good dose amount that nearly never burns or irritates, and even if it does it only lasts a few minutes for me now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been so used to being miserable and dripping that I found that even when this product had stopped my sweating, I felt phantom sweat dripping down my sides that wasn&#x27;t there. To my delight that stopped after a couple weeks of use and I can honestly say that my life has returned to normal, and this product has honestly gone a long way towards improving my daily happiness.</li>
            <li> They are much better than any antipersperant roll-on that I&#x27;ve used before. They still contain aluminum but because you use it at nights, your clothes won&#x27;t stain during the day.</li>
            <li> First application didn&#x27;t really work, after the second it was like I just stopped sweating.  I use it every three days and still use my regular deodorant daily (not sure you really even need to do this).  This stuff appears that it will last forever.  I worked out the day after the second application in a gray shirt.  The entire shirt was dark gray with sweat, except for under my arms, it was comical to the point I was showing strangers in the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I bought this under my wife&#x27;s account so this wont&#x27; be showing \\&quot;verified purchase\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t experience any of the \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; some reviewers mention.  Buy this, you&#x27;ll be amazed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started using Certain Dri a few weeks ago and it works great. It has worked especially well these past few 90+ degree days. I commute via walking and public transit, so this has become a must.</li>
            <li> Great product. Stops sweating completely for 2 or 3 days. If you want to add a scent, just use store bought &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; afterwards.</li>
            <li> Have a perspiration problem? Shirts always wet under the arms? Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;Tried Certain Dri years ago. Could not beleive the results. Threw away all those stained and crusty under the arm shirts.&lt;br /&gt;Use as directed. You will be a believer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews - but this stuff is absolutely amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from sweating through a t-shirt, dress shirt, and a sweater (layered!) - to complete and total dryness ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT SWEAT FROM MY UNDERARMS ANYMORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So awesome - words can not describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop reading reviews - and buy this right now. Pay for the one-day shipping so you can experience the life changing effects of this products. Wow - just wow.</li>
            <li> Amazing anti-perspirant. The first day I got the product, I put it to the test. 2 hours of Taekwondo practice. Holy smokes! I had degree, mitchum and dove. Degree didn&#x27;t work at all. Mitchum stains all my clothes. Dove didn&#x27;t even work for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;Certain Dri didn&#x27;t even give one bit of dampness on my t-shirt. For me. the first 10-20 minutes, my armpits get a little stinging but it goes away. Love the product. Only lasts for me for 24 hrs. But I LOVE this anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few days ago, and I have been awe struck! For several years I have avoided wearing anything gray or colorful because the sweat was so visible. I follow the instructions to use it at night, and I use some normal deodorant in the morning. It stings and itches a little bit for about ten minutes, but it&#x27;s worth that. I put it to the ultimate test today, it was 90 degrees out today with almost 40% humidity- I wore a gray shirt. Not a single spot! I&#x27;m in love. The price isn&#x27;t too bad either, especially compared to the other stuff that claims to be clinical strength.</li>
            <li> After going through all of the anti-perspirant deodorants in the grocey store, I finally found Certain Dri on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear long sleeve dress shirts at work, and I would constantly sweat through them, this is the only deodorant that has worked for me, don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some other people say it burns, when I first put it on I get a little bit of a burning tingle, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t forget to put it on at night, at first I thought this was for people who sweat at night, but you have to do this no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased, 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and it will actually change your life. I&#x27;ve been using Certain-Dri for several years, only bought ~10 bottles, and don&#x27;t wear undershirts unless I want to. I feel like a woman in one of those cheesy Depends commercials. Living without fear of wet armpits is incredibly freeing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I started to sweat so profusely in my armpits, but it was a real problem and it caused me distress. Doctors couldn&#x27;t tell me why this was happening. I Googled hyperhidrosis treatments and voila! Up popped suggestions for Certain Dri. That was 7 years ago and I haven&#x27;t stopped using it. It stung a little when I applied it for the very first time, but after the first week or so it went away. I now have no discomfort at all. Follow the instructions and your life will change. Use at night before you go to bed, and in the morning after you shower you put on your regular deodorant. I now use CD just a couple of times a week, and I don&#x27;t sweat through my clothes. You&#x27;ll figure out what frequency of use works for you. One bottle of the roll-on lasts me one YEAR. Yup, a year. I&#x27;d have spent that much each month for the peace of mind that I get. If you&#x27;re having an underarm sweating problem, get Certain Dri. I know I sound like an ad for this product, but that&#x27;s just how good it&#x27;s been for me. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This is the best deoderant and anti-perspirant I have found. It claims to last for 72 hours and I believe it!  I love this product and highly recommend it for people who perspire a lot.</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper to use then drysol. I like using then our on my face and neck when I wear suits. When I wear suits my neck and face sweats a lot. It doesn&#x27;t work very well on my hands but I got really sweaty hands. Even extra strength drysol do not work too well on my hands.</li>
            <li> Not going to repeat all the other positive reviews. This product works and works great. No need to spell that out any further.  My intention is to warn people to MAKE SURE this stuff dries BEFORE you put your shirt on. If you dont you will ruin your shirt. This product permantly stained two $85-$100 dress shirts because i was in too much of a hurry to let it dry on my arms first. It bleached the color right out of them leaving big white tie-die looking splotches on the armpits of the shirts. Not so good. Of course if you put this on at night &amp; go to bed without a shirt on you&#x27;ll be ok but i take my showers in the am and dont like the idea of putting antiperspirant on dirty armpits at night. Anyway heed my warning. This stuff stains. Be careful when using it with any non-white shirt.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this and Im still trying to figure it out. I have always used Driclor and it works perfect. However, I had to change this time because I couldnt wait for it to be shipped from the UK. I had it shipped to a friend in the US because I live outside the US. When i received it and tried to apply it, it just leaked out like water! It doesnt stick to the armpits at all! and of course does not work! Im trying to understand if this is how it should be or if i received a defective product or if it got tampered with or damaged in transit. Because for sure i think it&#x27;s just water!</li>
            <li> i bought after reading reviews, and thought it would work for me.. but it didnt. i followed instructions to the T but i broke a sweat next morning within an hour of waking up.. i have two unused bottles (since i ordered the pack of 3) if anyone needs please contact me. useless product though.</li>
            <li> I believe in writing reviews if a product is exceptionally good or exceptionally bad -in this case this is an exceptionally good product which does what it says for the price! As others trying this have written, I&#x27;ve used other products including clinical strength antiperspirants (esp. Secret) with not much luck. To give an understanding of my problem: On cool days, I don&#x27;t sweat that much (or even in cool environments), but once it&#x27;s hot, or I get nervous even if the AC is on (think a job interview or even a date or even having a difficult conversation or a hard work-out at the gym), my armpits (even my tummy and areas that shall remain unmentioned) start to sweat. SO EMBARASSING!&lt;br /&gt;This condition seemed to develop over the years for me as it was never quite as bad. It got to the point that I had to avoid wearing certain types of colors or even tops (think nice tight tank tops with sleeves) or leggings on certain days to avoid embarrassment. Well I bought this as a last resort with not much hope and VOILA, I&#x27;ve put it to the test in 91 degree heat, with light colored clothing (even a top tight under the armpits) and in a meeting that had me super nervous - and having followed instructions, my pits (and other areas), remained dry (give or take a bit of sweat)...C&#x27;mon, if you&#x27;re really hot no matter what you will sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to be clear - you need to follow the instructions (depending on your condition though you might need more swipes initially than the bottle says). Use at night and you can follow-up in the morning with your regular antiperspirants (Secret works for me). Apply wherever your embarrassing sweat glands are (and I do mean WHEREVER). To start off you might need to apply 3 nights or more in a row before it really kicks in - so don&#x27;t be discouraged if you&#x27;ve only used it just 1 or 2 nights and you still sweat. Once it kicks in, you can cut down usage to maybe every other night or even less.&lt;br /&gt;Next, from a biological standpoint, if you cut sweat off somewhere, it&#x27;s gonna pop up elsewhere on your body, so don&#x27;t be alarmed if you start to sweat more from say your neck or wider body surface area. I&#x27;d rather that though than sweaty armpits. At any rate sweat is meant to keep you cool and rid your body of a few toxins so it wouldn&#x27;t be rational or healthy to expect ZERO sweat from your body especially if its hot out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then, if it works for a gal like me with typical/moderate hyperhidrosis, I&#x27;m sure unless you have some crazy exceptional sweating, it will work for you...if not guess you&#x27;d need Botox injections which I can&#x27;t afford or maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and good luck!!weat off somewhere, it&#x27;s gonna pop up elsewhere on your body, so don&#x27;t be alarmed if you start to sweat more from say your neck or wider body surface area.

            <li> I was skeptical but decided to try this because I ran out of my prescription roll on.  This works better than the prescription ever did and causes less irritation!  Put on at night, every few days it worked wonders - regardless of the fabrics I wear (synthetic or cotton for example). It dries clear and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess.  It works fine whether I shower it off in the morning OR leave it on. In the morning I recommend using Clinique antiperspirant-deodorant or other product with similar % of aluminum chlorohydrate for high level of protection all day.  The Certain Dry did cause a bit of skin irritation if used too frequently, hence my mention to use it every few nights instead of every night. Highly recommend and will buy again for this great price.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely wonderful product at keeping you dry. Prior to this, I&#x27;ve always looked for the perfect anti-perspirant, trying to find that perfect one for me. I&#x27;ve definitely gone through many in an attempt to stay dry. This product flat out works, more than I ever thought possible. Be sure to use it as directed, which is applying it to a dry underarm at night before bed. The first week or two, I used it nearly every day, but as others have mentioned, you begin not needing it as much anymore. Being able to use it every few days makes this even GREATER of a deal! I&#x27;ve gone 3-4 days without applying this at night and have kept dry throughout the day. I used this bad boy all through this summer, even on the HOTTEST of days, not a drop of sweat. If you have issues with staying dry, do yourself a favor and pick this up and follow it as instructed. I hear the roll-on is much more effective than the bar kind of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must warn you, there is a bit of a down side to this product, at least in my case. It definitely burns when applying, but that will probably vary from person-to-person. I felt some burning when I was first using the product, but try to apply it on a dry underarm to lessen it. It&#x27;s nothing too intolerable or anything, but it&#x27;s certainly not comfortable. I&#x27;ll sometimes keep my arms raised when this is on, like in front of a fan or something, to immediately ease the burn. I hope this doesn&#x27;t scare you off :) Even despite the slight discomfort, it&#x27;s still SO worth it. I can deal with the burn when applying it here and there if it means I will be 100% dry all the time. Definitely recommended for max wetness protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to pick up a DEODORANT, in addition to this product. Be sure that it a deodorant only, because this WON&#x27;T protect you against odor, it&#x27;s not supposed to. This product&#x27;s sole purpose is to protect against wetness, which it excels at; however, you will need to combine it with a deodorant of your liking in order to keep a fresh smell in your underarms, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it one less star only due to the burning. Some skin types are more sensitive than others, naturally. Still, it&#x27;s totally worth it and I highly recommend this product!o keep a fresh smell in your underarms, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it one less star only due to the burning. Some skin types are more sensitive than others, naturally. Still, it&#x27;s totally worth it and I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is the roll-on version of the dry stick. I believe that it is more effective. That being said, it is a bit wetter than the stick. I have to be careful not to get my pajamas wet from it. It also make my pits itch (TMI) but the stick form does not. I am not sure what the difference is. Whichever one I grab out of my night stand drawer  is the one I use every other day. This brand is very good for those people who have pit wetting problems (PWP) but their PWP is not severe enough to be medicated. I use the daily a.m. deodorant too. It has a nice fragrance and I feel like I am doing something extra to stay dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year. Works well but it does leave a \\&quot;crust\\&quot; on your shirts. Since I always wear an undershirt No big deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how many doubts you have...Give this product a try if you sweat a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied maybe 10 total swipes around each entire armpit before bed the first night I received the product.&lt;br /&gt;The very next day, I did not sweat a SINGLE DROP (in my armpits).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it burns like heck, but does it matter? I don&#x27;t care if this thing burnt holes into my armpits...not having sweat issues is a dream come true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you work in an office, this product is a must. Nothing is worse than:&lt;br /&gt;1) While giving a presentation, using hand gestures or writing on the whiteboard only to reveal huge puddles of sweat.&lt;br /&gt;2) Losing your favorite work shirts due to sweat stains in the armpit area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you sweat above-average, I promise you, this product will help. If you can&#x27;t take the burning pain (which usually goes away 1 hour after my morning shower and can be ignored), try applying some anti-itch cream.&lt;br /&gt;If you still sweat, try applying more swipes. It may burn more, but it is entirely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a normal antiperspirant deodorant in the morning. Not sure if it matters--it&#x27;s more out of habit and for a little freshness under the pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I found my love for this product sooner in life.&lt;br /&gt;I was considering making a video review for before and after, but I&#x27;m not sure if my armpits are that attractive, sweaty or not sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My symptoms before the product:&lt;br /&gt;1) A small amount of physical exercise (walking) would produce massive puddles.&lt;br /&gt;2) Just sitting at my computer in a well air-conditioned room would cause sweat.&lt;br /&gt;3) Inability to wear normal t-shirts at home (had to wear old shirts) because they would get ruined by sweat no matter the temperature of the environment.&lt;br /&gt;4) Would usually wake up in the morning with a feeling of (cold) sweat in my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;5) Wearing of sweatshirts and jackets in the summer when around ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the product:&lt;br /&gt;1) Not a single drop of sweat in my armpits, yet.&lt;br /&gt;2) Confusion caused by the lack of sweat.&lt;br /&gt;3) Frequent lifting of arms to check armpits due to (2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (09/30/2012)&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;I have finally finished my first roll of this stuff. It lasted about 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;There have been some big changes...&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have to swipe furiously each time I use it, and I don&#x27;t have to use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;During a stressful week, I completely forgot to use it, but I still did not sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is excellent news for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The product will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;2) No more extreme burning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now only use the product 2-3 times a week. I shoot for Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday.&lt;br /&gt;Because I am not piling it on every single night, the irritation has gone down immensely.

            <li> good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)</li>
            <li> Great deodorant. Previously, I had a problem to pick up a dozodorant until I tried Certain. Nanoshu it every morning after a shower and forget the whole day. It works great and is very economical.</li>
            <li> This item does not work for me at all. I purchase this on April 4, 2015 and gave it a chance until now; I figured if it doesn&#x27;t begin to show improvement after two months AT ALL, that the product is not a good one for my needs. Since I gave the item such a long testing period, I am now being told that I cannot return them because I am out of my 30 day return period. So I guess that is my fault, and you learn from your mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in an office and have severe hyperhidrosis in my underarms specifically, so its not from running or being active. I just sweat for no reason, and it drips it gets so bad. After reading the reviews, and I read many of the reviews before deciding to trust the product, I thought that this would definitely help my issue. Putting it on only before bed and only a few times a week sounded a little too good to be true to me, looks like it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am hoping the seller will reply to my request and issue a refund. I have two unopened packages here, and one 1.2oz bottle opened and used for about two months. It says on the bottle, &amp;#34;stops excessive perspiration (hyperhydrosis) for up to 72 hours&amp;#34;. It hasn&#x27;t helped for any hours, let alone AT ALL. I&#x27;m not generally a picky person but when I purchase something that is promised to help in some way, I expect that product to help in some way. I am very displeased with the product here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my comment to grade their customer service, once I hear back from them (if I do not get a reply I will update on that as well)</li>
            <li> Take it from someone who had THEE WORST sweat pits, this stuff is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;It only took 3 days for it to begin fully working and now, i havent had sweat pits since i started using Certain Dri.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because I have been suffering from extreme sweating for the longest time. Unfortunately, the product didn&#x27;t work as well as the reviews suggested. It helped the sweating just like the other antiperspirants (nothing special) but it broke me out on my face! I stopped using it in about 2 weeks, since I didn&#x27;t see a great impact on sweating, and the breakouts went away. Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My armpits sweat a lot and this is not ladylike. I&#x27;ve tried other products and I like the Certain Dri Roll-On the best, hands down. I have found it works the most effectively, lasts the longest, and doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li> I have always had pretty bad pit stains.  I used to buy a lot of black clothes to try and hide them.  All my white shirts end up with yellow armpits after only a few wears.  Wearing suits was the worst because I would just pit them within an hour.  In the summer I always tried to wear sleeveless shirts so there would be less pit to stain!&lt;br /&gt;My doctor gave me a prescription for Drysol several years ago.  I used it and it def. worked, but its a pain to have to get a prescription for deodorant so I stopped using it and just stuck with Lady Mitchum (which was almost completely ineffective as an anti-perspirant).&lt;br /&gt;I found Certain Dri on Amazon about two months ago and it has been fantastic!  It looks like the chemical make up is pretty similar to Drysol but you don&#x27;t need the prescription.  For about the first week I used it I put it on every other day.  The first day or or two I still had a little armpit sweat but after about a week of using it every other day, my pits are nice and dry!  Now I only use it every 4-5 days and wear regular deodorant/anti-perspirant  (Secret) each morning. It will dry your armpits out when you first put it on and they do get a little itchy, but since you put it on at night before bed I usually fall asleep and my armpits are fine in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;It has been so nice to be able to lift my arms up without fear of showing my pit stains!  Once I realized how well it worked I took all of my suits and dresses to the dry cleaner.  Now I can wear a suit or dress more than once without needing to get it drycleaned to get rid of the pit stains.  I&#x27;ve also been buying colorful tops because I no longer have to worry about pit stains.  It&#x27;s been a very liberating experience.  I LOVE this deodorant!  Wish I had found it years ago!!!  If it doesn&#x27;t clear up your pit sweat after the first use, don&#x27;t give up!  Give it at least of week or so of using it every other day before you give up on it!</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, I have always sweated profusely in my under-arms. In my job field, I have a lot of contact with people, and some have on occasion noticed and pointed out the puddles that were forming under my pits. Imagine the awkwardness of having to explain excessive sweating that store-bought antiperspirants did nothing to solve!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying Certain-Dri was sort of a Hail Mary for me. I don&#x27;t typically buy products such as this simply because their claims are often outrageous exaggerations of the truth. But I was desperate! Imagine my surprise when Certain-Dri ACTUALLY DID WHAT IT SAID IT WOULD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product before bed time, as instructed. In the morning, I showered and put on deodorant. The rest of the day my pits stayed DRY -- in the middle of the summer, no less! I put it on again last night, and same thing today, dry armpits. My wife especially appreciates the dryness. Who likes a swamp monster&#x27;s arm wrapped around you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this product. I was skeptical at first, but I can&#x27;t tell you how appreciative I am to have dry pits! This will certainly be a big help at my job interview tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I was recently at a symposium to watch some presentations and noticed many of the nervous speakers had huge sweat stains. I used to sweat like that, no matter how much anti-perspirant I put on. But certain dri really works amazingly well. It virtually shuts down armpit sweat. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and can&#x27;t remember the last time I developed big armpit sweat stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but I also don&#x27;t get deodorant stains anymore. When I used those solid white anti-perspirants, my shirts would become caked with the antiperspirant and it wouldn&#x27;t even come off in the wash. Certain dri is a clear, roll on liquid that dries several minutes after you put it on and has never stained any of my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem expensive, but one bottle will last me months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some minor drawbacks&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I got some burning for a few minutes. But since then, I only notice minor burning when my armpits are already irritated, for example if I just took a shower and scrubbed too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions indicate to put it on at night for a reason. I&#x27;ve tried putting it on in the morning and it is not nearly as effective. This makes it kind of inconvenient, if you forgot to put it on at night you might be out of luck the next day. But you really are covered for a few days with just one application, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you sweat a lot, consider using this. It&#x27;s in another universe of effectiveness, compared to other anti-perspirants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for something like this for years now.  I&#x27;ve tried other clinical strength anti-perspirants which didn&#x27;t seem to do too much.  When I&#x27;m sitting at my desk at work, I pretty much just sweat non-stop sometimes and it&#x27;s very annoying.  However, I recently tried this and it absolutely worked wonders for me.  I applied it just one time the first night like the directions said, and I wasn&#x27;t sweating abnormally for the next 3-4 days!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, and have only had to apply this once every 3-4 days or so.  Definitely a fan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so I was surprised of my reaction to this deodorant. Made my skin itchy and red. I gave it a couple of tries until I gave up. Need to try something else.</li>
            <li> I have excessive sweating, and this product has been used by me since my teen years. This is the only product that works for me. USE AS DIRECTED! you must apply it at night for it to be effective the next day</li>
            <li> This has been a life saver, the best stuff ever!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. All of my expectation with this product is by far the best I&#x27;ve used for my under arm sweating.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep on purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from hyperhidrosis. This is the only antiperspirant that stops the sweating. It just takes a while to get use to putting on before you go to bed. No more yellow stains on white clothes &amp; no white spots on dark clothing. This 3 pack was the cheapest I&#x27;ve have found in a while. It may be a little more expensive per bottle than regular deodorant but it actually lasts longer because you don&#x27;t have to put it on everyday.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best, I sweat profusely and when I started using it the difference was immediately noticeable. Now I don&#x27;t live in fear of having huge pit stains as i walk around town.</li>
            <li> Put it on the night before and my pits weren&#x27;t wet for work. The only thing that is kinda of annoying is the stinging for a little bit.</li>
            <li> work well. the only problem I had after long term used is that, it left my underarm dark, which I don&#x27;t like so I stop using for a while. It does delivered a good job, I just didn&#x27;t like the underarm darkening, but it&#x27;s a good product that works.</li>
            <li> I always thought that I sweat so much because I was nervous. Turns out sweating so much was what was making me nervous. Has really improved my confidence, and generally made my life better (for example: not having to carry around an extra dress shirt for work because the one I put on in the morning had pitted out). I have tried the &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; anti-perspirants, but they were not an improvement over standard anti-perspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say, don&#x27;t be alarmed by the price. I use the product almost every evening, and it has lasted me about 6 months a bottle. I did have some sensativity for the first few weeks, but it soon went away. You can also try the solid version if you are particularly concerned about having overly sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also echo what others have said -- if I miss a day, it still protects me. I tend to use it every night just so I don&#x27;t forget to put it on, but have gone whole weekends without putting any on and it has worked for the whole time. Definately worth a try if other anti-perspirants have not worked well for you.</li>
            <li> I have tried every anti perspirant on the market - either they did not work or burned and caused ugly rashes - including the prescription kind! This product is the first one ever that shows results and works even for my sensitive skin. You apply it in the evening before you go to bed - it is NOT scented and yes it will burn on a freshly shaved underarm ( but it tells you so in the instructions !) . However - if applied like suggested on skin that is not broken or shaved it should not burn ( and this comes from someone with a very sensitive skin and eczema! ). It will prevent excessive perspiring for 1-3 days but make sure you use some kind of moisturizer on your underarms the day after you applied certain dri if you have dry or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Another word for all those with hyperhidrosis: as much as this society would like you to believe that it is a medical &amp;#34; condition&amp;#34; - in reality it would actually present an advantage in warm climates as sweat has the function to cool your body. Only in our &amp;#34; advanced&amp;#34; and &amp;#34; sophisticated&amp;#34; society is it un-acceptable to perspire in public. Many societies all over the globe would not find anything wrong with sweat marks. I think there should be no embarrassment involved with hyperhidrosis- it is a bit like faulting an allergy sufferer for a runny nose or persistent sneezing !</li>
            <li> Four years ago my wife got me some of this stuff because I always &amp;#34;pitted out&amp;#34; my shirts.  2 hours into the day and my shirts are soaked.  Cold, warm, hot, didn&#x27;t matter.  I sweat a lot all the time but just from my armpits.  I was skeptical, but I tried it.  2 weeks later, the problem is gone.  Not just subsided, but gone.  And I know it&#x27;s the Cerain-Dri because if I let up on applying this every day, I go back to pig mode.  Very thankful I found this stuff.</li>
            <li> Top 3 best products I ever bought in my life. This is the only deodorant that works. No smell, no yellow stains on my white shirts.</li>
            <li> This is the best non-prescription roll-on you can buy. Did not irritate my skin and the price is reasonable. Just follow the directions and put it on at night vice in the morning.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years now, I am allergic to aluminum. Seems most of the anti-perspirants on the market today have aluminum. Just make sure you screw the cap in as tight as possible after each use, if not the product will leak out. Must be applied at bedtime for use on the next day.</li>
            <li> The product is too strong and corrosive for my underarms. It burns so bad after I put it on that I have to wash it off. I like the idea, but it ain&#x27;t for everyone. I do not have sensitive skin or allergies, aluminum chloride gives off a lot of acid.</li>
            <li> My pits have turned against me, and gush sweat that form gigantic continents of hatred under my arms on all my shirts.&lt;br /&gt;Like most users, I have tried other clinical products but they did nothing for my nasty pit stains.&lt;br /&gt;After i applied the first night I felt a little itchy, but that Is just the feeling of the sweat goblins dying.&lt;br /&gt;Next morning I was a little damp, but was dry as bone for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Now I can put my arm around the babes who flock to my dry embrace without sliming then with pit juice.&lt;br /&gt;FREEDOM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_______________&lt;br /&gt;EDIT - 1 Week later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stopped working on the second day.&lt;br /&gt;Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;I switched to Drysol, and haven&#x27;t had a drop of pit-nastiness in 4 days after one application.&lt;br /&gt;Try Drysol if this doesnt work for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it is the BEST!!!  it really does put an end to perspiration.  No more embarrassing wet marks!  This products emits NO odor and is applied at night.  It can on occasion burn a bit, but your body will adjust.  I find that if irritation occurs, I only apply every other day.  Give it a week, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> It was second night when I applied this roll-on. I even did not have a chance to notice if it works or no because my underarms are burning red and hurt now. So, I applied some healing cream. First night I decided to try it one more time next night and see. Lol! I am stupid - today is Christmas and I feel like an invalid. It feels like you shaved pits with a super dull knife. I never before noticed that my skin is even a little sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;It is just $12 for 3 packs, so I will not return them and will try to apply the product to my feet. Will let you know.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do, and for a fraction of the cost of many competing brands.</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing!!!! Must buy if you have excessive sweat! !!!</li>
            <li> I have heavy underarm sweating and this product stops it cold.  Use initally for two days in a row and then every other day or every two days. It&#x27;s that good.  Apply at night before bedtime so it soaks in.  Use a deoderant in the morning for smell protection before heading to work etc.</li>
            <li> Wow, it is an anti-perspirant that actually works.  Im actually amazed by how well it preforms and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I use Certain Dri and we love it. It&#x27;s the only thing that has helped us control the sweating. Yes, it does sting somewhat for about a half hour after application, but that little bit of discomfort is worth it to us. Will always re-purchase Certain Dri!</li>
            <li> Product works great.  Don&#x27;t over do it!  If you have sensitive skin,  I&#x27;d recommend slowing down the applications to ever other day or more.</li>
            <li> Only antiperspirant I use. Comes in powder and unscented, solid and roll on. I go unscented roll on at night and I&#x27;m ok for a quick spray of deodorant in the morning and I&#x27;m good all day. With that said this is only an antipersperant. You still need deodorant in over this when it dries. Works so good while I&#x27;m sweating at the gym, the only dry spots are my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: DO NOT USE WITH OLD SPICE PRODUCTS#!!! I occasionally rotate between  dove, old spice, and right guard deodorant products and I want y&#x27;all to know that I during my most recent old spice rotation I got pretty bad chemical burns around my armpit areas. I don&#x27;t know if either company changed ingredients but this is the first time I experienced this whilst using certain dri. Please test small amounts with different brands on different parts of your body to see if there is any reaction with your favorite types of deodorant before full blown use. Just a warning. Be safe and hopefully sweat free.</li>
            <li> works but have to be patient for results. does feel itchy if you use too much.</li>
            <li> I was coming home daily with pit stains so severe I had to hang them up to try before i can put them in the hamper. Pit stains so embarrassing that I would never lift my arms at work. 3 days later, the sweat was so minimal. Not nearly enough to even show a spec through the clothes. been a couple weeks now and it was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made all year.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it works really well. If you have problems with sweating, I would highly recommend trying this. Don&#x27;t put on too much or it can burn a bit, I would recommend using it every couple of days, and not every day.</li>
            <li> Incredible product!  Don&#x27;t even try the name brands that claim to do the same thing.  Go right to the top!</li>
            <li> You have to be careful with how much you apply and letting it dry before doing things, but I put this on every other day on my hands and feet and am a 100% satisfied, repeat customer.</li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ve ordered off of Amazon I&#x27;ve ever written a review for.  Just a great product. I have chronic sweaty pits.  Especially my right one. It&#x27;s so bad I have to make sure when I go out I am wearing light clothing so as not to draw attention to the massive sweat stain.  I use this product at night, seriously, i&#x27;m good for three days.  No sweat. None.  Nothing beats it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend! Finally found something that ended my underarm wetness and constant search of relevant tops and blouses to wear.</li>
            <li> I used to profusely sweat before applying this product. I now put it on every 2-3 days and it works great, drastically reduced underarm sweat!</li>
            <li> Great product.  If you have underarm perspiration problems, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Really works!  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now and have found that if I apply sparingly, then rub in with my fingertips, THEN blot my underarms gently with a slightly damp towel, it doesn&#x27;t burn or itch.  I think that is caused by using too much.  If you rub it in 3 or 4 strokes will do.  It&#x27;s a must have in the summer if you like going sleeveless.</li>
            <li> This product saved my life!  I have been battling nasty, sweaty pits my entire life.  I have tried other products, reapplying deodorant, paper towels on the pits, everything!  I have even had to avoid buying tops in certain fabrics and colors but not any more!  This product works when nothing else has. Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> i think it is the same like other deodorants nothing special, so i will never buy it again, i prefer another one</li>
            <li> I have big problems with under arm sweating. This product was literally my last attempt before going to see a doctor about the issue. It works incredibly well. As long as you apply it once per day then you don&#x27;t need to reapply after a shower. Just do it once before bed.</li>
            <li> Magic,magic.this product needs 10*</li>
            <li> This is the antiperspirant I recommend most, for people with trouble with excessive sweating. Yes, it often causes burning, redness, itchiness, and irritation, but it works. The other \\&quot;clinical\\&quot; products out there (you know the ones, that come in a more traditional deodorant form), but this one works the best, by FAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips: the directions say to apply it at night, but that&#x27;s only for people who shower in the morning. If you happen to bathe at night, you&#x27;ll want to apply this in the morning instead. This is especially important for women who shave their underarms (who will probably experience quite a bit of irritation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you travel, be sure to place this inside a ziplock bag. It tends to leak, no matter how tightly you screw on the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have trouble with unsightly redness that migrates past your underarms (it can be difficult to apply this precisely, because it is a liquid), try applying body lotion everywhere you don&#x27;t want to apply it, before using the Certain Dri. This will help protect the skin you don&#x27;t want to treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I found a very unusual use for this product: I had a kitten who kept me awake all night licking my face. It was sweet, but also incredibly annoying. To gently stop her, one night I applied Certain Dri to my face (it tastes terrible). She gave me one lick, then never tried again.</li>
            <li> Amazing thats all I can say. You will not be disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> Stuff really does work!!!! I haven&#x27;t had any luck with any product in 30 years until this! Have to make sure you put it on EVERY night and your pits will stay dry the next day! Was very skeptical but trust me it works! No more papertowl under my arms or embarrassing sweat rings!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! Make sure you follow the instructions. I didn&#x27;t at first, but they made a big difference when I did.</li>
            <li> Simply stated - it does not work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followed instructions exactly as stated and it simply does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, results were equal or worse than over&lt;br /&gt;the counter items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recall the last time i didn&#x27;t sweat through my shirt the minute i put it on... That is until yesterday!&lt;br /&gt;I applied the product before going to bed really thinking this was a gimmick but i was ready to try anything ( even considered botox injections in the sweat glands) and the next morning i kinda just forgot about it until i realized at lunch that my shirt was totally dry!&lt;br /&gt;so even if its just a fluke, i gave this product a 5 star rating for at the very least that one day of dryness...&lt;br /&gt;i would definitely recommend it $20 is nothing when you suffer from this excessive sweating .&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been thoroughly disappointed by this product. Each time I wear it, I seem to sweat just as much, if not more. I am debating whether or not I received a bad roll-on considering all the other great results. But just thought that I&#x27;d put it out there that there is one very dissatisfied customer :(</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding this at department stores so I ordered it off of amazon. One roller lasts me a couple months. I find that this is very effective at cutting down my armpit sweating. I used to have to avoid buying certain shirt types because I&#x27;d soak right through my undershirt into the outside shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use antiperspirant deodorant in conjunction with certain dri. I usually try to apply it before I go to bed after taking a shower. It seems to be the most effective this way. I apply it every other day on average and it does the job for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks are that the roller can catch your armpit hair occasionally. Also, the product can burn a bit if you use it after shaving or trimming your armpits as well. I just make sure I trim my armpits on the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; day.</li>
            <li> My husband is a heavy sweater. This antiperspirant works so well that yesterday while moving furniture from the fourth floor out of the building, he was dripping in sweat from everywhere except his underarms. The only dry spots on his shirt were his pits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product in stores and it really, really works and for that I give this 5 stars. However, it does make my armpits really itchy, which I&#x27;ve heard is common when using this product. If you can deal with the itching, I say go for it.</li>
            <li> For some reason when the summer rolls around and I am on BC, my pits destroys my pretty dresses and summer tops. I put this on after a night shower and I am covered for at least 72 hours.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  I usually have to switch between heavy-duty brands to keep my body from getting used to them and therefore not work as well, but I don&#x27;t have that problem with Certain Dri.  I know some people don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s watery, but I find that to be a plus because it absorbs in.  I use any old brand on top of it just for a scent I like.  Sometimes it stings badly, but it eventually stops, and I have to be sure not to use too much (I&#x27;ve always used so much deodorant!!).  I know it says to apply at night (and it seems most people use it that way), but I shower in the morning and just prefer to put in on then....I figure if I put in on every 24 hours, it really doesn&#x27;t matter what time of day I put it on.  It does last longer than a day if for some reason I don&#x27;t put it on, but I can tell if I haven&#x27;t put it on several days in a row.</li>
            <li> I would say that I produce an average amount of sweat; mostly in extreme heat, but also during activities with a high level of movement or stress. I originally bought this product because my job requires me to wear clothing with sleeves, and it was embarrassing how I would show sweat spots on my shirt when in situations with high heat, stress or activity. It is an amazing product; I have used 3 other clinical strength deodorants that didn&#x27;t reduce my sweat, let alone eliminate it for 3 full days like this product does. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, so you have to use a regular deodorant with it, but I actually like this feature, as I am picky about scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because of the itching factor. I use it as directed: before bed, on dry, unbroken skin, NOT after shaving (did that once and it was the most miserable night of non-sleep in my life), and it still causes nearly unbearable itching. If it didn&#x27;t completely eliminate my sweat, I wouldn&#x27;t have used it more than once. As it is, I apply it right before bed, and take melatonin to help me fall asleep quickly and sometimes my under arms will itch so badly I will wake up in the middle of the night, desperate to scratch my arm pits. I have a number of times \\&quot;attacked\\&quot; my armpits with an emery board to the point of drawing blood. I&#x27;ve also taken to keeping an aloe lotion beside my bed, and sometimes applying this is effective enough to reduce the itching to a bearable level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it works differently for different people. I just wanted to share my experience with it. I think the confidence that comes with knowing I don&#x27;t have sweat spots on my clothing is worth the temporary discomfort and disruptions to my sleep.</li>
            <li> First: the product. Certain Dri lives up to it&#x27;s claim of combating underarm wetness and does an amazing job at that. I am a big man, so I have to use more than the 2 recommended rolls of the bottle, more like 4. Yes, there is a bit of irritation once applied but this goes away after 30 minutes. My shirts stay dry, I&#x27;m not ashamed to raise my arm in class, and no one looks at my underarms anymore and the ensuing swamp jokes. This is a definite win if you have underarm wetness issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up with the reviews on this product, but all of them seem a little to good to be true. Nearly everyone gives it a 5 start rating and many of the reviews sound the same. Also, if you click on the purchaser to see other items reviews, you will notice that many have this listed as their only product. Sounds like Review Spamming, probably in an effort to have high reviews and thus more sales of the product. Not sure who would do that, would you?</li>
            <li> Itch like crazy for a couple of hours, but pretty effective. After some time I&#x27;m just using it once a week, or even less frequent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff since puberty, it has been a life saver.  No longer do I have to wear an undershirt with my tees.  Just be careful not to over apply, it can cause skin irritation, but 3 swipes per pit and you&#x27;ll be golden,</li>
            <li> Works so well I didn&#x27;t even need it anymore after using it a few times. Had crazy weird peri-menopause sweating issues (what the heck) and my dr. recommended this. It didn&#x27;t cause irritation and seemed to not only cover the problem but actually treat it. Very cool. Now I&#x27;m back to just regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> While I do use this product to control sweat, it is under a prosthetic liner. As a recent BK amputee,  I was sweating profusely under the silicone suspend liner. After my Prosthetist recommend Certain DRI and gave me a sample,  I knew it would be a permanent part of my routine. For me, the difference was dramatic.</li>
            <li> The roll on Certain Dri is, definitely, not my first choice.  I am glad I tried it but I prefer the Certain Dri solid.  This one is too wet and I feel like I sweat more with the roll on method.  It&#x27;s uncomfortable and sometimes irritating.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works. This has been a real life-saver.  I used to carry several t-shirts and change them throughout the day.  Now I just put this on before bed every few days and I don&#x27;t have a problem anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used everything from Degree&#x27;s Clinical Protection to Speed Stick&#x27;s Pro series and nothing works as good as this does.  In fact, it worked better than the prescription my doctor gave me!</li>
            <li> I have had heavy underarm sweat since about 14 years old. I&#x27;ve tried every deodorant/antiperspirant on the market. Even clinical strength did nothing and I would start sweating shortly after putting it on in the morning. I tried CertainDri for the first time last night. This is the first day in my life since puberty that I have not had wet underarms or sweat stains on my shirt. It did burn a bit a few minutes after I put it on, but if every day will be like today it is worth it. While shaving my armpits this morning there was some discomfort due to sensitivity of the underarm, but again, worth it for not a drop of sweat all day.</li>
            <li> this really works. i&#x27;ve recommended it to friends and it works every time for them. you do kind of build up a tolerance to it but it still works.</li>
            <li> My mom say it works but starch something no big problem</li>
            <li> This product is great! Use it exactly how it says. I apply generously and it lasts for 3 or so days! It is SO nice to not have to worry about soaking shirts everyday, and keeping my arms down to hide it. Thank you CertainDri for doing what everything over-the-counter could not do!</li>
            <li> As the others reviews said, it&#x27;s amazing. No more sweaty pits at work after a day or two and it&#x27;s been working for almost 2 years now. On my 4th bottle. Just buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been extremely self-conscious of my excessive underarm sweating. When you sweat as much as I do (and I&#x27;m sure that there&#x27;s a big chance that you do), you can&#x27;t reach up to grab items off high shelves, give someone a good hug, write something on the high portion of a whiteboard, and so many other things.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product a few months ago after I read some amazing reviews online. I had incredible results right away; I went from heavy to minimal perspiration. After trading out my regular, bargain-brand deodorant for a clinical deodorant, I found that my sweating disappeared completely.&lt;br /&gt;About a month ago, I lost my Certain Dri bottle for a few days, which meant that my perspiration went back to a more minimal level (with the Certain Dri having been \\&quot;built up\\&quot; over time and still using a clinical deodorant). When I found the bottle again, I went back to having no perspiration whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;My Certain Dri bottle recently dried completely up and I went to purchase another from my local WalMart. I couldn&#x27;t find the Certain Dri anywhere. I went back to search three times and I just can&#x27;t find it. In just two weeks or so of not using Certain Dri, my perspiration has gotten much, much worse again. Even while using a clinical deodorant (which does make me sweat less than a bargain-brand deodorant), the amount of sweat I have is much more than with Certain Dri. Actually, any amount of sweating would be much more than with Certain Dri because when I use Certain Dri, I don&#x27;t sweat at ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, using the product does make your underarms sting. But I&#x27;ve found that when it gets really bad, it&#x27;s best not to use the product for a few nights or shave the area until the stinging goes down. A minimal amount of stinging is perfectly normal, especially when you first start to use it. The key is just to use a few swipes, just as the instructions say. Piling up the product WILL make it more painful and will most likely (as it did for me) turn your underarms bright red.&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, Certain Dri is a miracle product. It makes a huge difference for everyday life and I highly recommend that you purchase it. But don&#x27;t use too much of it at once! And remember; it&#x27;s okay to skip a day or two now and then. Just don&#x27;t go without it for two weeks like me, because then it gets scary!ed.  Long story short, Certain Dri is a miracle product.

            <li> I waited a few months before writing my review because I thought the effects might wear off, but so far so good. Like may reviewers I used to avoid everything except black and white shirts because of profuse sweating. With this product, I&#x27;m able to wear anything I want. Today I even wore a solid burgundy dress shirt in front of my classes with no fear of lifting up my arms. I don&#x27;t want to exaggerate, but if any product on Amazon has ever changed my life for the better, this is definitely it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you should put it on at night instead of in the morning. That&#x27;s how it works. I follow the directions, take a shower in the morning, and am good to go. It&#x27;s great. There&#x27;s nothing messy to get on the inside of your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, it can sting if you use it all the time, so I only use it on days when I know I&#x27;m going to especially need it--usually 3-4 days during the week--and give it a rest of weekends. But the effects last on the off days as well. I sometimes still get a little stinging, but the benefits are definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it will work for everyone, and the effects still might eventually wear off for me, but right now the only negative thought I have about this product is &amp;#34;why couldn&#x27;t I have found it sooner.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works great! Took some medication that cause excessive sweating and this took care of it after only a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Finally I can wear all the clothes I like without worrying about sweat stains. I have tried a lot of different products but this is the only one that helped.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews and was very optimistic especially when some people were reporting having to only use the product once in a couple of months after several weeks of straight use. First let me mention that I live in Southeast Asia where it is very very humid and always hot. I hated getting pit stains at work. I started using this product last April 2013 and for the first 2 weeks it was doing well. I was putting it at night before bed every night. Then after the 2nd week i started to itch. I read that this was a normal side effect so i tried applying this only every other night. This still caused itchiness so i tried applying twice a week. Fail. Still had the itch. I tried putting it once every 4 days and the itchiness went away, but the sweat came back. I read some reviews of people saying they would rather have itchy underarms than sweaty ones and i felt i was in that same boat so i continued to use the product. It would be itchy a few minutes after application then the next morning everything would be ok so i felt i could live with it. However, after a few months of using the product during the week and giving myself a break during the weekends, i started to develop a rash. So I stopped applying until the rash went away and now i&#x27;m using it intermittently. Still trying to find the perfect interval that will stop sweat and produce no side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: product works but be ready to get the side effects. It could take days, weeks or even months to find the right amount of usage that will produce perfect results. Would have given five stars if there were no side effects. Would have given four stars if i didn&#x27;t get the rash and only had the itch.</li>
            <li> My father has always sweated alot to the point that when he drove a truck at a mine he would shave during the hotter months to try to cut down on the odor. He passed that excessive sweating onto my brother and my teenage son also has the same issue. My father uses Gillette clinical strength and it works for him but he is retired so it&#x27;s not like it was years ago. I purchased Gillette Clinical Strength for my son and it does work to a point but he works at a deli and around oven and fryers all day so he gets pretty hot and he will still sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw Certain Dry here on Amazon and figured what the heck it can&#x27;t hurt to try. So it arrived and that night my son started using it. A little itchy feeling in his armpits he said but bearable and if it worked he&#x27;d \\&quot;deal\\&quot; with it. He worked all day today and than walked home in 84 degree weather and not only did he not sweat at work but the walk home didn&#x27;t make him sweat either. He was totally jazzed when he got home and thanked me for getting it for him. His excessive sweating has always embarrassed him and now that is at an end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that it costs less than Gillette Clinical Strength to which makes me happy lol.</li>
            <li> I honestly would sweat like crazy for some odd reason. There was no rhyme or reason I would just sweat, and a lot. I would even wear two shirts and would still have both of them would show sweat marks in the arm pit area. I tried every single available anti-perspiration deodorant. I tried the Axe dry which had 17% anti-pers, I even tried the Mich. Ultra Advamce(Clinical Strength). And I would still sweat like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day of using this product and not even a drop of sweat visible. I could not believe it, I even had a light gray(almost white in colour), and not a drop. I am absolutely amazed at this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is used correctly, you will not sweat at all. Anyone not rating this product a 5 shouldn&#x27;t even be look at in my personal opinion, because I&#x27;ve tried everything(Even using powder to absorbed some sweat), and this works like no other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally a must to regain your self confidence.</li>
            <li> This product will make you itch uncontrollably</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried literally every woman&#x27;s and men&#x27;s deodorant in the store...every single one. Certain dri is the ONLY thing to ever stop me from constantly sweating under my arms. I&#x27;ve been using the product almost ten years. I can&#x27;t find it where I live so got it online. You&#x27;ll need baby powder or some spray for the stink...that still happens but I would rather have that than sweat.</li>
            <li> Amazing! First time I tried it, the next day I didn&#x27;t sweat. For me, it didn&#x27;t burn because I did applied it at night and not after a shower. It used to be that my shirts were soaked by noon, and now, I&#x27;m sweat free. I even forgot to apply it one night, and I still didn&#x27;t sweat the next day. I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a week, too. I wish I would have tried this sooner.</li>
            <li> second time of purchasing this product is a excellent sweat preventer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t try this years ago. Antiperspirant deodorant can&#x27;t even come close. TRY IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy sweater and I&#x27;m finding its harder to get a product to keep me dry. After reading about Certain Dri on a blog I decided to give it a try.  After a week of using it I have no complaints.  The first day I applied it there was some stinging but it hasn&#x27;t happened since.  Keeps me dry for several days at a time too.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Not sure why the Aluminum Chloride in this product would be so much better than the Aluminum Chlorohydrate in common store-bought antiperspirants, but it seems to work extremely well.  The strange part: they tell you to use this product at night, just before going to sleep -- not after a bath/shower.  Following these directions, I&#x27;ve had good results, staying pretty dry even in stressful summer heat.  And the price is quite reasonable, too.</li>
            <li> Did not expect this stuff to work. But after the first few uses, no more excessive sweat! Now I can wear anything I want without worrying about pit stains!</li>
            <li> I have tried one anti-perspirant after another without relief. It was a very frustrating abv embarrassing problem. Certain Dri was one I tried skeptically optimistic and I was pleasantly surprised. I am completely dry all the time. The itching is a little annoying sometimes on application but the trade off is SO worth it.</li>
            <li> The product let me dry for at least 4 days. The study online says most users witnessed a reduction of perspiration for 5 days. I must admit my armpit burns a bit immediately after applying but it doesn&#x27;t last more then 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> invisible roll on, long lasting</li>
            <li> Even though this hasn&#x27;t 100% solved my perspiration problems, it has improved it drastically.  If I even skip one day, the problem begins to come back in full force so I just have to use it each night.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever stop using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teen..and I&#x27;ve always had a low self esteem because of my sweating problem. Now..it&#x27;s completely gone. Now whenever I come home and i see that there&#x27;s no sweat stains at all. And when I&#x27;m in gym class...I don&#x27;t have to worry about the massive sweat stains that might be on my shirts...and I don&#x27;t have to worry about people gossiping about my problem. It feels so amazing.  And in school..I&#x27;m always in the center of attention because I&#x27;m in the student council and I guess I&#x27;m considered \\&quot;popular\\&quot;..so this product allows me to be..me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving up after two months.  This product has had no beneficial effects and I actually feel like my problem is somehow worse than it was before.  It comes in a very nice roll-on bottle that conforms to the underarm.  Irritation was mild for the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is known as a first try for hyperhydrosis though, so I can&#x27;t give it a horrible review as continued sweating is more likely my problem than it is the product.  I&#x27;ll try Drysol next.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to sweat out your armpits? Buy this, follow the instructions, and you won&#x27;t sweat for a couple weeks. Like I said, a little bit scary, but it works.</li>
            <li> Wow, so I have been suffering from sweaty armpit for years. Tried every type of deodorant out there but none seemed to work. After 10 minutes of putting on a shirt, it was soaked in the armpit area and lowered my confidence. I was recommended this product by a friend and decided to give it a try since I&#x27;ve got nothing to lose. The day after my first night of using it, I had not even a drop of sweat in my armpit the next day. I could finally do the activities that I want to now.</li>
            <li> This is the best product, it truly works, I could never live without it. It has stopped my wetness problems.</li>
            <li> Very good! , ues for a long times per bottle /  economise  , good quality &amp;  quantity. :) :) :)</li>
            <li> I went from sweating through 2 shirts a day to not sweating (at all). This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made from Amazon. I wish I would have known about it earlier. 10/10, 100% awesome.</li>
            <li> OUCH! This burns, stings and makes you itchy! I tried it on the first time and I felt the discomfort, the next day I didn&#x27;t sweat, great! The next night I used it again and the burning and itching were much worse, when I woke up I still had a great deal of burning and stinging. I woke up and looked at my arm pits in the mirror and was shocked to see the skin was red and inflamed. I washed it with mild soap and had to put ointment on there. this may stop the sweating but the side effects are too horrible.</li>
            <li> This product has change my life. I used to sweat ALOT. It was embarrassing @ times. I couldnt wear tight shirts. Or clothes that i wanted to wear.  I saw a commercial. Bought it and now i can not imagine being with out it.  I treat my problem once a month.  Best product out there! I promise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best stuff on the market for this kind of problem.  Follow the directions and only use a little and never after shaving.  Problem solved.</li>
            <li> This works great for me. I was a terrible head sweater (I belonged to head sweaters anonymous). I use Certain Dri, the roll on kind, on my forehead before I go to bed, and I hardly sweat from my head anymore. I feel, like I sweat like a normal person, now, Instead of it being Niagara Falls.</li>
            <li> As someone who has suffered from overactive sweatglands finding a good antiperspirant has been a lifelong challenge.  I have tried everything including natural remedies and nothing has worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you use Certain Dri as instructed, at night and use daily for a week or two then gradually start skipping days, the results are fabulous.  I usually perspire even when cold and now I can use the &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; and good smelling deodorants that never did any good before.  My shirts and sweaters last longer and do not have the discoloration that came from multiple applications of antiperspirant a day.  I have even stopped carrying around an &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; travel size of deodorant in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since recommended to my cousin and friend who suffer as I did and they have had the same results.</li>
            <li> I was putting on so much deodorant that my clothes were getting stained. White shirts got the yellow stains from the aluminum or whatever it is in deodorant that causes it. And black shirts were getting white stains from there being too much of it. But if I didn&#x27;t put enough on, then my sweat wouldn&#x27;t be properly absorbed and I&#x27;d get wet patches and feel really itchy. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to give this product a try and I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I use it in combination with regular deodorant, however, now I&#x27;m able to just put a very thin layer of deodorant on and still feel comfortable throughout the day. I apply certain dri at night, usually every other night. By the time I wake up, there is a faint smell of sweat, but I feel dry, and that makes me infinitely more comfortable. I wouldn&#x27;t say you could use this just by itself though. It decreases the amount of sweat you can produce in your armpits, but it doesn&#x27;t eliminate it entirely, so you&#x27;re still going to need some form of deodorant as well. If you&#x27;re like me, anyway.</li>
            <li> I was never a big sweater, but a friend recommended this to me about 10 years ago, and I have been using it ever since.  I buy it at Target.  I wax my underarms once per week, so on that day, I skip the application of this product, because it would burn.  The other 6 days of the week, I apply before going to bed.  I work nights, so apply some days In the mornings.  Not necessary to use every day, but I did not ever have a problem with excessive sweating.  For people getting Botox injections to stop underarm sweat, this product could possibly eliminate that need.</li>
            <li> this is a very effective product. applied at night it will visibly dimish sweat over the next day (says it hold for more days...didn&#x27;t experiment). no unsavoury or musty smells.&lt;br /&gt;one roll on lasted for 3-4 months&lt;br /&gt;if applied abundantly it super dries armpits...causes excessive itching</li>
            <li> Perfect, does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> As advertised solved by problem after years of issues.</li>
            <li> Works like it says, I had problems with over excessive sweating when I would just be sitting in class and this 100% works. The very next day after using it the first night I had no problems. It&#x27;s a real confidence booster and worth a shot.</li>
            <li> This is one of only two deodorants I have been able to use because of allergies.  I had never heard of it before, but it fills the bill for me!  I checked the ingredients vs. the one I previously used, which is no longer made.  Thank you, Certain Dri!</li>
            <li> OMG! This stuff really works!  I work from home and find myself sitting at my desk for long stretches. Lately, I have been noticing that my armpits were getting sweatier than usual and set out to find a better ant-perspirant.  I tried a wide assortment of deoderants and found no success... That is, until I found Certain Dri here on Amazon.  This stuff is amazing!  I apply this every other night, before bed, and then apply the Certain Dri AM in the morning and I&#x27;m set!  FYI, this stuff isn&#x27;t meant to be used daily - apply it every few days as a base.  Use the Certain Dri AM every morning as a regular deoderant and you&#x27;ll be good to go.  FYI, the Certain Dri does have a strong talc smell when you apply it, which is also why I like to use the nice-smelling Certain Dri AM as my daily deoderant.  A great combination with excellent results. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Ok, so like many of the people who have commented on this, I sweat a ton from my underarms.I have tried many of the over the counter \\&quot;Clinical Strength\\&quot; products. I sweat just sitting at my desk during the day and oftentimes have to put paper towerls in my underarms so I don&#x27;t have sweat rings down to my waist. I received these in the mail 4 days ago. The first day I used it I noticed a little bit of an improvement. Certainly better than past products but not amazing like most people describe. Then, the second day, halfway through the day I noticed that I hadn&#x27;t been sweating at all. I&#x27;m on the fourth day and it&#x27;s still working great. I give this product 5 stars - it&#x27;s given me a lot more confidence to know that I don&#x27;t look like a sweaty pig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU SWEAT A LOT, AND NOTHING HAS WORKED, BUY THIS PRODUCT. It&#x27;s worth the $12 to even just try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this review is early, but I will be sure to give another one in a couple of months to see if it&#x27;s still working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It&#x27;s now been about 4-5 months since I did an update. This is still working amazing. I still have 1.5 bottles left, and when I&#x27;m finished, I&#x27;ll be buying more for sure. Like I said above, buy this NOW if you have problems sweating.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it was as described by the seller. The anti-perspirant is effective in my case, so I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> GREAT! I was not expecting it to work... but it does!! A couple strokes at night and I&#x27;m fresh all day&#x27;s long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only weird thing is that when weather is hot and I was supposed to sweat, I feel like if my armpits were hot and wet, but I touch them and nothing, they&#x27;re dry!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not using it daily, but it works.</li>
            <li> This deodorant used to work amazingly on me...until they changed to the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; thicker formula. Now it makes my armpits itch like crazy! I woke up at 3am last night with itchy armpits and had to wash it off. So sad! It used to be my favorite product and I could use it with no skin calming products. I tried using it with skin calming products but I&#x27;m still too itchy :( I wish they would sell me the old formula for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes, but the product works average.  Def better than the high price anti per spirants but be ware of the possibility of it ruining certain colored clothes.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot.  I have gone through dozens of different anti-perspirant products and none of them was strong enough to stop the sweat. All they ever did was stain my clothes with a lovely, hard to clean gunk + sweat combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now I use this product maybe once a week or so, and just a simple, light deodorant (which, as I discovered is actually quite hard to find, seems like just about everything on the grocery store shelf is anti-perspirant) in between.  I no longer sweat all over my clothes, and I no longer ruin my clothes or get white stripes all over everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does make my armpits itch.  Some nights more than others, probably depending on how much I put on.  It can be hard to dose the liquid because it isn&#x27;t particularly sticky, it sort of just drips off the roller ball.</li>
            <li> The only product that has helped me with excessive perspiration. Before finding this deodorant I tried everything and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. Just use the instructions, as you must put it on before bed.</li>
            <li> This is supposedly a new and improved formula but it simply does not work as well as the original. I really wish they had specified that it was a different formula which is not apparent until you open the package. Now I am stuck with three of these.</li>
            <li> it really keeps you dry, I also use a day antiperspirant but finally found a product that really helped for that matter</li>
            <li> I swear by it for several years now since my menopause.</li>
            <li> After trying multiple types of antiperspirants, I&#x27;ve finally found one that works, this.  If you put it on and have water on your underarms, it seems to sting a bit, dry yourself off first.  Works VERY well...</li>
            <li> my pits tend to sweat a lot even if i&#x27;m not being active so this has been the first thing besides stick antiperspirant that i&#x27;ve tried.  Well I have to say I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve been living without it!  I use it the way the say to, roll it on before bed and the next day you should be dry, sometimes two days.  Even if I forget at night, rolling it on in the morning doesn&#x27;t burn or anything and if you&#x27;re careful I haven&#x27;t seen any stains on clothes(which is why I assume they tell you to put it on at night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now In the morning I just apply a deodorant (not an antiperspirant) or just skip and just a little cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tip for guys: I also found trimming down your pit hair (i&#x27;m a beast) helps a lot in its own, but also helps since this stuff can make better contact with your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try and remedy the pit stains I get from excessive armpit sweating. I followed the instructions but I still experience pit stains at least 2 or 3 times a week. Overall, I am disappointed that this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Have struggled with underarm sweat for years.  It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m extrememly self conscious about, and I feel embarrassed because of it.  I&#x27;ve tried different deodorants, different amounts of deodorants...nothing seemed to work.  I received this product last week and applied before bed, and the next day I was completely dry that day and the next.  I&#x27;ve reapply this product every other night before bed, and I&#x27;ve been dry every day since.  Unbelieveable.  I didn&#x27;t experience the burning sensation that people have mentioned; I do not shave my armpits and maybe that is the reason some people experience the burn, while others do not.  Great product....can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend , works as promised! Husband and son love it! Will order more as needed! Wish we could find it in stores!</li>
            <li> The product works…however, it broke my skin out in a rash and I had to stop using it.  I ordered the solid which is supposed to be better for sensitive skin.  I hope it works as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant (usually bought it at different retail stores) for about 15 years and all I have to say is that it really works, unlike other deodorants that promise to work up to 24, 48, 72 hours but at best leave your clothes smelling like stale deodorant anyway or don&#x27;t work like promised.&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant is a little watery, but you&#x27;ll get used to it once you notice that you really don&#x27;t perspire or at the end of the day, there&#x27;s no residual smell on your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend you bathe before 72 hours, as no deodorant will last that long.&lt;br /&gt;This pack of three is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping at a great price!</li>
            <li> I hate this product. I&#x27;ve used this product twice- the first night my underarms itched so insanely bad that I couldn&#x27;t go to sleep. I had to wash my armpits after about 20 minutes because the itching was like some sort of torture. I just put it on again about 30 minutes ago and after about 10 minutes, my underarms started to itch like crazy again- so I immediately ran to the bathroom and washed my armpits and applied my Dove deodorant. I then threw my open bottle of Certain Dri in the trash. This product is horrible- For the people that leave positive reviews... How do you make it through the night with the insane itching??? Never using this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly two weeks and notice my sweating has reduced dramatically. I am finally able to wear some shirts (in lighter colors) that I couldn&#x27;t even two weeks ago due to armpit stains.</li>
            <li> My son has had allergic reactions to other common brands, but this product Certain Dri works great.  No reactions and it works great.  It costs a little more than the other big name brands but it works great and in our case no reactions from the product.</li>
            <li> WORKS PERFECT, JUST LIKE THE COMMENTS, USE AS THE INSTRUCTIONS AND WILL BE PERFECT FOR YOU, I DONT HAVE ANY PROBLEM</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years. It works like a miracle. For years, I tried several of the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; antiperspirants but none seemed to make a difference and will not solved the problem they promised to solved. After finding Certain Dri my perspiration problem resolved. I only use it once a week, and...problem solved. Now, be aware this product may create a burning or itching sensation during the first 30 minutes after application.</li>
            <li> I am sooooo pleased with this product. I have had a super sweaty underarm problem since high school and once I had children, it got so much worse. It was embarrassing and gross and I had to be careful of the kinds of shirts I could wear. I could be freezing cold, but my underarms would sweat like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I saw a commercial for this product &amp; looked into it. Boy am I glad i did!!! I read and read reviews of the product before making my decision. The thing that worried me most about it was the itching. I have sensative skin so it worried me. I ordered mine (which showed up much sooner then the estimated shipment date) and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. The bottle said to put it on before bedtime....also said not to shave before putting it on. So the first night I put it on and it did itch some, but at the most I noticed the itch off and on for about an hour. The next day, I noticed a difference in the decreased amount of wetness under my arms already. Did still sweat more then I would have liked. The next night I did shave my underarms before putting it on. Again it itched and this time burned alittle, but lasted no more then an hour. Nothing I couldn&#x27;t deal with. After 3 days of use, boy what a difference it had made. Almost no wetness on super hot days and no wetness on other hot days or normal days! Now I do use more on both underarms then recommended. It said 2 swipes on each arm, I do more then that. Never counted but it&#x27;s more then that. I have been using the product for over a week now and I am hooked!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! No more embarrassment, no more worries about what shirts I can or can&#x27;t wear. Too bad I didn&#x27;t hear about this product sooner!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I don&#x27;t know how I survived without it.  I&#x27;m totally hooked and will continue to purchase if the future.  I will say that the product does tingle a little at first and sometimes itches, but as you get used to it (over a month or two) you don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li> This really helps with sweaty underarms. It stung the first time I applied this. That&#x27;s probably because I used it right after I got out of the shower and I applied too much. 3 strokes will do the job and make sure your underarms are dry. This made my armpit dark though so now I only use this when it&#x27;s really hot. But my underarms are not as sweaty as before anymore. I also like that it&#x27;s odorless and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it would. I use it the night or two before an important event because I usually sweat when I am nervous or excited and had a huge problem with having sweaty underarms. It saved my life, my white shirts and my confidence. It takes one-two applications to work. I don&#x27;t use it everyday - just when I know I will have an important event or if I want to wear a white/light colored clothes that will show sweat. Love it. Still on the first one from the three pack after about of 6-7 month of sporadic use.</li>
            <li> I brought this antiperspirant for my daughter, but it damaged her clothes, as if she had put chlorine in the underarm area.</li>
            <li> I was using Drysol for years but is was getting rather expensive and harder to obtain being that it is prescription required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Certain Dri Roll-On many months ago and I am very pleased.  The product isn&#x27;t as strong as Drysol but works almost the same.  The product uses a water base solution for application where as Drysol uses an alcohol base solution (will dry and absorb quicker).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only relay difference is that you will need to apply this product more frequently than say using Drysol.  Otherwise,Certain Dr Roll-On is identical in results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work, but according to the review I saw before I bought the item, some people have much more severe condition than I do, and they said the product worked 100%.</li>
            <li> Best Anti-Perspirant I have ever used. It really works from the very first day. People say it burns, but I felt nothing so far.</li>
            <li> Alright. So here&#x27;s the problem. I&#x27;m a big guy, and I sweat A LOT. To let you have a brief idea of how much,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I start perspiring once I get out of the showers, although it&#x27;s light perspiration&lt;br /&gt;2) my underarms get really wet just from walking from point to point (e.g. down a block)&lt;br /&gt;3) Even in an air conditioned room, my underarms can get pretty damp/wet just from sitting down and getting my work done.&lt;br /&gt;4) In the clubs or open air bar? I don&#x27;t even wanna get started. I might as well start my own water-purification plant and start selling my own bottle water from my perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So obviously, I sweat too much. And it makes me incredibly self conscious about myself. Not so much because of the smell (I don&#x27;t have body odor, thankfully), but because of the giant dark patches in my shirts. This is particularly worse when I&#x27;m expected to give a pitch or presentation to my office (dark patches are very distracting...) or when I&#x27;m in a club and I&#x27;m just forcing myself to keep my hands down instead of fist pumping the s*** outta my arms in the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried TONNES of over the counter products. You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. Every single bloody one of them, and none of them works. I&#x27;d pretty much given up really, and was looking towards going to the doctors to get some sorta prescription strength product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ohhhhh god. The power of Amazon&#x27;s suggestion. For some weird reason this product popped up in my suggested items, and I check it out. Saw the insanely good reviews, decided to buy it to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just start by saying this product is BLOODY MINDBLOWINGLY AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the instruction says run on 2 -3 swabs on your underarm before you sleep. given my history of disappointing encounters, I was not taking any chances. I applied a good 5 - 8 swabs on each underarm, and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAM. first thing that&#x27;s gonna hit you. This bad boy REALLY REALLY stings. The stinging sensation comes in little pulses here and there. They&#x27;re not unbearable, but they are intense. But yeah. It&#x27;s pretty damn painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next day, BAM. a whole day of errand running. rushed back and forth all over the place, and when I&#x27;d normally have these 2 giant wet patches on my shirt at the underarm area, this time there was NOTHING. nada. zilch. So i thought ok maybe its not wet enough to soak through. So I reached in, touched my underarm, and BAM. mind &#x3D; blown. My underarm was like the bloody sahara desert. heck, it wasn&#x27;t even remotely damp or clammy or anything of that sorts. It was just DRY. and mind you, I had a pretty intense day, running/jogging around + lifting stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways my underarm stayed dry for a good 2 full days, and since i had some important function on the 3rd, i decided to apply again before I sleep. This time I thought that I would reduce the number of swabs to 4 to see if the stinging would be less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad news: No. The stinging is still the same. It still stings, and it still hurts pretty intensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3, Went for a whole afternoon of wakeboarding + party after that. BAM. still dry as a... okay nvm I don&#x27;t think anyone would appreciate the analogy I was gunning for, but you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this baby is frigging amazing. And I&#x27;m telling you as someone who has an underarm thats on a perpetual perspiration overdrive EVEN from sitting down in an airconditioned room. It works, and it keeps your underarm just DRY. And it&#x27;s bloody amazing because that s*** lasts at least 2 full days. The ONLY downside right now that this s*** stings. It really does, and it really hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But heck if you ask me, I&#x27;d go through a good amount of pain knowing that I can freely lift my arms up and not look like I have 2 sexually aroused underarms.but they are intense. But yeah. It&#x27;s pretty damn painful.    Next day, BAM. a whole day of errand running. rushed back and forth all over the place, and when I&#x27;d normally have these 2 giant wet patches on my shirt at the underarm area, this time there was NOTHING. nada. zilch. So i thought ok maybe its not wet enough to soak through. So I reached in, touched my underarm, and BAM. mind &#x3D; blown. My underarm was like the bloody sahara desert. heck, it wasn&#x27;t even remotely damp or clammy or anything of that sorts. It was just DRY. and mind you, I had a pretty intense day, running/jogging around + lifting stuff.    Anyways my underarm stayed dry for a good 2 full days, and since i had some important function on the 3rd, i decided to apply again before I sleep. This time I thought that I would reduce the number of swabs to 4 to see if the stinging would be less.    Bad news: No. The stinging is still the same. It still stings, and it still hurts pretty intensely.    Day 3, Went for a whole afternoon of wakeboarding + party after that. BAM. still dry as a... okay nvm I don&#x27;t think anyone would appreciate the analogy I was gunning for, but you get the idea.    In short, this baby is frigging amazing. And I&#x27;m telling you as someone who has an underarm thats on a perpetual perspiration overdrive EVEN from sitting down in an airconditioned room. It works, and it keeps your underarm just DRY. And it&#x27;s bloody amazing because that s*** lasts at least 2 full days. The ONLY downside right now that this s*** stings. It really does, and it really hurts.    But heck if you ask me, I&#x27;d go through a good amount of pain knowing that I can freely lift my arms up and not look like I have 2 sexually aroused underarms.</li>
            <li> i am a big time sweater, but with this product those days are gone.  love it.&lt;br /&gt;just dont put on too much.</li>
            <li> It’s nice when a product works EXACTLY as advertised, which Certain Dri PM Roll-On does. This is one of the few products I have used that TRULY works through a strong antiperspirant action. That is, it does NOT use scents to cover up odor from sweating, but rather dramatically reduces sweating, and hence dramatically reduces odors. When at least 15 other deodorant/antiperspirant products didn’t, THIS is the product that allows me to wear light blue shirts.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY PROBLEM&lt;br /&gt;Everyone produces sweat under his or her arms, and this type of sweat has an odor to it. However, not everyone sweats the same. Some sweat more than others, and some sweat has a more noticeable odor. Stress can accelerate not just the quantity of sweat, but also make a more concentrated odor. I have a tendency to sweat a lot when wearing a sport coat. It&#x27;s not something pleasant to talk about, but I historically would have to specifically only buy certain color shirts, and refrain from taking my outer coat off because I felt it was noticeable. This bothered me greatly, often accelerating stress, and ultimately making me sweat more. Yikes :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different deodorant/antiperspirant products, including some of the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; products sold over the counter. Some worked better than others, but none had dramatic results. A friend who suffered from the same issue recommended this Certain Dri, and specifically this Certain Dri PM Roll-On (found in a green and white box.)&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CERTAIN DRI PRODUCT OFFERINGS&lt;br /&gt;Certain Dri offers 4 different products:&lt;br /&gt;---1. “Certain Dri Clinical Strength Anti-Perspirant Roll-On” AKA the PM Roll-On&lt;br /&gt;This is their 72-hour antiperspirant and their strongest product, made for use before going to bed. It does not have a scent and is a pure antiperspirant (i.e., not a deodorant.) It comes in a green and white box, and this listing is for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---2. “Certain Dri Clinical Strength Solid Anti-Perspirant” AKA the PM Stick&lt;br /&gt;This is their 72-hour antiperspirant designed to be gentler on skin than the roll-on, made for use before going to bed. It is not as aggressive of an antiperspirant as the Roll-On version, but it is still quite capable. It does not have a scent and is a pure antiperspirant (i.e., not a deodorant.) It comes in a green &amp; white box also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---3. “Everyday Strength Certain Dri AM Underarm Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Roll-On”&lt;br /&gt;This is their daily-use roll-on product that contains both an antiperspirant AND a deodorant. It has a light scent that is fresh and appropriate for both guys and girls. It’s antiperspirant action is comparable to many other premium over-the-counter antiperspirants, but is nowhere near as strong as the Certain Dri PM products above. It comes in a light blue &amp; white box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---4. “Everyday Strength Certain Dri AM Underarm Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant Solid”&lt;br /&gt;This is their daily-use stick product that contains both an antiperspirant AND a deodorant, and is often considered more gentle on skin than the AM Roll-On. It has a light scent that is fresh and appropriate for both guys and girls. It’s antiperspirant action is comparable to many other premium over-the-counter antiperspirants, but is nowhere near as strong as the Certain Dri PM products above. It also comes in a light blue &amp; white box.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW WELL DOES CERTAIN DRI WORK???&lt;br /&gt;Certain Dri’s PM Roll-On changed everything. This PM Roll-On is the workhorse of the Certain Dri family. It does not use scents at all to mask odors. Rather, what it contains is quite a lot of aluminum chloride and this blend is highly effective in dramatically reducing the amount you sweat. If I had to put a percentage on it, I would say it reduces my sweating by at least 95%. The active ingredient not only gives effectiveness, but also longevity. It puts just everything else you can buy without a prescription (and some you can buy only with a prescription) to shame, and many physicians consider it the product of choice to manage a medical condition that can cause profuse sweating. This is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CORRECT USAGE&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely critical that this product be used correctly because correct usage will 1) allow it to work to its full potential, 2) reduce the chance of causing irritation, and 3) avoid staining expensive clothing. As this is a pure antiperspirant, it needs to be applied a period of time BEFORE being required to work as the act of shrinking the pores is not immediate. For most people, that means applying around bedtime. I find that applying it an hour or so after showering is best because skin is clean, pores are open, and the medication can be effectively absorbed. This Roll-On can stain clothing when freshly applied, and so applying it at night makes it easier to avoid staining your nice dress cloths.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;72 HOURS?? WATER-RESISTANT?? SERIOUSLY??&lt;br /&gt;This product is advertised as a 72-hour antiperspirant. Normally, I would say any product claiming this is making a ridiculous claim that is anything but true. But this isn&#x27;t a gimmick. It is very long acting, and it does work for well past the 24-hour mark (mind you, it is most effective for the first 36-48 hours.) It is water resistant to some degree...if you jump in a pool and swim some, when you get out this product will still be surprisingly effective. Your own body will influence how often you need to reapply…for some people, every 24 hours works best. For others, 48-72 hours is fine. I generally apply this every between 48 and 72 hours, and I use this alongside a regular scented deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IRRITATION&lt;br /&gt;Stronger antiperspirants can be more irritating than other products, and there are two Certain Dri PM products consumers can choose from. This Certain Dri PM roll-on is more effective than the PM stick version, containing a more aggressive antiperspirant. However, the PM roll-on can be more irritating to skin, so the PM stick gives you an alternative if irritation occurs. With that said, I do not find the Roll-On to be excessively irritating and the fact that you only need a small amount to work effectively, plus you do not need to apply it daily, can help reduce the risk of skin irritation. Be sure to apply this product sparingly because the quantity required to work is far less than it would seem.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;These days I don&#x27;t care what color shirt I wear, and I have no issue taking my coat off even if I was warm for an extended period. Certain Dri&#x27;s PM Roll-On literally has made this a non-issue for me. No, this isn&#x27;t the easiest issue to talk about, but having been there I can identify with others and no one should have to go through the distress that excessive underarm sweat can cause. With this product, you don&#x27;t have to. This was literally a silver bullet. It took a major problem that bothered me immensely and totally &amp; completely resolved it. With that kind of effectiveness, this product is a 10 out of 5 and I highly recommend it.gevity. It puts just everything else you can buy without a prescription (and some you can buy only with a prescription) to shame, and many physicians consider it the product of choice to manage a medical condition that can cause profuse sweating. This is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CORRECT USAGE&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely critical that this product be used correctly because correct usage will 1) allow it to work to its full potential, 2) reduce the chance of causing irritation, and 3) avoid staining expensive clothing. As this is a pure antiperspirant, it needs to be applied a period of time BEFORE being required to work as the act of shrinking the pores is not immediate. For most people, that means applying around bedtime. I find that applying it an hour or so after showering is best because skin is clean, pores are open, and the medication can be effectively absorbed. This Roll-On can stain clothing when freshly applied, and so applying it at night makes it easier to avoid staining your nice dress cloths.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;72 HOURS?? WATER-RESISTANT?? SERIOUSLY??&lt;br /&gt;This product is advertised as a 72-hour antiperspirant. Normally, I would say any product claiming this is making a ridiculous claim that is anything but true. But this isn&#x27;t a gimmick. It is very long acting, and it does work for well past the 24-hour mark (mind you, it is most effective for the first 36-48 hours.) It is water resistant to some degree...if you jump in a pool and swim some, when you get out this product will still be surprisingly effective. Your own body will influence how often you need to reapply…for some people, every 24 hours works best. For others, 48-72 hours is fine. I generally apply this every between 48 and 72 hours, and I use this alongside a regular scented deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IRRITATION&lt;br /&gt;Stronger antiperspirants can be more irritating than other products, and there are two Certain Dri PM products consumers can choose from. This Certain Dri PM roll-on is more effective than the PM stick version, containing a more aggressive antiperspirant. However, the PM roll-on can be more irritating to skin, so the PM stick gives you an alternative if irritation occurs. With that said, I do not find the Roll-On to be excessively irritating and the fact that you only need a small amount to work effectively, plus you do not need to apply it daily, can help reduce the risk of skin irritation. Be sure to apply this product sparingly because the quantity required to work is far less than it would seem.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;These days I don&#x27;t care what color shirt I wear, and I have no issue taking my coat off even if I was warm for an extended period.

            <li> can&#x27;t live without- remember to follow directions- I dont know how it affects clothing</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle. I was agnostic but this has renewed my faith in God. I use it 4 times a week and I&#x27;m dry as can be, even lifting weights with a tight cotton shirt on. Seriously, stop reading reviews and buy this and then go put on a light blue dress shirt and go running in 100 degree heat. I bet you&#x27;ll be dry under the arms!</li>
            <li> I used to ruin every shirt  I wore with a nasty stain and the armpit area would get hard as hell, I tried many antiperspirant brands with no avail (rexona, degree, gillete etc).  You need to use this a day in between at first, then your body gets used to it and it becomes a once a month thing!</li>
            <li> Decided to purchase this product after continually sweating through shirts.  I use to think it was because I was over weight that I over-sweated but have recently lost 80 pounds and in the best shape of my life and visiting the gym 4 days a week.  Well, the sweating did not stop with the weight loss.  Years ago I had tried Maxim which I believe is a comparable product to this so decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this daily for two weeks now and I have to say, I am amazed!  Have not hardly sweat at all except when working out at the gym which is totally acceptable to me!  Have noticed a little more sweating in my feet but would gladly trade armpit sweating for that.  Will definately buy more of this product when this runs out!  Thank you Certain Dri!</li>
            <li> it magically works !! i use it at bed time everyday... but in the first week when u miss it sweat will come again.. but after 3 weeks not a prb anymore</li>
            <li> I used to use the old formula years ago that was clear and runny. They have improved it by making it more thick and creamy.  I used it first time for three nights in a row, and it lasted for 48 hours. I used it again for two more nights and it actually lasted for three days.  Recently I started using it in conjuction with the Chlorophyll  gel tablets, a fantastic body deodorizer, and I don&#x27;t need to use Certain Dri as much. I feel comfortable and don&#x27;t perspire at all. I like the smell of lavender antiperspirant, but don&#x27;t feel I need to use it, just a habit.  It takes a while to kick in, and it does itch at night. I find using 5 swipes helps keep down the prickly itching, and using cornstarch when the roll-on dries, or a hydrocortizone creme or both. Worth it though, when I think of all the times I am in stress mode at work and my antiperspirant fails me. Now I can wear wool and several layers of clothing, which I love in winter, and not hesitate buying the looks I love because of fear of perspiration problems.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I live in the South and I was always embarrassed at under arm sweat. No more. I never sweat under the arms! This product is like a miracle. Since I found it over a year ago, I haven&#x27;t used any other product. I use their AM one too. It&#x27;s nothing special, but it will make you feel a little better since you only apply this one once a day at night.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  I&#x27;m down to using it every third day without loss of effect.&lt;br /&gt;One day I was wearing  black shirt outside in 90+ degree heat and digging holes and STILL didn&#x27;t have wet spots under my arms!&lt;br /&gt;Just makes me think that something that works this well can&#x27;t be good for you...but we&#x27;re all going to die from something...at least I&#x27;ll be dry!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work that well for me, But the seller is very good.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. You have to apply it at night (as per the directions) and it normally gives you dry days by the fourth day of consecutive use. If your skin is sensitive use it every other day. And of course, using it right after shaving is a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;  Health wise; I&#x27;m not sure how healthy such strong antiperspirant can be for the body. Because of this I don&#x27;t use it all of the time. I save it for warmer months etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 20 years, and I can&#x27;t live without it. I sweat heavily under my arms, and ruined many shirts back in the day. I literally had sweat stains 10 minutes after putting on a shirt, even in winter time!!! I happened upon certain dry by chance, while at CVS. I didn&#x27;t really think it would work but I figured what the heck? I&#x27;ll give it a try! I&#x27;m soooo glad I did. The package said it might take a few days to start working, but I saw a big difference from the first time! My armpits were still a little damp, but no sweat stains at all, and by the third day, I was certainly dry!!! I&#x27;ve been using it since and will be as long as they make it. Warning, don&#x27;t ever use right after shaving(wait at least 24 hours), and wait until it dries before putting on your PJ&#x27;s (you put this on at night, it is a clear liquid) or use a white t-shirt, because it can discolor clothing (only upon application, not after it has dried) In 20 years, I only ruined one top (an old t-shirt) so be careful with that. It does dry fast, but if you happen to be in a humid place it might take a tad longer. In that case, lift your arms in front of your fan, or even fanning the area with a piece of cardboard or something (it takes seconds to dry). You might be a little sensitive at the beginning (I was) but that goes away. You can wear a solid moisturizing deodorant (such as dove) if that is the case with you, just until you get used to the certain dry, which for me was a week later. after you&#x27;ve been using this about a month, you will only need to use it about every two to three days, which makes it last forever. I go through about 3 bottles a year! That&#x27;s not bad at all. Love this product, changed my life!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well for me. Some people have reported itching, but that goes away after a while. Wish I had learned of it years ago.</li>
            <li> Wow!!for some reason in the last year I started to sweat unexplanable under my armpits(yes even in a ac room).. Yesterday I put on the product for the first time and today....NO WET SPOTS!!! To be honest I didn&#x27;t think it would work but I just thought\\&quot;ahhh its only 12 bucks\\&quot;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just the first day ill try and review in about 2 weeks to see if it continues as it started..DRY.</li>
            <li> i have tried all other over the counter brands and they did not work. i have carried wet underarm since i was a teenager. now i am in my 40&#x27;s and have discovered this product, and it was really amazing that no sweat is shown in my armpit anymore. whenever i will wear a polo shirt, i make it appoint to apply this at night, and then bam! no sweat ring on my shirt for over 3-4 days!</li>
            <li> I tend to sweat quite a lot. This product has done wonders to stop me from looking like I had just finished swimming at all times through out the day. Would highly recommend for anyone trying to figure out a way to save a little embarrassment with sweating.</li>
            <li> Tried everything and nothing worked. Clinical this clinical that. This plain ol worked! Even tried the Certain Dri solid and it was not as good as the roll-on. I highly recommend. Thanks for all the other reviews that sold this to me!</li>
            <li> I gave this product 1 star even though it does work really good. But wen i received them in the mail one of the 3 bottles was empty it had nothing inside. I decided not to return because the product wasnt worth the trouble..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve delt with sweaty armpits my whole adult life. I roll this on at night only once a week and barely sweat (only time is 95 plus weather in full uniform with 30 lbs of gear on and it&#x27;s just BARELY) before I would get out of the shower and start sweating instantly carrying on through the whole day. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have hyperhidrosis and this didn&#x27;t really work for me. I tried it for about 3-5 days I believe (from what i remember at least). It didn&#x27;t really keep me dry at all it was more of a prolonging before I started sweating. The severity of my sweating is pretty intense like sweating through jackets.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that this is water based, and it leaks all over the place when applying. Maybe I should&#x27;ve gotten the solid one. I applied this before bed and I start sweating at noon already. This is expensive and I don&#x27;t see it works. Not recommended and don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so popular.</li>
            <li> YOU AND OTHER PEOPLE WILL COUGH, SNEEZE, HAVE HEADACHES, AND AN IRRITATED THROAT. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SMELL THE BURNING CHEMICALS IN YOUR NOSE. IM CONVINCED ALUMINUM CAUSES CANCER!</li>
            <li> This product really does work! You need to read the instructions and apply it before you go to bed because it works its magic over night and is a waste if you apply it during the day... What I do, because its NOT a deodorant, I put certain dri on at night then give a swipe of my daily deodorant in te morning and it works flawlessly!</li>
            <li> I really promote this product for those people who badly swet under arms and that ruins your clothes and makes you feel disgusting.</li>
            <li> No exaggeration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since middle school I have worn extra clothing and always dark clothing because of the huge pit stains I would get, even in cold/rainy weather. The minute I got out of the shower I would feel sweat running down the inside of my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It affected my confidence and my day to day life. I would try all kinds of different deodorants and pile it on, to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this stuff after reading a few reviews and put it on one night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OW!!!!!! Fire, burning, explosion of holy hell. My pits were red and painful when I woke up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DRY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sweated very slightly that day, an unbelievable improvement from my entire life before. I applied it again that night to the same pain and discomfort. It made it hard to sleep it was so uncomfortable.  I woke up the next morning to dry pits again, and not a single drop of perspiration the entire day. I was literally in tears of happiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product now for about 6 years and I still to this day don&#x27;t sweat a drop, it has quite literally changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear colored and light shirts now, I wear tighter shirts with confidence again. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. It took months before the burning from applying it subsided. I happily endured it every night and found it a small price to pay for dry pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things I&#x27;ve learned over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a shower and have clean and dry pits before you apply this. If you are still damp AT ALL, dont apply!!! This stuff is angered by water. If you apply it and still have deodorant on it vastly decreases its effectiveness. If you apply your standard deodorant directly over it the next morning the pain goes away. I don&#x27;t find the need to wash it off, just apply over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can usually get away with applying it every other day, but I&#x27;m so afraid of sweating I usually apply every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great, changed my life, pain goes away with time, don&#x27;t apply directly after a shower.orks great, changed my life, pain goes away with time, don&#x27;t apply directly after a shower.</li>
            <li> I use this every few days and it works amazingly well. I don&#x27;t have a sweating issue, but did find that deodorants kind of quit on me by the end of the day. This totally solves that problem, and now i don&#x27;t have to wash suit jackets every time I wear them.</li>
            <li> *&lt;br /&gt;(Please rate this review if you found it helpful)&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;let me say this, before this product, i&#x27;ve tried countless remedies to try to fix my sweating.  after this, which i only use 2 times  a week, i can wear anything i want and i wont sweat.  whats really crazy is that when i workout, my underarms barely perspire! THIS IS A MUST TRY ITEM if you suffer form underarm perspiration</li>
            <li> I am very happy to say this actually works. I have tried many different clinical strength antiperspirants and this is the only one that I don&#x27;t have to worry about wet underarms when I wear it. Great price too!</li>
            <li> This performs exactly as it is suppose to perform.  I have used many other products with no success - Not and issue here.  If you are tired of sweating in the pits, fed up with your cloth yellowing, get this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concern:  Stings when applied.  Bearable but need to note this.</li>
            <li> My son is using per directions where you apply the night before and he says it&#x27;s working great! In gym everything is perspiring except his pits! He couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> The pictures and descriptions on amazon have not been updated, the OLD formula for Certain Dri used to contain only three ingredients: Aluminum Chloride (Antiperspirant), Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), and Water. The &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; Certain Dri contains a bunch of added ingredients which have made the product completely useless. There are several other brands of clinical strength antiperspirants available but the only one that actually works is ZeroSweat. ZeroSweat is the only one that still contains just the three basic ingredients of Aluminum Chloride, Baking Soda and Water; all the other brands are loaded with too much junk to actually work effectively.&lt;br /&gt;And just an FYI: if you try ZeroSweat exactly according to directions and it does not work for you then you might have severe hyperhidrosis that may require something stronger. Drysol works on severe hyperhidrosis but it may only be available through prescription.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who sweats...a lot! This is the only thing that works, only if I use as directed and wear at night, my skin burns like crazy and leaves a rash, so I just use it in the morning after I shower and it keeps me dry all day long. After about 6 months, your body will get used to it and you may have to stop for a month or so, but I experience this with Shampoo and other antiperspirants all the time. I&#x27;m very in love with Certain Dri.</li>
            <li> I always feared the high five, anything that required me to lift my arms for the sweat stain and disgust that would follow. Up until I tried Certain Dri, I went through dozens of different anti-antiperspirants to no avail. I figured why not try this one, probably won&#x27;t work but whatever. I put it on the night I got it and I haven&#x27;t sweat since(other than pt of course ;) You just put it on once at a night, two or three strokes under each arm.The product soaks into your sweat pores and pretty much clogs them up. I highly recommend this product because of how much a difference it made for me. Buy it today and get one day shipping! Its totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Experienced a distinctly unpleasant burning sensation on the skin directly where I had applied it, which did not subside for quite some time. Also, on a few occasions I had forgotten to apply it in the evening so applied it in the morning instead, and subsequently noticed dark stains on my white undershirts as they come out of the wash, much worse than with ordinary anti-antiperspirants that have the same effect over time owing to the aluminum (the active ingredient in combating perspiration, apparently). My cursory examination of several products on the shelf at the drug store revealed that most contain 10-12% aluminum. This one list aluminum content as 20%, which probably means that its guaranteed to stain your clothes if you apply it the same day.</li>
            <li> I was using the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; anti-persperants such as dove, degree, etc and still sweating a lot. Certain dri is less expensive and has completely stopped my underarm wetness.</li>
            <li> Works! Stops me from sweating for about 5 days until I need to reapply.</li>
            <li> This has been the answer I&#x27;ve been looking for. I constantly had to deal with sweating and the embarrassment of ever lifting my arms up for anything. I&#x27;ve had people comment on it and this was a day to day thing. I&#x27;ve tried all the other brands out there claiming to fix the issue no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally tried this, same as the others, use before bed etc etc... Well now I have very minimal sweat spots! Give it a shot, if it works for you, and you were like me, the price is very minimal compared to the embarrassment! I went to the zoo, on a hot day, and nothing! (well sweating everywhere else, maybe I will try to use this all over my body... haha kidding).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, one note to make. If you&#x27;ve tried the bar version (solid) give this liquid one a try. The bar version didn&#x27;t work for me at all really... but this one did wonders!</li>
            <li> I have hypohydrosis and this product is the only thing that has worked to cut back on my sweating.  I highly recommend it.  Use it along with another deoderant as well, but this works as an EXCELLENT antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Previously I could change shirts and in less than 10 minutes I would start to sweat through it.  The day after I started using Certain Dri my shirts stayed completely dry.  I don&#x27;t even need undershirts anymore - that&#x27;s how well this stuff works.  Definitely give it a try.  It does itch a bit when you use it, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Have used this for about 10 years - Once you get the hang of using it at night and not every day can&#x27;t be beat</li>
            <li> Used to botox my pits, now I just use certain dri. $1200 vs $10.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that prevents hype for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you say it doesn&#x27;t work, just read how to use it. Put it on before you fall asleep, wake up and shower (or don&#x27;t) then put regular deodorant on. No sweat because of Certain Dri, no smell because of regular deodorant, no wet shirts and embarrassing telltale hype rings.</li>
            <li> I am a sweaty girl. Deodorant just doesn&#x27;t do the trick for me. I have been using this since 2008, and love it. I use it after the shower but not immediately. I wait for my skin to dry some first. Be sure to store upright so that the bottle doesn&#x27;t leak. Often I follow up application with secret for the scent and it helps reduce skin irritation that I think the certain dri alone causes. Other friend have tried this on my recommendation, and they now swear by it too.</li>
            <li> Yes, love this stuff like crazy.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, I had astronomical expectations for the sweat that was pouring from my armpits (I could literally watch the sweat bubble out minutes after putting on conventional antiperspirant/deodorant combos). I couldn&#x27;t wear shirts with sleeves or anything that came within six inches of my armpits. It was getting to the point where I couldn&#x27;t go to school and feel like I could raise my hand to ask or answer questions. After browsing the internet for a solution, I came upon Certain Dri Roll-On Antiperspirant. When I used it for the first time in February, I can honestly say that that was the best $8.00 I ever spent. It stopped all sweat. I was finally able to wear normal clothes again!! I used it every day for three and a half months which caused it to eat the layers of skin away in a red, burning rash. A couple of weeks ago, I decided to space out the applications from every morning to every three or four days. Needless to say, I still haven&#x27;t sweat a drop. To boost the effectiveness, I also bought the A.M. solid, and it works great. I recommend this product to ANYONE who has a perspiration problem. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
