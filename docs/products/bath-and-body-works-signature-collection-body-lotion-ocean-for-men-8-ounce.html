            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell of this is wonderful and refreshing however it isn&#x27;t powerful and doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s my favorite kit.</li>
            <li>love ocean.</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderfully scented lotion, I just wish the smell stayed longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments from it as well.</li>
            <li>i love the smell of this stuff</li>
            <li>my girlfriend and every girl at my school loves it on me lol thanks.</li>
            <li>I have.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my hands smooth and I&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>It does a good job as a lotion not greasy gets rid of ash and leaves your fingers feeling soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Four</li>
            <li>Smells great and is not really oily.</li>
            <li>stars because of price and smell fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and makes hands very soft and came early!!!</li>
            <li>The initial smell is kind of cheap and tacky, but once it dies down, it&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li>It so fast shipping and the lotion look like it a new bootle from a store that bought I love it</li>
            <li>My hands and body feel so soft for so long, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>It sticks around for a while, too, but isn&#x27;t cloying nor overbearing -- you&#x27;ll only smell it if it&#x27;s right in front of your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a LONG way, scent is NICE and goes well with both cologne and spray.</li>
            <li>Smell is wayyyyy too strong another waste of money.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty reminiscent of Nautica&#x27;s \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; cologne, which is A-OK in my book (not my favorite these days, but the inspiration for the scent could&#x27;ve been way worse.)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Price is a little high -- it&#x27;s on par with brands like Eucerin, but a lotion that costs half as much will likely cost you in inconveniences (such as getting lotion grease all over everything you touch!)</li>
            <li>could be a good thing or bad</li>

            <li> It goes on thin, dries quickly, and the moisture lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any reviews on lotion for men are real and it makes buying very hard since most stores fail to carry items for men these days.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue, which is probably my biggest complaint with lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guilty of smelling my arm from time to time just to get a wiff.</li>
