            <li>I love this nail art stamp image plate.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Your better off buying Bundle Monster plates.</li>
            <li>I love these for my nail art.</li>
            <li>Takes some practice, but i love these plates.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times and it works great!</li>
            <li>I think my favorite image is the bow.</li>
            <li>In case you&#x27;re wondering this is an authentic Konad plate.  </li>
            <li>i just love my konad will keep buying plates</li>
            <li>love to get more</li>
            <li>and I love these images</li>
            <li>I love my stamper.</li>
            <li>I love these designs.</li>
            <li>so it does a better job of transferring from the plate onto the stamp.</li>
            <li>It works great and the results look very professionally done</li>
            <li>This is a perfect plate to jazz up your stamping designs or just using it to create super cute french tips.</li>
            <li>forgot to order the special polishes!</li>
            <li>Works Greate easy to install</li>
            <li>Thank you for easy service.</li>
            <li>Super cute &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>It looks great, and the use of two different images allows the beginner some room for error.</li>
            <li>I loved the patterns on this image plate and thought I&#x27;d have fun stamping on these great patterns,  an almost wasted thought.  </li>
            <li>This is great to add to a french manicure.  </li>
            <li>and I just need to practice more getting things lined up right,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and makes nail designs easy and fun.</li>
            <li>I recommend painting the nail first with your favorite nail color.</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>Love the designs &amp; it lasts a good long time!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Any suggestions where to buy the cheapest special polishes for Konad stamping?</li>
            <li>It is worth spending more money to get a real Konad brand one!</li>
            <li>This plate is great, my favorites are the bow in the center and the swirl design.</li>
            <li>Also make sure you clean the image plate with nail polish remover after each use, I&#x27;ve found it to be useful to have a bit of nail polish remover on the plate when using it, it keeps the nail polish from drying out as fast</li>
            <li>Make a very interesting and unique twist for French Tips.</li>
            <li>Images come out and transfer clean and crisp!</li>
            <li>I love nail art and am very new to stamping</li>
            <li>I did recieve the two plates quickly though after I placed &amp; paid for the order.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is pretty good</li>
            <li>Obviously, works better with deeper-toned polishes, but try it with a metallic to get a cool effect too!</li>
            <li>It was messy, never looked that great and never was that bold-</li>
            <li>Always a clean and consistent stamping image</li>
            <li>but it was fun practicing</li>
            <li>I like Konad brand and its products because they are well made and offer a fun way for me to get my nails done at home.  </li>
            <li>100% worth it.</li>
            <li>all of them do, acutally, but they find it so simple to do and love the detailed prints they can wear on their nails.</li>
            <li>They came in the original packaging with the hologram sticker and when compared side by side with a knock off, the designs are bigger and etched with more detail.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>the print in the middle is absolutely beautiful when you have a red background</li>
            <li>think we (costumers) should be completely honest about our purchases so we can select the companies which provide a good service avoiding us of having trouble in the future.</li>
            <li>I got it super fast too.</li>
            <li>I will also admit that the KONAD brand plates definitely seem to come out better than the off-brand ones I bought.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This plate is awesome but too expensive</li>
            <li>It turns out really pretty once you stamp it.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I ordered and nothing was damaged.</li>
            <li>Rest assured, these plates from Eos Beauty are the real deal!  </li>
            <li>no complaints with Konad whatsoever, they are first rate</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>These are pretty designs, but some do not transfer well onto nails.</li>
            <li>Also, do I clean after each use with regular nail polish remover or must I purchase a special cleaner as well???</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a bunch of random designs for cheap, but when it comes to a super cute design like the ones on this plate, sometimes you have to make a little more of an investment.</li>
            <li>It prints out clean and clear like all the Konad plates.</li>
            <li>I personally recomend the center image in red when the nails are with a rose top coat!</li>
            <li>Also, not everyone that wants a tip stamp has this exact dimension stamping surface.</li>
            <li>Konad plate M56 is a french tip plate that is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the center design --the</li>
            <li>Either way, they were fast getting it out.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I think I really need to practice, but the patterns are not this defined in real.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had trouble with french manicures for a while now, since I can never really get the tips perfect</li>
            <li>I stamp the top part of my nail in the swirl pattern, using black polish.</li>
            <li>I love this stamp especially the bow in the middle!</li>
            <li>Grandchildren and friends can have fun with them for only the price of the nail polish since no stickers are used up.  </li>
            <li>Hello, I&#x27;m new to Konad stamping...</li>
            <li>I put black bows on top of a french manicure, and it looks very snazzy.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little hesitant to spend $5+ on a single plate since I had just bought a set of 25 plates for $10, but I am really glad that I did.</li>
            <li>The plates are expensive to start with, but with good care, you can use them forever.  </li>
            <li>I was overly excited &amp; thought one of the other kit I bought earlier had polish!</li>
            <li>french tips are classic</li>
            <li>Works with any type of nail polish, and I suggest using an old hotel room key card, or old gift card/credit card as the scrapper-</li>
            <li>I worried about whether this was authentic konad or not when I ordered since the knock off&#x27;s are poorly made and designs are smaller than the konad ones.  </li>
            <li>I use several other brands, but when it comes to the nail tip plates, I have to use Konad because they are large enough to cover my entire nail.</li>

            <li> At first I was a little hesitant to spend $5+ on a single plate since I had just bought a set of 25 plates for $10, but I am really glad that I did.</li>
            <li> The plates are expensive to start with, but with good care, you can use them forever.  </li>
            <li> I was overly excited &amp; thought one of the other kit I bought earlier had polish!</li>
            <li> french tips are classic</li>
            <li> Works with any type of nail polish, and I suggest using an old hotel room key card, or old gift card/credit card as the scrapper-</li>

            <li> Did the french with red tips and pink on the rest of the nail and then added a white bow under the red french tip.  </li>
            <li> Sometime the bow is hard to match up on your nail, but the rest work very well!</li>
            <li> One can achieve professional looking nails, with little skill.</li>
            <li> For extra bling, I added a rhinestone in the center of the bow.  </li>
            <li> For those who are beginning the art of stamping, I recommend this plate above all others, along with both the black and white Konad polish.</li>
            <li> I have not used this template (because I have other that I am presently using)</li>
            <li> Its kind of annoying how sometimes they come out crooked.</li>
            <li> Limited use.</li>
            <li> For the stamping, I bought Konad black and white.</li>
            <li> I love nail stamping, I&#x27;m getting a little crazy into it.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to use, as it took MANY, MANY tries to get the imprint onto the stamp, I&#x27;m disappointed, but not sure if it&#x27;s user error, though I followed all instructions.</li>
            <li> Spending a few extra dollars for quality, always pays off</li>
            <li> You still need to be careful when stamping</li>
            <li> Ive tryed other plates, yet konad has never faild when it came to printing an image on to my nail.</li>
            <li> so even if I did get it to work, it was pretty faint.</li>
            <li> I did not want to waste money experimenting, although some other reviewers say they use different thick polishes.</li>
            <li> I have been using the little swirly one with Konad special white polish and a beige base coat</li>
            <li> This was really a failed attempt at nail art-it only sort of worked and even then, that&#x27;s a stretch.</li>
            <li> I know some people have a hard time using them, but I do</li>
            <li> duh,</li>
            <li> My step mom turned me on to Konad, and while their topcoat is quite thick, we have both found that it leave air bubbles across the nail.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about these stamps is that I can&#x27;t get them to line up on my nails for my french manicure.</li>
            <li> I got tired of redoing my nails and gave up.</li>
            <li> so cant go wrong with it</li>

            <li> This worked perfectly and I love it. It is worth spending more money to get a real Konad brand one!</li>
            <li> I ordered two diffrent plates from this same company &amp; I....duh, forgot to order the special polishes! But I did today 5/10/11. So I&#x27;ll be stamping in no time; I hope. Sigh.... I did recieve the two plates quickly though after I placed &amp; paid for the order. Thats dandy w/me. But what a goof, now I have to wait for the polishes to arrive....ugh:\ I was overly excited &amp; thought one of the other kit I bought earlier had polish! Darn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions where to buy the cheapest special polishes for Konad stamping? Thx</li>
            <li> All the images are extremelly beautiful in the nail! I personally recomend the center image in red when the nails are with a rose top coat!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect plate to jazz up your stamping designs or just using it to create super cute french tips.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best image plates I&#x27;ve ever received from Konad! It works great and the results look very professionally done</li>
            <li> I recommend this product, the drawings are beautiful and are very well pass the nails, also used with the China Glaze nail and Konad, the nails are perfect</li>
            <li> Love it,, good product,, i would recommend it, works good, konad always have the best stamping plate,just the price should be cheaper</li>
            <li> For those who are beginning the art of stamping, I recommend this plate above all others, along with both the black and white Konad polish. One can achieve professional looking nails, with little skill. I recommend painting the nail first with your favorite nail color. (I like Sally Hansen Insta-Dri because you can work a bit quicker.) For the stamping, I bought Konad black and white. I did not want to waste money experimenting, although some other reviewers say they use different thick polishes. I stamp the top part of my nail in the swirl pattern, using black polish. Once that dries, I use S.H. Insta-Dri topcoat. Thirty seconds later I stamp the bow pattern in white and topcoat it. It looks great, and the use of two different images allows the beginner some room for error. I finish with another S.H. topcoat. My step mom turned me on to Konad, and while their topcoat is quite thick, we have both found that it leave air bubbles across the nail. Have fun!</li>
            <li> I love this stamp especially the bow in the middle! It&#x27;s s cute in every color! SO easy to stamp on as well!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little hesitant to spend $5+ on a single plate since I had just bought a set of 25 plates for $10, but I am really glad that I did. I fell in love with the center design --the one with the bow-- and it look great. I put black bows on top of a french manicure, and it looks very snazzy. I will also admit that the KONAD brand plates definitely seem to come out better than the off-brand ones I bought. Even the intricate designs come out amazing. It&#x27;s nice to have a bunch of random designs for cheap, but when it comes to a super cute design like the ones on this plate, sometimes you have to make a little more of an investment.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s easy to use and makes nail designs easy and fun. It took awhile to get placement of image on my nails right but it was fun practicing and I found several different ways of placing the image on my nail.</li>
            <li> I love this nail art stamp image plate. Of course Konad puts the best of nail art stamping image products out there on the market. Always a clean and consistent stamping image</li>
            <li> These plates scratch easily! I would use a plastic scraper not one with a metal blade. Also, not everyone that wants a tip stamp has this exact dimension stamping surface. Limited use.</li>
            <li> Super cute &amp; easy to use. Love the designs &amp; it lasts a good long time!!</li>
            <li> Authentic Konad plates for a fraction of the price? Yes, please! I ordered on Thursday, it was shipped on Friday &amp; I received it on Saturday! Of course the estimated arrival was Mon-Wed. Either way, they were fast getting it out. I haven&#x27;t tried the plate yet, but I can&#x27;t wait. I&#x27;d definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> I like Konad brand and its products because they are well made and offer a fun way for me to get my nails done at home.  I have not used this template (because I have other that I am presently using) but I can not wait to get my nails done with this art image plate.</li>
            <li> Works Greate easy to install</li>
            <li> This konad image plate like all others I have purchased is great! Images come out and transfer clean and crisp!</li>
            <li> This plate is simple enough for me to use. I absolutely love it. I got it super fast too. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good product for its price. My wife recommends. The item arrived on time and she a prompt service.&lt;br /&gt;I think we (costumers) should be completely honest about our purchases so we can select the companies which provide a good service avoiding us of having trouble in the future.</li>
            <li> Very nice designs. Works very well.  I love nail art and am very new to stamping and I found this very easy to use with great results</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to use, as it took MANY, MANY tries to get the imprint onto the stamp, I&#x27;m disappointed, but not sure if it&#x27;s user error, though I followed all instructions. Maybe you&#x27;ll do better, but it was a fail for me.</li>
            <li> This plate is awesome! However Konad plates are sooo overpriced! Your better off buying Bundle Monster plates. This plate is awesome but too expensive</li>
            <li> the print in the middle is absolutely beautiful when you have a red background and you use white for the bow and lines</li>
            <li> Konad plates are the best! I love these for my nail art. Ive tryed other plates, yet konad has never faild when it came to printing an image on to my nail. Takes some practice, but i love these plates.</li>
            <li> I love nail stamping, I&#x27;m getting a little crazy into it. This plate is great, my favorites are the bow in the center and the swirl design.</li>
            <li> Nice designs, but one needs so practice to place the stamp correctly on the tip of the nail.</li>
            <li> I loved the patterns on this image plate and thought I&#x27;d have fun stamping on these great patterns,  an almost wasted thought.  I purchased a scraper and stamper from another brand so I don&#x27;t know if that was an issue.  I think I really need to practice, but the patterns are not this defined in real.</li>
            <li> I love this plate! I have used it several times and it works great! I think my favorite image is the bow. It turns out really pretty once you stamp it.</li>
            <li> My Konad Stamping Nail Art Image Plate [[ASIN:B001LTVF7G Konad Stamping Nail Art Image Plate - M56]]arrived in a timely manner. The product was exactly what I ordered and nothing was damaged. Thank you for easy service.</li>
            <li> I love this image plate! Konad makes a great plate- that is really easy to use! Works with any type of nail polish, and I suggest using an old hotel room key card, or old gift card/credit card as the scrapper- it won&#x27;t scratch the metal.</li>
            <li> konad never fails to give good quality products! And this is no exception! Spending a few extra dollars for quality, always pays off</li>
            <li> In case you&#x27;re wondering this is an authentic Konad plate.  I worried about whether this was authentic konad or not when I ordered since the knock off&#x27;s are poorly made and designs are smaller than the konad ones.  Rest assured, these plates from Eos Beauty are the real deal!  They came in the original packaging with the hologram sticker and when compared side by side with a knock off, the designs are bigger and etched with more detail.  Nice price too! :D</li>
            <li> Love this designs!  Make a very interesting and unique twist for French Tips. The ivy one looks amazing when finished.  A must for Konad fans. 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> This is great to add to a french manicure.  I put the bow under where the smile line would be and it looks great.  Did the french with red tips and pink on the rest of the nail and then added a white bow under the red french tip.  For extra bling, I added a rhinestone in the center of the bow.  Looks great.  If I can figure out how to put a picture on Amazon, I&#x27;ll add it.</li>
            <li> i just love my konad will keep buying plates french tips are classic so cant go wrong with it love to get more</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good quality and I just need to practice more getting things lined up right, no complaints with Konad whatsoever, they are first rate and I love these images</li>
            <li> My daughter just loves this!!  ...all of them do, acutally, but they find it so simple to do and love the detailed prints they can wear on their nails.</li>
            <li> I love my stamper. I know some people have a hard time using them, but I do too sometimes I just take my time with them. If you have the stuff for stamping plates I would recamend this to them. The leafes one though doesn&#x27;t turn out all that good.</li>
            <li> Hello, I&#x27;m new to Konad stamping...does anyone know if any nail polish may be used on the plates or do I have to purchase the Konad nail polish as well??? Also, do I clean after each use with regular nail polish remover or must I purchase a special cleaner as well??? I just purchased the plates, but now need to figure out the rest. Thank you for your help.</li>
            <li> This was really a failed attempt at nail art-it only sort of worked and even then, that&#x27;s a stretch. It was messy, never looked that great and never was that bold-so even if I did get it to work, it was pretty faint. I&#x27;d say pass.</li>
            <li> I love these designs. This image plate is easy to use and has beautiful designs that you can add to a nice manicure.</li>
            <li> Works very well! Obviously, works better with deeper-toned polishes, but try it with a metallic to get a cool effect too! Sometime the bow is hard to match up on your nail, but the rest work very well!</li>
            <li> These are pretty designs, but some do not transfer well onto nails. I got tired of redoing my nails and gave up.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Konad plates! I use several other brands, but when it comes to the nail tip plates, I have to use Konad because they are large enough to cover my entire nail. I have been using the little swirly one with Konad special white polish and a beige base coat and I get so many compliments on it!</li>
            <li> The plates are expensive to start with, but with good care, you can use them forever.  Grandchildren and friends can have fun with them for only the price of the nail polish since no stickers are used up.  What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li> It did it&#x27;s job ! Arrived on time.  Works like a charm each and every time it is put to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with french manicures for a while now, since I can never really get the tips perfect so I decided to but this image plate, having bought the konad nail art kit a while ago. I tried it with one of my thicker polishes, I have to say it didn&#x27;t turn out as well as when I used the actual konad polishes, but it still works. You still need to be careful when stamping because I know from experience that it sometimes appear slanted and not the way you wanted it to look, but a bit of practice is all that is needed. Also make sure you clean the image plate with nail polish remover after each use, I&#x27;ve found it to be useful to have a bit of nail polish remover on the plate when using it, it keeps the nail polish from drying out as fast so it does a better job of transferring from the plate onto the stamp. Overall, this is pretty good and I bought it for a cheaper price on Amazon then the one I saw on its website.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about these stamps is that I can&#x27;t get them to line up on my nails for my french manicure. Its kind of annoying how sometimes they come out crooked. I do love to use the one with the bow on its own without the lines cuz its just so cute.</li>
            <li> Konad plate M56 is a french tip plate that is easy to use. It prints out clean and clear like all the Konad plates.</li>
