            <li> These little micro brushes allow me to place one drop at a time on the tip and apply to my lash line.  </li>
            <li> One drop instead of two and a lot less waste!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed because I thought I was getting 4 different colors but got all yellow.</li>

            <li> The sponge tips at the top of these brushes are way too small.  I don&#x27;t recommend these brushes.  I went back to using the Fera Micro Swabs from Long Lash Supplies.</li>

            <li> It was fast delivery but a little bummed I wasn&#x27;t getting one of each color as the picture shows; got all yellow, my least favorite color! Petty I know, but I&#x27;d like to receive what is pictured. Other companies specific right in the main description what color you&#x27;re getting. Oh well, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll still work for what I bought them for which is to apply glue to intricate die cuts.</li>
            <li> Perfect for getting into very small spaces. I re-design jewelry and these work perfect!!! Thank you.</li>
            <li> So many uses for these. I bought them to put glue on intricate diecuts when I am scrapbooking.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for crafting. Saw them used on a YouTube video and came directly here to purchase. Arrived quickly and 400 is a great value.</li>
            <li> great for building models</li>
            <li> Use this to clean my sewing machine.  Work great!</li>
            <li> I use these for my models. I use them for putty or CA glue or liquid glue. These are cheap compared to hobby shop brushes</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace the applicators that come with Latisse.  The Latisse brushes are big and absorb way too much of the product.  These little micro brushes allow me to place one drop at a time on the tip and apply to my lash line.  Plus they are hygienic!</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying glue in teeny places like diecuts!!!</li>
            <li> I received these microbrushes lightning fast from the seller with the colors as they appeared in the listing!  This order included two containers of medium microbrushes and two containers of large microbrushes.  These brushes are perfect for paint touch-ups and other hobby uses.  My wife can also use them if she needs to!</li>
            <li> Purchased these to use as &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; paint brushes in my craft work.  They are perfect for what I wanted them for.</li>
            <li> This is a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> Clever item, many uses for many of my crafting projects.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying blue but received yellow.  Not a problem.  The yellow is slightly smaller tip.  Site not clear on what you are getting.</li>
            <li> These lint free microbrushes are a great find for art projects. They are so much more actuate than fine paint brushes.  And are great for precise dots of glue. They are sturdy enough to get through an entire project.  I could wish they did show up as multi-colored as shown in description (mine are the bright yellow) but that is not enough to keep me from buying them again.</li>
