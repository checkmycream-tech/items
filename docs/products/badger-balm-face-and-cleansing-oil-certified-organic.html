            <li>This smells wonderful, more like lavender than rose I would say.</li>
            <li>It feels so good on my skin without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>so 1 oz is a good size to start with.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t use it often because it doesn&#x27;t feel as good as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Also good for knees, elbows, heels.</li>
            <li>(I have fairly oily skin</li>
            <li>I found it feels wonderful on my face and hands both, and it disappears quickly and does a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Ok - it is too soon to tell if I am going to have gorgeous skin from using this - LOL.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is great to find a good quality product without a huge price tag!</li>
            <li>Smells great , but the best part is it absorbs fast .</li>
            <li>It adds a gorgeous shine, conditions and gives my  hair a lovely fragrance!</li>

            <li>rose balm is amazing-</li>
            <li>Leaves your face nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have kind of an abnormal skin type-</li>
            <li>B0063NKM6K Damascus Rose</li>
            <li>Badger Damascus Rose Antioxidant Face Oil has become my go-to moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It works nicely and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li>* Best of all, it really</li>
            <li>I ordered it after using the Damascus Rose Face Sunscreen this spring and summer.</li>
            <li>In fact, I find myself preferring it to hand lotion on my hands, so I&#x27;m going to order the Damascus Rose Body Oil, too, and try that for my hands.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face at night, and it moisturizes nicely without being greasy.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, intensive moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The oil is easy to use and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>It is easy and pleasant to apply and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my full review of this great product at: myreallifereviews  .</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re not wanting the lovely rose smell of Damascus Rose..</li>
            <li>also absolutely love the rose element.</li>
            <li>All natural and smells great!!</li>
            <li>In the Winter however, it is a nice silky bed time moisturizer with a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this product,  I put it on at night after I use the Badger rose geranium face &amp; body soap bar.</li>
            <li>I think for someone with drier or more mature skin and also someone living in a drier climate, this could be an excellent product.</li>
            <li>It has a very high vibration and promotes radiance,smells great, and feels luxurious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE this oil, I&#x27;m 31</li>
            <li>Love this face oil.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I use Babo Botanicals sunscreen on top of it (and some face powder when I go out) and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>I assume there are too many essentials in the mixture.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite face oils.</li>
            <li>that I didn&#x27;t like better than this one.</li>
            <li>I love it ....</li>
            <li>Tried lotions and potions to make the redness better.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for more than two years.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Lovely mix of oils.  </li>
            <li>this is okay</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t do well with most products.</li>
            <li>I love badger sunscreen and aromatherapy tins</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d love this</li>
            <li>for some reason the oil loosens the pump on the top of the bottle</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product hardcore.  </li>
            <li>I love Badger :)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>It absorbs better than coconut oil too.</li>
            <li>but I use it nightly on my neck instead &amp; have noticed improvement; smoother skin, more elasticity.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell &amp; it leaves my skin feeling very moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy w purchase because my dry areas feel good.</li>
            <li>They all said the best you can really do/get is Retin-A cream (prescription only) at night and antioxidant and good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>so I was very happy to stumble across this oil.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate or is overpowered and feels great for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>My skin feels more supple, smooth, and soothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the product, which I ordered directly from Badger Balm.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>But the oil is very light and absorbs in quickly.  </li>
            <li>Its a wonderful moisturizer for my sensitive/ dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have started to notice the first signs of aging so its very important for me to keep my face hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>better.&lt;br /&gt;Really softens the skin and makes fine lines virtually disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is super hydrating!</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The rose oil is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I use under my night cr√®me, fantastic results with fine lines</li>
            <li>Too much lavender overpowers the rose.</li>
            <li>This formula is much lighter than the rose body oil.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and dewy, not greasy but with that glow,</li>
            <li>use this in addition to skinfood&#x27;s peach sake toner, and the combo is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel smooth and protected ...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like rose....</li>
            <li>That means it will be protected from light until I receive it, and I don&#x27;t keep it where it&#x27;s going to be light-damaged.</li>
            <li>This is a superior facial care product, for so many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This facial oil was okay, it seemed to absorb quickly and the scent was pleasant.</li>
            <li>Rose is such a healthy thing for your body.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous Face Oil,,, totally Organic and Toxin free.  </li>
            <li>I only give it 4 stars because I wish it smelled more of rose.</li>
            <li>To keep my dry, and sensitive skin moisturized, I use Damascus Rose oil together with castor oil (hexane-free).Works great for me.</li>
            <li>It absorbs super fast and goes on your face very creamy feeling surprisingly airy.</li>
            <li>Too much lavender!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lovely oil</li>
            <li>Like their body oil, very sensual and lovely.  </li>
            <li>Was not expecting to love this as much as I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to friends with dry skin issues when they ask what I use to keep my skin so nice!</li>
            <li>It does smell pretty strongly, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients look good and it smells lovely, but I find it way too harsh for my skin.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not overpowering and it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to many scented products.</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I used it nightly for 6-8 weeks without noticing any reduction in fine lines or wrinkles, but I don&#x27;t really expect anything aside from retinol products to work on that front.  </li>
            <li>The product floats freely moving about the box as the box is too large and the bubble cannot sustain it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>So far I am satisfied with this.</li>
            <li>a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>that said, I love Amazon for nearly all my online purchase . . .</li>
            <li>I have combination skin so finding the right moisturizer is a bit of a pain in the ass.</li>
            <li>It apply this right after shower after damping my face.</li>
            <li>My first bottle of Damascus Rose Face Oil is getting low.</li>
            <li>(I go through a lot of hand lotion/oil, so the body oil price is attractive, but basically even the face oil seems reasonably priced--a little goes a long way, and the pump top makes it easy to use just a</li>
            <li>The oil arrived quickly, but although Damascus Rose is in large letters and &amp;#34;with lavender and chamomile&amp;#34; is in small letters, the oil smells mostly of chamomile.</li>
            <li>Really I&#x27;m using it for a long-term effect (which I heard antioxidant oils are good to use for good skin down the road), so I&#x27;m not surprised that I don&#x27;t really notice a difference yet.</li>
            <li>It is very reasonably priced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only use cruelty free items and I love what the Badger company stands for, all natural quality ingredients,  food for your skin</li>
            <li>When I visited her recently, she told me how pleased she was with it.</li>
            <li>This winter has proven to be a very hydrated one!</li>
            <li>I would DEFINITELY buy this again :)</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>wish that the bottle was opaque to better protect the essential oils</li>
            <li>facial skin just keeps looking better and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my first amazon purchase, I have found retailers who offer this at a deeper discount.</li>
            <li>I used only one pump and the smell was lovely and it went on my skin like silk</li>
            <li>esthetician recommended that I prepare a strong green tea and add a few drops of rose oil in a spray bottle, then mist my face after cleansing and before moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While waiting for the Rose Absolu oil to arrive, I tried the badger face oil and saw immediate improvements in suppleness on my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a slightly floral scent, light and lovely.  </li>
            <li>I am able to use this oil both evening, under a heavy cream, as well as lightly in the morning.</li>
            <li>My eczema improved within 2 days back to clean radiant skin!  </li>
            <li>my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After two day of this rose oil I have less redness and my skin is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like it irritates my skin a bit, but my face is super sensitive</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft.  </li>
            <li>It also has a mild natural fragrance to it, but it did not make my skin irritated or break out.     </li>
            <li>pure, organic and healthful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not worried about the bottle being clear, because the box it comes in (which is very pretty) is opaque.</li>
            <li>so I am pretty familiar with different types of oils and</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my sister who is very fond of rose-scented items.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li>really made me break out.</li>
            <li>so I will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;(I thought it might be really greasy and stay greasy....</li>
            <li>and I really the scent.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need much at all.  </li>
            <li>I think this will really help to delay the aging of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I took one star off because the blend of oils doesn&#x27;t smell much like roses.</li>
            <li>Does not take much to use.  </li>
            <li>but it went on very matte).</li>
            <li>the other reviewer said, the oil smells lovely.</li>
            <li>I really see my skin looks and feels much better than it has in years, and for much less $.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>That has not happened with any other product I have used, so I can definitely attribute these effects to the Badger Damsascus Rose Oil.</li>
            <li>I have stuck to my skin care routine (wash with Dr. Bronners Almond and tone with Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel toner) for many years but recently noticed my skin feeling a little dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I put just one pump on at night and by morning my skin is soft and smooth without any oily or dry patches.</li>
            <li>it gives my skin a healthy glow, which is no easy task.</li>
            <li>It may be environmental (I live in Los Angeles)</li>
            <li>I am not allergic to it so far although my face skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>The bottle is clear, and typically oils are stored in colored bottles to eliminate UV and light damage.  </li>
            <li>and I wear it at night with the Badher beauty balm under my eyes, wake up to soft hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>It is not oily and keeps my face looking natural all day.</li>
            <li>But my eyes are sensitive to it and wearing it does irritate them.</li>
            <li>Just try not to get it near eyes.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face really soft and it does not make it so shiny like</li>
            <li>It contains all organic, natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a lovely, pleasing and delicate scent.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel nourished and soft, and has a calming effect.     </li>
            <li>Bonus it is made with all natural, organic ingredients.     </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good face oil that wasn&#x27;t too expensive and that was organic.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it is very light.</li>
            <li>I saw a few dermatologists (I wanted to be certain) and learned that most of these high-end products have harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Not like gross fake rose smell but like real roses.</li>
            <li>I certainly does soften and help my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make a difference if I go to bed with a clean or dirty face, my skin feels lovely the next morning.</li>
            <li>It does help keep my face moisturized all day long, but now its hot outside so it may be that.  </li>
            <li>It does not make my skin breakout, does not have a strong odor and does not affect my skin in any negative way.</li>
            <li>Even with using it as often as I do, I still was able to use it for 1 1/2 or so months before running out-great usage for such a small bottle!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and a normal to combination skin type (some oily spots in the summer, some dry patches in the winter), and I have been using this as a nighttime moisturizer for about a month now.     </li>
            <li>Though I would not necessarily go so far as to call it a &amp;#34;miracle worker,&amp;#34; I certainly noticed an improvement on the overall look and feeling of my face.</li>
            <li>After using it for serveral weeks, my skin is relatively clear, smoother and my pores are noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times in the last week and I like it.</li>
            <li>or it could be age related (27 years old) but</li>
            <li>A few drops go a long way, making this a very economical way to pamper myself.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re just a tad dry (or normal), then I would use this under a lighter hydrator-</li>
            <li>I used to use Kiehl&#x27;s and other high-end skincare lines but after years of on and off skin quality and so much money I decided it&#x27;s time for a change.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I am prone to breakouts, but since switching from lotions with 50+ ingredients to using natural oils I have had much fewer breakouts, my skin looks healthier in general, and the few dry spots I have had basically disappeared.</li>
            <li>Have tried other oils that are advertised as light but are really heavy on the skin.  </li>

            <li> Great for nighttime under moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Also, great to put on at night.  </li>
            <li> BUT I have incorporated this into my routine in a way that it works great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to get more!!</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful, more like lavender than rose I would say.</li>
            <li> It feels so good on my skin without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> so 1 oz is a good size to start with.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t use it often because it doesn&#x27;t feel as good as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Also good for knees, elbows, heels.</li>
            <li> (I have fairly oily skin</li>
            <li> I found it feels wonderful on my face and hands both, and it disappears quickly and does a good job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Ok - it is too soon to tell if I am going to have gorgeous skin from using this - LOL.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is great to find a good quality product without a huge price tag!</li>
            <li> Smells great , but the best part is it absorbs fast .</li>
            <li> It adds a gorgeous shine, conditions and gives my  hair a lovely fragrance!</li>
            <li> I read good stuff about rose oil and wanted to try this.</li>
            <li> Okay 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I love badger brand!</li>
            <li> This oil is so lovely!  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;ll be much better for the environment!</li>
            <li> and this makes my face feel amazing.</li>
            <li> This oil is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> rose balm is amazing-</li>
            <li> Leaves your face nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have kind of an abnormal skin type-</li>
            <li> B0063NKM6K Damascus Rose</li>
            <li> Badger Damascus Rose Antioxidant Face Oil has become my go-to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It works nicely and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> * Best of all, it really</li>
            <li> I ordered it after using the Damascus Rose Face Sunscreen this spring and summer.</li>
            <li> In fact, I find myself preferring it to hand lotion on my hands, so I&#x27;m going to order the Damascus Rose Body Oil, too, and try that for my hands.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face at night, and it moisturizes nicely without being greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, intensive moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The oil is easy to use and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> It is easy and pleasant to apply and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my full review of this great product at: myreallifereviews  .</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re not wanting the lovely rose smell of Damascus Rose..</li>
            <li> also absolutely love the rose element.</li>
            <li> All natural and smells great!!</li>
            <li> In the Winter however, it is a nice silky bed time moisturizer with a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> I love this product,  I put it on at night after I use the Badger rose geranium face &amp; body soap bar.</li>
            <li> I think for someone with drier or more mature skin and also someone living in a drier climate, this could be an excellent product.</li>
            <li> It has a very high vibration and promotes radiance,smells great, and feels luxurious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil, I&#x27;m 31</li>
            <li> Love this face oil.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I use Babo Botanicals sunscreen on top of it (and some face powder when I go out) and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> I assume there are too many essentials in the mixture.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite face oils.</li>
            <li> that I didn&#x27;t like better than this one.</li>
            <li> I love it ....</li>
            <li> Tried lotions and potions to make the redness better.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for more than two years.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Lovely mix of oils.  </li>
            <li> this is okay</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t do well with most products.</li>
            <li> I love badger sunscreen and aromatherapy tins</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d love this</li>
            <li> for some reason the oil loosens the pump on the top of the bottle</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product hardcore.  </li>
            <li> I love Badger :)</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> It absorbs better than coconut oil too.</li>
            <li> but I use it nightly on my neck instead &amp; have noticed improvement; smoother skin, more elasticity.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It has a great smell &amp; it leaves my skin feeling very moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy w purchase because my dry areas feel good.</li>
            <li> They all said the best you can really do/get is Retin-A cream (prescription only) at night and antioxidant and good sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> so I was very happy to stumble across this oil.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate or is overpowered and feels great for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> My skin feels more supple, smooth, and soothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the product, which I ordered directly from Badger Balm.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> But the oil is very light and absorbs in quickly.  </li>
            <li> Its a wonderful moisturizer for my sensitive/ dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have started to notice the first signs of aging so its very important for me to keep my face hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> better.&lt;br /&gt;Really softens the skin and makes fine lines virtually disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is super hydrating!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The rose oil is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> I use under my night cr√®me, fantastic results with fine lines</li>
            <li> Too much lavender overpowers the rose.</li>
            <li> This formula is much lighter than the rose body oil.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smooth and dewy, not greasy but with that glow,</li>
            <li> use this in addition to skinfood&#x27;s peach sake toner, and the combo is fabulous.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel smooth and protected ...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like rose....</li>
            <li> That means it will be protected from light until I receive it, and I don&#x27;t keep it where it&#x27;s going to be light-damaged.</li>
            <li> This is a superior facial care product, for so many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This facial oil was okay, it seemed to absorb quickly and the scent was pleasant.</li>
            <li> Rose is such a healthy thing for your body.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous Face Oil,,, totally Organic and Toxin free.  </li>
            <li> I only give it 4 stars because I wish it smelled more of rose.</li>
            <li> To keep my dry, and sensitive skin moisturized, I use Damascus Rose oil together with castor oil (hexane-free).Works great for me.</li>
            <li> It absorbs super fast and goes on your face very creamy feeling surprisingly airy.</li>
            <li> Too much lavender!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lovely oil</li>
            <li> Like their body oil, very sensual and lovely.  </li>
            <li> Was not expecting to love this as much as I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to friends with dry skin issues when they ask what I use to keep my skin so nice!</li>
            <li> It does smell pretty strongly, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients look good and it smells lovely, but I find it way too harsh for my skin.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not overpowering and it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to many scented products.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I used it nightly for 6-8 weeks without noticing any reduction in fine lines or wrinkles, but I don&#x27;t really expect anything aside from retinol products to work on that front.  </li>
            <li> The product floats freely moving about the box as the box is too large and the bubble cannot sustain it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with this.</li>
            <li> a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> that said, I love Amazon for nearly all my online purchase . . .</li>
            <li> I have combination skin so finding the right moisturizer is a bit of a pain in the ass.</li>
            <li> It apply this right after shower after damping my face.</li>
            <li> My first bottle of Damascus Rose Face Oil is getting low.</li>
            <li> (I go through a lot of hand lotion/oil, so the body oil price is attractive, but basically even the face oil seems reasonably priced--a little goes a long way, and the pump top makes it easy to use just a</li>
            <li> The oil arrived quickly, but although Damascus Rose is in large letters and &amp;#34;with lavender and chamomile&amp;#34; is in small letters, the oil smells mostly of chamomile.</li>
            <li> Really I&#x27;m using it for a long-term effect (which I heard antioxidant oils are good to use for good skin down the road), so I&#x27;m not surprised that I don&#x27;t really notice a difference yet.</li>
            <li> It is very reasonably priced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only use cruelty free items and I love what the Badger company stands for, all natural quality ingredients,  food for your skin</li>
            <li> When I visited her recently, she told me how pleased she was with it.</li>
            <li> This winter has proven to be a very hydrated one!</li>
            <li> I would DEFINITELY buy this again :)</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> wish that the bottle was opaque to better protect the essential oils</li>
            <li> facial skin just keeps looking better and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my first amazon purchase, I have found retailers who offer this at a deeper discount.</li>
            <li> I used only one pump and the smell was lovely and it went on my skin like silk</li>
            <li> esthetician recommended that I prepare a strong green tea and add a few drops of rose oil in a spray bottle, then mist my face after cleansing and before moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While waiting for the Rose Absolu oil to arrive, I tried the badger face oil and saw immediate improvements in suppleness on my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a slightly floral scent, light and lovely.  </li>
            <li> I am able to use this oil both evening, under a heavy cream, as well as lightly in the morning.</li>
            <li> My eczema improved within 2 days back to clean radiant skin!  </li>
            <li> my skin is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After two day of this rose oil I have less redness and my skin is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like it irritates my skin a bit, but my face is super sensitive</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft.  </li>
            <li> It also has a mild natural fragrance to it, but it did not make my skin irritated or break out.     </li>
            <li> pure, organic and healthful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not worried about the bottle being clear, because the box it comes in (which is very pretty) is opaque.</li>
            <li> so I am pretty familiar with different types of oils and</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister who is very fond of rose-scented items.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> really made me break out.</li>
            <li> so I will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;(I thought it might be really greasy and stay greasy....</li>
            <li> and I really the scent.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much at all.  </li>
            <li> I think this will really help to delay the aging of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I took one star off because the blend of oils doesn&#x27;t smell much like roses.</li>
            <li> Does not take much to use.  </li>
            <li> but it went on very matte).</li>
            <li> the other reviewer said, the oil smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I really see my skin looks and feels much better than it has in years, and for much less $.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> That has not happened with any other product I have used, so I can definitely attribute these effects to the Badger Damsascus Rose Oil.</li>
            <li> I have stuck to my skin care routine (wash with Dr. Bronners Almond and tone with Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel toner) for many years but recently noticed my skin feeling a little dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I put just one pump on at night and by morning my skin is soft and smooth without any oily or dry patches.</li>
            <li> it gives my skin a healthy glow, which is no easy task.</li>
            <li> It may be environmental (I live in Los Angeles)</li>
            <li> I am not allergic to it so far although my face skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> The bottle is clear, and typically oils are stored in colored bottles to eliminate UV and light damage.  </li>
            <li> and I wear it at night with the Badher beauty balm under my eyes, wake up to soft hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> It is not oily and keeps my face looking natural all day.</li>
            <li> But my eyes are sensitive to it and wearing it does irritate them.</li>
            <li> Just try not to get it near eyes.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face really soft and it does not make it so shiny like</li>
            <li> It contains all organic, natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a lovely, pleasing and delicate scent.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel nourished and soft, and has a calming effect.     </li>
            <li> Bonus it is made with all natural, organic ingredients.     </li>
            <li> I was looking for a good face oil that wasn&#x27;t too expensive and that was organic.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it is very light.</li>
            <li> I saw a few dermatologists (I wanted to be certain) and learned that most of these high-end products have harsh ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Not like gross fake rose smell but like real roses.</li>
            <li> I certainly does soften and help my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a difference if I go to bed with a clean or dirty face, my skin feels lovely the next morning.</li>
            <li> It does help keep my face moisturized all day long, but now its hot outside so it may be that.  </li>
            <li> It does not make my skin breakout, does not have a strong odor and does not affect my skin in any negative way.</li>
            <li> Even with using it as often as I do, I still was able to use it for 1 1/2 or so months before running out-great usage for such a small bottle!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a normal to combination skin type (some oily spots in the summer, some dry patches in the winter), and I have been using this as a nighttime moisturizer for about a month now.     </li>
            <li> Though I would not necessarily go so far as to call it a &amp;#34;miracle worker,&amp;#34; I certainly noticed an improvement on the overall look and feeling of my face.</li>
            <li> After using it for serveral weeks, my skin is relatively clear, smoother and my pores are noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times in the last week and I like it.</li>
            <li> or it could be age related (27 years old) but</li>
            <li> A few drops go a long way, making this a very economical way to pamper myself.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re just a tad dry (or normal), then I would use this under a lighter hydrator-</li>
            <li> I used to use Kiehl&#x27;s and other high-end skincare lines but after years of on and off skin quality and so much money I decided it&#x27;s time for a change.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I am prone to breakouts, but since switching from lotions with 50+ ingredients to using natural oils I have had much fewer breakouts, my skin looks healthier in general, and the few dry spots I have had basically disappeared.</li>
            <li> Have tried other oils that are advertised as light but are really heavy on the skin.  </li>
            <li> All the dry red patches on my face disappeared so the next morning I woke up to a soft even complexion with zero dry spots!</li>
            <li> The Rose oil absorbs quickly and helps prevent the awful chapping that plagues me in the winter.</li>
            <li> /sever dry skin recently.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant (and live in the desert) and had a crazy battle with eczema</li>
            <li> A little bit oily, but the skin is so natural after.</li>
            <li> a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> little definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love what it does for my skin, especially during the brutal low temps we are dealing with.</li>
            <li> I tend to break out, but I also have a very dry surface, that actually flakes without a lot of heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, as well a lot of other areas.  </li>
            <li> I did break out a little the first few days I tried this, although I don&#x27;t know if it was what caused the small break out.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and sinks  without being too greasy.</li>
            <li> but not really like roses.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way-</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.    </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t sink in the way other oils do.  </li>
            <li> I guess that is due to the lavender and chamomile.</li>
            <li> Based on what the other reviewer said, I&#x27;ve thought twice about ordering it here.</li>
            <li> In addition to my skin, I also use the oil on my hair, rubbing a few drops between my hands, and then running my hands through my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I cant remember the last winter where I didn&#x27;t have dull, peeling skin.</li>
            <li> All the ingredients are organic which is a pro and a little goes a long way, so while the bottle is not huge, I have been using it almost everyday and it will probably last 3-4 months at least.</li>
            <li> and I think even slightly oily skin would fare well with this by itself.</li>
            <li> The picture shown makes this oil look deceptively small however the body is quite wide bodied</li>
            <li> A little goes</li>
            <li> Just received this little beauty today.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little to heavy for my face</li>
            <li> A little too heavy for my face</li>
            <li> Living in Florida, it is a little too heavy for use in the humid Summer months.  </li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t feel that it moisturized my skin enough, especially now that the weather has turned cold and</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to unscented lotion for my hands and body.</li>
            <li> That might be a contributing factor, or at least it tells me the company isn&#x27;t as careful as it should be about packaging its nourishing</li>
            <li> Not overpowering or harsh on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have particularly dry skin that seems to be getting worse as I age and also have symptoms of rosacea on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I was missing!  </li>

            <li> To keep my dry, and sensitive skin moisturized, I use Damascus Rose oil together with castor oil (hexane-free).Works great for me.</li>
            <li> Too much lavender!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lovely oil if you&#x27;re not wanting the lovely rose smell of Damascus Rose.. Too much lavender overpowers the rose. I won&#x27;t buy this product again. Almost false advertising.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this makes my face feel amazing. It smells wonderful. Not like gross fake rose smell but like real roses. Not too strong.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this oil. I love what it does for my skin, especially during the brutal low temps we are dealing with. In addition to my skin, I also use the oil on my hair, rubbing a few drops between my hands, and then running my hands through my dry hair. It adds a gorgeous shine, conditions and gives my  hair a lovely fragrance! I add a few drops to unscented lotion for my hands and body. The Rose oil absorbs quickly and helps prevent the awful chapping that plagues me in the winter. A few drops go a long way, making this a very economical way to pamper myself. I have recommended this to friends with dry skin issues when they ask what I use to keep my skin so nice!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil, I&#x27;m 31 and I wear it at night with the Badher beauty balm under my eyes, wake up to soft hydrated skin. I only use cruelty free items and I love what the Badger company stands for, all natural quality ingredients,  food for your skin</li>
            <li> an excellent product. I use under my night cr√®me, fantastic results with fine lines</li>
            <li> This oil is absolutely amazing. I have particularly dry skin that seems to be getting worse as I age and also have symptoms of rosacea on my cheeks. I am able to use this oil both evening, under a heavy cream, as well as lightly in the morning. Though I would not necessarily go so far as to call it a &amp;#34;miracle worker,&amp;#34; I certainly noticed an improvement on the overall look and feeling of my face. It is smoother, softer, and overall healthier-looking. Even with using it as often as I do, I still was able to use it for 1 1/2 or so months before running out-great usage for such a small bottle!</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m in love !!! This is the best thing ever for your face !!! I&#x27;m going to get more!! Thank you badger !!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sister who is very fond of rose-scented items.  When I visited her recently, she told me how pleased she was with it.</li>
            <li> Love this face oil. I put it on at night before I go to bed. Leaves your face nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Has been a wonder for my skin&#x27;s tone and acne prone-ness. I go nowhere without it now. It does not make my skin breakout, does not have a strong odor and does not affect my skin in any negative way. it&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good face oil that wasn&#x27;t too expensive and that was organic. This stuff is awesome. I use one pump each morning under my spf and it smoothes everything out and pumps my skin up.  Non greasy and smells like roses but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin so finding the right moisturizer is a bit of a pain in the ass. However, this oil may have solved that problem. I put just one pump on at night and by morning my skin is soft and smooth without any oily or dry patches. It doesn&#x27;t make a difference if I go to bed with a clean or dirty face, my skin feels lovely the next morning.</li>
            <li> Love it but it&#x27;s a little to heavy for my face so I use it as a body oil</li>
            <li> This formula is much lighter than the rose body oil. It absorbs super fast and goes on your face very creamy feeling surprisingly airy. I worried I would break out from it but didn&#x27;t. All the dry red patches on my face disappeared so the next morning I woke up to a soft even complexion with zero dry spots! I can&#x27;t believe how different the texture of my skin felt afterwards this is super hydrating! If you want to try a face oil but not one of the herbal scent ones this is an excellent alternative. Your face will not reek of roses! This oil is very subtle so you will not be gagging from the scent if you use it as a night cream like I did. I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> I used to use Kiehl&#x27;s and other high-end skincare lines but after years of on and off skin quality and so much money I decided it&#x27;s time for a change.  I saw a few dermatologists (I wanted to be certain) and learned that most of these high-end products have harsh ingredients.  They all said the best you can really do/get is Retin-A cream (prescription only) at night and antioxidant and good sunscreen.  I found this Badger Rose Face Oil on EWG with 0 rating (excellent).  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2-3 weeks now and I see my skin looks and feels hydrated.  I use Babo Botanicals sunscreen on top of it (and some face powder when I go out) and that&#x27;s it.  My skin looks smooth and dewy, not greasy but with that glow, if you know what I mean.  I really see my skin looks and feels much better than it has in years, and for much less $.  I&#x27;m not going back and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Looove this oil!! I have kind of an abnormal skin type- I tend to break out, but I also have a very dry surface, that actually flakes without a lot of heavy moisturizer. This oil underneath the badger rose balm is amazing- it gives my skin a healthy glow, which is no easy task. However, if you&#x27;re just a tad dry (or normal), then I would use this under a lighter hydrator- and I think even slightly oily skin would fare well with this by itself. Oil is actually great for combating oil, believe it or not.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in addition to skinfood&#x27;s peach sake toner, and the combo is fabulous. I cant remember the last winter where I didn&#x27;t have dull, peeling skin. This winter has proven to be a very hydrated one! I will be a repeat customer from here on out!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this face oil.  It feels so good on my skin without being greasy.  After washing my face, I apply it at night as a night oil.  In the day, I mix a smaller amount with MyChelle Sun Shield for moisture and protection during the day.</li>
            <li> A little bit oily, but the skin is so natural after.</li>
            <li> The ingredients look good and it smells lovely, but I find it way too harsh for my skin.  I assume there are too many essentials in the mixture.  It leave my face tingling in a way that naturals should not and it doesn&#x27;t sink in the way other oils do.  I decided to use it as a body moisturizer to use it up, and it also makes my arms burn. The bottle is clear, and typically oils are stored in colored bottles to eliminate UV and light damage.  That might be a contributing factor, or at least it tells me the company isn&#x27;t as careful as it should be about packaging its nourishing oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the company and I like their sunscreen.  I was disappointing by this product.  [[ASIN:B0063NKM6K Damascus Rose Face Oil - 1 oz - Oil]]</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite face oils. It has a mix of great for skin oils that absorbs well and makes my skin glow. There are a number of brand name oils that retail $50+ that I didn&#x27;t like better than this one.</li>
            <li> I love it .... It makes my face feel smooth and protected ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant (and live in the desert) and had a crazy battle with eczema/sever dry skin recently.  I have been doing the Oil Cleansing Method and using this as my moisturizer afterward.  My eczema improved within 2 days back to clean radiant skin!  It has a slightly floral scent, light and lovely.  Feels great and has helped me get that &amp;#34;pregnancy&amp;#34; glow I was missing!  A little bit goes a long way- so 1 oz is a good size to start with.</li>
            <li> really made me break out. my skin is super sensitive. smells beautiful, though.</li>
            <li> Tried lotions and potions to make the redness better.  IN the winter my redness actually stings!&lt;br /&gt;After two day of this rose oil I have less redness and my skin is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope with enough time the redness will be reduced.  Either way, though, its the best that I have tried so I will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;(I thought it might be really greasy and stay greasy....but it doesn&#x27;t...my skin soaks it up.</li>
            <li> While I have tried the body oil, the face oil for me is the one that shines out. A little goes a long way and it is very light. Lighter than the body oil actually. I know that this will last me for some months. It apply this right after shower after damping my face. It is not oily and keeps my face looking natural all day.</li>
            <li> This facial oil was okay, it seemed to absorb quickly and the scent was pleasant. I just didn&#x27;t feel that it moisturized my skin enough, especially now that the weather has turned cold and the heat has been turned on.  I gave it to my mom who loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Its a wonderful moisturizer for my sensitive/ dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have started to notice the first signs of aging so its very important for me to keep my face hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I also absolutely love the rose element. Rose is such a healthy thing for your body. It has a very high vibration and promotes radiance,smells great, and feels luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;It does not cloy.</li>
            <li> I certainly does soften and help my dry skin. But my eyes are sensitive to it and wearing it does irritate them. So I can only wear it a night.</li>
            <li> Badger Damascus Rose Antioxidant Face Oil has become my go-to moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to many scented products. I&#x27;ve used this for more than two years. It&#x27;s quickly absorbed. The smell is not overpowering and it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my face but its NOT breaking me out. My face smells like roses, alittle goes along way. I&#x27;m happy w purchase because my dry areas feel good. Hmm guess that is noticing a difference! Okay 4 stars!</li>
            <li> Like their body oil, very sensual and lovely.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and face feels great!</li>
            <li> Just tried it this evening and I really the scent. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or is overpowered and feels great for my sensitive skin! The oil gave me that luxurious feel as I message the oil in. I would DEFINITELY buy this again :)</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. All natural and smells great!! I use in conjunction with Badger Rose Balm, also a wonderful product. Moisturizes and sinks  without being too greasy.</li>
            <li> Great for nighttime under moisturizer.  Especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> My mom, at 90, swears by it.  Lovely mix of oils.  Just try not to get it near eyes.  These are OILS!!!!  Also, great to put on at night.  I mix it with my night cream.</li>
            <li> this is okay, I don&#x27;t use it often because it doesn&#x27;t feel as good as I thought it would. I feel like it irritates my skin a bit, but my face is super sensitive so I don&#x27;t do well with most products. I love badger sunscreen and aromatherapy tins so I thought I&#x27;d love this but I don&#x27;t. for some reason the oil loosens the pump on the top of the bottle so when I traveled with it... it dumped out all over and it constantly unscrews. it&#x27;s a little silly but also annoying. you think they&#x27;d notice the bottles never seem to shut all the way at their factory.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, as well a lot of other areas.  This is about the only oil that will make a difference with my face - otherwise I have patchy, scaly skin; but not with this oil!  Yeh!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product hardcore.  I like it.  I use OCM nightly to wash my face so I am pretty familiar with different types of oils and how they soak in to my skin.  I wanted to get a product that I could use in my morning routine for some extra moisture because traditional face lotions irritate my skin, but also wouldn&#x27;t leave me looking like I rubbed oil all over my face.  This face oil almost does the trick.  My only complaint is, when used alone, the texture is a bit &#x27;tacky&#x27; and leaves random shiny spots on my face where the oil got &#x27;stuck&#x27; as I was applying it.  BUT I have incorporated this into my routine in a way that it works great.  I have the Benton Soothing Aloe Propolis Gel and mix one pump of each together.  I use this as my AM moisturizer under my sunscreen and it has been wonderful.  My skin is super soft.  I love Badger :)</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful, more like lavender than rose I would say. All the ingredients are organic which is a pro and a little goes a long way, so while the bottle is not huge, I have been using it almost everyday and it will probably last 3-4 months at least. I put some on after my shower. My skin is sensitive and I am prone to breakouts, but since switching from lotions with 50+ ingredients to using natural oils I have had much fewer breakouts, my skin looks healthier in general, and the few dry spots I have had basically disappeared. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Ok - it is too soon to tell if I am going to have gorgeous skin from using this - LOL.  But the oil is very light and absorbs in quickly.  Don&#x27;t need much at all.  Have tried other oils that are advertised as light but are really heavy on the skin.  Smell okay but not really like roses.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous Face Oil,,, totally Organic and Toxin free.  I love badger brand!</li>
            <li> I was using coconut oil for the longest time as a skin moisturizer but it always made me break out. I read good stuff about rose oil and wanted to try this. So far I&#x27;ve used it about 5 times in the last week and I like it. It makes my face really soft and it does not make it so shiny like coconut oil does. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like rose....I guess that is due to the lavender and chamomile. It absorbs better than coconut oil too. So far I am satisfied with this. I only give it 4 stars because I wish it smelled more of rose.</li>
            <li> This oil is so lovely!  I have stuck to my skin care routine (wash with Dr. Bronners Almond and tone with Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel toner) for many years but recently noticed my skin feeling a little dry and sensitive.  It may be environmental (I live in Los Angeles) or it could be age related (27 years old) but either way I wanted a product to moisturize my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a very difficult time finding a product that did not contain toxic ingredients so I was very happy to stumble across this oil.  I now use this oil every night after washing and toning and have noticed such a difference in my skin (noticed immediate results and continued results after now using for about 2 weeks).  I use one pump and it is ample to cover my entire face (including eye area and lips) and neck.  I think this will really help to delay the aging of my skin.  My skin feels more supple, smooth, and soothed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the bottle was opaque to better protect the essential oils but I think at the rate that I use this the bottle will be gone before the product would begin to be degraded.  Also, it is great to find a good quality product without a huge price tag!</li>
            <li> It does smell pretty strongly, but you get used to it. It works nicely and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very good , I loved it!!</li>
            <li> The oil is easy to use and has a pleasant smell.  It does help keep my face moisturized all day long, but now its hot outside so it may be that.  I guess its doing what its supposed.  I&#x27;m not really sure.  I always use it with my moisturizer w/ SPF during the day and with a retinoid cream at night, so not sure if its doing what its supposed to.  Really I&#x27;m using it for a long-term effect (which I heard antioxidant oils are good to use for good skin down the road), so I&#x27;m not surprised that I don&#x27;t really notice a difference yet.</li>
            <li> This is a superior facial care product, for so many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It contains all organic, natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is easy and pleasant to apply and absorbs well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A little goes a LONG way.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been using my 1 oz. bottle for almost two months, every night and it&#x27;s still over 1/2 full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It has a lovely, pleasing and delicate scent. Not overpowering or harsh on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Best of all, it really works!&lt;br /&gt;My facial skin just keeps looking better and better.&lt;br /&gt;Really softens the skin and makes fine lines virtually disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read my full review of this great product at: myreallifereviews  . com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The rose oil is absorbed quickly. I am not allergic to it so far although my face skin is very sensitive. The smell is also very good.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived quickly, but although Damascus Rose is in large letters and &amp;#34;with lavender and chamomile&amp;#34; is in small letters, the oil smells mostly of chamomile.</li>
            <li> My only recommendation is smaller packaging. The product floats freely moving about the box as the box is too large and the bubble cannot sustain it. Plus it&#x27;ll be much better for the environment!</li>
            <li> pure, organic and healthful. a bit pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it. you get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> A little too heavy for my face but I use it nightly on my neck instead &amp; have noticed improvement; smoother skin, more elasticity. Also good for knees, elbows, heels. I took one star off because the blend of oils doesn&#x27;t smell much like roses.</li>
            <li> Was not expecting to love this as much as I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An esthetician recommended that I prepare a strong green tea and add a few drops of rose oil in a spray bottle, then mist my face after cleansing and before moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While waiting for the Rose Absolu oil to arrive, I tried the badger face oil and saw immediate improvements in suppleness on my face and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my first amazon purchase, I have found retailers who offer this at a deeper discount. If you are reluctant for price concerns, keep searching. that said, I love Amazon for nearly all my online purchase . . .</li>
            <li> I did break out a little the first few days I tried this, although I don&#x27;t know if it was what caused the small break out. After using it for serveral weeks, my skin is relatively clear, smoother and my pores are noticeably smaller. That has not happened with any other product I have used, so I can definitely attribute these effects to the Badger Damsascus Rose Oil. Definitely plan to keep using it!</li>
            <li> My first bottle of Damascus Rose Face Oil is getting low. I&#x27;m really happy with the product, which I ordered directly from Badger Balm. I was hoping to avoid paying shipping on my re-order, so I checked here at Amazon. Based on what the other reviewer said, I&#x27;ve thought twice about ordering it here. But my experience with the product has been so different that I think I&#x27;ll take a chance and try ordering it here, for the convenience. I&#x27;ve found the people at Badger really helpful, so if I get a bad bottle and the merchant doesn&#x27;t stand behind it, I imagine that the Badger Balm people themselves will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the other reviewer said, the oil smells lovely. I ordered it after using the Damascus Rose Face Sunscreen this spring and summer. I found it feels wonderful on my face and hands both, and it disappears quickly and does a good job of moisturizing. In fact, I find myself preferring it to hand lotion on my hands, so I&#x27;m going to order the Damascus Rose Body Oil, too, and try that for my hands. (I go through a lot of hand lotion/oil, so the body oil price is attractive, but basically even the face oil seems reasonably priced--a little goes a long way, and the pump top makes it easy to use just a little.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not worried about the bottle being clear, because the box it comes in (which is very pretty) is opaque. That means it will be protected from light until I receive it, and I don&#x27;t keep it where it&#x27;s going to be light-damaged.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I have sensitive skin and a normal to combination skin type (some oily spots in the summer, some dry patches in the winter), and I have been using this as a nighttime moisturizer for about a month now.     It makes your skin feel nourished and soft, and has a calming effect.     It does leave an oily residue that takes a while to fully absorb, which is why I only use it at night.     It also has a mild natural fragrance to it, but it did not make my skin irritated or break out.     A little goes a long way.    Bonus it is made with all natural, organic ingredients.     I would recommend this for someone looking for a nourishing nighttime oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has a great smell &amp; it leaves my skin feeling very moisturized.  Lasts overnight, too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it on my face at night, and it moisturizes nicely without being greasy. Smells lovely too.</li>
            <li> Smells great , but the best part is it absorbs fast . Does not take much to use.  And does not cause breakouts.  I love the way this makes my face feel very soft. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, intensive moisturizer.  I&#x27;m not convinced that it is the product for me, but it may work well for others.  Living in Florida, it is a little too heavy for use in the humid Summer months.  In the Winter however, it is a nice silky bed time moisturizer with a lovely scent.  I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a day time product as it has no SPF.  I used it nightly for 6-8 weeks without noticing any reduction in fine lines or wrinkles, but I don&#x27;t really expect anything aside from retinol products to work on that front.  I think for someone with drier or more mature skin and also someone living in a drier climate, this could be an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mother. She said she didn&#x27;t see any visible improvements just yet but enjoys using it nightly.</li>
            <li> Just received this little beauty today. The picture shown makes this oil look deceptively small however the body is quite wide bodied and I see this lasting for quite a bit of time. I used only one pump and the smell was lovely and it went on my skin like silk (I have fairly oily skin so I was worried it would make it worse but it went on very matte). Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, absorbs quickly. I use it every morning prior to makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this product,  I put it on at night after I use the Badger rose geranium face &amp; body soap bar. I have definitely seen an improve in my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I my self wouldn&#x27;t wear it in the daytime unless needed.&lt;br /&gt;A little definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The best ever. I will always use and buy this product.</li>
