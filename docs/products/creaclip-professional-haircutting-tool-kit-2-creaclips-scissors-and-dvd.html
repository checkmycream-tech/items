            <li>Make sure you review the demonstration videos if included in your purchase or view online.</li>

            <li>great product thanks</li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE</li>
            <li>Surprisingly this really works!  </li>
            <li>Two plastic clips may not seem like much in the way of a good haircut</li>
            <li>I am so excited to tell every one i know about this product. :)</li>
            <li>Its that easy</li>
            <li>just too easy.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use</li>
            <li>easy to use with the dvd now</li>
            <li>IT.IT IS EASY TO USE.I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super grateful to the genius who invented them!</li>
            <li>It is so easy and fun to use..!</li>
            <li>Now I can effortlessly keep my hair free from split</li>
            <li>Its ideal for different style fringes and simple layers,which is the look i have for my own hair.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and then some!</li>
            <li>You can tell the video is not an original.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter is something of a fashionista and is thrilled to have a mom who can change up her hair style any time she takes a notion to do so.</li>
            <li>Its well worth the money and the results are fabulous.</li>
            <li>I did not notice that most of the models in the videos and the women who posted DIY videos had straight hair or had straightened their hair themselves before proceeding.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d just go with the original because it&#x27;s seriously worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The DVD has different styles and you can find a lot more videos of more CreaClip haircuts online.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I do not reccommend crea clip to anyone unless they have excellent sharp haircutting scissors and pin straight hair that they want to cut straight across...</li>
            <li>It is very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it seems ok so far.  </li>
            <li>I find it really useful</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totaly worth the money</li>
            <li>I knew I should have waited until I took a trip back home to see my golden lovely hairdresser who never messes up my locks.</li>
            <li>THAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attempted to use it for a shorter cut on my oldest son when his hair was a bit longer, but ultimately decided it was easier to just wing it with fingers, scissors and clippers, but I&#x27;m sure I could&#x27;ve pulled it off on a kid with thinner hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a youtube video [...] showing my first experience with using this product.</li>
            <li>You can find more instructional clips on youtube for different types of cuts.</li>
            <li>They were $30 scissors from a local beauty supply store, I&#x27;m sure you can imagine which one.</li>
            <li>In concept this tool sounds great, but in reality its not as effective as the advertising makes it.&lt;br /&gt;The clips are not easy to place, the trick is to spread the hair evenly in the clip, and thats no easy task.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>I am finallly able to cut my own hair without stress of big expense and unpredictable results.</li>
            <li>I am ready to do my own bangs again after a recent professional cut.</li>
            <li>This worked very well and the instructional DVD was very helpful.</li>
            <li>Ok it isn&#x27;t on the same line as a professional cut,but it is almost like a proffessional cut,it depends on what style you&#x27;re after really.</li>
            <li>What I do when I cut my hair is I flip my hair over and put the clip in and secure it and then cut when I flip it back</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>The very fist time I used the CreaClip it had paid for itself.</li>
            <li>She uses diamond cut scissors, I forget the brand, but they are so precise that you can instantly tell the difference - lighter, bouncier, healthier hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the clips.</li>
            <li>I can layer my own hair in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>An easy way to give myself a long gypsey shag!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to save on monthly visits to beauty salon.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased the creaclip after becoming impatient with needing a trim, and having a local hairdresser hack my hair up.</li>
            <li>My hair was still pretty long, so 2 inches didn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>This actually works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>There is a level in the middle that you can angle for every style from straight cut, bob style, Mohawk, you name it!  </li>
            <li>When I first tried the clip, I used the longer white one.</li>
            <li>There have been occasions where I tried to replicate the process by using a large text book against the back of a chair.  </li>
            <li>Great tool for cutting kids hair.</li>
            <li>hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s clear instruction to use this product.</li>
            <li>I just had a chance to use this product once so far</li>
            <li>I finally decided to buy this product,including the dvd,which i found very helpful.</li>
            <li>My daughter has straight bangs and dye my hair often so hair cuts and hair Cate is essential.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a stylist near my hair since I bought this ingenius item.</li>
            <li>After using my mother&#x27;s creaclips for the last few years I finally took the plunge and ordered my own.  </li>
            <li>Will be trying lots of other styles in the future - just for fun!</li>
            <li>So my ends started splitting, and my hair weighed down from not being cut at the right angle.</li>
            <li>I had a good time cutting my daughters hair, I think having this gave me the confidence to cut it myself.</li>
            <li>The level doesn&#x27;t level off very well in cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;Is better in warmer weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, I ended up butchering my hair for the simple fact that the scissors I have, which are haircutting scissors, were not sharp enough to actually cut hair.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use although having &amp;#34;over 40 year old eyes&amp;#34; it is difficult for me to see the bubble up close.  </li>

            <li> This is easy to use although having &amp;#34;over 40 year old eyes&amp;#34; it is difficult for me to see the bubble up close.  </li>
            <li> I brushed my hair before using, but my hair is not straight, and has a lot of body, and can be coarse at times.</li>
            <li> but the result was a mess, I had to get it fixed, and lost a lot of hair in the process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> clips are hard to use when I&#x27;m cutting someone elses hair, but they are impossible and totally unrecomended when used to cut your own hair, especially the big clip, I tried to cut my own hair by flipping my hair to the front as in the video</li>
            <li> /dead ends without having to hassle my mother during our limited time together.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it because if you aren&#x27;t careful with your bangs they can come up a little silly.  </li>
            <li> I have italian and native american bloodlines, so I&#x27;m not sure if that has anything to do with it.</li>
            <li> So, I like it, try it but be careful.</li>
            <li> but I did, the cut was uneven though the bubble was in the middle.  </li>
            <li> It definitely was not a smooth cut at all.  </li>
            <li> you put the hair in the clip, its not easy to cut using scissors, just imagine holding the scissors in your hands and trying to cut the hair with the clip on, the clip is forced between your fingers and it ends up being very tricky and hard, the opposite to the video advert</li>
            <li> First time i pratice how do fix my hair but it is not perfect !</li>
            <li> There are lots of other uses like trimming hair which the Creaclip can be used for too.</li>
            <li> The last couple of times I&#x27;ve actually been able to go, they didn&#x27;t do anything I wanted and my hair always looked terrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently I only use the small clip to cut my daughters bangs, I found the clip helpful in that case.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews this is so easy to use</li>
            <li> The instructional DVD appears to be unnatural and awkward; it&#x27;s my least favorite part of the kit.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> This worked very well and the instructional DVD was very helpful. I got compliments on my hair. I am ready to do my own bangs again after a recent professional cut.</li>
            <li> I use the clips to trim my wigs. It is very convenient and easy to use. I recommend them to my customers.</li>
            <li> This actually works pretty well.  You end up with blunt edges, so thinning scissors/razor might help soften the look.</li>
            <li> First time i pratice how do fix my hair but it is not perfect !</li>
            <li> used it immediately, worked well.help video could be better</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this really works!  Its a nice tool to have for people who don&#x27;t cut hair for a  living!</li>
            <li> I just had a chance to use this product once so far and it seems ok so far.  The scissor cuts precisly.  The instructional DVD appears to be unnatural and awkward; it&#x27;s my least favorite part of the kit.</li>
            <li> I have very thick brown long hair with lots of split ends due to hair styling. The Crea Clip gave me awesome results without the salon price. Now i don&#x27;t have to visit a salon and spend 60 bucks on a simple angle haircut  trim.  I am so excited to tell every one i know about this product. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this to save money on going to the hairdresser and basically just thought I could do a better job myself since I do know what I want.  This is easy to use although having &amp;#34;over 40 year old eyes&amp;#34; it is difficult for me to see the bubble up close.  That is the only difficulty I have had.  It otherwise is as advertised.  Make sure you review the demonstration videos if included in your purchase or view online.</li>
            <li> Hey!  This worked great!  Used it on my shoulder-length hair and bangs.  Video was helpful!  Will be trying lots of other styles in the future - just for fun!</li>
            <li> Great product. Will be a great money saver. Have already used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one complaint. The level doesn&#x27;t level off very well in cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;Is better in warmer weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it is good, and will recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t I come up with something like this?  Genius!  I can layer my own hair in a few minutes.  The DVD has different styles and you can find a lot more videos of more CreaClip haircuts online.  There is a level in the middle that you can angle for every style from straight cut, bob style, Mohawk, you name it!  And if you have a child who is afraid of getting their bangs or hair cut, this clip holds the hair away from the eyes and scalp.  Men&#x27;s cuts are a snap also. Love it!</li>
            <li> I usually get pricey haircuts like 60-95 or so.  So I tried this and I like the product.  I don&#x27;t love it because if you aren&#x27;t careful with your bangs they can come up a little silly.  But i think its great for trimming or evening out layers.  So, I like it, try it but be careful.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to buy this product,including the dvd,which i found very helpful. I found the Creaclip easy to use and the result i found was very good. Ok it isn&#x27;t on the same line as a professional cut,but it is almost like a proffessional cut,it depends on what style you&#x27;re after really. Its ideal for different style fringes and simple layers,which is the look i have for my own hair.Also shorter bob styles too. There are lots of other uses like trimming hair which the Creaclip can be used for too. I find it really useful and i&#x27;m glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> It worked fine but was difficult to keep aligned while cutting with scissors. I had a good time cutting my daughters hair, I think having this gave me the confidence to cut it myself.</li>
            <li> After using my mother&#x27;s creaclips for the last few years I finally took the plunge and ordered my own.  Now I can effortlessly keep my hair free from split/dead ends without having to hassle my mother during our limited time together. (She lives a few hours away.) There have been occasions where I tried to replicate the process by using a large text book against the back of a chair.  It worked but it was much more involved, incredibly uncomfortable, and downright silly.  My 12 year old daughter is something of a fashionista and is thrilled to have a mom who can change up her hair style any time she takes a notion to do so. We&#x27;ve done various layered looks and she&#x27;s currently sporting something of a longer version of an angled bob with chunky layers.  It&#x27;s adorable, and I DID THAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attempted to use it for a shorter cut on my oldest son when his hair was a bit longer, but ultimately decided it was easier to just wing it with fingers, scissors and clippers, but I&#x27;m sure I could&#x27;ve pulled it off on a kid with thinner hair.  His hair is ridiculously thick and unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m still saving a ton of money on haircuts using these for just me and my daughter.  I&#x27;ve always been something of a cheapskate so these are a definite MUST HAVE in my house!  I&#x27;m super grateful to the genius who invented them!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I had been paying $50 and up to get my hair cut and sat in a chair for an hour. The CreaClip took 15 mins. literally. I have a youtube video [...] showing my first experience with using this product. A lot of the girls in the office have decided to buy one for themselves after seeing my results. Awessome buy</li>
            <li> I like this product, you don&#x27;t have have to regularly go to hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s clear instruction to use this product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My daughter has straight bangs and dye my hair often so hair cuts and hair Cate is essential. Going to the salon to cit my daughters bangs spending 5 dollars at a time ads up so when I discovered this I was eager to try it and let me tell you I am so happy I found it. I can cut my daughters bangs in less than 5 minutes it leaves them perfect and I cut my own hair bit by bit and I love it. I don&#x27;t understand the bad reviews this is so easy to use and so effective just follow the directions. What I do when I cut my hair is I flip my hair over and put the clip in and secure it and then cut when I flip it back I have layers.. Its that easy I love it</li>
            <li> An easy way to give myself a long gypsey shag! You can find more instructional clips on youtube for different types of cuts. Worth every penny and then some!</li>
            <li> I am finallly able to cut my own hair without stress of big expense and unpredictable results. I really like it. I cut my medium lenght hair with it, make layers, trim in minutes. With help of another person - trim the back with ease. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to save on monthly visits to beauty salon. Great tool for cutting kids hair. All it takes is a few minutes, kids can stand it easier than half an hour at the beauty pala.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years because I can never afford the salon. The last couple of times I&#x27;ve actually been able to go, they didn&#x27;t do anything I wanted and my hair always looked terrible. I&#x27;m not great at cutting and trimming myself so I looked into getting these. I got them as a gift for Christmas and did my bangs with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m in love! They did everything they were supposed to and my bangs look great! They didn&#x27;t look very good when I did them back in August on my own but with the help of CreaClip they look amazing and I can keep them (and the rest of my hair) that way from now. No costly and time consuming trips to the salon - ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know there were cheaper versions of this product until it was already purchased for me but I&#x27;d just go with the original because it&#x27;s seriously worth every penny. Two plastic clips may not seem like much in the way of a good haircut but it works. And it works well.</li>
            <li> I love it I don&#x27;t like be in a beauty 2 or more hours this save me time and money!!!</li>
            <li> I just got my Creaclip today.  I cut layers in my hair.  My hair looks great!  No more trips to the salon for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Girlfriend and now everyone is using it... Even my Grandmother!&lt;br /&gt;Totaly worth the money but I would also invest in a larger pair of hair cutting scissors.</li>
            <li> I love this tool kit and I will definitely recommend it to my friends and family.. It is so easy and fun to use..!</li>
            <li> I bought the set with 2 clips and I did my hair and my daughters. Our hair was never prof. done. We watched&lt;br /&gt;the youtube videos and followed the three layer. Our hair looks healthy, clean and wonderful! Curled or not.&lt;br /&gt;Its just too easy. My duaghter even cut her own. Its well worth the money and the results are fabulous. You&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t mess up. Its too easy and your hair looks wonderful! Go ahead and give it a try. Just to make a small note&lt;br /&gt;if your doing your bang. start chin level or longer and then you can always cut again.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I have received so many compliments on my hair since using this! Great scissors too! Thanks!!!!!</li>
            <li> The very fist time I used the CreaClip it had paid for itself. I haven&#x27;t had a stylist near my hair since I bought this ingenius item. It is so easy to use and I have created some great styles myself and I haven&#x27;t even viewed the DVD yet! A great buy - well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the creaclip after becoming impatient with needing a trim, and having a local hairdresser hack my hair up. I knew I should have waited until I took a trip back home to see my golden lovely hairdresser who never messes up my locks. When I first tried the clip, I used the longer white one. I had already been watching several videos online about this product. I did not notice that most of the models in the videos and the women who posted DIY videos had straight hair or had straightened their hair themselves before proceeding. I did not. I brushed my hair before using, but my hair is not straight, and has a lot of body, and can be coarse at times. I have italian and native american bloodlines, so I&#x27;m not sure if that has anything to do with it. Anyway, I ended up butchering my hair for the simple fact that the scissors I have, which are haircutting scissors, were not sharp enough to actually cut hair. They were $30 scissors from a local beauty supply store, I&#x27;m sure you can imagine which one. So my ends started splitting, and my hair weighed down from not being cut at the right angle. I finally got a chance to go back home to see my hairdresser, and she had to cut 2 inches off to correct what I had done. My hair was still pretty long, so 2 inches didn&#x27;t really bother me. She uses diamond cut scissors, I forget the brand, but they are so precise that you can instantly tell the difference - lighter, bouncier, healthier hair. Anyway, I do not reccommend crea clip to anyone unless they have excellent sharp haircutting scissors and pin straight hair that they want to cut straight across...</li>
            <li> I really like the clips. I usually get my hair cut and since its curly when I straighten my hair I always see the mess ups. I decided to give this a try and it&#x27;s great. I just recommend you don&#x27;t get their video, it was hard for me to see with a white and black color. You can tell the video is not an original.</li>
            <li> easy to use with the dvd now I can cut my own hair and not have to worry about what someone else is doing to my hair great product thanks</li>
            <li> Others may not have had any problems with it but I did, the cut was uneven though the bubble was in the middle.  Plus the cut was too harsh.  I didn&#x27;t like the way it was cut it was too blocky, if you can understand that.  It definitely was not a smooth cut at all.  Now I am just waiting to get my money back.</li>
            <li> In concept this tool sounds great, but in reality its not as effective as the advertising makes it.&lt;br /&gt;The clips are not easy to place, the trick is to spread the hair evenly in the clip, and thats no easy task.&lt;br /&gt;Once you put the hair in the clip, its not easy to cut using scissors, just imagine holding the scissors in your hands and trying to cut the hair with the clip on, the clip is forced between your fingers and it ends up being very tricky and hard, the opposite to the video advert, I found it easier to cut the hair with an electric trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The clips are hard to use when I&#x27;m cutting someone elses hair, but they are impossible and totally unrecomended when used to cut your own hair, especially the big clip, I tried to cut my own hair by flipping my hair to the front as in the video but the result was a mess, I had to get it fixed, and lost a lot of hair in the process.&lt;br /&gt;The clips have a balance guide on them, I did not know how to use it as the liquid was not moving.&lt;br /&gt;Currently I only use the small clip to cut my daughters bangs, I found the clip helpful in that case.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE IT.IT IS EASY TO USE.I HAVE ALWAYS HAD PROBLEMS WITH SALONS.MY LEVELS WERE NOT EQUALLY CUT.NOW I HAVE FOUND THE SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM.NICE EXPLANATORY DVD WITH REAL EVERYDAY WOMEN,NOT MODELS!!! THANK YOU.</li>
