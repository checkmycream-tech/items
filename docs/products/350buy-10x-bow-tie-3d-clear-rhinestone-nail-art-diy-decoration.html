            <li>Let the nail art projects begin since I&#x27;m new with designs ready to practice and come up with some cute designs for under the bows!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li>They are pretty but they are just ok.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product since it took me a while to find something like this.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little bow you can use it with difrent colors and it blends good, custumers like it.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have a surprise when you open them up very sparkling and beautiful</li>
            <li>but they stay on the customers&#x27; nails the full two weeks.</li>
            <li>I really thought these were cute.</li>
            <li>They are perfect, except they are a little large.</li>
            <li>Seller delivered quickly but I won&#x27;t buy these bows again.</li>
            <li>They are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to find something new and different to add to my wish list.  </li>

            <li>it was well worth the wait</li>
            <li>These little bows are gorgeous</li>
            <li>So cute wish they were smaller in size</li>
            <li>They are really sturdy and can be re-used!</li>
            <li>Beautiful product &amp; larger than expected.</li>
            <li>You get exactly what the picture shows.</li>
            <li>I would like something that is more flat</li>
            <li>let dry and then put another dab on top and bottom...</li>
            <li>so the only thing to do is either have them applied in a nail salon or purchase really strong glue</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I love that the picture gives u the expected size already</li>
            <li>They are very bulky for the nail.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it only comes with 10 bows, if you are expecting more you&#x27;ll be disapointed.</li>
            <li>When I opened my mail and saw them i new they would be a hit...</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly, but when I got them a majority of the jewels were missing.</li>

            <li> , the bows last a long time on.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are much larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> And I constantly get compliments on my other nail choices.</li>
            <li> kind of disappointed in the quality of these.</li>
            <li> instead they were 1 big bow tie, without the &amp;#34;hanging ribbons&amp;#34; they had little holes in the &amp;#34;bow ties&amp;#34; and then in the center was a mini rhinestone,</li>
            <li> Everything what I expected</li>
            <li> I order 2 things from this company 1 was as described but the other item, being this, was not!  </li>
            <li> You will have to reglue them once every few days</li>
            <li> Sorry that I ordered the black and white rhinestone bows.</li>
            <li> I usually wear one on my ring finger.</li>
            <li> Also the rhinestones inside the bow are so big the stick out from the base and the glue makes it have a yellow color underneath the bow.</li>
            <li> I checked the package for them but were unable to find them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> So cute wish they were smaller in size</li>
            <li> Received my purchase fast and Item is excellent. Thanks</li>
            <li> very pretty but it get stuck on your hair</li>
            <li> Perfect price, beautiful piece of ornament for your nails... but it takes forever to arrive!</li>
            <li> I loved them and did my nails with them. They are really sturdy and can be re-used! I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> i love these! The bling is wonderful and super mirror shiny. They are very beautiful and I paid very little for them.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product &amp; larger than expected. Item has more weight but good quality. Very happy with this purchase. Will order again</li>
            <li> I order 2 things from this company 1 was as described but the other item, being this, was not!  I recieved 10 silver bows which looked nothing like this picture instead they were 1 big bow tie, without the &amp;#34;hanging ribbons&amp;#34; they had little holes in the &amp;#34;bow ties&amp;#34; and then in the center was a mini rhinestone, the item sent to me looked NOTHING like the item pictured.  Very disappointed.  I don&#x27;t know if they ran out of this item and thought it was close enough but I wanted to recieve the item as pictured not something that slighty resembles it.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what the picture shows. I used superglue to get these to stay on my nails. I put one on each accent nail, and my friends loved them. I got lots of compliments. You will have to reglue them once every few days</li>
            <li> at my salon, these are nicknamed the boobie bows. i didnt think they were big..theyre massive! the stones are very bright and shiny, and thats what attracts the customers. but they stay on the customers&#x27; nails the full two weeks.</li>
            <li> Let the nail art projects begin since I&#x27;m new with designs ready to practice and come up with some cute designs for under the bows!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These little bows are gorgeous I love that the picture gives u the expected size already so you don&#x27;t have a surprise when you open them up very sparkling and beautiful</li>
            <li> They are sooooo much bigger than I thought they were gonna be. Unless you are a trophy wife I dont see these working well</li>
            <li> Very very cute. Love these.</li>
            <li> got these for the grand daughter and she just loves them, thank you.</li>
            <li> These are so cute my daughter in law loves to do my grand girls nails and these looked cute on line. When I opened my mail and saw them i new they would be a hit...They loved them Thanks Granny Linda</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly. The only thing is that it only comes with 10 bows, if you are expecting more you&#x27;ll be disapointed.</li>
            <li> I really thought these were cute. I usually wear one on my ring finger. They are well made and I&#x27;ve had no problems with them. They were shipped on time. They will be too big for a youth nail but they work great for an adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with this order and would order them again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. It took for ever to arrive and when it finally did arrived I got something total different.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are much larger than I expected.  Have not figured out hoe to make them stay on.  Would not purchase them again.  Sorry that I ordered the black and white rhinestone bows.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it on littlest pet shop to make it like head band on the side of their head! You might have to wait for it to come in because its coming from China but comes it on time!</li>
            <li> kind of disappointed in the quality of these. The big jewels on the bows were glued on crooked so you see gaps between the metal &amp; diamonds. Seller delivered quickly but I won&#x27;t buy these bows again.</li>
            <li> Their so beautiful I love them</li>
            <li> Everything what I expected</li>
            <li> They are very bulky for the nail. I would like something that is more flat so it won&#x27;t get stuck on things and snag. Also the rhinestones inside the bow are so big the stick out from the base and the glue makes it have a yellow color underneath the bow. I had to paint silver nail polish so it wouldn&#x27;t be yellow. They are pretty but they are just ok. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little bow you can use it with difrent colors and it blends good, custumers like it.</li>
            <li> thankyou..will buy more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in nail school now and we are learning different methods of nail design. I bought these to use as 3D nail art on acrylic nails. They are perfect, except they are a little large. They are definitely cute, shiny, sparkly, and perfect for design. They just won&#x27;t work on smaller acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> they are very cute love the size the one thing I don&#x27;t like is that there is nothing to stick them on with  so the only thing to do is either have them applied in a nail salon or purchase really strong glue</li>
            <li> I love this new addition to my nail art collection.  I could not find anything like this in my area anywhere.  I would recommend these to anyone looking to &amp;#34;bling&amp;#34; up their nail art at an affordable price.  I received my items very quickly and am very happy with them. They are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to find something new and different to add to my wish list.  I am so happy....</li>
            <li> While the product took a while to get here it was well worth the wait, the bows last a long time on. What I do is I put a dab of glue, put it on, hold it in place let dry and then put another dab on top and bottom...good to go...to get off just twist it and voila....</li>
            <li> The look like the eyes of a fly, instead of bows lol</li>
            <li> This set it a must have, very nicely cut designs, easy to apply on nails, very good for the price.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly, but when I got them a majority of the jewels were missing. I checked the package for them but were unable to find them. I was really excited about this product since it took me a while to find something like this. And I constantly get compliments on my other nail choices. I am a licensed nail tech and thought I had found something</li>
