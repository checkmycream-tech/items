            <li>It is awesome!  </li>
            <li>One of the best volume hair products I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in this product are incredibly detrimental to your health.  </li>
            <li>To keep it great looking</li>
            <li>Not to mention it smells great.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous!!!  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing!  </li>
            <li>But after reading good reviews about this one, I decided to give it a try, despite the $32 price tag.  </li>
            <li>and it is amazing</li>
            <li>I get really nice volume, without any stickiness or crunchiness.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s pricey, it really is the best volumizer I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was not at all as effective as the 6.00 Got2Be Volume powder-</li>
            <li>Nice smell too.</li>
            <li>I love love love this volume powder!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery residue, makes hair feel clean, adds volume, and smells great.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this hair powder!  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, and most importantly it works!  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this product gives my hair life!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>but i love it</li>
            <li>She uses it more as a hair refresher/dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>love this stuff, a bit pricey though</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I prefer my John Frieda refreshing powder much more.</li>
            <li>I am able to add volume to my hair and style it in ways that I otherwise would not be able to.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used many products that didn&#x27;t work for number of years until my hair dresser used this product on me..</li>
            <li>LOVE...</li>
            <li>Also smells great - fresh and not perfume-y sweet like most hair products.</li>
            <li>I still use this Sachajuan spray and it works great as a dry shampoo, but the John Masters Scalp Treatment creates volume and has healthy ingredients that are good for the scalp and that don&#x27;t cause dryness.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo ever  Love it</li>
            <li>One of the best dry shampoos I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo on the market!</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>Before ordering it, I had read a lot of reviews about it both here and on other websites, and most people agreed that it is one of the best volumizers out there.  </li>
            <li>If it does, its easy to just just off.</li>
            <li>Also, excited to hear that it&#x27;s an excellent dry shampoo!!</li>
            <li>Love this product for building volume, you don&#x27;t have to use very much for the results.</li>
            <li>Perfect if you&#x27;re like me and are too lazy to brush your hair.</li>
            <li>I have super fine thin hair, and this product is amazing at creating incredible volume.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great quality dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also sprays out in a nice even mist, and, so far, the canister doesn&#x27;t seem like it will clog up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is faster, easier, holds better, and creates a much better overall look!</li>
            <li>pretty sure the ingredients are poison and the price is ridiculously high, but it&#x27;s totally worth it for the all day (and even two-day!)</li>
            <li>I was able to make such huge hair, and it stayed all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a try if you need to add some \\&quot;umph\\&quot;  to your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well worth the look it gives.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels full and light, and the normal second-day greasy roots are gone.</li>
            <li>This Sachajuan powder doesn&#x27;t leave grit, and it also doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of white powder or color in your hair, which is good since I have dark reddish brown</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is great and I will definitely repurchase.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite bloggers (Keiko Lynn) uses this powder, and I finally caved and ordered it after wanting it for awhile.  </li>
            <li>My hair is also pretty oily by the end of each day, and this powder also prevents that as well.  </li>
            <li>Always be sure to spray on root so the white residue doesn&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li>It not only makes my hair feel, look, and smell clean and freshly washed, but it also gives my hair a ton of volume!</li>
            <li>It really does make your hair look better in between washes, especially if you&#x27;re someone who has oily hair.</li>
            <li>I would add that I only use the original formula (white powder/spray) because it works way better than the one for darker hair.</li>
            <li>I use it more as a dry shampoo than a volume product.  </li>
            <li>my hair stood out like I was electrocuted, it was sticky, tacky and really funny for Halloween or fright night but not for going out as a normal woman.</li>
            <li>much prefer the John Masters product as a volumizer.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a light brown, and the white doesn&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li>Great gives me a lot of body to my thin hair</li>
            <li>the smell is kind of heavy and spicy</li>
            <li>I have gorgeous thick wavy hair and work out every day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more than half a dozen brands of dry shampoos, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The original version leaves a white residue that goes away when you tousle your hair a bit at the roots.</li>
            <li>After I forgot a bottle at my mother in law I realized I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>The fumes do smell particularly toxic, though.</li>
            <li>Other people have actually told me my hair smells nice.</li>
            <li>This really is the first volume spray I&#x27;ve bought that actually gives volume.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of reading first though, because $33 is a lot, especially if you&#x27;re unsure on whether something will even work for you...</li>
            <li>I have very straight, fine, thin hair; and I have tried multiple dry shampoos to try to give my hair more volume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a brunette and the dark hair version that I&#x27;ve tried works ok, but doesn&#x27;t give me the same level of volume or feeling of cleanliness.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing in its volumizing effect on my thin hair.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a little pricier than some of the other options out there, I love it because it works REALLY</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t turn your hair powdery white like some do, and it doesn&#x27;t give your hair a funny color like Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s similar version.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that gives me the sky high volume I am looking for.</li>
            <li>It may sound gross, but it makes my hair look and feel less greasy when I haven&#x27;t washed it for a day or two.</li>
            <li>Still, much better than several other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a few of my friends and family to use this product as well because I&#x27;m such a huge fan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit expensive but the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Anza one I&#x27;ve been using for the past few months is good, but it leaves grit in your hair, so I can only use that one on days when I know I&#x27;ll wash my hair the next day.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the most expensive hair product I pay for</li>
            <li>I wish it were a little cheaper, but I&#x27;ll keep buying it because it really does work!</li>
            <li>Is a little more expensive than others but worth it.</li>
            <li>Some people have complained about the smell in other reviews, but I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>I gave away bottles for my family overseas (and now they are hooked too!), and have at least 3 bottles at home at all times... call me crazy but a good hair day every day is worth the extra cabinet space!</li>

            <li> First off, I have extremely thin, fine hair, that barely holds curls unless I use serious hair spray, let alone if I tease it for volume &amp; spray b4 &amp; after.</li>
            <li> Even Very Sexy Hair falls short compared to this bad boy.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair, only on my roots, then tousle with my hands or brush through.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spray at the roots onto dry hair, flip head over, shake &amp; finger through to distribute the powder, flip head back &amp; voila!</li>
            <li> it works wonders for fullness and can even work as a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find any volume powder or dry shampoo that compares.</li>
            <li> Volumizer and Dry shampoo in one.</li>
            <li> but instead of going out with wet hair</li>
            <li> But none of them worked very well, and in fact, some even made my hair worse.  </li>
            <li> I was born with terribly flat, limp hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on clean hair, dirty hair, everything.</li>
            <li> I wash it twice a week and rinse it with water the other days</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> My hair is on the thin side and other volumizing spray powders generally felt heavy and greasy after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little on the pricey side...</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair</li>
            <li> I have limp locks</li>
            <li> If you have limp hair this product works well.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and gives limp hair the poof it needs.</li>
            <li> Enhances messy, bed head styles.</li>
            <li> It works to thicken hair, but it does not easily wash out.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not a very effective hair cleanser between washes.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid it would make my hair look whitish or dull, but it is completely undetectable.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeing very nasty and if there was any volume in my hair when I first applied the powder, it didn&#x27;t take long for my hair to flatten out and look limp and dirty.  </li>
            <li> seriously buy this product.</li>
            <li> It works for my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Obsessed.</li>
            <li> Was quite disappointed after reading the hype.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This is fabulous!!!  What a pick-up for oily and need to shampoo hair!!</li>
            <li> It does add volume, as described. But it&#x27;s not a very effective hair cleanser between washes. Was quite disappointed after reading the hype.</li>
            <li> It works to thicken hair, but it does not easily wash out.</li>
            <li> It may sound gross, but it makes my hair look and feel less greasy when I haven&#x27;t washed it for a day or two. The only downside is that it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo on the market! This product is amazing in its volumizing effect on my thin hair. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery residue, makes hair feel clean, adds volume, and smells great. Is a little more expensive than others but worth it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most expensive hair product I pay for and I LOVE it. This really is the first volume spray I&#x27;ve bought that actually gives volume. I can even re-fluff throughout the day and the texture and &#x27;oomph&#x27; is still there and waiting. The fumes do smell particularly toxic, though.</li>
            <li> seriously buy this product. it works wonders for fullness and can even work as a dry shampoo. the smell is kind of heavy and spicy but i love it</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo ever  Love it</li>
            <li> Horrendous product.  I have gorgeous thick wavy hair and work out every day.  To keep it great looking I wash it twice a week and rinse it with water the other days but instead of going out with wet hair I tried this product.  AAARRRGGGHHHH!!!  my hair stood out like I was electrocuted, it was sticky, tacky and really funny for Halloween or fright night but not for going out as a normal woman.</li>
            <li> Ever since I read an article about how it is used by the hairstylists on the models before they walk the runway, I had to try it. I have limp locks and it is amazing the volume I get from this product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this hair powder!  I have very dark hair and I was afraid it would make my hair look whitish or dull, but it is completely undetectable.  I use it on dry hair, only on my roots, then tousle with my hands or brush through. I get really nice volume, without any stickiness or crunchiness.  Some people have complained about the smell in other reviews, but I love the smell.  It&#x27;s sort of powdery, and I don&#x27;t really notice it after a few minutes.  Other people have actually told me my hair smells nice. Overall, this product is great and I will definitely repurchase.  In fact, I have already ordered one for my grandmother and she loves it too.  She uses it more as a hair refresher/dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite bloggers (Keiko Lynn) uses this powder, and I finally caved and ordered it after wanting it for awhile.  Before ordering it, I had read a lot of reviews about it both here and on other websites, and most people agreed that it is one of the best volumizers out there.  Although it&#x27;s pricey, it really is the best volumizer I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The L&#x27;Anza one I&#x27;ve been using for the past few months is good, but it leaves grit in your hair, so I can only use that one on days when I know I&#x27;ll wash my hair the next day.  This Sachajuan powder doesn&#x27;t leave grit, and it also doesn&#x27;t leave any kind of white powder or color in your hair, which is good since I have dark reddish brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also sprays out in a nice even mist, and, so far, the canister doesn&#x27;t seem like it will clog up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try if you need to add some \\&quot;umph\\&quot;  to your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED ON 12-20-13:  I just bought [[ASIN:B0006SFXYY John Masters Organics John Masters Organics Deep Scalp Follicle Treatment &amp; Volumizer for Thinning Hair 2 fl oz - 2 fl oz]], and much prefer the John Masters product as a volumizer.  I still use this Sachajuan spray and it works great as a dry shampoo, but the John Masters Scalp Treatment creates volume and has healthy ingredients that are good for the scalp and that don&#x27;t cause dryness.</li>
            <li> If you have limp hair this product works well.  Also adds body as the days go on without a rewash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more than half a dozen brands of dry shampoos, and this is my favorite. Even though it&#x27;s a little pricier than some of the other options out there, I love it because it works REALLY WELL. I&#x27;ve gotten a few of my friends and family to use this product as well because I&#x27;m such a huge fan. It not only makes my hair feel, look, and smell clean and freshly washed, but it also gives my hair a ton of volume! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great quality dry shampoo. I would add that I only use the original formula (white powder/spray) because it works way better than the one for darker hair. I&#x27;m a brunette and the dark hair version that I&#x27;ve tried works ok, but doesn&#x27;t give me the same level of volume or feeling of cleanliness. The original version leaves a white residue that goes away when you tousle your hair a bit at the roots.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, a bit pricey though</li>
            <li> One of the best dry shampoos I&#x27;ve found. My hair is a light brown, and the white doesn&#x27;t show. Only if I sort of overdo it along my part, I guess, can you tell that it&#x27;s got the powder in it. Still, much better than several other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive but the smell is amazing. It also makes your hair volumize too!</li>
            <li> Love this product for building volume, you don&#x27;t have to use very much for the results.</li>
            <li> I have super fine thin hair, and this product is amazing at creating incredible volume. I was able to make such huge hair, and it stayed all day.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product are incredibly detrimental to your health.  A simple Wikipedia search of this INCI should send people running.</li>
            <li> I love love love this volume powder!! I use it on clean hair, dirty hair, everything. Can&#x27;t find any volume powder or dry shampoo that compares. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This product does as promised.  I love the smell.  Keeper, but pricey, I think.</li>
            <li> I use it more as a dry shampoo than a volume product.  The smell is amazing!  It really does make your hair look better in between washes, especially if you&#x27;re someone who has oily hair.</li>
            <li> I think the product is way over priced!  It left my hair feeing very nasty and if there was any volume in my hair when I first applied the powder, it didn&#x27;t take long for my hair to flatten out and look limp and dirty.  I would NEVER buy this product again.  It was a waist of my money.</li>
            <li> Obsessed. Volumizer and Dry shampoo in one. Best brand.</li>
            <li> This was not at all as effective as the 6.00 Got2Be Volume powder- Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.  A little pricey but well worth the look it gives.  Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and gives limp hair the poof it needs.</li>
            <li> First off, I have extremely thin, fine hair, that barely holds curls unless I use serious hair spray, let alone if I tease it for volume &amp; spray b4 &amp; after. This spray is the holy grail for girls like me with lifeless hair! I did a lot of reading first though, because $33 is a lot, especially if you&#x27;re unsure on whether something will even work for you... But the reviews on Sephora didn&#x27;t let me down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spray at the roots onto dry hair, flip head over, shake &amp; finger through to distribute the powder, flip head back &amp; voila! EASYYYY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye, bye: root lifters, moose, volume tonics, volume powders (this is a spray!!), and maybe that teasing brush thing. This is faster, easier, holds better, and creates a much better overall look! Also, excited to hear that it&#x27;s an excellent dry shampoo!! --&gt;Fringe benefit! :D&lt;br /&gt;...will they be coming out with a travel size anytime soon?!!</li>
            <li> I did not like this at all. My hair looks like a rats nest after. I prefer my John Frieda refreshing powder much more.</li>
            <li> I have very straight, fine, thin hair; and I have tried multiple dry shampoos to try to give my hair more volume.  But none of them worked very well, and in fact, some even made my hair worse.  But after reading good reviews about this one, I decided to give it a try, despite the $32 price tag.  It is awesome!  It doesn&#x27;t turn your hair powdery white like some do, and it doesn&#x27;t give your hair a funny color like Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s similar version.  It smells nice, and most importantly it works!  I am able to add volume to my hair and style it in ways that I otherwise would not be able to.  My hair is also pretty oily by the end of each day, and this powder also prevents that as well.  I wish it were a little cheaper, but I&#x27;ll keep buying it because it really does work!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. I have fine hair and this product gives my hair life! Best dry shampoo! Hands down</li>
            <li> One of the best volume hair products I&#x27;ve bought. Enhances messy, bed head styles. Perfect if you&#x27;re like me and are too lazy to brush your hair. Also smells great - fresh and not perfume-y sweet like most hair products.</li>
            <li> This is one of these products you don&#x27;t deem necessary until you&#x27;ve tried it. My hair is on the thin side and other volumizing spray powders generally felt heavy and greasy after a couple of hours. My hairdresser raved about it (they only use Sachajuan products), and I was hooked!! My hair feels full and light, and the normal second-day greasy roots are gone. I used to have to shampoo every day, but no longer. After I forgot a bottle at my mother in law I realized I couldn&#x27;t live without it! I gave away bottles for my family overseas (and now they are hooked too!), and have at least 3 bottles at home at all times... call me crazy but a good hair day every day is worth the extra cabinet space!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that gives me the sky high volume I am looking for. Even Very Sexy Hair falls short compared to this bad boy. Not to mention it smells great. Always be sure to spray on root so the white residue doesn&#x27;t show. If it does, its easy to just just off. 2nd time Ive purchased this and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I was born with terribly flat, limp hair. I used to wash my hair every day and back comb it like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure the ingredients are poison and the price is ridiculously high, but it&#x27;s totally worth it for the all day (and even two-day!) volume I get from this product.</li>
            <li> Great gives me a lot of body to my thin hair</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little on the pricey side...It works for my thin hair.  I have used many products that didn&#x27;t work for number of years until my hair dresser used this product on me..I am sold! LOVE...</li>
