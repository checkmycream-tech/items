            <li>but the item didn&#x27;t work for my kind of hair</li>
            <li>it smells nice, but that&#x27;s about it,</li>

            <li>my hair is very fine and this shampoo has been a saving grace.  </li>
            <li>Great quality &amp; fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Bain de Force has become my all time favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love Kerastase.  </li>
            <li>but It has too many damaging sulfates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced just as much or even more hair loss and the shampoo leaves my hair brittle.</li>
            <li>My stylist used a Kerastase treatment ($45 in salon) on my hair that made my hair look 100% healthy and glossy.</li>
            <li>have been really pleased with the results the product has given to my hair.</li>
            <li>it has made my hair feel thicker and have more depth.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Great product - really makes a difference on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Recent purchase at a great price put the icing on the cake!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have the deep conditioner by Kerastase that I use once a week (and LOVE!!!)  </li>
            <li>excellent shampoo performed as expected will order again when I can find it on the site</li>
            <li>Loved it so much purchased it twice.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased Kerastase in my salon and was astounded at how amazing my hair looked and felt.</li>
            <li>this shampoo is awesome, my hair is really smooth and shiny, I recomend this product, because any other shampoo made in my weakened hair this results.....</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely fine</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, fine, bleached hair.</li>
            <li>P.S I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li>I use this along with the Kerastase Resistance Ciment Thermique and now my hair is smooth.</li>
            <li>My fly-away ends are improved (I use coconut oil to smooth them</li>
            <li>I think it should be priced to be available to everyone.</li>
            <li>It took weeks to restore it back to the condition it was in before I bought this shampoo (which already wasn&#x27;t great).</li>
            <li>It leaves my baby fine hair super shiny and nourished.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny !</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t be able to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>Today I passed by a salon and saw it, told her my story and purchased it there for the original price.</li>
            <li>Also, should it be a price anything below the original sales price</li>
            <li>ALL Keratase products are amazing - best to examine the line carefully for your specific need or ask your hairdresser.</li>
            <li>After using the Bain De Force I truly couldn&#x27;t see all those split ends any longer, my hair felt healthy for the first time in a decade.</li>
            <li>Definitley worth it!</li>
            <li>It lathers well, smells nice and my hair is already in better shape after only 3 shampoos.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a great line that was developed for really damaged hair, try de&#x27;Cinque Science.</li>
            <li>A co-worker recommended use about 13 years when I experienced more hair loss than usual.</li>
            <li>Fair enough.  </li>
            <li>, I only endorse that fact that for once I could tolerate how good my hair looked and this product destroyed that.</li>
            <li>Really repaired my hair to the point that I was able to &amp;#34;downgrade&amp;#34; to the Nutriv line, hehe.</li>
            <li>Even though I am more on the sceptical side she explained me very, very convincingly that Kerastase does not approve selling through any channels other than their approved salons and that they NEVER EVER go on sale.</li>
            <li>I mix it with other conditioners and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>course they are more expensive, but it makes her happy!!</li>
            <li>I really Love the old formula!!</li>
            <li>I just kind of lightly smooth it around with my palms and fingers flat.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair, and a great hair dresser, who works hard when I want my hair straighten, but I will not get the same results w/o this product, so is the perfect combination....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last year and it has been AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Also wasn&#x27;t worth the price in relation to how well it performed.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo didn&#x27;t mKe my hair dry, but gave it a lot of body.i was very satisfied with the feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo gets my hair perfectly clean but is incredibly gentle.</li>
            <li>now I am back to dark brown but excellent product all of them!!!!</li>
            <li>I really wish they would be more reasonable on the price, especially for the size of the conditioner (which I always have to use more of than shampoo).  </li>
            <li>My long brown hair is shinning with this amazing shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo for leaving my very dry hair so smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I have been using for 2 years now as my sole shampoo and can say that it is worth every penny and more.  </li>
            <li>It makes thin hair much healthier, and smells great!</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine, and color treated hair and could easily look at my ends and see a bevy of split ends.</li>
            <li>My ends are slightly dry and easily damaged because I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Right now I am considering to copy paste my review to other popular Amazon Kerastase products as well so that people are aware of the risk.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was reluctant to spend so much money on a shampoo but seeing the drastic results the treatment had made I decided it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have not been able to buy it locally.</li>
            <li>One of the first five ingredients in this shampoo is Sodium Laurel Sulphate.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser uses it and recommended it for flat hair that could use more body.</li>
            <li>Before running out of the product I quickly ordered another batch on Amazon, however when it arrived I noticed the bottles were just slightly different from the original bottles I had purchased in the salon.</li>
            <li>This has been the best product I&#x27;ve ever used, the only other product that worked even close to this brand was Garnier Fructis&#x27; Sleek and Shine series, only.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair line is wonderful, a little expensive but so worth it, it leaves my hair so shiny, soft and smooth, can live with out it.</li>
            <li>It seems it helps strengthen my hair and certainly makes it shiny.  </li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that gives body to my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I see such a huge difference in the thickness and volume of my hair.</li>
            <li>I have been useing this for about 6 years and it really helps your hair get stronger and stops hair loss....</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My initial thought was, \\&quot;can a shampoo really be worth that much money?\\&quot; but then realized that given how much I spend to color and cut my hair, that yes, it probably was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I&#x27;m not losing hair as much as it used to be.</li>
            <li>shampoos frizz my hair or leave too much residue and don&#x27;t wash out the oil.  </li>
            <li>and it really feels like you just walked out of a salon.  </li>
            <li>I Like it, its very relax,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner when you use this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It was because I had too much protein  built up in my hair.</li>
            <li>My color was fading fast as well</li>
            <li>but if you have the money and your hair really needs a boost from damage, I&#x27;d recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I saw results rather quickly and the shampoo really restored my hair back to health.  </li>
            <li>It is not worth the $10-20 in savings to damage your hair even more.</li>
            <li>I love this, the smell, the way it cleans using so little product in my very thick and long hair, love the way hair feels strong and so light after use.  </li>
            <li>Ok, Glamazons, you know I don&#x27;t lie when it comes to products and that I do not get paid by any company for reviews good or bad.</li>
            <li>More shine, less frizz.</li>
            <li>Now I only do it when I want a super sleek look.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lasted longer and is decent size, but it&#x27;s just too pricey for both consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and as I get older</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for women with ultra processes hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, and their conditioners are amazing, expensive but still worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few years now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>it is 100% fake or at the very least old.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, am I a sceptical person and can see that the hair salon seller has her own agenda and most likely wants to sell her products with a nice margin and does not want me to go to amazon and get it cheaper....</li>
            <li>I go to the finest of salons and use the most gentle products but the only way to achieve a color as blonde as I have is through multiple processes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve introduced several other people to this product and they all love it, too.</li>
            <li>It washes out cleanly and the conditioner is not heavy like other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I color my hair regularly, and I was also concerned that cheaper products were stripping the color out of my hair at a much faster rate.</li>
            <li>As a young woman, my hair was loaded with body, curl and wave.  </li>
            <li>However I&#x27;ve not noticed any considerable difference in the texture or health of my hair using it.</li>
            <li>I get a chance I will reach out to Kerastase and ask them directly and update you guys.</li>
            <li>You have to buy it from a professional, but you will get miraculous results.</li>
            <li>In all honesty, I used to use this shampoo before I became a professional product ingredient specialist.</li>
            <li>My stylist swears by this line of products but my hair is so far gone</li>
            <li>And so far, no miracles.</li>
            <li>I never considered my favorite hair product until a few days ago when I finally stopped using it.</li>
            <li>Its not a bad shampoo but its definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have super processed hair (bleached, dyed, re-bleached, dyed again) which I blow dry and straighten constantly.</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair blonde for the better part of 10 years, and my hair was a huge mess after I finally decided to go back to my natural of dark brown.  </li>
            <li>but her story was very convincing and I am left wondering and definitely hesitant to  buy any further Kerastase products at Amazon before I was not able clarify this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was in Paris recently, and all the high end salons carry the Kerastase products</li>
            <li>We recently moved to a new town</li>
            <li>This worked really well in conjuction with the conditioner in making my hair soft and saw a little difference in the dryness of my hair but didn&#x27;t see any difference in how much my hair would break and still saw the same amount of hair on the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>I held off because it&#x27;s not cheap, but I have to say, it does give my hair more fullness than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>a circumference of thickness barely wider than a marker.  </li>
            <li>So the difference in price between this brand and that one is obvious- which really destroys any theory that expensive shampoos are automatically better.  </li>
            <li>So, she swore that if I see products on amazon that they are most likely fake or at the very least passed the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;She went on saying that it is a well known problem that they come in original-style packaging but are filled not with the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Can tell a difference in breakage &amp; does not dry hair</li>
            <li>Cannot use other products because it not only halted the hair loss process it also really does reinforce weakened hair.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner I also purchased was actually drying my hair out even more and the longer I left it on the worse it would get.</li>
            <li>I wear a high volume platinum blonde (nearly white) and my hair naturally is almost black.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t weak or fragile, but it is fine and cranky.  </li>

            <li> Great quality &amp; fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Bain de Force has become my all time favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love Kerastase.  </li>
            <li> but It has too many damaging sulfates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced just as much or even more hair loss and the shampoo leaves my hair brittle.</li>
            <li> My stylist used a Kerastase treatment ($45 in salon) on my hair that made my hair look 100% healthy and glossy.</li>
            <li> have been really pleased with the results the product has given to my hair.</li>
            <li> it has made my hair feel thicker and have more depth.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product - really makes a difference on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Recent purchase at a great price put the icing on the cake!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly and the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have the deep conditioner by Kerastase that I use once a week (and LOVE!!!)  </li>
            <li> excellent shampoo performed as expected will order again when I can find it on the site</li>
            <li> Loved it so much purchased it twice.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased Kerastase in my salon and was astounded at how amazing my hair looked and felt.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is awesome, my hair is really smooth and shiny, I recomend this product, because any other shampoo made in my weakened hair this results.....</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, fine, bleached hair.</li>
            <li> P.S I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Kerastase Resistance Ciment Thermique and now my hair is smooth.</li>
            <li> My fly-away ends are improved (I use coconut oil to smooth them</li>
            <li> I think it should be priced to be available to everyone.</li>
            <li> It took weeks to restore it back to the condition it was in before I bought this shampoo (which already wasn&#x27;t great).</li>
            <li> It leaves my baby fine hair super shiny and nourished.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny !</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t be able to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> Today I passed by a salon and saw it, told her my story and purchased it there for the original price.</li>
            <li> Also, should it be a price anything below the original sales price</li>
            <li> ALL Keratase products are amazing - best to examine the line carefully for your specific need or ask your hairdresser.</li>
            <li> After using the Bain De Force I truly couldn&#x27;t see all those split ends any longer, my hair felt healthy for the first time in a decade.</li>
            <li> Definitley worth it!</li>
            <li> It lathers well, smells nice and my hair is already in better shape after only 3 shampoos.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great line that was developed for really damaged hair, try de&#x27;Cinque Science.</li>
            <li> A co-worker recommended use about 13 years when I experienced more hair loss than usual.</li>
            <li> Fair enough.  </li>
            <li> , I only endorse that fact that for once I could tolerate how good my hair looked and this product destroyed that.</li>
            <li> Really repaired my hair to the point that I was able to &amp;#34;downgrade&amp;#34; to the Nutriv line, hehe.</li>
            <li> Even though I am more on the sceptical side she explained me very, very convincingly that Kerastase does not approve selling through any channels other than their approved salons and that they NEVER EVER go on sale.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other conditioners and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> course they are more expensive, but it makes her happy!!</li>
            <li> I really Love the old formula!!</li>
            <li> I just kind of lightly smooth it around with my palms and fingers flat.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair, and a great hair dresser, who works hard when I want my hair straighten, but I will not get the same results w/o this product, so is the perfect combination....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last year and it has been AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Also wasn&#x27;t worth the price in relation to how well it performed.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t mKe my hair dry, but gave it a lot of body.i was very satisfied with the feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gets my hair perfectly clean but is incredibly gentle.</li>
            <li> now I am back to dark brown but excellent product all of them!!!!</li>
            <li> I really wish they would be more reasonable on the price, especially for the size of the conditioner (which I always have to use more of than shampoo).  </li>
            <li> My long brown hair is shinning with this amazing shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo for leaving my very dry hair so smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for 2 years now as my sole shampoo and can say that it is worth every penny and more.  </li>
            <li> It makes thin hair much healthier, and smells great!</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine, and color treated hair and could easily look at my ends and see a bevy of split ends.</li>
            <li> My ends are slightly dry and easily damaged because I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Right now I am considering to copy paste my review to other popular Amazon Kerastase products as well so that people are aware of the risk.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was reluctant to spend so much money on a shampoo but seeing the drastic results the treatment had made I decided it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have not been able to buy it locally.</li>
            <li> One of the first five ingredients in this shampoo is Sodium Laurel Sulphate.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses it and recommended it for flat hair that could use more body.</li>
            <li> Before running out of the product I quickly ordered another batch on Amazon, however when it arrived I noticed the bottles were just slightly different from the original bottles I had purchased in the salon.</li>
            <li> This has been the best product I&#x27;ve ever used, the only other product that worked even close to this brand was Garnier Fructis&#x27; Sleek and Shine series, only.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair line is wonderful, a little expensive but so worth it, it leaves my hair so shiny, soft and smooth, can live with out it.</li>
            <li> It seems it helps strengthen my hair and certainly makes it shiny.  </li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that gives body to my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I see such a huge difference in the thickness and volume of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been useing this for about 6 years and it really helps your hair get stronger and stops hair loss....</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My initial thought was, \\&quot;can a shampoo really be worth that much money?\\&quot; but then realized that given how much I spend to color and cut my hair, that yes, it probably was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I&#x27;m not losing hair as much as it used to be.</li>
            <li> shampoos frizz my hair or leave too much residue and don&#x27;t wash out the oil.  </li>
            <li> and it really feels like you just walked out of a salon.  </li>
            <li> I Like it, its very relax,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner when you use this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It was because I had too much protein  built up in my hair.</li>
            <li> My color was fading fast as well</li>
            <li> but if you have the money and your hair really needs a boost from damage, I&#x27;d recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I saw results rather quickly and the shampoo really restored my hair back to health.  </li>
            <li> It is not worth the $10-20 in savings to damage your hair even more.</li>
            <li> I love this, the smell, the way it cleans using so little product in my very thick and long hair, love the way hair feels strong and so light after use.  </li>
            <li> Ok, Glamazons, you know I don&#x27;t lie when it comes to products and that I do not get paid by any company for reviews good or bad.</li>
            <li> More shine, less frizz.</li>
            <li> Now I only do it when I want a super sleek look.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lasted longer and is decent size, but it&#x27;s just too pricey for both consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and as I get older</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for women with ultra processes hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, and their conditioners are amazing, expensive but still worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> it is 100% fake or at the very least old.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, am I a sceptical person and can see that the hair salon seller has her own agenda and most likely wants to sell her products with a nice margin and does not want me to go to amazon and get it cheaper....</li>
            <li> I go to the finest of salons and use the most gentle products but the only way to achieve a color as blonde as I have is through multiple processes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve introduced several other people to this product and they all love it, too.</li>
            <li> It washes out cleanly and the conditioner is not heavy like other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I color my hair regularly, and I was also concerned that cheaper products were stripping the color out of my hair at a much faster rate.</li>
            <li> As a young woman, my hair was loaded with body, curl and wave.  </li>
            <li> However I&#x27;ve not noticed any considerable difference in the texture or health of my hair using it.</li>
            <li> I get a chance I will reach out to Kerastase and ask them directly and update you guys.</li>
            <li> You have to buy it from a professional, but you will get miraculous results.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I used to use this shampoo before I became a professional product ingredient specialist.</li>
            <li> My stylist swears by this line of products but my hair is so far gone</li>
            <li> And so far, no miracles.</li>
            <li> I never considered my favorite hair product until a few days ago when I finally stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Its not a bad shampoo but its definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have super processed hair (bleached, dyed, re-bleached, dyed again) which I blow dry and straighten constantly.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair blonde for the better part of 10 years, and my hair was a huge mess after I finally decided to go back to my natural of dark brown.  </li>
            <li> but her story was very convincing and I am left wondering and definitely hesitant to  buy any further Kerastase products at Amazon before I was not able clarify this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was in Paris recently, and all the high end salons carry the Kerastase products</li>
            <li> We recently moved to a new town</li>
            <li> This worked really well in conjuction with the conditioner in making my hair soft and saw a little difference in the dryness of my hair but didn&#x27;t see any difference in how much my hair would break and still saw the same amount of hair on the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> I held off because it&#x27;s not cheap, but I have to say, it does give my hair more fullness than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> a circumference of thickness barely wider than a marker.  </li>
            <li> So the difference in price between this brand and that one is obvious- which really destroys any theory that expensive shampoos are automatically better.  </li>
            <li> So, she swore that if I see products on amazon that they are most likely fake or at the very least passed the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;She went on saying that it is a well known problem that they come in original-style packaging but are filled not with the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Can tell a difference in breakage &amp; does not dry hair</li>
            <li> Cannot use other products because it not only halted the hair loss process it also really does reinforce weakened hair.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner I also purchased was actually drying my hair out even more and the longer I left it on the worse it would get.</li>
            <li> I wear a high volume platinum blonde (nearly white) and my hair naturally is almost black.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t weak or fragile, but it is fine and cranky.  </li>
            <li> After having used many other shampoos over the years and not happy with the results I tried Kerastase and could not be any happier with the results and have been using it for several years..........</li>
            <li> It is a little bit more expensive than an average shampoo, but it worth it to buy it your hair is damaged.</li>
            <li> but my hair lifted naturally in a way it hasn&#x27;t with any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This has helped get my hair back to normal and have a little resiliance</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> It falls flat on my head, even using hair products like mousse that is supposed to give your hair a boost were failing me.  </li>
            <li> I used to always need to flat iron my hair to keep the frizzies at bay.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair, and my friend has short curly hair.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit is enough for a single use and the bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Despite being somewhat on the expensive side I will definitely be re-purchasing this fantastic product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried just tons of shampoos, cheap and expensive, as well as try and figure out what I may be missing in my diet to help my hair naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying it for a long time now</li>
            <li> I expected the opposite effect!  </li>
            <li> You do not want to use it long term if you&#x27;re gonna go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a tiny bit of shampoo, less than a quarter dollop works for me.</li>
            <li> The treatment lasted about 5 days and then it was back to the same mess I had</li>
            <li> In other words, my hair is utter</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always struggled with the frizzies along with dry brittle strands.</li>
            <li> Made my hair really dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> dry the hair (or even if you don&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> My hair is still feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> I initially used this everyday, then after about a month I started using this about twice a week with my regular shampoo</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the type of hair that gets so oily, it looks like I&#x27;ve gone a week without bathing in less than 24, especially if I don&#x27;t lift it up in some hairspray.  </li>
            <li> It is very dry and stringy.</li>
            <li> Little too pricy for me and not enough results.</li>
            <li> and so I only use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on products that didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> shipped as i expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have really thin and straight hair</li>
            <li> They are expensive, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it act like a harsh detergent, it strips your color.</li>
            <li> You can also buy Aphogee from Sally&#x27;s and do it yourself, but, read the directions on the bottle carefully before you do.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure, it&#x27;s worth trying at least once!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy a product at amazon due to the additional shipping fees.</li>
            <li> I like it, a small amount is enough and it did improve my hair</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star due to the price</li>
            <li> This really dry my hair like straw !!!</li>
            <li> this product is overpriced and is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It took a few washings with other products but the itching has stopped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot less fallout and breakage since I started using this shampoo, and my hair is even shinier.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t awful, wasn&#x27;t amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have limp, damaged, oily-fine hair that is also prone to frizzing if I forgo conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say these products nearly destroyed my hair all over again.</li>
            <li> and I have issues with some shampoos making it too heavy</li>
            <li> I usually have to wash, condition, use some sort of styling/lifting cream, then immediately blow-dry my hair in order to give it any sort of lift.. then put on half a can of hairspray.  </li>
            <li> It really is expensive, but I have short hair</li>
            <li> Only cons I can think of is that it&#x27;s quite expensive and not organic.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged (sadly), my hair lost all the body.  </li>
            <li> My hair sits beautifully (no more flyaways!)</li>
            <li> , thats a thing of the past!  </li>
            <li> My hair needed some serious TLC.  </li>
            <li> I am a sucker for kerastase and if you want strength and restoration, use this line!  </li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with the way other shampoos left my hair very dull with lots of those annoying little flyaways.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for little result</li>
            <li> It dried my scalp so bad, so I ended up buying Nizoral to get rid of dandruff.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but does what it says it will</li>
            <li> Too expensive, unfortunately, for me</li>
            <li> Possibly a fake product??</li>
            <li> My stylist has noticed a dramatic difference in my hair too!</li>
            <li> My hair got worst with this shampoo: became my hair too dry!!!  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sad to be unable to use this brand all the time.  </li>
            <li> This brand just happens to be.. very, expensive.  </li>
            <li> , it was bad.  </li>
            <li> When has leaving conditioner on for longer ever been bad for hair?</li>
            <li> About two weeks ago, my scalp began to itch terribly.</li>
            <li> There is no flaking or dryness, just a terrible itching that interrupted my sleep and activities!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this shampoo for leaving my very dry hair so smooth and shiny.  I also like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I have been useing this for about 6 years and it really helps your hair get stronger and stops hair loss....i am very very happy about it...</li>
            <li> This worked really well in conjuction with the conditioner in making my hair soft and saw a little difference in the dryness of my hair but didn&#x27;t see any difference in how much my hair would break and still saw the same amount of hair on the bathroom floor. Little too pricy for me and not enough results.</li>
            <li> Bain de Force has become my all time favorite shampoo. Up until I switched to Kerastase I was very unhappy with the way other shampoos left my hair very dull with lots of those annoying little flyaways. I color my hair regularly, and I was also concerned that cheaper products were stripping the color out of my hair at a much faster rate. (Turns out they were.) I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last year and it has been AMAZING. It leaves my baby fine hair super shiny and nourished. My hair sits beautifully (no more flyaways!) and looks like I&#x27;ve just left the salon. All in all I am very impressed with this product. Despite being somewhat on the expensive side I will definitely be re-purchasing this fantastic product.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is awesome, my hair is really smooth and shiny, I recomend this product, because any other shampoo made in my weakened hair this results.....I like it!</li>
            <li> As a young woman, my hair was loaded with body, curl and wave.  As I&#x27;ve aged (sadly), my hair lost all the body.  It falls flat on my head, even using hair products like mousse that is supposed to give your hair a boost were failing me.  I read numerous materials about various products -- Pantene is pretty good, but it still wasn&#x27;t great.  I finally ordered the Kerastase.  I held off because it&#x27;s not cheap, but I have to say, it does give my hair more fullness than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Super great for my hair!  Love Kerastase.  I bleached my hair blonde for the better part of 10 years, and my hair was a huge mess after I finally decided to go back to my natural of dark brown.  Split ends, wouldn&#x27;t grow out nice, it was bad.  My hair needed some serious TLC.  I initially used this everyday, then after about a month I started using this about twice a week with my regular shampoo and it&#x27;s perfect!  My hair is beautiful again.</li>
            <li> I love this, the smell, the way it cleans using so little product in my very thick and long hair, love the way hair feels strong and so light after use.  I have been using for 2 years now as my sole shampoo and can say that it is worth every penny and more.  My hair now feels a lot stronger, and I use to shed when washing hair, thats a thing of the past!  I hope this works as well for you as it does for me. This is the best shampoo I have used so far.  I am a sucker for kerastase and if you want strength and restoration, use this line!  This shampoo+ ciment thermique+ masquintense&#x3D; heaven for your hair.</li>
            <li> I love this hair line is wonderful, a little expensive but so worth it, it leaves my hair so shiny, soft and smooth, can live with out it. People often stop me on the street to ask me about my hair, what I use, etc. I have natural curly hair, and a great hair dresser, who works hard when I want my hair straighten, but I will not get the same results w/o this product, so is the perfect combination....</li>
            <li> After having used many other shampoos over the years and not happy with the results I tried Kerastase and could not be any happier with the results and have been using it for several years..........</li>
            <li> Fair enough.  Wasn&#x27;t awful, wasn&#x27;t amazing.  Also wasn&#x27;t worth the price in relation to how well it performed.  The. End.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works good but It has too many damaging sulfates. I bought the hair mask and leave in hair milk those are amazing! I would not purchase this shampoo again I would rather use an organic shapmoo with no sulfates. But I will purchase the hair mask and hair milk again.</li>
            <li> Its not a bad shampoo but its definitely not worth the price. I know that Kerastase has great products like the Elixir Ultime but this is not it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it you.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  It lathers well, smells nice and my hair is already in better shape after only 3 shampoos.  It is expensive but does what it says it will, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on products that didn&#x27;t.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine and I&#x27;ve always struggled with the frizzies along with dry brittle strands. Adding highlights to my hair doesn&#x27;t help with those issues. My stylist recommended this shampoo to me. My initial thought was, \\&quot;can a shampoo really be worth that much money?\\&quot; but then realized that given how much I spend to color and cut my hair, that yes, it probably was worth a try. I use this along with the Kerastase Resistance Ciment Thermique and now my hair is smooth. I used to always need to flat iron my hair to keep the frizzies at bay. Now I only do it when I want a super sleek look. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It strengthens hair, like it says it does.  I&#x27;ve had a lot less fallout and breakage since I started using this shampoo, and my hair is even shinier.  It really is expensive, but I have short hair and so I only use a little at a time.</li>
            <li> I use Kerastase a lot and ther product is always great! This stuff works wonders, by far the best shampoo out there!</li>
            <li> this product is overpriced and is not worth the money. I&#x27;ve experienced just as much or even more hair loss and the shampoo leaves my hair brittle. also, there&#x27;re a LOT of harmful chemicals in the ingredient. I should have thought twice before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, fine, bleached hair. The bleach as done a lot of damage to my hair. It is very dry and stringy. My stylist used a Kerastase treatment ($45 in salon) on my hair that made my hair look 100% healthy and glossy. The treatment lasted about 5 days and then it was back to the same mess I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reluctant to spend so much money on a shampoo but seeing the drastic results the treatment had made I decided it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a grapefruit smell when applying but once I rinse it out I can&#x27;t smell it at all. Very good for me since I am allergic to strong smells. You only need to use a tiny bit of shampoo, less than a quarter dollop works for me. So this bottle will last a while. I don&#x27;t scrub this into my hair I just kind of lightly smooth it around with my palms and fingers flat. It is enough to get all of yesterdays product out of my hair without damaging it by scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow with the corresponding conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been really pleased with the results the product has given to my hair. It looks very healthy and shiny. My fly-away ends are improved (I use coconut oil to smooth them down).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star for the price. I think it should be priced to be available to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shampoos that I have ever used. It is a little bit more expensive than an average shampoo, but it worth it to buy it your hair is damaged.</li>
            <li> I had just a week using this product and my hear is dryer. I&#x27;m using a conditioner to help it. I noticed that I&#x27;m not losing hair as much as it used to be.</li>
            <li> Made my hair really dry and brittle. It took weeks to restore it back to the condition it was in before I bought this shampoo (which already wasn&#x27;t great).</li>
            <li> my hair is very fine and this shampoo has been a saving grace.  it has made my hair feel thicker and have more depth.</li>
            <li> This is an Awesome product!! I really Love the old formula!! My hair feels so good!! Worth every penny !</li>
            <li> Every now and then I treat myself to a bottle of this great shampoo.  Each time I do, my hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t weak or fragile, but it is fine and cranky.  This shampoo shines and calms my hair.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product - really makes a difference on my hair.  I also recommend the conditioner as well.  Great product for sure!</li>
            <li> I have limp, damaged, oily-fine hair that is also prone to frizzing if I forgo conditioner.  I can gather my hair up with my thumb and pointer finger... a circumference of thickness barely wider than a marker.  I can wash my hair at night, and after 6 hours of sleep, I&#x27;ll wake up like it was never washed at all.  It&#x27;s the type of hair that gets so oily, it looks like I&#x27;ve gone a week without bathing in less than 24, especially if I don&#x27;t lift it up in some hairspray.  In other words, my hair is utter crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried just tons of shampoos, cheap and expensive, as well as try and figure out what I may be missing in my diet to help my hair naturally. This has been the best product I&#x27;ve ever used, the only other product that worked even close to this brand was Garnier Fructis&#x27; Sleek and Shine series, only.  So the difference in price between this brand and that one is obvious- which really destroys any theory that expensive shampoos are automatically better.  This brand just happens to be.. very, expensive.  Too expensive, unfortunately, for me and I won&#x27;t be able to use it consistently.  I really wish they would be more reasonable on the price, especially for the size of the conditioner (which I always have to use more of than shampoo).  The shampoo lasted longer and is decent size, but it&#x27;s just too pricey for both consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most shampoos frizz my hair or leave too much residue and don&#x27;t wash out the oil.  This shampoo feels really great to wash in.. you can just feel your hair improving.  It washes out cleanly and the conditioner is not heavy like other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blow dry the hair (or even if you don&#x27;t) and it really feels like you just walked out of a salon.  My hair was so shiny, it felt like I had \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in it, that gave it a waxy feel but my hair lifted naturally in a way it hasn&#x27;t with any other shampoo.  It looked like I had put some sort of styling cream in it.  I usually have to wash, condition, use some sort of styling/lifting cream, then immediately blow-dry my hair in order to give it any sort of lift.. then put on half a can of hairspray.  I was just absolutely impressed with how well this brand got me to that level by just being washed in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sad to be unable to use this brand all the time.  When you got the money, use it.  If you&#x27;re not sure, it&#x27;s worth trying at least once!</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers nice, smells good, etc. However I&#x27;ve not noticed any considerable difference in the texture or health of my hair using it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. My long brown hair is shinning with this amazing shampoo.I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I regularly highlight my hair and although I use salon shampoo/conditioner I felt as though my hair needed something extra. My ends are slightly dry and easily damaged because I have fine hair. I bought this because I have the deep conditioner by Kerastase that I use once a week (and LOVE!!!)  I am extremely happy with this shampoo. It lathers very well and you only need a small amount. I mix it with other conditioners and my hair looks and feels great. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I Like it, its very relax, good very good...................I like it, very nice, I like it, good, very good ;)</li>
            <li> shipped as i expected but the item didn&#x27;t work for my kind of hair</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month, but didnt see any changes. Above all there are parabens in it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great! I have long curly hair, and my friend has short curly hair. We both love this product!</li>
            <li> Great quality &amp; fast delivery! We are very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> My hair is still feeling dry.  I purchased this 3 years ago with different results.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my hair or the product</li>
            <li> This really dry my hair like straw !!! Am still trying to recover! P.S I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> excellent shampoo performed as expected will order again when I can find it on the site do have to take time to find it</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been buying it for a long time now and it still gives me beautiful results.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found that gives body to my fine hair.  I can definitely tell a difference if I use something else.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo that keeps your hair silky and smooth but also adds body.  My hairdresser uses it and recommended it for flat hair that could use more body. Only cons I can think of is that it&#x27;s quite expensive and not organic.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy a product at amazon due to the additional shipping fees. Today I passed by a salon and saw it, told her my story and purchased it there for the original price. Even though I am more on the sceptical side she explained me very, very convincingly that Kerastase does not approve selling through any channels other than their approved salons and that they NEVER EVER go on sale. So, she swore that if I see products on amazon that they are most likely fake or at the very least passed the expiration date.&lt;br /&gt;She went on saying that it is a well known problem that they come in original-style packaging but are filled not with the real stuff. Also, should it be a price anything below the original sales price it is 100% fake or at the very least old.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I mentioned at the beginning, am I a sceptical person and can see that the hair salon seller has her own agenda and most likely wants to sell her products with a nice margin and does not want me to go to amazon and get it cheaper.... but her story was very convincing and I am left wondering and definitely hesitant to  buy any further Kerastase products at Amazon before I was not able clarify this matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a chance I will reach out to Kerastase and ask them directly and update you guys. Right now I am considering to copy paste my review to other popular Amazon Kerastase products as well so that people are aware of the risk.</li>
            <li> I used it twice and I can already tell my hair looks healthier! More shine, less frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair got worst with this shampoo: became my hair too dry!!!  I expected the opposite effect!  Before I use another shampoo of Loreal (Evercream,  absolut repair) and I like.</li>
            <li> Have been a long-time fan of this product. A co-worker recommended use about 13 years when I experienced more hair loss than usual. Cannot use other products because it not only halted the hair loss process it also really does reinforce weakened hair.  Recent purchase at a great price put the icing on the cake!</li>
            <li> I have super processed hair (bleached, dyed, re-bleached, dyed again) which I blow dry and straighten constantly. This shampoo gets my hair perfectly clean but is incredibly gentle. I almost don&#x27;t need to use conditioner with it. This plus the bain de force mask, also Kerastase, has made a world of difference in my hair. It&#x27;s expensive, but definitely worth it. I&#x27;ve introduced several other people to this product and they all love it, too.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this shampoo. I used the Cristal Kerastase shampoo for about a year and then my hairdresser recommended Resistance Bain de Force. I see such a huge difference in the thickness and volume of my hair. I have really thin and straight hair so this definitely helps!</li>
            <li> ALL Keratase products are amazing - best to examine the line carefully for your specific need or ask your hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and products that this company puts out I was a blonde at the time now I am back to dark brown but excellent product all of them!!!!</li>
            <li> I like it, a small amount is enough and it did improve my hair</li>
            <li> I first purchased Kerastase in my salon and was astounded at how amazing my hair looked and felt. I have very long, fine, and color treated hair and could easily look at my ends and see a bevy of split ends. After using the Bain De Force I truly couldn&#x27;t see all those split ends any longer, my hair felt healthy for the first time in a decade. Before running out of the product I quickly ordered another batch on Amazon, however when it arrived I noticed the bottles were just slightly different from the original bottles I had purchased in the salon. I thought it was no big deal, perhaps the packaging had recently changed. The shampoo smelled the same but the real shampoo should be a milky white color, this product had a green tint to it. The conditioner I also purchased was actually drying my hair out even more and the longer I left it on the worse it would get. When has leaving conditioner on for longer ever been bad for hair? Needless to say these products nearly destroyed my hair all over again. It is not worth the $10-20 in savings to damage your hair even more. DON&#x27;T BUY, unless it is from a salon. The different is night and day. I do not work for a salon nor do I endorse one, I only endorse that fact that for once I could tolerate how good my hair looked and this product destroyed that.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product after I damaged my hair with another product.  I saw results rather quickly and the shampoo really restored my hair back to health.  I was in Paris recently, and all the high end salons carry the Kerastase products so you know that they are really excellent.  I gave it a 4 star due to the price but if you have the money and your hair really needs a boost from damage, I&#x27;d recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great for my fine hair!  My stylist has noticed a dramatic difference in my hair too! Great product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Really repaired my hair to the point that I was able to &amp;#34;downgrade&amp;#34; to the Nutriv line, hehe. Great for super damaged hair</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used.  It seems it helps strengthen my hair and certainly makes it shiny.  A tiny bit is enough for a single use and the bottle lasts a long time.  I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now and absolutely love it. We recently moved to a new town and I have not been able to buy it locally. So I ordered through amazon.  About two weeks ago, my scalp began to itch terribly. There is no flaking or dryness, just a terrible itching that interrupted my sleep and activities! For ten days, I tried different avenues to stop the itching but nothing worked. I never considered my favorite hair product until a few days ago when I finally stopped using it. It took a few washings with other products but the itching has stopped. Possibly a fake product??</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo! Definitley worth it! It makes thin hair much healthier, and smells great! Love! Love! Love!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and as I get older I see it breaking and falling out all the time. This has helped get my hair back to normal and have a little resiliance</li>
            <li> It got Here to my house fats</li>
            <li> Great deal all around</li>
            <li> This shampoo didn&#x27;t mKe my hair dry, but gave it a lot of body.i was very satisfied with the feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly and the conditioner. I highly recommend it ! It also has a nicer perfume than the others.</li>
            <li> ...my girlfriend loves it!!! The differece between Kerastase products and others are visible and palpable!!&lt;br /&gt;Of course they are more expensive, but it makes her happy!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s my new favorite. I&#x27;m going to try it on my girls&#x27; hair next. Thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent product --- this is the only shampoo I use for my hair.  My hair is baby fine and I have issues with some shampoos making it too heavy but the Kerastase is perfect for my type of hair.  It nourishes it as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff in AWESOME!!  All the products are and smell delicious!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair has shine and fullness even after I colored it!</li>
            <li> I love Kerastase!!!  I would highly recommend this product, and their conditioners are amazing, expensive but still worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Kerastase products are the best.  They are expensive, but well worth it.  This shampoo is what they use at the salon that I go to.  It is for hair that is weakened by color or bleach.  You really don&#x27;t even have to use conditioner when you use this shampoo.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It dried my scalp so bad, so I ended up buying Nizoral to get rid of dandruff. it smells nice, but that&#x27;s about it,</li>
            <li> Very expensive for little result</li>
            <li> Can tell a difference in breakage &amp; does not dry hair</li>
            <li> Ok, Glamazons, you know I don&#x27;t lie when it comes to products and that I do not get paid by any company for reviews good or bad. With that being said, do not spend your money here. One of the first five ingredients in this shampoo is Sodium Laurel Sulphate. Not only does it act like a harsh detergent, it strips your color. On a good note, this shampoo does contain protein. You do not want to use it long term if you&#x27;re gonna go ahead and buy it. It will start to do the opposite and your hair will start to break. If you&#x27;re looking for a great line that was developed for really damaged hair, try de&#x27;Cinque Science. You have to buy it from a professional, but you will get miraculous results. You can also buy Aphogee from Sally&#x27;s and do it yourself, but, read the directions on the bottle carefully before you do. In all honesty, I used to use this shampoo before I became a professional product ingredient specialist. I didn&#x27;t understand why it stopped working after about three weeks of using it. It was because I had too much protein  built up in my hair. My color was fading fast as well and I was doing my color every 2 weeks. Not kidding. This line is owned by Loreal btw.&lt;br /&gt;xoxoxo&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro</li>
            <li> Loved it so much purchased it twice.  I wear a high volume platinum blonde (nearly white) and my hair naturally is almost black. I go to the finest of salons and use the most gentle products but the only way to achieve a color as blonde as I have is through multiple processes.  Thats where Kerastase comes in.  This product truly restores the damage and keratin lost.  I highly recommend for women with ultra processes hair. Best with the Masque Force Architecte.  Use levels 3-4 for lots of damage, levels 1-2 for moderate damage.</li>
            <li> My stylist swears by this line of products but my hair is so far gone I don&#x27;t expect any miracles. And so far, no miracles.</li>
