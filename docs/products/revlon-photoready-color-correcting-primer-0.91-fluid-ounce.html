            <li>I did not experience any of the flaking or balling during the day that some of the reviewers experienced, I did allow the primer to set before appying anything else to my face for about 5 to 7 mins.  </li>

            <li>It covers/blends very nicely...</li>
            <li>However, when I followed it up with a moisturizer containing SPF the results were AMAZING!</li>
            <li>My makeup goes over it perfectly and I love that my complexion looks amazing all day.</li>
            <li>A must have when you&#x27;re in a budget for good quality make up</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I recommend this primer works really good.</li>
            <li>And it has always been good to me.</li>
            <li>, I sometimes just wear it without any foundation because it feels that good.</li>
            <li>we have fair skin tone</li>
            <li>It makes my foundation look smooth and flawless</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li>However, I am pretty impressed!</li>
            <li>I have tried other primers, but this one has the best color enhancement and makes the skin feel flawless.</li>
            <li>we both love it!</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this ladies!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>If you have pores around your nose, this product covers them nicely.</li>
            <li>Effective for skin imperfections on non face areas too.</li>
            <li>It controls shine and just kind of smoothes out your skin.</li>
            <li>But It does feel really nice to use.</li>
            <li>This primer spreads really nicely and is creamy yet powdery.</li>
            <li>Flawless coverage, moisturizers your skin, not too heavy, not oily, perfect!!!</li>
            <li>In order for this primer to look nice</li>
            <li>Easy to blend it, and so good that I often don&#x27;t put foundation over it;</li>
            <li>nice for very light coverage</li>
            <li>still pretty great, feels oft on your skin, but I fell like it is heavier than the perecting primer.</li>
            <li>so I was expecting to use it mostly to even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It also makes my foundation a lot more smoother to blend.</li>
            <li>, it felt smooth and looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My husband says that my face tone is more even now since I have been wearing it.</li>
            <li>Was able to touch my face</li>
            <li>Eventually, I break the top off and scrape it out.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It evened out my skin tone and made my makeup look more matte</li>
            <li>It feels nice and smooth putting it on</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s subscribe and save-</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my bottle in April, and it has been consistently wonderful for the last 3 months.</li>
            <li>It is OK.</li>
            <li>Just need to use more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this primer.</li>
            <li>This primer is reasonably priced and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>My skin appears to be softer, clearer and with a more uniform aspect when I wear it.</li>
            <li>When this was revealed I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy; I love Revlon&#x27;s cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>This is something that they come up with in the lab before coming up with something better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>A tube would be much better.</li>
            <li>Then when you buy this product and put foundation over it, you are going to so pleased how your skin is smoothed out.  </li>
            <li>but i am glad i changed my mind.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;• Absorbs oil and reduces shine for most of the day&lt;</li>
            <li>wear this primer alone on most days.</li>
            <li>it works pretty good for that purpose.</li>
            <li>Wow this is smooth, Goes on neat and so good!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced the flakiness, but I wear this primer under the Clear Face Neutrogena sunblock, which sometimes flakes off.</li>
            <li>I also felt that my foundation went on more smoothly over this primer.  </li>
            <li>Am in awh, that a cheap product from Revlon works better that my here&#x27;s my list  Clinique Arboone, Estee Laurer, Lancolmn.  </li>
            <li>My skin was velvet soft, smooth and looked pretty much flawless.  </li>
            <li>Great primer, really does keep my look fresh all day.</li>
            <li>One tip - it doesn&#x27;t work as well if you moisturize first, which is kind of a bummer...</li>
            <li>My favorite :) Fast shipping and works wonders for me!</li>
            <li>This primer is easy to apply and goes onto my face smoothly.  </li>
            <li>loved it, it brightens the skin, and makes a good look, Makes the skin look dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine, it absorbs well and sits under my Photoready foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a huge benefit to the color correction.  </li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>I have primarily been using it after morning face cleansing, without using makeup over it.</li>
            <li>primer feels so smooth on my skin</li>
            <li>This also mattifies my face which is great because I have oily skin, especially in the t-zone area.  </li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap and I feel as though we were a paying study group.  </li>
            <li>It rubbed on smoothly.</li>
            <li>My skin is already smooth</li>
            <li>and FREE SHIPPING</li>
            <li>I love this product, would 100% recomened it to a friend and will certainly purchase this product again!,</li>
            <li>this primer will be a bit more drying and may not be a good choice as I could see it emphasizing dry spots on our skin.</li>
            <li>but it does help my makeup stay on and looking fresh!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super smooth to apply, it&#x27;s not tick.</li>
            <li>I have many acne scars on my face and this certainly doesn’t conceal them but it does help mask them.</li>
            <li>And it does lengthen cosmetic wear time so it;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, it looked fine for awhile</li>
            <li>In love with the product and thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Great product for uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>Price is worth it..</li>
            <li>Works fabulous, better than the big name brands.</li>
            <li>Other than needing to be fast after applying this I think this is a great product</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any reduction in my pore size, but the redness faded significantly after letting the product sink into my skin.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;fine&#x27; lines around my eyes and my laugh lines seemed to nearly dissapear.  </li>
            <li>and it really does help to smooth out the skin really well.</li>
            <li>This primer is light, colorless, and very soft on your skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good when first applied, but if my face gets rubbed even a little bit</li>
            <li>It is light and airy, not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I first put it on</li>
            <li>I used this primer with the revlon photo ready combination/oily skin foundation and revlon powder!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>It evens out my color and leaves the skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Like I always do, I tested it on my wrist first before I put it on my face.</li>
            <li>However, it has a funny smell I can&#x27;t get over.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first primer I have ever used, and I like it.</li>
            <li>Its not the best primer I have used, but it does the trick for filling in my pores, the tone of it is slightly too pink</li>
            <li>product goes on very smooth - leaving a perfect base for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>This primer pretty much does all the work.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I applied too much</li>
            <li>this is okay mainly because of the price that I can currently afford.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that this accentuates that in any significant way, but next order I&#x27;m going to try a different shade of primer and see if I&#x27;m more enthused with the results.</li>
            <li>When I went to apply it, on certain areas the foundation would just attach to the primer and not want to blend.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;color correcting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s transparent and really holds my foundation a little bit longer, lovely!</li>
            <li>I have pretty decent skin already</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The color correcting really does help.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>but I really just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Until now , this product has no sparkle and it really is tone correcting.</li>
            <li>also, the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on very well</li>
            <li>product to make  your skin ready to apply makeup or not.  </li>
            <li>I was really doubting it since I have been trying for about 2 years now..</li>
            <li>Yep, I went for the 4th bottle because I really, really like the primer.</li>
            <li>, even with the lid on securely and with daily use, the product hardens up in the nozzle.</li>
            <li>for me, thanks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a difference with this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much correcting with this primer.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this primer.</li>
            <li>I put it on and about an hour later lightly scratched my cheek and the product flaked off.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and sun spots, and this primer reduces the redness, controls the shine and optically decreases the size of the pores.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t see to much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I have really oily, shiny skin.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are buying this product to reduce redness it won&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>I really like this primer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So excited to finally found my it products!</li>
            <li>It creates a nice matte finish and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>It makes foundation feel a bit cakey and the foundation doesn&#x27;t settle as nicely, which is the exact opposite of the expected effect!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, and I only use this product as my primary makeup.</li>
            <li>I have bought the expensive department store brands that most women love...</li>
            <li>Before I purchased this I was looking for a decently priced primer from a quality brand.  </li>
            <li>The one time I tried to use foundation over it, it made the foundation hard to spread and kind of cakey looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used MANY primers, Smashbox, Clinique, Sephora, L&#x27;oreal and Cargo to name a few.</li>
            <li>I had a reaction (red bumps everywhere) to a more expensive primer that I tried, but this one has been kind to my skin.  </li>
            <li>One positive thing about the pump is that it does allow you to carefully measure out how much you use, probably preventing overuse!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel too dry if used without moisturizer, but I would definitely prefer some more moisture on my face.</li>
            <li>but I put foundation right over it so its no big deal.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping to save money on more expensive primers, but now I&#x27;m throwing this away and scared to waste more money on trying to find an adequate but cheaper primer.</li>
            <li>Nothing that has been mentioned here negatively about it my wife experienced, which leads me to the logical conclusion that it has different effects on different people (different skin types)</li>
            <li>Well to put it simply, the product smells exactly how it feels.</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone completely!</li>
            <li>This cheap product goes on slightly drying.  </li>
            <li>I have only positive things to say about the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what they put in it, but every time I tried to use this product, my face broke out with large red bumps.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and did reduce redness, but like a couple of the other reviews mention, it flakes off!!</li>
            <li>The cheaper brands are okay but don&#x27;t give you that nice even base that you need.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, stay away.  </li>
            <li>I naturally have oily skin</li>
            <li>I 30 yrs old</li>
            <li>I was really surprised that a drugstore primer would outperform high-end primers, but this one sets my makeup and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive</li>
            <li>But I am a natural redhead (now dyed blonde/brown) and already have somewhat of a pinkish complexion.</li>
            <li>I use this primer, then apply L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Secrets Professional Color</li>
            <li>I do have a sensitive nose, so maybe it won&#x27;t bother everyone, but for me it is a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>The primer looks okay when you put it on a clean face, but as soon as you apply foundation on top it flakes off and looks terrible.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I am searching for a new one is because I would like to find one that is naturally derived and yet functional.</li>
            <li>buy again when I run out -- it goes a long way and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>If I put this on in the morning and then apply my usual face makeup, I am literally shine free ALL day.  </li>
            <li>Does make my makeup last longer, I don&#x27;t really think the color actually evens my skin tone though.</li>
            <li>previous comment on the bottle/pump design is right on.</li>
            <li>This is a very good base primer.</li>
            <li>I have a very lite skin tone, I like the pink hue of this primer.</li>
            <li>If I even touched my face, the primer would rub together into these little grayish balls and flake right off.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product because it said I could wear without other makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have spent 1000$ in the past couple years to find the right make up line for me!</li>

            <li> Makeup stays on and in still looking good mode all day, and I have combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this primer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this primer and would reccommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, quality primer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li> However, I am pretty impressed!</li>
            <li> I have tried other primers, but this one has the best color enhancement and makes the skin feel flawless.</li>
            <li> we both love it!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this ladies!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> If you have pores around your nose, this product covers them nicely.</li>
            <li> Effective for skin imperfections on non face areas too.</li>
            <li> It controls shine and just kind of smoothes out your skin.</li>
            <li> But It does feel really nice to use.</li>
            <li> This primer spreads really nicely and is creamy yet powdery.</li>
            <li> Flawless coverage, moisturizers your skin, not too heavy, not oily, perfect!!!</li>
            <li> In order for this primer to look nice</li>
            <li> Easy to blend it, and so good that I often don&#x27;t put foundation over it;</li>
            <li> nice for very light coverage</li>
            <li> still pretty great, feels oft on your skin, but I fell like it is heavier than the perecting primer.</li>
            <li> so I was expecting to use it mostly to even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It also makes my foundation a lot more smoother to blend.</li>
            <li> , it felt smooth and looked amazing.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My husband says that my face tone is more even now since I have been wearing it.</li>
            <li> Was able to touch my face</li>
            <li> Eventually, I break the top off and scrape it out.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> It evened out my skin tone and made my makeup look more matte</li>
            <li> It feels nice and smooth putting it on</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s subscribe and save-</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my bottle in April, and it has been consistently wonderful for the last 3 months.</li>
            <li> It is OK.</li>
            <li> Just need to use more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this primer.</li>
            <li> This primer is reasonably priced and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> My skin appears to be softer, clearer and with a more uniform aspect when I wear it.</li>
            <li> When this was revealed I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy; I love Revlon&#x27;s cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> This is something that they come up with in the lab before coming up with something better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> A tube would be much better.</li>
            <li> Then when you buy this product and put foundation over it, you are going to so pleased how your skin is smoothed out.  </li>
            <li> but i am glad i changed my mind.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;• Absorbs oil and reduces shine for most of the day&lt;</li>
            <li> wear this primer alone on most days.</li>
            <li> it works pretty good for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Wow this is smooth, Goes on neat and so good!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced the flakiness, but I wear this primer under the Clear Face Neutrogena sunblock, which sometimes flakes off.</li>
            <li> I also felt that my foundation went on more smoothly over this primer.  </li>
            <li> Am in awh, that a cheap product from Revlon works better that my here&#x27;s my list  Clinique Arboone, Estee Laurer, Lancolmn.  </li>
            <li> My skin was velvet soft, smooth and looked pretty much flawless.  </li>
            <li> Great primer, really does keep my look fresh all day.</li>
            <li> One tip - it doesn&#x27;t work as well if you moisturize first, which is kind of a bummer...</li>
            <li> My favorite :) Fast shipping and works wonders for me!</li>
            <li> This primer is easy to apply and goes onto my face smoothly.  </li>
            <li> loved it, it brightens the skin, and makes a good look, Makes the skin look dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, it absorbs well and sits under my Photoready foundation smoothly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a huge benefit to the color correction.  </li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> Goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> I have primarily been using it after morning face cleansing, without using makeup over it.</li>
            <li> primer feels so smooth on my skin</li>
            <li> This also mattifies my face which is great because I have oily skin, especially in the t-zone area.  </li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap and I feel as though we were a paying study group.  </li>
            <li> It rubbed on smoothly.</li>
            <li> My skin is already smooth</li>
            <li> and FREE SHIPPING</li>
            <li> I love this product, would 100% recomened it to a friend and will certainly purchase this product again!,</li>
            <li> this primer will be a bit more drying and may not be a good choice as I could see it emphasizing dry spots on our skin.</li>
            <li> but it does help my makeup stay on and looking fresh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super smooth to apply, it&#x27;s not tick.</li>
            <li> I have many acne scars on my face and this certainly doesn’t conceal them but it does help mask them.</li>
            <li> And it does lengthen cosmetic wear time so it;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, it looked fine for awhile</li>
            <li> In love with the product and thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great product for uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Price is worth it..</li>
            <li> Works fabulous, better than the big name brands.</li>
            <li> Other than needing to be fast after applying this I think this is a great product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any reduction in my pore size, but the redness faded significantly after letting the product sink into my skin.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;fine&#x27; lines around my eyes and my laugh lines seemed to nearly dissapear.  </li>
            <li> and it really does help to smooth out the skin really well.</li>
            <li> This primer is light, colorless, and very soft on your skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good when first applied, but if my face gets rubbed even a little bit</li>
            <li> It is light and airy, not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I first put it on</li>
            <li> I used this primer with the revlon photo ready combination/oily skin foundation and revlon powder!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> It evens out my color and leaves the skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Like I always do, I tested it on my wrist first before I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> However, it has a funny smell I can&#x27;t get over.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first primer I have ever used, and I like it.</li>
            <li> Its not the best primer I have used, but it does the trick for filling in my pores, the tone of it is slightly too pink</li>
            <li> product goes on very smooth - leaving a perfect base for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> This primer pretty much does all the work.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I applied too much</li>
            <li> this is okay mainly because of the price that I can currently afford.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that this accentuates that in any significant way, but next order I&#x27;m going to try a different shade of primer and see if I&#x27;m more enthused with the results.</li>
            <li> When I went to apply it, on certain areas the foundation would just attach to the primer and not want to blend.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;color correcting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s transparent and really holds my foundation a little bit longer, lovely!</li>
            <li> I have pretty decent skin already</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The color correcting really does help.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> but I really just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Until now , this product has no sparkle and it really is tone correcting.</li>
            <li> also, the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on very well</li>
            <li> product to make  your skin ready to apply makeup or not.  </li>
            <li> I was really doubting it since I have been trying for about 2 years now..</li>
            <li> Yep, I went for the 4th bottle because I really, really like the primer.</li>
            <li> , even with the lid on securely and with daily use, the product hardens up in the nozzle.</li>
            <li> for me, thanks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a difference with this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much correcting with this primer.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this primer.</li>
            <li> I put it on and about an hour later lightly scratched my cheek and the product flaked off.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and sun spots, and this primer reduces the redness, controls the shine and optically decreases the size of the pores.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t see to much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I have really oily, shiny skin.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are buying this product to reduce redness it won&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> I really like this primer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So excited to finally found my it products!</li>
            <li> It creates a nice matte finish and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> It makes foundation feel a bit cakey and the foundation doesn&#x27;t settle as nicely, which is the exact opposite of the expected effect!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, and I only use this product as my primary makeup.</li>
            <li> I have bought the expensive department store brands that most women love...</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this I was looking for a decently priced primer from a quality brand.  </li>
            <li> The one time I tried to use foundation over it, it made the foundation hard to spread and kind of cakey looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used MANY primers, Smashbox, Clinique, Sephora, L&#x27;oreal and Cargo to name a few.</li>
            <li> I had a reaction (red bumps everywhere) to a more expensive primer that I tried, but this one has been kind to my skin.  </li>
            <li> One positive thing about the pump is that it does allow you to carefully measure out how much you use, probably preventing overuse!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel too dry if used without moisturizer, but I would definitely prefer some more moisture on my face.</li>
            <li> but I put foundation right over it so its no big deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to save money on more expensive primers, but now I&#x27;m throwing this away and scared to waste more money on trying to find an adequate but cheaper primer.</li>
            <li> Nothing that has been mentioned here negatively about it my wife experienced, which leads me to the logical conclusion that it has different effects on different people (different skin types)</li>
            <li> Well to put it simply, the product smells exactly how it feels.</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone completely!</li>
            <li> This cheap product goes on slightly drying.  </li>
            <li> I have only positive things to say about the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they put in it, but every time I tried to use this product, my face broke out with large red bumps.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and did reduce redness, but like a couple of the other reviews mention, it flakes off!!</li>
            <li> The cheaper brands are okay but don&#x27;t give you that nice even base that you need.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, stay away.  </li>
            <li> I naturally have oily skin</li>
            <li> I 30 yrs old</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that a drugstore primer would outperform high-end primers, but this one sets my makeup and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive</li>
            <li> But I am a natural redhead (now dyed blonde/brown) and already have somewhat of a pinkish complexion.</li>
            <li> I use this primer, then apply L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Secrets Professional Color</li>
            <li> I do have a sensitive nose, so maybe it won&#x27;t bother everyone, but for me it is a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> The primer looks okay when you put it on a clean face, but as soon as you apply foundation on top it flakes off and looks terrible.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am searching for a new one is because I would like to find one that is naturally derived and yet functional.</li>
            <li> buy again when I run out -- it goes a long way and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> If I put this on in the morning and then apply my usual face makeup, I am literally shine free ALL day.  </li>
            <li> Does make my makeup last longer, I don&#x27;t really think the color actually evens my skin tone though.</li>
            <li> previous comment on the bottle/pump design is right on.</li>
            <li> This is a very good base primer.</li>
            <li> I have a very lite skin tone, I like the pink hue of this primer.</li>
            <li> If I even touched my face, the primer would rub together into these little grayish balls and flake right off.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product because it said I could wear without other makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have spent 1000$ in the past couple years to find the right make up line for me!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product to help control my makeup (particularly my eyeshadow) from running after a few hours of applying, and this primer has succeeded.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combo skin, a little oily in my t-zone and normal everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> The lid will not snap back on after you remove it, so care is required so that it doesn&#x27;t dry out or get contaminated.</li>
            <li> , I do have a few dark spots that it really didn&#x27;t do anything for -</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble finding makeup that looks natural and that matches my neck.</li>
            <li> if you leave it on for too long without applying your foundation it starts to get sticky.</li>
            <li> It felt strange and it didn&#x27;t look good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• Does not completely conceal color imperfections (acne scars,</li>
            <li> It also smells funny.. not pleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when applying makeup, let this product dry before putting on foundation, or you will end up with this product balling up on your face.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin</li>
            <li> I found this product to overdry my already dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I got a couple of dry flaky areas when using it</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago and put it on my bare face.  </li>
            <li> I finally narrowed down to the cause to this primer</li>
            <li> so then I applied less the next time.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this Revlon primer, especially since I love the Revlon Photoready foundation and have been wearing that product for years.  </li>
            <li> Also it had a bad smell but not awful.</li>
            <li> With other primers my makeup is long gone due to shine.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I tried it again and noticed the same chalky look.  </li>
            <li> It would just spread and stick together and got harder to smoothen it out.</li>
            <li> and I also wear it on everyday activities to include hiking and physical activity.</li>
            <li> This primer does not really help the oil either.</li>
            <li> it is lighter than expected if worn alone.</li>
            <li> Spend the few extra bucks!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Provides a nice base.</li>
            <li> I feel like a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Avoid this product and get the E.l.f. Studio primer or splurge on Smashbox Photo Finish primer (might be a bit pricier, but a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t do what other products have.</li>
            <li> I tried this primer and won&#x27;t switch to any other.  </li>
            <li> It also does not correct in discoloration but it does not pill or roll up like other primers.</li>
            <li> I have opened the cap and now &#x27;scoop&#x27; out the small amount I need daily--</li>
            <li> lol friends think somethings wrong with me, like i&#x27;m sick or something.</li>
            <li> I have kinda dark circles under my eye</li>
            <li> /&gt;Loved it so much I bought a bottle for my sister to try, but unfortunate for her</li>
            <li> Had used this a few times and occasionally found my usual source would be out of the one I needed...</li>
            <li> i have rosey cheeks, and this does tone them down a bit.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t do anything for the even slight redness around the nose.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t cover it up like my previous primer did</li>
            <li> Makeup glides on and, in fact, I use less  foundation because of it.</li>
            <li> I still have a bit less than half of the bottle</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this primer for months (maybe half a year) and have not noticed any of the problems the low-raters have mentioned (blotchiness; crumbled, balled-up texture; breakouts; etc)</li>
            <li> It makes my foundation streaky and flaky and even makes my normal/dry skin appear slightly greasy.  </li>
            <li> I apply this on my eyelids then apply concealer then a little bit of foundation powder.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about purchasing this primer just because I&#x27;m not familiar with Revlon.</li>
            <li> I am a little bit darker Latin.</li>
            <li> After that it could get a little shiny.</li>
            <li> After using about 2/3 of the bottle, the pump begins to peter out and is unable to completely work.</li>
            <li> skin appearance seems to be smoother when I use it than when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend putting it on, waiting a few minutes, then applying your foundation makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It dried up and started rolling off of my face.  </li>
            <li> Correcting Anti-Redness Primer (the green one).</li>
            <li> I wear this, paired with some mascara and neutral eye shadow and it suffices as my everyday</li>
            <li> Within a few hours, though, the product was acting weird.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy the REVLON Photoready perfecting primer.</li>
            <li> The reason is because revlon usually puts a lot of sparkles in their products.</li>
            <li> and I can usually skip foundation when I go out and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this primer for the past three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this product this morning and am in love I have crazy bad acne here with in the past year.</li>
            <li> A very small amount in rthe bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> At first i hated it because i did not give it a chance</li>
            <li> time I ordered online s saving gas and it was less expensive than the stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Smashbox primer and less expensive Maybelline and don&#x27;t have the problems with them that I had with this one.</li>
            <li> i recommend lotion first then the primer because when i used it without lotion it looked awful and it was hard to put on the makeup since this primer os silicone like.</li>
            <li> Not good smell though.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not good for travel, but even if the cap is on the primer that&#x27;s in the nozzle dries out.</li>
            <li> The only downside, which is driving me crazy, is the lousy pump.</li>
            <li> Definitely will not repurchase &amp; it is going in the trash. :(</li>
            <li> Yes I am THAT addicted to it.</li>
            <li> It gives me an even tone and brightens my face where it doesn&#x27;t appear I&#x27;m tired when I&#x27;m not.</li>

            <li> I cannot use this product on my nose because it doesn&#x27;t agree with my concealer and it develops a really weird texture.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE this primer!!! I am an African American woman with a medium/darker brown complexion depending on the time of year.  I have pretty decent skin already and I don&#x27;t use makeup so I was expecting to use it mostly to even out my skin tone.  I bought this a few years ago and put it on my bare face.  It looked chalky and so I never used it again.  A few months ago I tried it again and noticed the same chalky look.  However, when I followed it up with a moisturizer containing SPF the results were AMAZING! My skin was velvet soft, smooth and looked pretty much flawless.  Now I use it every day.  Can&#x27;t live without it! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Smooth. Provides a nice base. Not good smell though.</li>
            <li> Great primer. Easy to blend it, and so good that I often don&#x27;t put foundation over it; just powder. The color correcting really does help. An essential component of my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> If you have pores around your nose, this product covers them nicely. However, when applying makeup, let this product dry before putting on foundation, or you will end up with this product balling up on your face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! Goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> Its not the best primer I have used, but it does the trick for filling in my pores, the tone of it is slightly too pink but I put foundation right over it so its no big deal.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the REVLON Photoready perfecting primer. I accidentally purchased the Color Correcting by mistake. I thought I would give it a try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its still pretty great, feels oft on your skin, but I fell like it is heavier than the perecting primer. i still would recomment it. i have rosey cheeks, and this does tone them down a bit.</li>
            <li> I have a red tint to my face. I have always had trouble finding makeup that looks natural and that matches my neck. This has helped my foundation look so good! It hides my pores also, which is a great thing. I love it. It is light and airy, not heavy at all. Wish I had found it years ago.</li>
            <li> Best primer I&#x27;ve ever used! No need to buy primers for your eyes. This primer pretty much does all the work.I use this primer all over my face. I wear it alone or under my make up. I apply this on my eyelids then apply concealer then a little bit of foundation powder. It helps my eyeshadow not to crease. I also apply this before I apply my eyeliner under my eye to avoid any smudge. A must have when you&#x27;re in a budget for good quality make up</li>
            <li> Color correction works well to cancel out under-eye circles and skin imperfections. Virtually no texture once applied. Makes makeup go on smoother and last longer. Saved $3+ by buying on Amazon vs. brick-and-mortar retailers. Effective for skin imperfections on non face areas too.</li>
            <li> This stuff looks great some of the time. It controls shine and just kind of smoothes out your skin. But on some days (maddeningly, not every day) it flakes off by lunchtime. Like you rub your face and it rubs off in flakes. I have primarily been using it after morning face cleansing, without using makeup over it. The one time I tried to use foundation over it, it made the foundation hard to spread and kind of cakey looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line, when it doesn&#x27;t flake off it is awesome alone on skin. I didn&#x27;t like it under makeup. I really wanted to like this product but I really just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Okay so I was skeptical on getting this. The reason is because revlon usually puts a lot of sparkles in their products. (Atleast the ones I&#x27;ve tried). Until now , this product has no sparkle and it really is tone correcting. When I apply this and then blend it it has a very nice feel to it. Like velvet. It also makes my foundation a lot more smoother to blend. One thing I noticed though if you leave it on for too long without applying your foundation it starts to get sticky. For ex. I left it on for like 30 minutes before applying my foundation. When I went to apply it, on certain areas the foundation would just attach to the primer and not want to blend. When I would try to blend it evenly.. It would just spread and stick together and got harder to smoothen it out. Other than needing to be fast after applying this I think this is a great product</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product because it said I could wear without other makeup.  I hate having a lot of makeup on during the summer!  Unfortunately, this is not the product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put it on, it felt smooth and looked amazing.  My skin was glowing and it did seem to get some of the redness out of my face.  Within a few hours, though, the product was acting weird.  If I even touched my face, the primer would rub together into these little grayish balls and flake right off.  It felt strange and it didn&#x27;t look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part about this product is the reaction I had to it.  I don&#x27;t know what they put in it, but every time I tried to use this product, my face broke out with large red bumps.  I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin and while I might have a stray zit every once in a while, this was awful.  I finally narrowed down to the cause to this primer and I simply can&#x27;t use it.  If you have sensitive skin, stay away.  If you don&#x27;t, still use cautiously!</li>
            <li> I have a very lite skin tone, I like the pink hue of this primer. It&#x27;s not heavy, and I only use this product as my primary makeup.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good when first applied, but if my face gets rubbed even a little bit my foundation starts looking like eraser shavings. also, the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on very well so it&#x27;s not good for travel, but even if the cap is on the primer that&#x27;s in the nozzle dries out. it&#x27;s very annoying. i have stopped using.</li>
            <li> nice for very light coverage</li>
            <li> It makes foundation feel a bit cakey and the foundation doesn&#x27;t settle as nicely, which is the exact opposite of the expected effect! Also doesn&#x27;t do anything for the even slight redness around the nose.</li>
            <li> My favorite :) Fast shipping and works wonders for me!</li>
            <li> I like this primer but it didn&#x27;t do what other products have. I have kinda dark circles under my eye and it doesn&#x27;t cover it up like my previous primer did but it does help my makeup stay on and looking fresh!</li>
            <li> All I can say is that my wife is happy with it, so I&#x27;m happy as well!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great deal fo rthe price you pay! Nothing that has been mentioned here negatively about it my wife experienced, which leads me to the logical conclusion that it has different effects on different people (different skin types)</li>
            <li> I tried this primer and won&#x27;t switch to any other.  Great  product to make  your skin ready to apply makeup or not.  It seems to hide the pores, which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this primer about 2 months ago. I have been actually been trying to find a primer and make up that fits my tone. I was really doubting it since I have been trying for about 2 years now.. I can say I use this primer none stop!! I love it. I use it by itself when I don&#x27;t want to wear my foundation and I also wear it on everyday activities to include hiking and physical activity. Yes I am THAT addicted to it. It only flaked once and that&#x27;s because I was in a rush and didn&#x27;t spread it out evenly nor thinly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: My husband says that my face tone is more even now since I have been wearing it. I know this is not a UV protection primer but it has helped me out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I recommend this primer works really good. Price is worth it..</li>
            <li> It gives me Greasy in my face during the day</li>
            <li> Bought this product this morning and am in love I have crazy bad acne here with in the past year. A lot of it due the the insane oil my face produces, which cause me to cake on layers of make up. No lie I have to use tissues every hour to pull oil off! Make up runs becomes spotty! This gave me an even face helped hide redness lots of it!! Along with acne. I&#x27;m in love with it! I have spent 1000$ in the past couple years to find the right make up line for me! I used this primer with the revlon photo ready combination/oily skin foundation and revlon powder! And I didn&#x27;t have to dap my face one time today! My make up stayed in place, didn&#x27;t smear and get blotchy! Where has this been! So excited to finally found my it products! It lasted all day with no oil!!!!! Was able to touch my face never ever could I touch my face simply because my oil would ruin my make up! Thank you revlon!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the base I always use.  And it has always been good to me. I&#x27;m prone to breaking out and had a massive allergic reaction to another product years ago--so I&#x27;m cautious when I buy my makeup.  But for the price point, it&#x27;s very good. No issues and I can usually skip foundation when I go out and about with just this and some eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about purchasing this primer just because I&#x27;m not familiar with Revlon. However, I am pretty impressed! I naturally have oily skin and I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product to help control my makeup (particularly my eyeshadow) from running after a few hours of applying, and this primer has succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;The primer feels so smooth on my skin, I sometimes just wear it without any foundation because it feels that good. No complaints here!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my 4th bottle and am very happy with the product for all the reasons others have listed...reduces redness,looks great alone or under foundation. My foundation now looks great, really great after a 10 hour day. I have only positive things to say about the product. But....I&#x27;m frustrated with the container. After using about 2/3 of the bottle, the pump begins to peter out and is unable to completely work. Then for the remainder of the bottle I must shake and pound it to get the pump to work. Eventually, I break the top off and scrape it out. Happens on every bottle. Yep, I went for the 4th bottle because I really, really like the primer. One positive thing about the pump is that it does allow you to carefully measure out how much you use, probably preventing overuse!! So, it does get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a while and it really does help to smooth out the skin really well.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Not only does it help the overall appearance of my skin but my makeup lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Smoothes the  texture of the skin and evens skin tone. Makeup glides on over the primer to evenly cover your face and neck. I have tried other primers, but this one has the best color enhancement and makes the skin feel flawless.</li>
            <li> Very good product and excelent seller</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what what it says it does.  The &#x27;fine&#x27; lines around my eyes and my laugh lines seemed to nearly dissapear.  It evened out my skin tone and made my makeup look more matte, I do have a few dark spots that it really didn&#x27;t do anything for - but I did not expect it to.  I have combo skin, a little oily in my t-zone and normal everywhere else.  I did not experience any of the flaking or balling during the day that some of the reviewers experienced, I did allow the primer to set before appying anything else to my face for about 5 to 7 mins.  I love this product, would 100% recomened it to a friend and will certainly purchase this product again!,</li>
            <li> Wow this is smooth, Goes on neat and so good! I 30 yrs old and my mom is 46 we both love it! we have fair skin tone I am a little bit darker Latin. But It does feel really nice to use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel like it made a difference whether I had it on or not,so I don&#x27;t even use it. It feels nice and smooth putting it on but that&#x27;s about it!</li>
            <li> This primer is awesome! My makeup goes over it perfectly and I love that my complexion looks amazing all day. I don&#x27;t use a lot - I feel like a little goes a long way. Issues with flaking/peeling probably happen when you use a lot of the product, but personally, I don&#x27;t feel like I need it. I also love that it&#x27;s subscribe and save- never have to worry about running out!</li>
            <li> I found the Revlon Photoready Color Correcting Primer to just be &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Does it do the job? Sure. So would I repurchase? No. Why not? Well to put it simply, the product smells exactly how it feels. Awfully waxy! I can&#x27;t stand the smell. It&#x27;s like plastic or wax or rubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even with the lid on securely and with daily use, the product hardens up in the nozzle. So essentially you&#x27;re wasting 1/4 of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for me, thanks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a difference with this. It looked the same and even felt the same. I have been using it as a eye primer.. it works pretty good for that purpose. It also smells funny.. not pleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, i would recommend this as an eye primer.&lt;br /&gt;No, i would not recommend this as a face primer.</li>
            <li> A very small amount in rthe bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> This was so greasy I put it on once and immediately washed it off. Not for me</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product! If I have to run up to the store without makeup I still apply this primer only. It gives me an even tone and brightens my face where it doesn&#x27;t appear I&#x27;m tired when I&#x27;m not. It&#x27;s undetected when there is no time to put on foundation. I&#x27;ve been using this primer for the past three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If its out of stock in the drugstore I drive onto the next store until I find it!&lt;br /&gt;This time I ordered online s saving gas and it was less expensive than the stores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved it so much I bought a bottle for my sister to try, but unfortunate for her it irritated her skin:(</li>
            <li> I have bought the expensive department store brands that most women love...and, this seems to work as well for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Amazing. My face literally looked airbrushed with no makeup on! One tip - it doesn&#x27;t work as well if you moisturize first, which is kind of a bummer...Doesn&#x27;t feel too dry if used without moisturizer, but I would definitely prefer some more moisture on my face.</li>
            <li> Makes your face look flawless. If you use the Revlon primer, base and then this power you face looks like you just had a photo shoot!</li>
            <li> Great amount for the price. I like this primer. It evens out my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Use it after moisturizer.  Gives a great glow.</li>
            <li> Works fabulous, better than the big name brands.</li>
            <li> Great primer, really does keep my look fresh all day.</li>
            <li> In love with the product and thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This primer is light, colorless, and very soft on your skin. I purchased my bottle in April, and it has been consistently wonderful for the last 3 months. A  great addition to any makeup collection.</li>
            <li> This primer spreads really nicely and is creamy yet powdery. It covers/blends very nicely...it is definitely something I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have used MANY primers, Smashbox, Clinique, Sephora, L&#x27;oreal and Cargo to name a few. I have oily, acne prone skin and the silicone based primers do nothing for my oil. This primer does not really help the oil either. I have yet to find something that actually works. What this does do is set your makeup all day. I was really surprised that a drugstore primer would outperform high-end primers, but this one sets my makeup and lasts all day. All have to do is touch up with powder for shine. With other primers my makeup is long gone due to shine. If you have dry skin this primer will be a bit more drying and may not be a good choice as I could see it emphasizing dry spots on our skin. It also does not correct in discoloration but it does not pill or roll up like other primers. It just primes your skin well....which is great! I use Tarte clay foundation and blush and it stays all day with this primer.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because it DOES NOT help in correcting color imbalances in the skin, thus I think that is false advertising.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this primer.  It makes my foundation look smooth and flawless and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months.  I had a reaction (red bumps everywhere) to a more expensive primer that I tried, but this one has been kind to my skin.  I don&#x27;t notice a huge benefit to the color correction.  I can still notice some redness of my skin, especially around my nose.  I cannot use this product on my nose because it doesn&#x27;t agree with my concealer and it develops a really weird texture.  Like snake skin or something.  I think you have to be cautious of what foundation or concealer you use with this product.  I&#x27;ve been using Revlon or CoverGirl foundations with it and all is well.</li>
            <li> it is lighter than expected if worn alone. lol friends think somethings wrong with me, like i&#x27;m sick or something. What I like about this product is that it controls my redness. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product for uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much correcting with this primer. It is OK. Does make my makeup last longer, I don&#x27;t really think the color actually evens my skin tone though. I have some slightly red areas on my face that I would like to even out and they are still there after application. But it isn&#x27;t too oily and it hasn&#x27;t caused breakouts. And it does lengthen cosmetic wear time so it;s not a bad product. Just not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> Was looking for alternative to smashbox primer...this is okay mainly because of the price that I can currently afford. Just need to use more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this primer. It evens out my skin tone completely! It softens my skin! Makeup glides on and, in fact, I use less  foundation because of it. I have no shine or oil throughout the day when I use this. Best of all, I can use this on its own! The only downside, which is driving me crazy, is the lousy pump. I still have a bit less than half of the bottle and nothing will come through the pump. I have opened the cap and now &#x27;scoop&#x27; out the small amount I need daily--ughhh. I will purchase again in spite of the bad packaging. (I would rather have this dispensing issue than a tube any day!)</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this ladies! Spend the few extra bucks! It&#x27;s your face! Flawless coverage, moisturizers your skin, not too heavy, not oily, perfect!!! I&#x27;m serious about my makeup because I&#x27;m serious about my skin and this is the bomb!! Buy 2-3 at a time! I do!! The cheaper brands are okay but don&#x27;t give you that nice even base that you need. Add this to ur favorites!!</li>
            <li> This primer is reasonably priced and does a great job.  It evens out my color and leaves the skin smooth and soft.  Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this primer. It goes on smooth and did reduce redness, but like a couple of the other reviews mention, it flakes off!! I put it on and about an hour later lightly scratched my cheek and the product flaked off. I would absolutely not recommend this product. Definitely will not repurchase &amp; it is going in the trash. :(</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and sun spots, and this primer reduces the redness, controls the shine and optically decreases the size of the pores. My skin appears to be softer, clearer and with a more uniform aspect when I wear it. I haven&#x27;t experienced the flakiness, but I wear this primer under the Clear Face Neutrogena sunblock, which sometimes flakes off.</li>
            <li> Greasy feeling on skin. Darker than I anticipated. Smells weird. I bought this hoping to save money on more expensive primers, but now I&#x27;m throwing this away and scared to waste more money on trying to find an adequate but cheaper primer.</li>
            <li> Bought to try - like it.&lt;br /&gt;This product goes on very smooth - leaving a perfect base for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;My skin appearance seems to be smoother when I use it than when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend putting it on, waiting a few minutes, then applying your foundation makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say it makes the makeup last any longer -- seems the same with or without it.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again when I run out -- it goes a long way and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> loved it, it brightens the skin, and makes a good look, Makes the skin look dry and fresh. I Recomend</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this I was looking for a decently priced primer from a quality brand.  When this was revealed I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy; I love Revlon&#x27;s cosmetics.  This primer is easy to apply and goes onto my face smoothly.  I didn&#x27;t really notice any reduction in my pore size, but the redness faded significantly after letting the product sink into my skin.  I also felt that my foundation went on more smoothly over this primer.  This also mattifies my face which is great because I have oily skin, especially in the t-zone area.  Wearing this primer keeps my face matte all day (no oil shines through) and makes my makeup last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this primer for months (maybe half a year) and have not noticed any of the problems the low-raters have mentioned (blotchiness; crumbled, balled-up texture; breakouts; etc) and I have sensitive, acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this primer and would reccommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, quality primer.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, it looked fine for awhile and then maybe an hour later I had my boyfriend asking me why my face was peeling.  It dried up and started rolling off of my face.  At first I thought I applied too much so then I applied less the next time.  Same darn result.  This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap and I feel as though we were a paying study group.  This is something that they come up with in the lab before coming up with something better.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product today. Like I always do, I tested it on my wrist first before I put it on my face. Then I tried it under my foundation. It rubbed on smoothly. My skin is already smooth so I didn&#x27;t see to much of a difference. I will keep an updated post.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super smooth to apply, it&#x27;s not tick. When you apply it it&#x27;s transparent and really holds my foundation a little bit longer, lovely!</li>
            <li> Had used this a few times and occasionally found my usual source would be out of the one I needed... so I came to Amazon and foud just what I needed from a food seller. What is not to like about that? and FREE SHIPPING so I save both time and money.</li>
            <li> I found this product to overdry my already dry skin.  I got a couple of dry flaky areas when using it and also I thought the color correcting properties gave my skin a pasty look unless I put foundation on over it.  I have used Smashbox primer and less expensive Maybelline and don&#x27;t have the problems with them that I had with this one.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, it absorbs well and sits under my Photoready foundation smoothly. But I am a natural redhead (now dyed blonde/brown) and already have somewhat of a pinkish complexion. I don&#x27;t think that this accentuates that in any significant way, but next order I&#x27;m going to try a different shade of primer and see if I&#x27;m more enthused with the results.</li>
            <li> I have really oily, shiny skin.  If I put this on in the morning and then apply my usual face makeup, I am literally shine free ALL day.  It&#x27;s amazing.  Of course, if I go to the gym or do something that causes me to sweat, it needs to be reapplied.  But just being at work all day, I don&#x27;t have to even use a touch of powder.  I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> This is a very good base primer. It creates a nice matte finish and is long lasting. However, if you are buying this product to reduce redness it won&#x27;t help much. I use this primer, then apply L&#x27;Oreal Paris Studio Secrets Professional Color Correcting Anti-Redness Primer (the green one). When both products are combined they work well at reducing redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous comment on the bottle/pump design is right on. About half-way through the bottle the pump will cease to work, at which time you will need to pry off the lid (with some difficulty). Then you need to scoop or shake the rest out. The lid will not snap back on after you remove it, so care is required so that it doesn&#x27;t dry out or get contaminated. A tube would be much better. The packaging is the only reason I am giving this rating 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Am in awh, that a cheap product from Revlon works better that my here&#x27;s my list  Clinique Arboone, Estee Laurer, Lancolmn.  This cheap product goes on slightly drying.  but blends on so well you could go without foundation.  Makeup stays on and in still looking good mode all day, and I have combination skin.  If you don&#x27;t use a primer and you wear liquid foundation,  Then when you buy this product and put foundation over it, you are going to so pleased how your skin is smoothed out.  Try it You will like it</li>
            <li> Amazing!! At first i hated it because i did not give it a chance but i am glad i changed my mind. In order for this primer to look nice i recommend lotion first then the primer because when i used it without lotion it looked awful and it was hard to put on the makeup since this primer os silicone like. Also it had a bad smell but not awful.</li>
            <li> It is a great primer!  I gave it four star because it does not have ANY color correcting capacity as the name suggests.</li>
            <li> Really evens out your skin tone without the heavy use of concealer.</li>
            <li> This product does what it is supposed to. It helps my bb cream stay on all day and it does reduce redness. However, it has a funny smell I can&#x27;t get over. I do have a sensitive nose, so maybe it won&#x27;t bother everyone, but for me it is a deal breaker. I won&#x27;t be finishing the bottle.</li>
            <li> Worst primer EVER!  I am so disappointed with this Revlon primer, especially since I love the Revlon Photoready foundation and have been wearing that product for years.  The primer looks okay when you put it on a clean face, but as soon as you apply foundation on top it flakes off and looks terrible.  It makes my foundation streaky and flaky and even makes my normal/dry skin appear slightly greasy.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;color correcting&amp;#34; properties, either.  Avoid this product and get the E.l.f. Studio primer or splurge on Smashbox Photo Finish primer (might be a bit pricier, but a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> I really like this primer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Creates an even base for makeup&lt;br /&gt;• Absorbs oil and reduces shine for most of the day&lt;br /&gt;• Corrects color somewhat&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• Does not completely conceal color imperfections (acne scars, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;• Oil returns by the end of the night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear this primer alone on most days. It softens the color of imperfections and absorbs oil, which is perfect for people with combination/oily skin. I have many acne scars on my face and this certainly doesn’t conceal them but it does help mask them. I wear a thin layer of this and my face is left oil free for up to ten hours. After that it could get a little shiny. I wear this, paired with some mascara and neutral eye shadow and it suffices as my everyday makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first primer I have ever used, and I like it. The only reason I am searching for a new one is because I would like to find one that is naturally derived and yet functional. Otherwise, I wholeheartedly recommend it.</li>
