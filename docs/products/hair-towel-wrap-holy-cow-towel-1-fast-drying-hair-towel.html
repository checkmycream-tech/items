    <ol>
            <li>BEST HAIR TOWEL EVER.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe this towel would be as awesome as they said and it is.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>A truly great product!!</li>
            <li>looks good!!</li>
            <li>very nice!</li>
            <li>Remarkably absorbent towel!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, water absorption is very good,</li>
            <li>It works great, but the elastic is not well made.</li>
            <li>They were great and promptly refunded my money</li>
            <li>This towel is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I think this was my favorite gift ever!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Im glad I have it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how effective this is, and how quick and easy it does the job for you!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>one occasion going nearly 3 hours - and when I took my hair out of the towel, it was still incredibly wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife now use a hair clip to hold it which work well, but it should be a bit more sturdy.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I really love this thing.</li>
            <li>Added to it the towel is of light weight too and handy to use.</li>
            <li>More like a kevlar skull cap than a towel.</li>
            <li>I love this concept.</li>
            <li>but once you get it, it works better than a towel.</li>
            <li>It absorbs more than the towel, leaves your hair frizzless</li>
            <li>Does not work any better than a towel does.</li>
            <li>The elastic is not the greatest, I have replaced mine, but big deal a needle and thread is all you need.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t absorb as miraculously as most reviews I read.  </li>
            <li>Design is nice and it just sits right in your head</li>
            <li>easy</li>
            <li>The towel dries my hair very quickly and it&#x27;s comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Super bummed, and will be buying more &amp;#34;turbie twist&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for those times when using a hair dryer won&#x27;t dry your hair too much to do what you want to do with styling wise.</li>
            <li>but it was a huge hit and stolen twice.  </li>
            <li>It also feels cheap as well.</li>
            <li>After using it for just a couple days, I liked it so much</li>
            <li>This towel has greatly helped my hair, I use it then wring it out and put it back on for a while.  </li>
            <li>very useful, it texture like sport towel</li>
            <li>the idea of this towel drying my hair better and faster really appealed to me!  </li>
            <li>I was also familiar with the chamois material from swimming, so I knew how absorbent that material</li>
            <li>At first I wasn’t sure what to think.  </li>
            <li>Cute towel, funny name.  </li>
            <li>This Holy Cow Towel dries my hair beautifully and never gets a musty smell.  </li>
            <li>It fits snugly on the head and eliminates the weight and hassle of using a full sized towel.</li>
            <li>and I am already enjoying my new towel and have had no problems.</li>
            <li>Works... great for air drying my hair in less time.</li>
            <li>Saves so much of my time and it is so easy to be used.</li>
            <li>However, it fits nicely on my head and is a better solution than the typical towel wrap.</li>
            <li>The light, comfortable and dry fitting towel made my day.</li>
            <li>Not at all worth it.</li>
            <li>After using this towel, my drying time is cut down remarkably.  </li>
            <li>It dries hair super fast!</li>
            <li>towels that I&#x27;ve had in that past and had been happy with but</li>
            <li>to big for most heads</li>
            <li>Wife was hesitant at first to use, but loves it now.</li>
            <li>This does work but a regular towel is better.  </li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>Pretty neat product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the time it takes her to get ready!</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer since I&#x27;ve been using this!</li>
            <li>All the reviews are dated around the same time and most are mens names...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to twist it and put it around as if I were to be using a regular towel except with this</li>
            <li>just make sure you wet and wring it out first.</li>
            <li>Yes this is definitely much better than trying to use a towel or blow dryer to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they sent me a new one right away that didn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li>The strap that secures it to your head is cheap rubber and will not last.</li>
            <li>I must be doing something wrong because so many reviews are raving about how great it is, but I can&#x27;t find any directions that are different from what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li>I really wonder what the lifespan is for one of these.  </li>
            <li>Worked well, very absorbent.</li>
            <li>and this does really work well.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t fit especially well.</li>
            <li>Love the pink color!</li>
            <li>She uses it every time she gets out of the shower: it sure beats any other towel she uses in the house.</li>
            <li>I have very long very curly hair and a huge head</li>
            <li>It does pull more of the wetness out of my hair a little quicker too .</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and sure enough, once you wet it, it softens and is ready to use.  </li>
            <li>It immediately soaked moisture from the wet hair and prepared the hair for light blow drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve updated my rating to reflect my view of the new towel.</li>
            <li>I had some fears about exposing my hairs to l hot blowing for long duration, which I came to know was a real risk.</li>
            <li>Towel is great for anyone with long hair that has takes a long time to even get it just slightly damp to put hair products in.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m a believer!  </li>
            <li>this towel really does dry hair fast, the only downside is that the two times I&#x27;ve used it my scalp became very itchy and irritated.</li>
            <li>I think this is a little more work then just my regular hair towels</li>
            <li>Uses it daily and really works.</li>
            <li>Strange smells the first time and should be used when using laundry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>are too far over.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The first towel I received the elastic had been in the heat too long</li>
            <li>When dry it was pretty &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these and the loop broke the first time I used it, but it still helped dry my hair, so I returned it and repurchased.</li>
            <li>I have already been using a microfiber towel to dry my hair, so I am not noticing any huge dry time difference.</li>
            <li>you have to get the towel wet first and then ring it out.</li>
            <li>I have super long curly hair that takes hours to air dry.</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive on buying it at first as I thought it might just go in for a normal towel.</li>
            <li>The first Holy Cow Towel I received broke (the elastic fell off)</li>
            <li>It was little pricey but well worth the time it has saved me.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a bit hard to fit all my hair into it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get a chance to try it because when I wet it and put it on my head, I went to hook the loop around the buttons and the loop broke off.  </li>
            <li>My main purposes for purchasing is I wanted something that would gently dry my hair</li>
            <li>I wonder if there is anyone who has not been irritated by wet hair when getting ready in a hurry.</li>
            <li>You really do just wet it, wring it out, and put it on.  </li>
            <li>I tried it during my normal routine a couple of times, wearing it just for 10 minutes or so after my shower before blow-drying it, and the hair was still nearly dripping wet.  </li>
            <li>works ok but not a great item as promissed</li>
            <li>the first time I used it, but when I left a poor review I got a quick response from Customer Service</li>
            <li>but it’s way better than my bath towel and the other terry cloth towel I used in the past.  </li>
            <li>This product has no hype and it isn&#x27;t promising you anything other than what&#x27;s in the name.</li>
            <li>At least they will do a full refund on this item.</li>
            <li>My first thought was &#x27;what did he waste his money on now???&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>The towel was super hard and almost stuck together when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>It helps dry her hair quicker and since it absorbs so much water it doesn&#x27;t feel like a wet mop on her head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it only a few times so far, but I really hope it continues to work for a long time.  </li>

            <li> (I have natural hair--locs) without picking up the lint that so often comes with other hair drying towels, even the microfiber ones.  </li>
            <li> Drys very stiff works but to much effort to use daily</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this several times, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> it still does dry my hair quicker than a regular towel.</li>

            <li> I have really long hair</li>

            <li> I wrap my hair for about 15 minutes in this and it cuts my drying time in half.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get a chance to try it because when I wet it and put it on my head, I went to hook the loop around the buttons and the loop broke off.  I bought two others but haven&#x27;t opened them yet.  I&#x27;m going to try and sew it back on myself and see how the towel does.</li>
            <li> to big for most heads</li>
            <li> Not good. I&#x27;m not going to recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these. One for me and one for my daughter. Absolutely LOVE it.  Didn&#x27;t frizz my hair like a regular terry cloth towel. It does pull more of the wetness out of my hair a little quicker too . For those who complain if the small strap that you use to button it breaks. ...geesh.....you can just track that with a needle and thread. Take just a few minutes. I have had mine for about 6 months and it is still in tact.  I&#x27;m ordering a third one today to keep at the gym.</li>
            <li> My main purposes for purchasing is I wanted something that would gently dry my hair (I have natural hair--locs) without picking up the lint that so often comes with other hair drying towels, even the microfiber ones.  Chamois doesn&#x27;t have the pile microfiber and other towels have.  I just bought this, so I&#x27;m withholding a review until I actually use it a few times.  Then give I&#x27;ll give it a review.</li>
            <li> Broke after 3 uses! The strap that secures it to your head is cheap rubber and will not last. At least they will do a full refund on this item. It also feels cheap as well.</li>
            <li> What am I missing here???  I bought this instead of regular &amp;#34;turbie twist&amp;#34; towels that I&#x27;ve had in that past and had been happy with but the idea of this towel drying my hair better and faster really appealed to me!  I was also familiar with the chamois material from swimming, so I knew how absorbent that material is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this several times, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.  Seriously, hardly the tiniest bit even!  I tried it during my normal routine a couple of times, wearing it just for 10 minutes or so after my shower before blow-drying it, and the hair was still nearly dripping wet.  Then, I have tried it three times at night where I&#x27;ve worn the HCT for over 90 minutes - one occasion going nearly 3 hours - and when I took my hair out of the towel, it was still incredibly wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What am I missing here???  I must be doing something wrong because so many reviews are raving about how great it is, but I can&#x27;t find any directions that are different from what I&#x27;m doing.  Super bummed, and will be buying more &amp;#34;turbie twist&amp;#34; towels that I know work.</li>
            <li> It works great, but the elastic is not well made. Will break after a few uses. My wife now use a hair clip to hold it which work well, but it should be a bit more sturdy.</li>
            <li> Other hair wraps would smell musty after one use and not soak up a lot of the moisture in my long hair.  This Holy Cow Towel dries my hair beautifully and never gets a musty smell.  Is looks goofy and is a little difficult to put on (stiff), but I won&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> Wife was hesitant at first to use, but loves it now. Uses it everyday!</li>
            <li> Uses it daily and really works. After use it dries stiff as a board but works well</li>
            <li> just make sure you wet and wring it out first.</li>
            <li> I have already been using a microfiber towel to dry my hair, so I am not noticing any huge dry time difference. However, it fits nicely on my head and is a better solution than the typical towel wrap. It is a little annoying having to wet the towel and wring it up though, as it adds another step to the shower routine. My hair is long and thick, and barely fits in the hood, so for really long hair it will not fit very well. Love the pink color!</li>
            <li> very useful, it texture like sport towel</li>
            <li> Holy Cow indeed!  I do not fall for gimmicks.  I would never have bought this towel.  My husband gave it to me as a Christmas gift.  My first thought was &#x27;what did he waste his money on now???&#x27;.  However, I was wrong!!  This towel is AMAZING!  It&#x27;s a little weird that you wet it before you use it, but the system works.  I have medium/long hair and it takes forever to dry.  After using this towel, my drying time is cut down remarkably.  I think this was my favorite gift ever!  I&#x27;ve used it only a few times so far, but I really hope it continues to work for a long time.  I really wonder what the lifespan is for one of these.  So far I&#x27;m a believer!  It&#x27;s kooky, but it works.</li>
            <li> This does work but a regular towel is better.  don&#x27;t bother to buy.  Very hard to use hook and a towel will dry your hair just as fast,</li>
            <li> At first I wasn’t sure what to think.  The towel was super hard and almost stuck together when it arrived.  I followed the instructions and sure enough, once you wet it, it softens and is ready to use.  I wrung it out and put it on like the pictures I saw on Amazon.  It worked just as described.  It is a little weird that it dries really! Really! Hard, but it’s way better than my bath towel and the other terry cloth towel I used in the past.  It was little pricey but well worth the time it has saved me.  Give it a shot and don’t forget it’s HARD!</li>
            <li> Worked well, very absorbent. When dry it was pretty &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;. Felt weird. Not what I expected. Dried my hair very well though. I am not a fan of pink.</li>
            <li> Drys very stiff works but to much effort to use daily</li>
            <li> It takes me such a painfully long time to dry my hair, so I was looking for something like this which would make my life easier for me! I can&#x27;t believe how effective this is, and how quick and easy it does the job for you!!</li>
            <li> Cute towel, funny name.  I bought this as a white elephant gift and not only did it come in under budget (we could spend $15) but it was a huge hit and stolen twice.  Guess who won it?? ☺  I love it.  It dries my hair in a fraction of the time my terry cloth towel doe sand I’ve used it 3 or 4 times now and it doesn’t  smell like a wet towel after it dries.  Pretty neat product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this. She uses it every time she gets out of the shower: it sure beats any other towel she uses in the house. It helps dry her hair quicker and since it absorbs so much water it doesn&#x27;t feel like a wet mop on her head.</li>
            <li> Horrible ripped immediately.  I haven&#x27;t seen it since I bought it for my wife.  I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s at the dump.  I guess I could have used it to dry my car.</li>
            <li> Strange smells the first time and should be used when using laundry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, water absorption is very good,</li>
            <li> Total bunk. Does not dry hair quickly, doesn&#x27;t fit especially well. Doesn&#x27;t save time. Not at all worth it.</li>
            <li> BEST HAIR TOWEL EVER.  I didn&#x27;t believe this towel would be as awesome as they said and it is.  you have to get the towel wet first and then ring it out. and my hair has been healthier then ever.  THANK YOU  HOLY COW TOWEL</li>
            <li> Excellent product! My wife and daughter fight over it constantly. Definitely no complaints and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the time it takes her to get ready!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will. This product has no hype and it isn&#x27;t promising you anything other than what&#x27;s in the name. The towel dries my hair very quickly and it&#x27;s comfortable to wear. I&#x27;m going to get another one for christmas...</li>
            <li> everyday i use this&lt;br /&gt;so easy and i like it</li>
            <li> Love this! My hair is much softer since I&#x27;ve been using this!</li>
            <li> I love this product! After using it for just a couple days, I liked it so much I went back and bought a second one to have as a spare. It fits snugly on the head and eliminates the weight and hassle of using a full sized towel.I have super long curly hair that takes hours to air dry. I don&#x27;t blow dry it because it makes my hair frizzy... Even my sister started to use this one. It dries hair super fast! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> All the reviews are dated around the same time and most are mens names... not who would usually by a head towel like this.  Makes me wonder if they are legit or posted by the seller</li>
            <li> This is like a Sham Wow for your hair.  I hate washing my hair because it takes forever to dry. I wrap my hair for about 15 minutes in this and it cuts my drying time in half. I really love this thing. I&#x27;m getting another to keep in my vacation suitcase so I don&#x27;t forget it.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive on buying it at first as I thought it might just go in for a normal towel. But I was wrong, it made all the difference I wanted. Saves so much of my time and it is so easy to be used. Drying hair, when you are late to office turns out to be terrible, but this towel is a perfect solution! Added to it the towel is of light weight too and handy to use. Im glad I have it!</li>
            <li> Works... great for air drying my hair in less time.</li>
            <li> More like a kevlar skull cap than a towel.</li>
            <li> works ok but not a great item as promissed</li>
            <li> I love this concept. I have really long hair, it&#x27;s a bit hard to fit all my hair into it but once you get it, it works better than a towel. It absorbs more than the towel, leaves your hair frizzless</li>
            <li> I wonder if there is anyone who has not been irritated by wet hair when getting ready in a hurry. I had always thought the humble dryer is the ultimate solution in this regard. But HCT drying towel was totally a table turner. It immediately soaked moisture from the wet hair and prepared the hair for light blow drying. I had some fears about exposing my hairs to l hot blowing for long duration, which I came to know was a real risk. With HCT drying towel this fear was removed. The light, comfortable and dry fitting towel made my day.</li>
            <li> Remarkably absorbent towel!  I use it daily..  You really do just wet it, wring it out, and put it on.  It is also quite soft when wet.</li>
            <li> The first Holy Cow Towel I received broke (the elastic fell off) the first time I used it, but when I left a poor review I got a quick response from Customer Service and they sent me a replacement.  The new towel works as expected, but the chamois isn&#x27;t a thick or absorbent as I&#x27;d hoped. However, the shape and the closure do make it easier to use than a simple, rectangular chamois.      I&#x27;ve updated my rating to reflect my view of the new towel.</li>
            <li> I got this towel wrap from a different retailer  online but I like it. I only wish it was a little bigger as my hair is extremely long. But for being the size it is and not being in the mall towel it still does dry my hair quicker than a regular towel. Design is nice and it just sits right in your head and I&#x27;m able to twist it and put it around as if I were to be using a regular towel except with this I don&#x27;t have extra towel hanging or making my head feel extremely heavy. Towel is great for anyone with long hair that has takes a long time to even get it just slightly damp to put hair products in. I know mine is a soppy mop for hours but if I eat tried to dry my hair with a towel. It&#x27;s great for those times when using a hair dryer won&#x27;t dry your hair too much to do what you want to do with styling wise.</li>
            <li> Very stiff and does not really dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Yes this is definitely much better than trying to use a towel or blow dryer to dry my hair. Towel drying frizzes my hair and blow drying it severely dries my hair out and causes it to poof but with this towel it doesn’t do either of these which saves me times and I do not have to be in a rush. A truly great product!!</li>
            <li> Does not work any better than a towel does. I have relatively short hair.  Maybe it would work on longer hair.  It does not fit -buttons are too far over.  Hate that it does not work.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these and the loop broke the first time I used it, but it still helped dry my hair, so I returned it and repurchased. They were great and promptly refunded my money and I am already enjoying my new towel and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> Do not buy - hard like cardboard when dry and does not stay wrapped around the head.  Waste of $.</li>
            <li> READ the instructions!  This towel is just like the chamois used to dry your car, it must be damp to work properly.  I have very long very curly hair and a huge head and this does really work well.  The elastic is not the greatest, I have replaced mine, but big deal a needle and thread is all you need.  This towel has greatly helped my hair, I use it then wring it out and put it back on for a while.  I have not used heat for years, but my hair takes hours to dry and this does reduce the air dry time.</li>
            <li> opened up the package and the towel ripped apart!</li>
            <li> this towel really does dry hair fast, the only downside is that the two times I&#x27;ve used it my scalp became very itchy and irritated. I have sensitive skin so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> looks good!! very nice!</li>
            <li> The first towel I received the elastic had been in the heat too long so it broke and when trying to open the towel the inside stuck the other side and ripped pieces off. I contacted the seller and they sent me a new one right away that didn&#x27;t have any issues. It is very weird to wet something and then use it to dry your hair but it works. I use these types of towels but not this material. I think this is a little more work then just my regular hair towels but I still like it. This is the same material that is used to dry off cars and those are kept in a sealed plastic container to keep them damp. I think it would be helpful to do something like that instead of wetting it each time. I think I may try it in a tuperware and see how that works.</li>
            <li> It does, indeed, absorb.  It just doesn&#x27;t absorb as miraculously as most reviews I read.  My drying time has not been shorted either.</li>
            <li> Pretty ugly. I tend to grab a microfiber one instead just because I don&#x27;t want to prep thus by dialing before use</li>
