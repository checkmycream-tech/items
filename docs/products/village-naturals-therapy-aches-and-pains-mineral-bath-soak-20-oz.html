            <li>It feels nice while you are in.</li>
            <li>They say to soak in a warm bath for twenty minutes before bed and drink chamomile tea.</li>
            <li>I sprinkled a handful of these bath salts in the tub and proceeded to fill the tub with warm water.</li>
            <li>Even the kids (who are not allowed \\&quot;bubble bath\\&quot; because of health issues) loved the \\&quot;magic bath rocks\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Liked it and does what I want.</li>

            <li>love all VN products&lt;</li>
            <li>When I take my feet out, they feel a lot better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Village naturals make a shower gel for aches &amp; pains but that works much better than these bath salts.</li>
            <li>I love the Therapy line of Village Naturals Bath Salts.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;Aches &amp; Pains&#x27; one is a favorite.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more.</li>
            <li>That being said, I love these salts.  </li>
            <li>They love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Village Naturals sells it for seven, and most drugstores sell the product for seven or eight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become one of my favorites &amp; I just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed many of the products in this line.</li>
            <li>I have found it better than just a epsom salt soak for aches and pains or headaches.</li>
            <li>I guess if you had muscule pains you might feel it more</li>
            <li>When I am home and the rls is really acting up, I soak in this wonderfully scented and relaxing soak and can easily go to sleep.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty good</li>
            <li>ok, smells good and gives you the &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; of menthol, but it did absolutely nothing for aches and pains, so if you buy it, buy it for the smell mostly.</li>
            <li>I typically am NOT a fan of anything with eucalyptus, but I found these to smell mild and feel WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that all of their products or over 99% naturally derived, but these salts are great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never slept more soundly.  </li>
            <li>The scent in the bath is light &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li>This product dissolved well, had a nice scent, and was a relaxing mineral foot soak A great way to end a long day on your feet.</li>
            <li>It feels like the aroma is gently burning - in a good way - the pain away.</li>
            <li>I have tried many items, but this works the best hands down.</li>
            <li>Why spend tons of money when you can have your own therapy mineral bath right at home.</li>
            <li>I originally found it at the grocery store and ended up buying more through Amazon...</li>
            <li>Product arrived VERY quickly ....</li>
            <li>so* strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relaxing and soothing, the smell can be a bit strong for my taste like Vicks in my nose</li>
            <li>If you like strong menthol like bath thus s for you.</li>
            <li>The aroma could be a bit strong for some</li>
            <li>I purchased this but thought the scent was too strong.</li>
            <li>it not as strong as the one I often use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend after a good workout - or if you just have chronic aches &amp; pains.  </li>
            <li>The pain relief I enjoy after a good soak is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li>I take soak in a tub of hot water and this amazing stuff</li>
            <li>Now I have the crystals poured back in, but I want my mother&#x27;s gift to look beautiful too</li>
            <li>I draw a nice hot bath with Village Naturals Therapy Aches &amp; Pains Mineral Bath Soak</li>
            <li>As stated in the subject, this is a very good product!</li>
            <li>and I do just fine with this bath soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This item was just fine when we used it.  </li>
            <li>We have tried many of them-each really does seem to have its own special qualities and usefulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>he ran me a bath witht ehse bath salts that i understood WHY he liked them so much.</li>
            <li>Light a couple candles, have some Kenny G playing in the background</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s attractive especially around holiday</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s green and foamy and smells wonderful for my aching muscle soak.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great after playing hockey, or in trying to get a short relief from chronic pain.  </li>
            <li>The price is cheap for how this stuff makes you feel.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy and appreciate Village Naturals Therapy Aches &amp; Pains Mineral Bath Soak 20 oz with its eucalyptus fragrance.</li>
            <li>love the aroma and the fresh</li>
            <li>After about 5 deep inhalations on each side, the sinus pressure greatly decreases.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and really relieves my aches and pains.</li>
            <li>This smells so amazing very relaxing</li>
            <li>, they are much better, smells soft &amp; nice</li>
            <li>Cheaper than local and just as good :)</li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>Thank you, the Natural Therapy Aches &amp; pains Mineral Bath Soak, are great in a hot bubble bath, release the pains</li>
            <li>I have tried their stress and tension one as well and also enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally a shower kind of guy -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>significantly helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works better in a tub rather than a hot tub.</li>
            <li>We were able to find more locally and that is why we did not buy more.</li>
            <li>With the aid of these bath salts in a soak before bedtime, I have found significant relief from arthritis pain.</li>
            <li>all of them will clean your airways, but the sinus and allergy will clean your sinuses of anything(we&#x27;re talking matchbox cars), or you can eat a spoon of wasabi and not get the soak.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my wife, I don&#x27;t know if it really worked, but my wife loved it and she ran out of it fast.  </li>
            <li>These bath salts are a unique combination of being affordable, smelling good, and actually doing what they claim to.</li>
            <li>and my skin and joints still feel cool and tenderized.</li>
            <li>I love the aroma-therapy aspects, the scents aren&#x27;t too over bearing either and really contour the aches and pains.</li>
            <li>This product specifically is my favorite because it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>muscles felt cool and tingly for about an hour after my soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoyable smell, works as advertised, no issues with asthma/allergies, reasonable price (but not the lowest).  </li>
            <li>She wants more.</li>
            <li>and you feel the cool refreshment relieving the pain.  </li>
            <li>and it foams nice, smells fabulous and is soooooo nice after training for (then running in) a half marathon!</li>
            <li>This particular product is the best I&#x27;ve tried of a few epsom salts available on amazon.  </li>
            <li>i have a tremendous amount of joint and muscle pain.</li>
            <li>I used this while I was pregnant, because I was so achy and sore, and just needed to relax</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant</li>
            <li>Dissolves quickly and the scent goes away</li>
            <li>They dissolve quickly and fully.</li>
            <li>I quickly drained the tub &amp; turned on the shower-head to wash my skin &amp; get it off me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(The smell of this is mild but I will tell you that if you do not like the smell of menthol or vapor rubs....</li>
            <li>I have been buying this variety as well as the Restless Nights variety for mother&#x27;s day/birthday gifts for mom, she is a huge fan of bath salts but these are by far her favorite.</li>
            <li>The menthol cools just enough, it makes my skin feel soft and the fragrance leaves my whole house smelling great!  </li>
            <li>They are new, perfect to soak away those tired aches &amp; pains while enjoying a cup of fresh coffee!</li>
            <li>It dissolves pretty fast and makes a bath very relaxing and enjoyable!</li>
            <li>The bathroom was full of soothing minty smells and when I soaked in this water I felt as though my aching muscles just loosened right up.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and you only need a small amount in your bath to get the great muscle relief you need!</li>
            <li>This product does a great job of relaxing tight muscles.  </li>
            <li>She said the salts smelled great, made the water green, and that was about it.</li>
            <li>It did also seem to open my sinuses a bit which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>This worked well in COLD water, and so I am sure that it would be GREAT in a hot/warm bath!  </li>
            <li>and yes the scents gave off a powerful smell when I opened them</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed it for the $5.75 I paid when I bought it in early December.</li>
            <li>When it first comes out of the container, the smell is wonderful but it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I think I&#x27;m better off with a warm bath and few glasses of brandy for temporary pain relief then a warm bath and this product.</li>
            <li>Worked great for my achy muscles, not a huge fan of the smell.</li>
            <li>worth a go</li>
            <li>have been trying various methods to ensure more sound sleep.  </li>
            <li>Village Naturals product is worth trying in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Just thought that was worth mentioning.)</li>
            <li>and I can say it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Arrived as expected and pleased with item.  :)</li>
            <li>, \\&quot;Whoa!\\&quot; I knew I had bought the right stuff.</li>
            <li>Helps if I can&#x27;t sleep or I&#x27;m sore or right.</li>
            <li>I work out at a high intensity so this is important to me and</li>
            <li>I have a few of Village Naturals salts and while each one concentrates on what is on the label they all cross over and are great for healthy mind and body.</li>
            <li>but lately I find myself more and more soaking the pain away!</li>
            <li>which is great for me because every one of my joints hurt at the same time and it kind of gets ridiculous when you have to rub ointment on every bendy part of your body.</li>
            <li>Ladies love it and they&#x27;re actually quite useful for relieving stress and pains.</li>
            <li>and I am sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li>as a person who does martial arts and insanity daily, it&#x27;s great to relieve those pains and aches you get from a sore body.</li>
            <li>When we first bought it, we were skeptical, but now we are more relaxed and happy.</li>
            <li>make sure the water is a little hot and your bones can get a more relaxed feeling with hot water.</li>
            <li>I also really enjoy the scent it even doubles to clear up your sinuses which can sometimes go hand in hand with an achy body!</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Lid fits well and plastic container is nice, even reusable, so this is a high enough quality for gift giving.</li>
            <li>I just received this in the mail (APO - stationed in Japan) and firstly - well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I made a semi hot bath after just coming home from the gym and put 3/4 cup of this into the bath.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>i soak in hot baths with epsom salt all the time.</li>
            <li>It is soo relaxing, and it really does help with the aches and pains, I never want to get out of the bath with this stuff!</li>
            <li>wow it doesnt get rid of the pain all the way but makes your skin feel smooth</li>
            <li>i love this stuff , but i found the same product at walmart for 4.97 .</li>
            <li>And yes, I believe I did feel better the next morning.....</li>
            <li>I have tried many others and ALWAYS come back to these1</li>
            <li>I soak in a hot bath with this product along with some oil and bubbles.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to sleep!</li>
            <li>It was better in a regular bath.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a teacher, and some days I need to come home and just relax and take a hot bath.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Personally, I think the aroma combined with the warm water and just the relaxing situation of being in the tub, create a mental situation where you think your pain is better.</li>
            <li>Cons: Doesn’t do anything for aches and pains beyond what soaking in a hot tub</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on baths, but I got into them while we had this on hand because I felt significantly more relaxed after soaking in this.</li>
            <li>you most likely won&#x27;t care for the smell of this bath soak.</li>
            <li>The menthol can be a bit much but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>The best part is that even in very very hot water the cooling sensation of these salts tricks the body into thinking that its sitting in cold water.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s the kind of person who balks at me using Lavender oil for allergies and barely believes in the value of taking vitamins, definitely not a natural medicine kind of guy, so for him to say these worked actually meant something.</li>
            <li>I have also taken a large pretty glass container</li>
            <li>The menthol in these salts is so strong you can&#x27;t smell anything else, and that&#x27;s only using 1 tablespoon in a whole bath!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a positive test.</li>
            <li>My third favorite is the Citrus one - another intensely scented bath salt that&#x27;s gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I had foot surgery and the skin was super- sensitive and the menthol perhaps made the bottom of my feet sting and  tender.</li>
            <li>people may not like the scent because it is a strong menthol I personally like it</li>
            <li>Its soothing and great to use in a very warm bath especially when your sick</li>
            <li>I have tried every single on of Village Naturals bath salts, and I can say that I love them all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s around $4 bucks for a large box at Walmart</li>
            <li>My sister was happy to see them on Christmas day and told me today, less than 2 months later that she already used them up.</li>
            <li>I think this soak would be perfect if you had a cold or were feeling kind of down from a sinus problem.  </li>
            <li>The kids all laugh and remark at the strong smells, I just laugh and climb back into the saddle the next day!  </li>
            <li>except it was all over my whole body.</li>
            <li>The customer reviews looked promising</li>
            <li>Get ready for a burst of chill.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like Vitabath but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>14.99 is way to much .</li>
            <li>/&gt;The aromatherapy of Aches &amp; Pains is really revitalizing.  </li>
            <li>price is terrific-better than any bath salts costing much more-at this price one can really have a luxurious, plentiful bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never been much of a believe in these bath salts, but this one changed my mind.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the smell is a gentle soothing aroma of chamomile.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly to anyone who has sore muscles!</li>
            <li>and it really helps with swollen and achy feet.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t know if they actually help with Aches and Pains, I did enjoy using these in a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gift that really delivers to you or whomever receives it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like that effect, but I could feel my tension release.  </li>
            <li>I felt my skin was very tingly,</li>
            <li>I paid way too much for this.</li>
            <li>THAT IT IS ALREADY CAPABLE OF DOING FOR YOUR ACHES AND PAINS</li>
            <li>Just fill your tub with lots of water and lay back and enjoy.</li>
            <li>Maybe they were putting in too much.  </li>
            <li>This really helps with the aches and pains.</li>
            <li>Does not take much in your bath.</li>
            <li>This really helps soak away all the aches and pains that I get from being on my feet all day.</li>
            <li>I brought this for my son who plays baseball and he uses it to soak in and says it really helps.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>mine might be too much for any soak to handle.  </li>
            <li>But my husband, who was in pain waiting to have knee surgery, used these up fast taking baths every night to sooth his knee pain.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend a try!</li>
            <li>and it really does help soothe my aches and pains.</li>
            <li>It really does help soothe muscles and a headache as well.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is too much</li>
            <li>but i didnt notice any difference even after I put in twice as much .</li>
            <li>Another thing is this product has a medicated sent, making not only good for aches and pains, but also good for any cold or stuffy nose.</li>
            <li>The bubbles aren&#x27;t  necessary  - the soothing quality in the warm water is enough.</li>
            <li>I add epsom salt and Dead Sea Salt to it and soak my feet in warm water.  </li>
            <li>It actually takes a hot bath and makes it feel super therapeutic.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, for all ages especially if you have trouble sleeping, this relaxes mind &amp; spirit, enough to just hit the sheets without any worries and/or pains, very very refreshing!!</li>
            <li>I can use a little alone as it is very strong</li>
            <li>The placebo effect, in other words.&lt;br /&gt;I will say this, that while not repulsed by the product to never by it again for anything other then aroma bath salt, I also wasn&#x27;t impressed enough to buy it again as a viable form of pain relief.  </li>
            <li>The scent is so nice that we tried to trap it in as long as possible.  </li>
            <li>your entire body is going to be so cool that it feels like you rubbed mentholatum all over it</li>
            <li>Call it weird, but the tingly feeling was more intense around the muscles that were most sore.  </li>
            <li>I felt better the next morning  after bath but haven&#x27;t noticed much of release of pain as such.</li>
            <li>Who wants to shell out $42 for Ole Henriksen soak when you can get these little magic bullets?</li>
            <li>Finding bath salts has become much more difficult, but I love the smell of these.  </li>
            <li>The container is about the size of an Arizona Ice tea(give or take) and is decently packed.</li>
            <li>After mineral baths my skin is also very soft!</li>
            <li>Nothing beats the natural aroma and aches and pains relief of these, mixed with a nice sonata of \\&quot;Guy screaming\\&quot; in B Minor.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY highly recommended.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND The Vaseline Moisturizing Beads</li>
            <li>highly recommend this</li>
            <li>The scent is powerful in my little bathroom which is something I look for; it has a sharp, clean aroma with strong mint tones.  </li>
            <li>Also, you&#x27;d have to wait to be alone due to the strong smell.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak too much about how much it helps with actually relieving her pain, but she certainly enjoys it</li>
            <li>Ok I am highly disappointed because amazon used to offer this product for $6.95 and free shipping I wanted to buy more and saw amazon doesn&#x27;t directly sell it so the price is high</li>
            <li>If your mother-in-law is suffering from late stage COPD, like mine is, you may want to reconsider this gift as a nice gesture for her...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this works so well for aches and pains, but the mint cooling factor was enough to make my hot bath water seem much cooler than I knew it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it, but I first purchased this in my local grocery store and liked it.  </li>
            <li>It did work wonderfully at clearing my sinuses, so I highly recommend using this when sick.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t stick your nose right up to the bath salts and take a big whiff like I did!</li>
            <li>I have a history of seizures and it is triggered by a tremendous amount of stress.  </li>
            <li>Melted a brand new tub</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft and I am not going to need moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Both my husband and I used this product for the first time recently.</li>
            <li>Not sure Epsom salts are a magic cure, or just the hot relaxing bath water, but this has a minty tingle, yes you can actually feel it.</li>
            <li>It noted the Eucalyptus, Chamomile, and Rosehips, but failed to mention the most important ingredient-- Menthol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out on a limb and purchased them without knowing about it and was pleasantly surprised when they arrived.</li>
            <li>( I have an ovarian cyst plus lower back pains) but just the hot water alone soothes any muscle aches I have</li>
            <li>By the way, DO NOT get it in your eyes unless you have something besides the bath water near you to rinse them!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it it relieves aches and pains, but it helps make the bath much more soothing.</li>
            <li>However, if you live anywhere near a walmart I&#x27;d look there first as its about a third of the price.</li>
            <li>It tingles and smells rather strong, but it does calm tired legs.</li>
            <li>but any container will work and added a large amount of the regular epson salts</li>
            <li>The person I was giving this to used the product to saok feet after hard runs  or training sessions and enjoyed the use.</li>
            <li>As soon as I poured it into the hot water, it cleared up my sinuses, so its great for a cold too!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m 29 years old.</li>
            <li>Plus it makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of of aches and pains from an old injury and a neuro/muscle disease</li>
            <li>I breath in these salts directly from the canister that they come in.  </li>
            <li>I have done it with JUST the oil and bubbles and notice my skin isn&#x27;t as soft as it is when I add this in.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 25 years old I suffer from arthritis in my knees and pcos.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I pulled a muscle last week and was literally having difficulty walking, and I really do think soaking with these</li>
            <li>a hanky near by)</li>
            <li>Your skin is so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>so I put the crystals in my hand and rubbed directly on my neck (in the shower</li>
            <li>Got sensitive nose?</li>
            <li>It has really helped me with some recent bouts of sciatica also.</li>
            <li>I follow up with Two Old Goats foot balm and put on some socks</li>
            <li>alive feeling after a bath in this..</li>
            <li>I have Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition, and I am always trying to find natural ways to help reduce my pain.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a marathon runner and frequently gets aches and pains from her training.  </li>
            <li>She likes to take baths to help ease pain, so this seemed like a natural fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it at the request of my 18 year old daughter after trying a sample size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used nearly every bath salt that Village Naturals makes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to mixing my own plain epsom salts and essential oils.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no ring around the tub as I&#x27;ve encountered with other colorful bath products &amp; no slippery residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and was appealing to a man.</li>
            <li>Get the exact same products at your local Wal-Mart for $5; they even have .97c trial size packets!</li>
            <li>I have tried supplementation (ZMA, melatonin), over the counter drugs (diphenhydramine and one other), lightbox therapy and virtually every other non-prescription modality you&#x27;ll find articles about online for better sleep.  </li>
            <li>ORDER THIS AND ENJOY A LITTLE TUB TIME!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to soak in Epsom Salts as an addition to their regular salt.  </li>
            <li>I have survived two major car accidents (for the record - rear enders and not my fault!)</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and is very good to use when you have a cold, i just had a cold</li>
            <li>This stuff works well for minor aches in my experience and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I was under the impression it would feel different during a bath vs a normal bath</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old and pretty active.</li>
            <li>and I find this to work very well especially for the price especially if you have prime time.  </li>
            <li>It works well for calming senses and general relaxation.</li>
            <li>I ordered three of these (different scents), and one on the jars tops completely broke and spilled the crystals into the shipping box.</li>
            <li>If you have had a recent surgery and have a sensitive skin spot, I&#x27;d recommend using it in half-strength to check it out</li>
            <li>this is the only product on amazon so far that i would</li>
            <li>I ordered four jars last time and it was nearly gone in 1 month.</li>
            <li>When I finally tried it I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Soaking in this will immediately open your sinuses and get you back to breathing normal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is worthy.</li>
            <li>I was in a whole other world.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m skeptical about how much of my pain relief came from soaking in hot water and how much came from this product.</li>
            <li>Since pretty much everybody feels and reacts to pain differently, it&#x27;s impossible for me or anybody for that matter, to say that using this will decrease pain beyond what a normal hot bath would.  </li>
            <li>I have scolosis and major back issues.  </li>
            <li>Had I known that the major ingredients were menthol and eucalyptus, I would have purchased without a second thought!</li>
            <li>I really look forward to the end of the day taking a little time for myself and preparing the old body for the next day&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have to look very far to spot the extremism and lack of logical thought in the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>I added a small amount to their bath water and their congestion eased right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what all bath salts are supposed to do, but at least the smell made it nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several other brands of Eucalyptus Spearmint Epsom Salts with no problem, however for some reason this particular brand irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very, very soft and radiant and I also get few break outs on my chest and back, this has no harsh effect on that if anything it takes any bumps away.</li>
            <li>Usually, I dump half the bottle or box of salts in, but since the smell was so strong, I decided to follow the directions.  </li>

            <li> That said, it does smell really good.</li>
            <li> but my sister said they smelled so good that she was generous in pouring them into her bath.</li>

            <li> it did smell good when I passed by the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I would have settled for just smelling good.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good bath soak you should try one of their line of options.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Epsom salt baths.</li>
            <li> They loved it and so did I</li>
            <li> The fragrance itself is very pleasant, strong eucalyptus scent that will pierce your olfactory nerve.</li>

            <li> Nice fragrance - pleasant bath addition.  </li>

            <li> but on a weekly bases i tried another one of the products too just as great why i dont see more reviews</li>

            <li> I sprinkled a handful of these bath salts in the tub and proceeded to fill the tub with warm water.</li>
            <li> Even the kids (who are not allowed \\&quot;bubble bath\\&quot; because of health issues) loved the \\&quot;magic bath rocks\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Liked it and does what I want.</li>
            <li> They give a nice cleansing salt bath but also have a varying set of nature&#x27;s lineaments and aromas that also help with stress, aches &amp; pains, and even sinus &amp; allergy(have</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> : As a bath salt, these have a nice scent and they do make my skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The packaging is also nice.</li>

            <li> The smell is very strong, but nice.  </li>
            <li> In any bath store these products can easily run $20 or more, great value for what you get.</li>

            <li> This stuff makes your whole bathroom smell great and its so relaxing.</li>

            <li> love all VN products&lt;</li>
            <li> When I take my feet out, they feel a lot better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Village naturals make a shower gel for aches &amp; pains but that works much better than these bath salts.</li>
            <li> I love the Therapy line of Village Naturals Bath Salts.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Aches &amp; Pains&#x27; one is a favorite.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more.</li>
            <li> That being said, I love these salts.  </li>
            <li> They love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Village Naturals sells it for seven, and most drugstores sell the product for seven or eight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become one of my favorites &amp; I just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed many of the products in this line.</li>
            <li> I have found it better than just a epsom salt soak for aches and pains or headaches.</li>
            <li> I guess if you had muscule pains you might feel it more</li>
            <li> When I am home and the rls is really acting up, I soak in this wonderfully scented and relaxing soak and can easily go to sleep.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good</li>
            <li> ok, smells good and gives you the &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; of menthol, but it did absolutely nothing for aches and pains, so if you buy it, buy it for the smell mostly.</li>
            <li> I typically am NOT a fan of anything with eucalyptus, but I found these to smell mild and feel WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that all of their products or over 99% naturally derived, but these salts are great.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never slept more soundly.  </li>
            <li> The scent in the bath is light &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li> This product dissolved well, had a nice scent, and was a relaxing mineral foot soak A great way to end a long day on your feet.</li>
            <li> It feels like the aroma is gently burning - in a good way - the pain away.</li>
            <li> I have tried many items, but this works the best hands down.</li>
            <li> Why spend tons of money when you can have your own therapy mineral bath right at home.</li>
            <li> I originally found it at the grocery store and ended up buying more through Amazon...</li>
            <li> Product arrived VERY quickly ....</li>
            <li> so* strong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relaxing and soothing, the smell can be a bit strong for my taste like Vicks in my nose</li>
            <li> If you like strong menthol like bath thus s for you.</li>
            <li> The aroma could be a bit strong for some</li>
            <li> I purchased this but thought the scent was too strong.</li>
            <li> it not as strong as the one I often use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend after a good workout - or if you just have chronic aches &amp; pains.  </li>
            <li> The pain relief I enjoy after a good soak is nothing short of amazing.  </li>
            <li> I take soak in a tub of hot water and this amazing stuff</li>
            <li> Now I have the crystals poured back in, but I want my mother&#x27;s gift to look beautiful too</li>
            <li> I draw a nice hot bath with Village Naturals Therapy Aches &amp; Pains Mineral Bath Soak</li>
            <li> As stated in the subject, this is a very good product!</li>
            <li> and I do just fine with this bath soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This item was just fine when we used it.  </li>
            <li> We have tried many of them-each really does seem to have its own special qualities and usefulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> he ran me a bath witht ehse bath salts that i understood WHY he liked them so much.</li>
            <li> Light a couple candles, have some Kenny G playing in the background</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s attractive especially around holiday</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s green and foamy and smells wonderful for my aching muscle soak.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great after playing hockey, or in trying to get a short relief from chronic pain.  </li>
            <li> The price is cheap for how this stuff makes you feel.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy and appreciate Village Naturals Therapy Aches &amp; Pains Mineral Bath Soak 20 oz with its eucalyptus fragrance.</li>

            <li> After about 5 deep inhalations on each side, the sinus pressure greatly decreases.</li>

            <li> Thank you, the Natural Therapy Aches &amp; pains Mineral Bath Soak, are great in a hot bubble bath, release the pains</li>
            <li> I have tried their stress and tension one as well and also enjoyed it very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a shower kind of guy -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> significantly helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works better in a tub rather than a hot tub.</li>
            <li> We were able to find more locally and that is why we did not buy more.</li>
            <li> With the aid of these bath salts in a soak before bedtime, I have found significant relief from arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> all of them will clean your airways, but the sinus and allergy will clean your sinuses of anything(we&#x27;re talking matchbox cars), or you can eat a spoon of wasabi and not get the soak.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife, I don&#x27;t know if it really worked, but my wife loved it and she ran out of it fast.  </li>
            <li> These bath salts are a unique combination of being affordable, smelling good, and actually doing what they claim to.</li>
            <li> and my skin and joints still feel cool and tenderized.</li>
            <li> I love the aroma-therapy aspects, the scents aren&#x27;t too over bearing either and really contour the aches and pains.</li>
            <li> This product specifically is my favorite because it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> muscles felt cool and tingly for about an hour after my soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enjoyable smell, works as advertised, no issues with asthma/allergies, reasonable price (but not the lowest).  </li>
            <li> She wants more.</li>
            <li> and you feel the cool refreshment relieving the pain.  </li>
            <li> and it foams nice, smells fabulous and is soooooo nice after training for (then running in) a half marathon!</li>
            <li> This particular product is the best I&#x27;ve tried of a few epsom salts available on amazon.  </li>
            <li> i have a tremendous amount of joint and muscle pain.</li>
            <li> I used this while I was pregnant, because I was so achy and sore, and just needed to relax</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant</li>
            <li> Dissolves quickly and the scent goes away</li>
            <li> They dissolve quickly and fully.</li>
            <li> I quickly drained the tub &amp; turned on the shower-head to wash my skin &amp; get it off me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(The smell of this is mild but I will tell you that if you do not like the smell of menthol or vapor rubs....</li>
            <li> I have been buying this variety as well as the Restless Nights variety for mother&#x27;s day/birthday gifts for mom, she is a huge fan of bath salts but these are by far her favorite.</li>
            <li> The menthol cools just enough, it makes my skin feel soft and the fragrance leaves my whole house smelling great!  </li>
            <li> They are new, perfect to soak away those tired aches &amp; pains while enjoying a cup of fresh coffee!</li>
            <li> It dissolves pretty fast and makes a bath very relaxing and enjoyable!</li>
            <li> The bathroom was full of soothing minty smells and when I soaked in this water I felt as though my aching muscles just loosened right up.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and you only need a small amount in your bath to get the great muscle relief you need!</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of relaxing tight muscles.  </li>
            <li> She said the salts smelled great, made the water green, and that was about it.</li>
            <li> It did also seem to open my sinuses a bit which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> This worked well in COLD water, and so I am sure that it would be GREAT in a hot/warm bath!  </li>
            <li> and yes the scents gave off a powerful smell when I opened them</li>
            <li> and I enjoyed it for the $5.75 I paid when I bought it in early December.</li>
            <li> When it first comes out of the container, the smell is wonderful but it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I think I&#x27;m better off with a warm bath and few glasses of brandy for temporary pain relief then a warm bath and this product.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my achy muscles, not a huge fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> worth a go</li>
            <li> have been trying various methods to ensure more sound sleep.  </li>
            <li> Village Naturals product is worth trying in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Just thought that was worth mentioning.)</li>
            <li> and I can say it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and pleased with item.  :)</li>
            <li> , \\&quot;Whoa!\\&quot; I knew I had bought the right stuff.</li>
            <li> Helps if I can&#x27;t sleep or I&#x27;m sore or right.</li>
            <li> I work out at a high intensity so this is important to me and</li>
            <li> I have a few of Village Naturals salts and while each one concentrates on what is on the label they all cross over and are great for healthy mind and body.</li>
            <li> but lately I find myself more and more soaking the pain away!</li>
            <li> which is great for me because every one of my joints hurt at the same time and it kind of gets ridiculous when you have to rub ointment on every bendy part of your body.</li>
            <li> Ladies love it and they&#x27;re actually quite useful for relieving stress and pains.</li>
            <li> and I am sensitive to strong smells.</li>
            <li> as a person who does martial arts and insanity daily, it&#x27;s great to relieve those pains and aches you get from a sore body.</li>
            <li> When we first bought it, we were skeptical, but now we are more relaxed and happy.</li>
            <li> make sure the water is a little hot and your bones can get a more relaxed feeling with hot water.</li>
            <li> I also really enjoy the scent it even doubles to clear up your sinuses which can sometimes go hand in hand with an achy body!</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Lid fits well and plastic container is nice, even reusable, so this is a high enough quality for gift giving.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail (APO - stationed in Japan) and firstly - well packaged.  </li>
            <li> I made a semi hot bath after just coming home from the gym and put 3/4 cup of this into the bath.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> i soak in hot baths with epsom salt all the time.</li>
            <li> It is soo relaxing, and it really does help with the aches and pains, I never want to get out of the bath with this stuff!</li>
            <li> wow it doesnt get rid of the pain all the way but makes your skin feel smooth</li>
            <li> i love this stuff , but i found the same product at walmart for 4.97 .</li>
            <li> And yes, I believe I did feel better the next morning.....</li>
            <li> I have tried many others and ALWAYS come back to these1</li>
            <li> I soak in a hot bath with this product along with some oil and bubbles.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to sleep!</li>
            <li> It was better in a regular bath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teacher, and some days I need to come home and just relax and take a hot bath.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Personally, I think the aroma combined with the warm water and just the relaxing situation of being in the tub, create a mental situation where you think your pain is better.</li>
            <li> Cons: Doesn’t do anything for aches and pains beyond what soaking in a hot tub</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on baths, but I got into them while we had this on hand because I felt significantly more relaxed after soaking in this.</li>
            <li> you most likely won&#x27;t care for the smell of this bath soak.</li>
            <li> The menthol can be a bit much but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> The best part is that even in very very hot water the cooling sensation of these salts tricks the body into thinking that its sitting in cold water.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s the kind of person who balks at me using Lavender oil for allergies and barely believes in the value of taking vitamins, definitely not a natural medicine kind of guy, so for him to say these worked actually meant something.</li>
            <li> I have also taken a large pretty glass container</li>
            <li> The menthol in these salts is so strong you can&#x27;t smell anything else, and that&#x27;s only using 1 tablespoon in a whole bath!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a positive test.</li>
            <li> My third favorite is the Citrus one - another intensely scented bath salt that&#x27;s gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I had foot surgery and the skin was super- sensitive and the menthol perhaps made the bottom of my feet sting and  tender.</li>
            <li> people may not like the scent because it is a strong menthol I personally like it</li>
            <li> Its soothing and great to use in a very warm bath especially when your sick</li>
            <li> I have tried every single on of Village Naturals bath salts, and I can say that I love them all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s around $4 bucks for a large box at Walmart</li>
            <li> My sister was happy to see them on Christmas day and told me today, less than 2 months later that she already used them up.</li>
            <li> I think this soak would be perfect if you had a cold or were feeling kind of down from a sinus problem.  </li>
            <li> The kids all laugh and remark at the strong smells, I just laugh and climb back into the saddle the next day!  </li>
            <li> except it was all over my whole body.</li>
            <li> The customer reviews looked promising</li>
            <li> Get ready for a burst of chill.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like Vitabath but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> 14.99 is way to much .</li>
            <li> /&gt;The aromatherapy of Aches &amp; Pains is really revitalizing.  </li>
            <li> price is terrific-better than any bath salts costing much more-at this price one can really have a luxurious, plentiful bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never been much of a believe in these bath salts, but this one changed my mind.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the smell is a gentle soothing aroma of chamomile.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly to anyone who has sore muscles!</li>
            <li> and it really helps with swollen and achy feet.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t know if they actually help with Aches and Pains, I did enjoy using these in a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift that really delivers to you or whomever receives it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like that effect, but I could feel my tension release.  </li>
            <li> I felt my skin was very tingly,</li>
            <li> I paid way too much for this.</li>
            <li> THAT IT IS ALREADY CAPABLE OF DOING FOR YOUR ACHES AND PAINS</li>
            <li> Just fill your tub with lots of water and lay back and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Maybe they were putting in too much.  </li>
            <li> This really helps with the aches and pains.</li>
            <li> Does not take much in your bath.</li>
            <li> This really helps soak away all the aches and pains that I get from being on my feet all day.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my son who plays baseball and he uses it to soak in and says it really helps.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> mine might be too much for any soak to handle.  </li>
            <li> But my husband, who was in pain waiting to have knee surgery, used these up fast taking baths every night to sooth his knee pain.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend a try!</li>
            <li> and it really does help soothe my aches and pains.</li>
            <li> It really does help soothe muscles and a headache as well.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is too much</li>
            <li> but i didnt notice any difference even after I put in twice as much .</li>
            <li> Another thing is this product has a medicated sent, making not only good for aches and pains, but also good for any cold or stuffy nose.</li>
            <li> The bubbles aren&#x27;t  necessary  - the soothing quality in the warm water is enough.</li>
            <li> I add epsom salt and Dead Sea Salt to it and soak my feet in warm water.  </li>
            <li> It actually takes a hot bath and makes it feel super therapeutic.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, for all ages especially if you have trouble sleeping, this relaxes mind &amp; spirit, enough to just hit the sheets without any worries and/or pains, very very refreshing!!</li>
            <li> I can use a little alone as it is very strong</li>
            <li> The placebo effect, in other words.&lt;br /&gt;I will say this, that while not repulsed by the product to never by it again for anything other then aroma bath salt, I also wasn&#x27;t impressed enough to buy it again as a viable form of pain relief.  </li>
            <li> The scent is so nice that we tried to trap it in as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> your entire body is going to be so cool that it feels like you rubbed mentholatum all over it</li>
            <li> Call it weird, but the tingly feeling was more intense around the muscles that were most sore.  </li>
            <li> I felt better the next morning  after bath but haven&#x27;t noticed much of release of pain as such.</li>
            <li> Who wants to shell out $42 for Ole Henriksen soak when you can get these little magic bullets?</li>
            <li> Finding bath salts has become much more difficult, but I love the smell of these.  </li>
            <li> The container is about the size of an Arizona Ice tea(give or take) and is decently packed.</li>
            <li> After mineral baths my skin is also very soft!</li>
            <li> Nothing beats the natural aroma and aches and pains relief of these, mixed with a nice sonata of \\&quot;Guy screaming\\&quot; in B Minor.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY highly recommended.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND The Vaseline Moisturizing Beads</li>
            <li> highly recommend this</li>
            <li> The scent is powerful in my little bathroom which is something I look for; it has a sharp, clean aroma with strong mint tones.  </li>
            <li> Also, you&#x27;d have to wait to be alone due to the strong smell.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak too much about how much it helps with actually relieving her pain, but she certainly enjoys it</li>
            <li> Ok I am highly disappointed because amazon used to offer this product for $6.95 and free shipping I wanted to buy more and saw amazon doesn&#x27;t directly sell it so the price is high</li>
            <li> If your mother-in-law is suffering from late stage COPD, like mine is, you may want to reconsider this gift as a nice gesture for her...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works so well for aches and pains, but the mint cooling factor was enough to make my hot bath water seem much cooler than I knew it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it, but I first purchased this in my local grocery store and liked it.  </li>
            <li> It did work wonderfully at clearing my sinuses, so I highly recommend using this when sick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stick your nose right up to the bath salts and take a big whiff like I did!</li>
            <li> I have a history of seizures and it is triggered by a tremendous amount of stress.  </li>
            <li> Melted a brand new tub</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and I am not going to need moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Both my husband and I used this product for the first time recently.</li>
            <li> Not sure Epsom salts are a magic cure, or just the hot relaxing bath water, but this has a minty tingle, yes you can actually feel it.</li>
            <li> It noted the Eucalyptus, Chamomile, and Rosehips, but failed to mention the most important ingredient-- Menthol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out on a limb and purchased them without knowing about it and was pleasantly surprised when they arrived.</li>
            <li> ( I have an ovarian cyst plus lower back pains) but just the hot water alone soothes any muscle aches I have</li>
            <li> By the way, DO NOT get it in your eyes unless you have something besides the bath water near you to rinse them!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it it relieves aches and pains, but it helps make the bath much more soothing.</li>
            <li> However, if you live anywhere near a walmart I&#x27;d look there first as its about a third of the price.</li>
            <li> It tingles and smells rather strong, but it does calm tired legs.</li>
            <li> but any container will work and added a large amount of the regular epson salts</li>
            <li> The person I was giving this to used the product to saok feet after hard runs  or training sessions and enjoyed the use.</li>
            <li> As soon as I poured it into the hot water, it cleared up my sinuses, so its great for a cold too!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m 29 years old.</li>
            <li> Plus it makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of of aches and pains from an old injury and a neuro/muscle disease</li>
            <li> I breath in these salts directly from the canister that they come in.  </li>
            <li> I have done it with JUST the oil and bubbles and notice my skin isn&#x27;t as soft as it is when I add this in.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old I suffer from arthritis in my knees and pcos.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I pulled a muscle last week and was literally having difficulty walking, and I really do think soaking with these</li>
            <li> a hanky near by)</li>
            <li> Your skin is so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> so I put the crystals in my hand and rubbed directly on my neck (in the shower</li>
            <li> Got sensitive nose?</li>
            <li> It has really helped me with some recent bouts of sciatica also.</li>
            <li> I follow up with Two Old Goats foot balm and put on some socks</li>
            <li> alive feeling after a bath in this..</li>
            <li> I have Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition, and I am always trying to find natural ways to help reduce my pain.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a marathon runner and frequently gets aches and pains from her training.  </li>
            <li> She likes to take baths to help ease pain, so this seemed like a natural fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it at the request of my 18 year old daughter after trying a sample size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nearly every bath salt that Village Naturals makes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to mixing my own plain epsom salts and essential oils.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no ring around the tub as I&#x27;ve encountered with other colorful bath products &amp; no slippery residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and was appealing to a man.</li>
            <li> Get the exact same products at your local Wal-Mart for $5; they even have .97c trial size packets!</li>
            <li> I have tried supplementation (ZMA, melatonin), over the counter drugs (diphenhydramine and one other), lightbox therapy and virtually every other non-prescription modality you&#x27;ll find articles about online for better sleep.  </li>
            <li> ORDER THIS AND ENJOY A LITTLE TUB TIME!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to soak in Epsom Salts as an addition to their regular salt.  </li>
            <li> I have survived two major car accidents (for the record - rear enders and not my fault!)</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and is very good to use when you have a cold, i just had a cold</li>
            <li> This stuff works well for minor aches in my experience and is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression it would feel different during a bath vs a normal bath</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old and pretty active.</li>
            <li> and I find this to work very well especially for the price especially if you have prime time.  </li>
            <li> It works well for calming senses and general relaxation.</li>
            <li> I ordered three of these (different scents), and one on the jars tops completely broke and spilled the crystals into the shipping box.</li>
            <li> If you have had a recent surgery and have a sensitive skin spot, I&#x27;d recommend using it in half-strength to check it out</li>
            <li> this is the only product on amazon so far that i would</li>
            <li> I ordered four jars last time and it was nearly gone in 1 month.</li>
            <li> When I finally tried it I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Soaking in this will immediately open your sinuses and get you back to breathing normal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is worthy.</li>
            <li> I was in a whole other world.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about how much of my pain relief came from soaking in hot water and how much came from this product.</li>
            <li> Since pretty much everybody feels and reacts to pain differently, it&#x27;s impossible for me or anybody for that matter, to say that using this will decrease pain beyond what a normal hot bath would.  </li>
            <li> I have scolosis and major back issues.  </li>
            <li> Had I known that the major ingredients were menthol and eucalyptus, I would have purchased without a second thought!</li>
            <li> I really look forward to the end of the day taking a little time for myself and preparing the old body for the next day&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to look very far to spot the extremism and lack of logical thought in the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I added a small amount to their bath water and their congestion eased right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all bath salts are supposed to do, but at least the smell made it nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other brands of Eucalyptus Spearmint Epsom Salts with no problem, however for some reason this particular brand irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very, very soft and radiant and I also get few break outs on my chest and back, this has no harsh effect on that if anything it takes any bumps away.</li>
            <li> Usually, I dump half the bottle or box of salts in, but since the smell was so strong, I decided to follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> only con is the product doesn&#x27;t last long because its not a big container.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold it in a larger size, as everyone in my house loves it and the jar doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> after a long work day my back and ankles were popping and creaking.</li>
            <li> I have long suffered from restless leg syndrome (rls) and take daily medications to treat it.  </li>
            <li> and i think i got over it faster than normal because i was bathing with this everyday.  </li>
            <li> When Amazon didn&#x27;t have any in stock and the local store didn&#x27;t have any in stock, he actually called around to other stores to find someone who had the product in stock.  </li>
            <li> to strong (my 4 kids hated how strong it was that it smelled down the hallway).</li>
            <li> I was just very surprised to feel so cold in a very hot bath.  </li>
            <li> About 15 minutes was about the most I could stand because I felt physically cold.  </li>
            <li> also love the Cold &amp; Allergy Therapy -</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> definitely no lavender aroma - so choose your version carefully.</li>
            <li> She felt as though her back didn&#x27;t hurt that day and mentally refreshed as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that one has to be careful in only  one way I found.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if you use this for a soak in the tub or if it&#x27;s just for a foot soak after a long day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time lover of these products.</li>
            <li> Not a natural product</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t dry out his skin or negatively effect his skin in any way (a new cheaper replacement has, so I need to go back to buying this brand).</li>
            <li> it made my whole body feel cold like when you rub icy hot or tiger balm and a sore joint or muscle.</li>
            <li> I have several other types of salts by village naturals</li>
            <li> At one point I was pacing back and forth due to pain</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m a dancer with a bad back.</li>
            <li> Her lower back and legs were so worn down after an eight hour shift that I would run a bath with the mineral crystals for her when she got home.</li>
            <li> I add 1/2 cup of this to 2 cups of regular Epsom Salt to keep the expense down and also to stretch this a bit farther.</li>
            <li> The only reason I would feel like giving this item less than five stars is because the scent is</li>
            <li> And the previous comment about taking a big whiff out of the jar is just like putting a Hall&#x27;s up your nose.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells strong and that is just what you want if you have a cold and are all stopped up.  </li>
            <li> I got a little peeved and he said just open it and smell it</li>
            <li> but they throw in that little extra.</li>
            <li> got this for my husband who had an accident a few years ago while deployed and broke his back.</li>
            <li> He loves them so much that he bought them for my aunt, which in turn, got her addicted to them as well.  </li>
            <li> Then after 40 minutes, the headache seriously begins to subside completely!  </li>
            <li> I previously sprained my spinal cord and strained some ligaments, so after long hours of dancing I&#x27;m often sore.</li>
            <li> I can describe it as feeling hot and cold at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try the other ones as well.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> I get small bouts of relief, lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute and 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I toss the other packets in the trash!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I was looking to give this as a gift - so I bought it and put it in several small boxes for lady friends along with a tub for a foot soak.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it in a foot soak if I play several days of tennis in a row.  </li>
            <li> The salt is supposed to be good.for you because it gives you magnesium but other than that...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the smell of this product, it smells like you are bathing in menthol and the smell sticks around for awhile, as far as the healing affects are concerned I have not felt any different.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of those village Naturals Single Use Packets which is pre measure for one bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a particularly hard week at the gym, I purchased on of the 2 oz sample packets from my local gift/flower shop.  </li>
            <li> Defentetly not worth $20.</li>
            <li> I have to visit chiropractor at least once a month to release back pain and joint misalignment and was hopeful that this product would ease the tension.</li>
            <li> (do not take a big whiff unless you&#x27;re sick), and if you use too much (like I did!)</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t even realize that when you are sitting there, relaxing, chawing down on some dude&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> See it&#x27;s now down to $12.50 but suggest you head to Walmart instead of Amazon.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t lay down to take a bath</li>
            <li> You can buy it from Target or Walmart for half the price.</li>
            <li> The Rosemary one - the scent is odd - too medicinal.</li>
            <li> I typically use about half a bottle with a bath that&#x27;s 105-110 degrees</li>
            <li> I sniff long and hard, about every 2 - 3 minutes, for about 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li> When the pain gets really bad, I open the jar, place my nose as close to the salts as possible WITHOUT inhaling them,  and take a deep breath through each nostril.</li>
            <li> The menthol in the product made my HOT bath water feel ice cold.  </li>
            <li> I also think this would be fabulous if you are stuffed up with a cold!</li>
            <li> &quot; i just got out of the tub a little while ago.</li>
            <li> They are green and turn the water a slight green color</li>
            <li> the scent on that one is enough to relax my congestion in the Fall &amp; Spring &amp; during the occasional Winter cold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I really like to use it on cold days)  </li>
            <li> used the salts a few times, and I asked her how they affect her baths.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with some aches and pains</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding it.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product about a few months ago and was about to buy it again, however changed my mind.</li>
            <li> , of course, this was messy) and it helped alot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this now for a few bath sessions and</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes in a bath of the liquid or crystals</li>
            <li> As a fitness instructor and weight lifter, i am often stiff and sore.  </li>
            <li> Also, once I pulled a muscle in my neck and it was so stiff</li>
            <li> It is not a strong aroma at all to me</li>
            <li> I get pretty bad headaches, and tend to get them quite often</li>
            <li> I suppose that&#x27;s not a bad thing if you also have a fever, but I didn&#x27;t at the time, so it&#x27;s just a little weird to get out of the bath feeling cold</li>
            <li> Aches &amp; Pains bath salts really did help a bad shoulder sprain -after</li>
            <li> No more than 2 oz.</li>
            <li> I usually put about 1/4 of a bottle and then add a cup of ebsom salt.</li>
            <li> Seems to help for a little while, but let&#x27;s face it, when you get older we are just going to accept that we have aches and pains. :(</li>
            <li> Even dissolved very well in the cold water!  </li>
            <li> It was hard to tell what was in these salts from the amazon page...</li>
            <li> Helps on a hard day after the gym.</li>
            <li> this will clear you stuffy nose when sick</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> however, if you are just achy and tired  and need a &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34; bath after a hard day in the factory or deal with drama-stricken cubicle life, then this product might be for you.</li>
            <li> I also received the Restless Nights version, and it smelled like soap, not a pleasant aroma, to my wife or I, and</li>
            <li> Overall, disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed when I bought the same product and size at Target for $5.</li>
            <li> But it does work for tired and sore bodies.</li>
            <li> I could not find relief for sore, tired feet.  </li>
            <li> I had a very bad sprain to my foot and ankle - and the doctor told me to soak my foot in ice water frequently.  </li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY!</li>
            <li> my lower body hurts something serious!</li>
            <li> I found the Vanilla &amp; Cinnamon one to be a very delicately scented one - a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> some people have commented that it makes the water feel cold, but i have not experienced that at all.</li>
            <li> By soaking in it, the body begins to feel a chilling sensation.</li>
            <li> It felt as if the cold was going to every place on my body that hurt.  </li>
            <li> But who on earth would want to absorb artificial colors into&lt;br /&gt;their body?  </li>
            <li> You can feel the cold of the Menthol or whatever its in.</li>
            <li> you use the product your body will feel cold (even if your bath water is scolding)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my twin boys caught a cold</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice soothing/relaxing addition to bath! I do martial arts &amp; these bath salts work to relieve aches &amp; pains.  I recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Does not leave a film on the tub (or on you).</li>
            <li> My wife likes to take baths, so I thought I&#x27;d order some products to help enhance her weeknights. Along with bubbles, I placed an order for these bath salts, as I thought that would be a relaxing stimulant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s used the salts a few times, and I asked her how they affect her baths. She said the salts smelled great, made the water green, and that was about it. I&#x27;m not sure what all bath salts are supposed to do, but at least the smell made it nice.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with some aches and pains and I saw the Village Naturals Aches and Pains Mineral Bath Soak.  I figured why not give them a try.  Couldn&#x27;t hurt.  I enjoyed the aroma because I had some allergies bothering me and then I stepped into the tub.  I soaked for about 15 or 20 minutes and I did not want to get out of the bath.  All I can say is, I hope they have bunches of this stuff, because I am a believer and I want more. My head, body and allergies feel better.  I am going to try the other ones as well.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I used this product for the first time recently. I am recovering from a back injury.  The Mineral bath was perfect as it allowed me to be pain free through the night.  I have a feeling that this will be addicting.  A word of caution though, the product seems to contain quite a bit of menthol.  Don&#x27;t use it if you may have skin sensitivies to menthol products.  It will also give a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; or \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; feeling.  I really loved that.  So think of it as a Biofreeze or bengay in a bath.  Don&#x27;t over do the amount you put into the bath.  I will be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> got this for my husband who had an accident a few years ago while deployed and broke his back. his back now hurts him all the time. when he got back from deployment again i had these waiting for him to soak in the bathub with. it wasnt untill he ran me a bath witht ehse bath salts that i understood WHY he liked them so much. the smell is STRONG but they feel soooooo good on your aching muscles!</li>
            <li> I have a history of seizures and it is triggered by a tremendous amount of stress.  When I bought these bath salts, (The Aches &amp; Pains one it helped me to relieve a lot of stress in the jacuzzi! Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other brands of Eucalyptus Spearmint Epsom Salts with no problem, however for some reason this particular brand irritates my skin.  It&#x27;s almost like my skin is on fire when I&#x27;m in the bath.  I now have this jar sitting in a cabinet and it won&#x27;t get used.    That said, it does smell really good.</li>
            <li> I like to take baths, especially having sore muscles from working a physical job. Not sure Epsom salts are a magic cure, or just the hot relaxing bath water, but this has a minty tingle, yes you can actually feel it. And it smells wonderful. It did also seem to open my sinuses a bit which was a nice surprise. The feel and aroma is lively, a nice balance to the relaxing bath. I also received the Restless Nights version, and it smelled like soap, not a pleasant aroma, to my wife or I, and definitely no lavender aroma - so choose your version carefully.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend after a good workout - or if you just have chronic aches &amp; pains.  The menthol cools just enough, it makes my skin feel soft and the fragrance leaves my whole house smelling great!  You can&#x27;t get a better, more effective product for the cost!</li>
            <li> Why spend tons of money when you can have your own therapy mineral bath right at home. It smells gooood like \\&quot;vicks\\&quot;, its so relaxing &amp; soothing. After mineral baths my skin is also very soft! I highly recommend it, for all ages especially if you have trouble sleeping, this relaxes mind &amp; spirit, enough to just hit the sheets without any worries and/or pains, very very refreshing!!</li>
            <li> This mineral bath works great! My wife and I both have aches and pains from working for so many years. When we first bought it, we were skeptical, but now we are more relaxed and happy. Her lower back and legs were so worn down after an eight hour shift that I would run a bath with the mineral crystals for her when she got home. She felt as though her back didn&#x27;t hurt that day and mentally refreshed as well.</li>
            <li> Great addition to the bath water!</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail (APO - stationed in Japan) and firstly - well packaged.  I made a semi hot bath after just coming home from the gym and put 3/4 cup of this into the bath.  The smell was great and then after getting into the bath the real therapy began.  I can describe it as feeling hot and cold at the same time.  It felt as if the cold was going to every place on my body that hurt.  I love this product and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> i have Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis and i&#x27;m 29 years old. i have a tremendous amount of joint and muscle pain. i soak in hot baths with epsom salt all the time. but i saw this and said, \\&quot;hey! i have aches and pains. let&#x27;s try it.\\&quot; i just got out of the tub a little while ago. it made my whole body feel cold like when you rub icy hot or tiger balm and a sore joint or muscle. except it was all over my whole body. which is great for me because every one of my joints hurt at the same time and it kind of gets ridiculous when you have to rub ointment on every bendy part of your body. so these bath salts are perfect for me. it&#x27;s been almost an hour since i got out of the tub and my skin and joints still feel cool and tenderized. i want to buy a case of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Delivery was excellent! Arrived a day before said delivery date. And let me just say when I tried the bath salts...I was in a whole other world. It was the most relaxing experience of my life. Light a couple candles, have some Kenny G playing in the background and you&#x27;re all set! Will definitely be a future buyer!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is worthy. I originally found it at the grocery store and ended up buying more through Amazon...IT&#x27;S THAT GOOD! I&#x27;m 50 years old and pretty active. This product soothes sore muscles and joints so you can sleep. Plus it makes your skin feel soft. This is no wonder drug or magic pain relief, but it does make you feel better...without drugs. I would highly recommend it. It smells like you are at the spa, too!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an XMAS gift for my mother, she loves taking baths and needs to be able to relax.    I have not used this product-but I am still upset.    I ordered three of these (different scents), and one on the jars tops completely broke and spilled the crystals into the shipping box. There were NO measures taken to ensure the safety of my items (like bubble wrap or foam peanuts).    Now I have the crystals poured back in, but I want my mother&#x27;s gift to look beautiful too and that can&#x27;t happen now with these jars. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order from this user again.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of of aches and pains from an old injury and a neuro/muscle disease and I find this to work very well especially for the price especially if you have prime time.  I can use a little alone as it is very strong and I like to mix with 2 to 3 cups regular magnesium salts for additional treatment.  I have found it to be an excellent product used either way . You only need a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have also taken a large pretty glass container but any container will work and added a large amount of the regular epson salts then it mix up then I can just add to tub pre  mixed plus makes my bath smell like a spa and it&#x27;s attractive especially around holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many marketed items and this along with the  village naturals Muscle Relief Lotion is a great combo to sooth muscles and ease aches.</li>
            <li> Got these for my mother for Mother&#x27;s day and for some friends. Ladies love it and they&#x27;re actually quite useful for relieving stress and pains. Definitely a great purchase. Man, I can&#x27;t believe each of these different \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; has a different product review box to fill out. They&#x27;re all great.</li>
            <li> Really nice and relaxing product. A little bit goes a long ways!</li>
            <li> The only reason I would feel like giving this item less than five stars is because the scent is *so* strong (do not take a big whiff unless you&#x27;re sick), and if you use too much (like I did!) your entire body is going to be so cool that it feels like you rubbed mentholatum all over it once you&#x27;re out of the bath - and it feels that way for an hour or more. I suppose that&#x27;s not a bad thing if you also have a fever, but I didn&#x27;t at the time, so it&#x27;s just a little weird to get out of the bath feeling cold (my fault, though). It did work wonderfully at clearing my sinuses, so I highly recommend using this when sick.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad sprain to my foot and ankle - and the doctor told me to soak my foot in ice water frequently.  I used this in my water when I soaked my foot, and it worked great.  Even dissolved very well in the cold water!  This worked well in COLD water, and so I am sure that it would be GREAT in a hot/warm bath!  Although I am not a big \\&quot;soak-in-the-tub\\&quot; person, I would purchase this again just because it worked so well on my injured foot!</li>
            <li> This bath salt isn&#x27;t too pricey, yet it smells good and feels awesome. It is my favorite of the 5 or so I&#x27;ve tried. My only question is if it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon or at Target.</li>
            <li> My sister had asked for bath salts for Christmas (2010) so I did a search on Amazon and stumbled on these. The customer reviews looked promising so I bought the package of 3 Village Naturals bath salts for about $28. They arrived promptly, well-packaged up and yes the scents gave off a powerful smell when I opened them and I was like, \\&quot;Whoa!\\&quot; I knew I had bought the right stuff. My sister was happy to see them on Christmas day and told me today, less than 2 months later that she already used them up. I was shocked. I just assumed that people use bath salts as an every once-in-awhile thing but my sister said they smelled so good that she was generous in pouring them into her bath. I&#x27;m quite happy that I got her exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> I used this while I was pregnant, because I was so achy and sore, and just needed to relax &#x3D;) It has a very strong, but good and refreshing smell. As soon as I poured it into the hot water, it cleared up my sinuses, so its great for a cold too! It is soo relaxing, and it really does help with the aches and pains, I never want to get out of the bath with this stuff! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I have had trouble finding it.  I have scolosis and major back issues.  On the weekends I work on our cattle ranch/pine tree plantation.  I really look forward to the end of the day taking a little time for myself and preparing the old body for the next day&#x27;s work.  The kids all laugh and remark at the strong smells, I just laugh and climb back into the saddle the next day!  (All five of them!)  enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have not used these myself, but I bought them for my dad as a gift.  Well, I&#x27;ve created a monster.  He loves them so much that he bought them for my aunt, which in turn, got her addicted to them as well.  When Amazon didn&#x27;t have any in stock and the local store didn&#x27;t have any in stock, he actually called around to other stores to find someone who had the product in stock.  It was amusing to me...must be a good product.</li>
            <li> It was hard to tell what was in these salts from the amazon page... It noted the Eucalyptus, Chamomile, and Rosehips, but failed to mention the most important ingredient-- Menthol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out on a limb and purchased them without knowing about it and was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. Had I known that the major ingredients were menthol and eucalyptus, I would have purchased without a second thought! The menthol makes a really big difference.</li>
            <li> I love the Mineral Bath Soak! The only thing: I wish it came in larger containers! I have had seventeen spine surgeries (14 vertebrae fused) and I  get muscle aches I can&#x27;t even explain. This product is exceptional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that one has to be careful in only  one way I found. I had foot surgery and the skin was super- sensitive and the menthol perhaps made the bottom of my feet sting and  tender. If you have had a recent surgery and have a sensitive skin spot, I&#x27;d recommend using it in half-strength to check it out first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE put it in larger containers! I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d find your customers would be delighted !</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance - pleasant bath addition.  I combine with Masada Bath Salts to have awesome bath soak for my sore legs.</li>
            <li> Bath salts seem like a good idea to me.  But who on earth would want to absorb artificial colors into&lt;br /&gt;their body?  Beware that this product contains Blue 1 Lake and Yellow 5 Lake - - look these up if you dare.</li>
            <li> The menthol in these salts is so strong you can&#x27;t smell anything else, and that&#x27;s only using 1 tablespoon in a whole bath!  In addition, if you get any bath water in your eyes--watch out, it stings!  Overall, disappointed.  I&#x27;ll go back to mixing my own plain epsom salts and essential oils.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of relaxing tight muscles.  I have tried many items, but this works the best hands down.</li>
            <li> I just used after a 7+ mile run. It feels nice while you are in. You can feel the cold of the Menthol or whatever its in.</li>
            <li> The best menthol aches and pain soaking salt bath ever! Get ready for a burst of chill. I also follow up with the body lotion after the bath to keep the menthol relaxation going.I have always loved their products.</li>
            <li> Get the exact same products at your local Wal-Mart for $5; they even have .97c trial size packets! Five star is for product ONLY, not price.</li>
            <li> wow it doesnt get rid of the pain all the way but makes your skin feel smooth and you feel even better when you get out this is the only product on amazon so far that i would but on a weekly bases i tried another one of the products too just as great why i dont see more reviews i dont know</li>
            <li> I have to say.  I am so glad that I found this item, online, too.  I have been using this product for a semi \\&quot;unorthodox\\&quot; remedy.  I get pretty bad headaches, and tend to get them quite often (3 X per month??).  They are almost debilitating.  I breath in these salts directly from the canister that they come in.  I sniff long and hard, about every 2 - 3 minutes, for about 40 minutes.  I get small bouts of relief, lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute and 30 seconds.  Then after 40 minutes, the headache seriously begins to subside completely!  It has been a miracle for me.  SERIOUSLY!</li>
            <li> I play indoor volleyball, field turf soccer, softball on dirt/grass and work out with a trainer/run 3 mornings a week. My legs and feet and back are always sore. This stuff makes them feel so much better. The only downside is the size. I wish it would come in vats! I would probably buy it. I use this along with this awesome bath gel I found on amazom too - Badedads http://www.amazon.com/Badedas-Classic-Vital-Bubble-Fluid/dp/B0006NXAHQ and it&#x27;s green and foamy and smells wonderful for my aching muscle soak. It&#x27;s like Vitabath but much cheaper. I recommend you get both and try it out. It really works!!! I&#x27;m normally a shower kind of guy - but lately I find myself more and more soaking the pain away! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m a dancer with a bad back. I previously sprained my spinal cord and strained some ligaments, so after long hours of dancing I&#x27;m often sore. Taking a bath with this bath salt always relaxes my muscles and relieves the pain. Another thing is this product has a medicated sent, making not only good for aches and pains, but also good for any cold or stuffy nose. Soaking in this will immediately open your sinuses and get you back to breathing normal. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product for a few years now.  It&#x27;s great after playing hockey, or in trying to get a short relief from chronic pain.  I wish they sold it in a larger size, as everyone in my house loves it and the jar doesn&#x27;t last long.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Love this and dr teals I try to always have some by my bath! Helps if I can&#x27;t sleep or I&#x27;m sore or right. Love!</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong i love this stuff , but i found the same product at walmart for 4.97 . 14.99 is way to much .</li>
            <li> Product is as described.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  Just AHHHHHH.  Smells great!  Feels great!  I bought the bubble bath to go with this and it foams nice, smells fabulous and is soooooo nice after training for (then running in) a half marathon!</li>
            <li> This entire line of bath salts is just wonderful.  We have tried many of them-each really does seem to have its own special qualities and usefulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aches &amp; Pains bath salts really did help a bad shoulder sprain -after one soak, the shoulder was more than 50% better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aromatherapy of Aches &amp; Pains is really revitalizing.  The scent is so nice that we tried to trap it in as long as possible.  Great for the sinuses as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is terrific-better than any bath salts costing much more-at this price one can really have a luxurious, plentiful bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give these bath salts a try-I recommend starting with Aches &amp; Pains!</li>
            <li> As stated in the subject, this is a very good product! I primarily used it in the bath tub for soaking, and relaxing and to relieved aches and pains from exercising!</li>
            <li> As a fitness instructor and weight lifter, i am often stiff and sore.  I have never been much of a believe in these bath salts, but this one changed my mind.  After a particularly hard week at the gym, I purchased on of the 2 oz sample packets from my local gift/flower shop.  It was amazing!!  Smelled great and after about 6-7 minutes in the tub, I started to tingle all over and it felt so relaxing. Call it weird, but the tingly feeling was more intense around the muscles that were most sore.  I went back the next day and bought all the store had left.  Great product!!  And yes, I believe I did feel better the next morning.....</li>
            <li> Thank you, the Natural Therapy Aches &amp; pains Mineral Bath Soak, are great in a hot bubble bath, release the pains</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t even realize that when you are sitting there, relaxing, chawing down on some dude&#x27;s face.  Nothing beats the natural aroma and aches and pains relief of these, mixed with a nice sonata of \\&quot;Guy screaming\\&quot; in B Minor.</li>
            <li> I got home and my husband had opened the one box he shouldnt have. I got a little peeved and he said just open it and smell it and I did. I didnt even need to put it in the bath and it made me relax. I deffinately would recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this is the product for everyone, however since I was never a fan of taking a bath, only showers, I did want to try this for my body aches.  Seems to help for a little while, but let&#x27;s face it, when you get older we are just going to accept that we have aches and pains. :(</li>
            <li> I gave this as a part of a birthday gift to a friend and she loves them.Very reasonable price as well.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of eucalyptus and thought I wouldn&#x27;t like it. It opens up my sinus the moment I pour it into the bath. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Great for post workout.</li>
            <li> This is the best therapy for aches and pains and I have been using it for years!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works miracles for menstrual cramps! I felt relief within 15 minutes. No more than 2 oz. needed for one bath.</li>
            <li> These bath salts are the BEST! They desolve quickliy and the aroma&#x27;a are amazing! I have tried many others and ALWAYS come back to these1</li>
            <li> Before I go to bed I soak in a hot bath with this product along with some oil and bubbles. I have done it with JUST the oil and bubbles and notice my skin isn&#x27;t as soft as it is when I add this in. Not to mention the smell is a gentle soothing aroma of chamomile. It is not a strong aroma at all to me and I am sensitive to strong smells. It leaves my skin very, very soft and radiant and I also get few break outs on my chest and back, this has no harsh effect on that if anything it takes any bumps away. I have somewhat sensitive skin and I do just fine with this bath soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this four out of five because the claim is for Aches and Pains, I do not notice a difference in my pains ( I have an ovarian cyst plus lower back pains) but just the hot water alone soothes any muscle aches I have so this doesn&#x27;t make a difference for me personally. The smell is nice and Chamomile is great for helping you sleep as a natural relaxant, that&#x27;s why I use this mostly and before bed. They say to soak in a warm bath for twenty minutes before bed and drink chamomile tea. I do all of this PLUS this mineral bath soak and I&#x27;m ready to sleep! I do love this stuff and as for the aches &amp; pains.... I think it may be misleading but some say it helps them so that&#x27;s awesome for them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with the smell of this product, it smells like you are bathing in menthol and the smell sticks around for awhile, as far as the healing affects are concerned I have not felt any different.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old I suffer from arthritis in my knees and pcos. This bath salt is amazing and helps get rid of my pain.. I also like the stress and relaxing salt. If you are in pain or stress out this is a must get!!!!</li>
            <li> The person I was giving this to used the product to saok feet after hard runs  or training sessions and enjoyed the use.</li>
            <li> I use it when I have aches and pains...it truly eases pain and lifts the soreness! I recommend it highly to anyone who has sore muscles!</li>
            <li> It tingles and smells rather strong, but it does calm tired legs. Calming is all it does, it will not cure any medical conditions, such as arthritis, etc. just a temporary relief. Also, you&#x27;d have to wait to be alone due to the strong smell.</li>
            <li> My mother and I love this foot soak! The smell is great! Eucalyptus scent would even do wonders for chest/nasal congestion. A little goes a long way! I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant and it really helps with swollen and achy feet. I totally recommend this!</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t know if they actually help with Aches and Pains, I did enjoy using these in a relaxing bath. I enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li> after a long work day my back and ankles were popping and creaking. I sprinkled a handful of these bath salts in the tub and proceeded to fill the tub with warm water. The bathroom was full of soothing minty smells and when I soaked in this water I felt as though my aching muscles just loosened right up. The price is cheap for how this stuff makes you feel.</li>
            <li> The scent punches you in the face when you open the plastic container. If your mother-in-law is suffering from late stage COPD, like mine is, you may want to reconsider this gift as a nice gesture for her...however, if you are just achy and tired  and need a &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34; bath after a hard day in the factory or deal with drama-stricken cubicle life, then this product might be for you. Dissolves quickly and the scent goes away, so sniff sniff while you can and take it in. The herbs are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Helps on a hard day after the gym.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it enhances or adds to the mineral and aroma to Epsom salts bath soaks making it more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> This mineral soak smells wonderful, works great to relieve all those aches and pians. It&#x27;s a gift that really delivers to you or whomever receives it.</li>
            <li> I have never ran to the computer to make a product review, but this time I did.  I bought this product because I always have tension pain in my neck and shoulders.  The smell is very strong, but nice.  Usually, I dump half the bottle or box of salts in, but since the smell was so strong, I decided to follow the directions.  I am glad I did.  The menthol in the product made my HOT bath water feel ice cold.  I didn&#x27;t really like that effect, but I could feel my tension release.  About 15 minutes was about the most I could stand because I felt physically cold.  It is 15 minutes later and I still feel the tingle.  My skin is very soft and I am not going to need moisturizer.  So, overall, I guess it did its job.  I was just very surprised to feel so cold in a very hot bath.  By the way, DO NOT get it in your eyes unless you have something besides the bath water near you to rinse them!  And the previous comment about taking a big whiff out of the jar is just like putting a Hall&#x27;s up your nose.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of aches and pains and this is my favorite soak from Village Naturals. Just wish it came in a larger size. Maybe in a barrel.</li>
            <li> wife likes it, i dont need to know more.</li>
            <li> I have survived two major car accidents (for the record - rear enders and not my fault!) and to say I have aches and pains is a massive understatement.  But I love this product.  The scent is beautiful and calming.  The pain relief I enjoy after a good soak is nothing short of amazing.  I took a jar with me on vacation with my family.  It was \\&quot;shared\\&quot; away in two days.  Between the aching muscles from hiking and the running noses from allergies, EVERYONE loved the positive effects of a good soak in this mineral bath.  Even the kids (who are not allowed \\&quot;bubble bath\\&quot; because of health issues) loved the \\&quot;magic bath rocks\\&quot;.  I ordered four jars last time and it was nearly gone in 1 month. I may need to start ordering by the case as Christmas gifts are being requested already.  ORDER THIS AND ENJOY A LITTLE TUB TIME!</li>
            <li> These are GREAT and well-priced. Who wants to shell out $42 for Ole Henriksen soak when you can get these little magic bullets? I typically am NOT a fan of anything with eucalyptus, but I found these to smell mild and feel WONDERFUL. I had knee surgery 1 year ago with some chronic pain there and in my back. I have been using these post-workouts and have found them superb for the chronic pain. Additionally, I pulled a muscle last week and was literally having difficulty walking, and I really do think soaking with these significantly helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: They make the bath feel silky with only a capful. The smell is pleasant and soothing. They dissolve quickly and fully. Very reasonable cost. EXTREMELY highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this works so well for aches and pains, but the mint cooling factor was enough to make my hot bath water seem much cooler than I knew it was. And it&#x27;s great for clearing the sinuses. Don&#x27;t stick your nose right up to the bath salts and take a big whiff like I did! It was like sticking a Halls up my nose!</li>
            <li> The product is excellent but was damaged in shipment. Service through Amazon to correct the problem was nonexistent. I would recommend the product but not if shipped through Amazon.</li>
            <li> works well and smells great this will clear you stuffy nose when sick</li>
            <li> Awesome way to relax.....</li>
            <li> Smells just like vicks because of the menthol. Its soothing and great to use in a very warm bath especially when your sick</li>
            <li> This product dissolved well, had a nice scent, and was a relaxing mineral foot soak A great way to end a long day on your feet.</li>
            <li> I used it with my HoMedics BA-M200 Body Bubbles Bath Spa  and it was OK. It was better in a regular bath. The bubbles aren&#x27;t  necessary  - the soothing quality in the warm water is enough.</li>
            <li> Liked it and does what I want. Disappointed when I bought the same product and size at Target for $5. Felt I got gipped here.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the village naturals therapy aches &amp; pains mineral bath soak.  It works better in a tub rather than a hot tub.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter if you use this for a soak in the tub or if it&#x27;s just for a foot soak after a long day. I have a few of Village Naturals salts and while each one concentrates on what is on the label they all cross over and are great for healthy mind and body. As if getting a chance to soak wasn&#x27;t a big enough treat.......add one their soaks.....yeah. These not only give you a salt bath but they throw in that little extra. I do like the fact that all of their products or over 99% naturally derived, but these salts are great. They give a nice cleansing salt bath but also have a varying set of nature&#x27;s lineaments and aromas that also help with stress, aches &amp; pains, and even sinus &amp; allergy(have a hanky near by) all of them will clean your airways, but the sinus and allergy will clean your sinuses of anything(we&#x27;re talking matchbox cars), or you can eat a spoon of wasabi and not get the soak.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  It actually takes a hot bath and makes it feel super therapeutic.  Also works well in Spas.</li>
            <li> These are so great for a relaxing soak when you have sore muscles. They smell great, and are so refreshing. I order these all the time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good and I enjoyed it for the $5.75 I paid when I bought it in early December. It&#x27;s now $14.75? I&#x27;ve heard of price gouging but.................Amazon, you have a problem.    Follow up Feb 12, 2011...............Walmart has this product for under $5.00. See it&#x27;s now down to $12.50 but suggest you head to Walmart instead of Amazon.</li>
            <li> Came in before the estimated shipment delivery. The product was sealed and handled with love. I love the aroma-therapy aspects, the scents aren&#x27;t too over bearing either and really contour the aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single on of Village Naturals bath salts, and I can say that I love them all.&lt;br /&gt;I do, of course, have my favorites, but the aromatherapy works for each type. This one is great for those post-workout aches and pains. Lovely scent.</li>
            <li> the tingling sensation is relaxing and enjoyable. make sure the water is a little hot and your bones can get a more relaxed feeling with hot water.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and you only need a small amount in your bath to get the great muscle relief you need!</li>
            <li> Love this but get it at Walmart for $4.97.</li>
            <li> Great product! seriously love it....FYI it&#x27;s $5 at target</li>
            <li> Bought this for Mom and she loves using them (bought 3 kinds).</li>
            <li> This has made for some relaxing baths! I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mineral Salts for years &amp; never had a problem! I bought a few of those village Naturals Single Use Packets which is pre measure for one bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the one for Village Naturals Therapy aches &amp; pains brand last night, which smelled way to strong (my 4 kids hated how strong it was that it smelled down the hallway). After soaking for 10 mins. I felt my skin was very tingly, 5 mins later I realize that i was stinging (ON FIRE) &amp; not tingling. This product irritated my skin. I had burning blotchy red spots on my skin, it irritated everywhere OUCH! Red spots on my arms, around my belly &amp; thighs. I quickly drained the tub &amp; turned on the shower-head to wash my skin &amp; get it off me. I toss the other packets in the trash!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY RECOMMEND The Vaseline Moisturizing Beads, they are much better, smells soft &amp; nice, even my husband uses it (honey vanilla with milk protein scent is our favorite) and you get added bonus of bubbles( add a splash of Vaseline Foaming Creme Bubble Bath). You don&#x27;t even need to rinse off. Your skin is so soft afterwards. Plus it&#x27;s around $4 bucks for a large box at Walmart that will last you a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time lover of these products. I recommend them to every and anyone with pain/stiffness. I bought the entire aches and pain line for my fiance for Christmas, he adores the scent and loves the way it melts away stress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teacher, and some days I need to come home and just relax and take a hot bath. This stuff makes your whole bathroom smell great and its so relaxing. Soothes my aching legs and feet.</li>
            <li> my mother inlaw says you can get the same thing at dollar tree for $1   But she says it works great. I paid way too much for this.</li>
            <li> Product arrived VERY quickly .... I have used this product for years! I am well supplied now for sure. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a few months ago and was about to buy it again, however changed my mind. Its now almost tripled the price then when I bought it. Defentetly not worth $20. Can go to bed bath and beyond and get better price.</li>
            <li> This works great in the bath.  The combination of warm water and the cooling effect of the soak does a good job at relaxing muscles.  Also, once I pulled a muscle in my neck and it was so stiff I couldn&#x27;t lay down to take a bath so I put the crystals in my hand and rubbed directly on my neck (in the shower, of course, this was messy) and it helped alot.  Taking a bath with the soak is also good if you are suffering from seasonal allergies.</li>
            <li> I run marathons and this is perfect for a nice soak after a long run. for me it seems to prevent sore muscles if I use it after a run.</li>
            <li> The only bath-salts I have found that are non-allergenic for me.&lt;br /&gt;They smell really good and don&#x27;t leave residue on skin or in the tub.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a gift for my mom. It arrived right on time, and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li> The most soothing bath I&#x27;ve ever had.  My daughter gave me some for Christmas and when I ran out I just had to get some more. One jar lasts about a month and I will continue to order more.</li>
            <li> DOES NOTHING TO RELIEVE ANY ACHES AND PAINS AS IS DESCRIBED ON THE BOTTLE. ITS FRAGRANCE IS PLEASANT WHICH IS THE REASON FOR THE TWO STARS BUT IF YOUR THINKING THAT IT WOULD ASSIST YOUR SPA IN DOING ANY MORE THAT IT IS ALREADY CAPABLE OF DOING FOR YOUR ACHES AND PAINS THEN YOU&#x27;LL BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I love baths. It is my favorite part of the day. These baths salts smell wonderful and I love to just soak. They are green and turn the water a slight green color but I have had no problems with it staining my tub. Just fill your tub with lots of water and lay back and enjoy.</li>
            <li> some people have commented that it makes the water feel cold, but i have not experienced that at all. Maybe they were putting in too much.  It smells really nice and is very good to use when you have a cold, i just had a cold and i think i got over it faster than normal because i was bathing with this everyday.  It dissolves pretty fast and makes a bath very relaxing and enjoyable!</li>
            <li> It burned through my tub! Melted a brand new tub</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for someone and I am sure she will love it.</li>
            <li> I liked it. It works well for calming senses and general relaxation. I felt better the next morning  after bath but haven&#x27;t noticed much of release of pain as such. But again... maybe my case is too severe. I have to visit chiropractor at least once a month to release back pain and joint misalignment and was hopeful that this product would ease the tension. I guess I need something stronger. But great product anyway.</li>
            <li> Got aches? Great. Got pains? Great. Got sensitive nose? Not so great. I&#x27;ve used this now for a few bath sessions and as a person who does martial arts and insanity daily, it&#x27;s great to relieve those pains and aches you get from a sore body. It&#x27;s relaxing and soothing, the smell can be a bit strong for my taste like Vicks in my nose but besides that, it does a great job.</li>
            <li> This is described for soothng aches, but it helped open my sinuses. It&#x27;s romatherapy for the bath - lay back and relax.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! This really helps with the aches and pains. I order a second bottle!</li>
            <li> Finding bath salts has become much more difficult, but I love the smell of these.  I&#x27;m not sure it it relieves aches and pains, but it helps make the bath much more soothing.</li>
            <li> This is way overpriced.  You can buy it from Target or Walmart for half the price.</li>
            <li> It works and a good value.  Does not take much in your bath.</li>
            <li> If you like strong menthol like bath thus s for you. It does not leave your skin smelling like that though. Works good for all if my aches and pains. I have several other types of salts by village naturals and I also like to mix them based on my mood/needs.</li>
            <li> Great product for a very inexpensive cost. In any bath store these products can easily run $20 or more, great value for what you get.</li>
            <li> Ok I am highly disappointed because amazon used to offer this product for $6.95 and free shipping I wanted to buy more and saw amazon doesn&#x27;t directly sell it so the price is high and so is the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the product review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Village Naturals makes the best line of bath salts I&#x27;ve ever used. This product specifically is my favorite because it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use the product your body will feel cold (even if your bath water is scolding)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My muscles felt cool and tingly for about an hour after my soak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may not like the scent because it is a strong menthol I personally like it but that&#x27;s a preference and not everyone&#x27;s the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the product doesn&#x27;t last long because its not a big container.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to soak in Epsom Salts as an addition to their regular salt.  There are only two drawbacks that keep me from rating this a 5 out of 5. 1) The size, I wish it came in a larger container.  I add 1/2 cup of this to 2 cups of regular Epsom Salt to keep the expense down and also to stretch this a bit farther. 2) I wish the smell was a bit stronger.  When it first comes out of the container, the smell is wonderful but it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.  Other than that, it is a wonderful product that I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy and appreciate Village Naturals Therapy Aches &amp; Pains Mineral Bath Soak 20 oz with its eucalyptus fragrance. I have long suffered from restless leg syndrome (rls) and take daily medications to treat it.  When I am home and the rls is really acting up, I soak in this wonderfully scented and relaxing soak and can easily go to sleep.  It has really helped me with some recent bouts of sciatica also.</li>
            <li> This smells great very comforting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical about how much of my pain relief came from soaking in hot water and how much came from this product. Since pretty much everybody feels and reacts to pain differently, it&#x27;s impossible for me or anybody for that matter, to say that using this will decrease pain beyond what a normal hot bath would.  Personally, I think the aroma combined with the warm water and just the relaxing situation of being in the tub, create a mental situation where you think your pain is better. The placebo effect, in other words.&lt;br /&gt;I will say this, that while not repulsed by the product to never by it again for anything other then aroma bath salt, I also wasn&#x27;t impressed enough to buy it again as a viable form of pain relief.  Personally, I think I&#x27;m better off with a warm bath and few glasses of brandy for temporary pain relief then a warm bath and this product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells amazing and helps to ease my aches. I am walking for 6-8 hours a day at my job and at the end of the day my lower body hurts something serious! I take soak in a tub of hot water and this amazing stuff and I can actually fall asleep and Im not tossing and turning because I am in pain. I also think this would be fabulous if you are stuffed up with a cold!</li>
            <li> Not a natural product</li>
            <li> love all VN products&lt;br /&gt;this is good to for the bath to soak aching muscles in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in it, but I first purchased this in my local grocery store and liked it.  I add epsom salt and Dead Sea Salt to it and soak my feet in warm water.  When I take my feet out, they feel a lot better.  I follow up with Two Old Goats foot balm and put on some socks and then just relax.  I recommend it if you just want to ease some of your aches and pains.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my achy muscles, not a huge fan of the smell. But it does work for tired and sore bodies.</li>
            <li> Cons: Doesn’t do anything for aches and pains beyond what soaking in a hot tub will do for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: As a bath salt, these have a nice scent and they do make my skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Village naturals make a shower gel for aches &amp; pains but that works much better than these bath salts. I will stick with using that if I have aches and pains.</li>
            <li> This really helps soak away all the aches and pains that I get from being on my feet all day.</li>
            <li> have purchased their products before, and will always again...love the aroma and the fresh alive feeling after a bath in this..worth a go</li>
            <li> My mother has Nerve Pain. So she takes baths. She noted that it does help sooth the joint and nerves affected. So, it made me happy that i could supply her with a nice bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, if you do have some sort of joint pain, this is definitely a nice thing to have.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my son who plays baseball and he uses it to soak in and says it really helps.</li>
            <li> This item was just fine when we used it.  We were able to find more locally and that is why we did not buy more.</li>
            <li> I love the Therapy line of Village Naturals Bath Salts. The &#x27;Aches &amp; Pains&#x27; one is a favorite. The scent is powerful in my little bathroom which is something I look for; it has a sharp, clean aroma with strong mint tones.  There&#x27;s no ring around the tub as I&#x27;ve encountered with other colorful bath products &amp; no slippery residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the Cold &amp; Allergy Therapy - the scent on that one is enough to relax my congestion in the Fall &amp; Spring &amp; during the occasional Winter cold. My third favorite is the Citrus one - another intensely scented bath salt that&#x27;s gentle on the skin. I found the Vanilla &amp; Cinnamon one to be a very delicately scented one - a bit disappointing. The Rosemary one - the scent is odd - too medicinal.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift from my nephew. I have chronic back pain and this has helped relieve pain and muscle spasms when medication didn&#x27;t help. At one point I was pacing back and forth due to pain and I remembered the bath salts. They provided such pain relief and relaxation. I highly recommend this product! I just ordered two more. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells strong and that is just what you want if you have a cold and are all stopped up.  It also helps with the aches of the flu.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife, I don&#x27;t know if it really worked, but my wife loved it and she ran out of it fast.  it did smell good when I passed by the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have to say this did nothing for my aches and pains but mine might be too much for any soak to handle.  That being said, I love these salts.  They have the most wonderful, clean eucalyptus aroma and definitely provide a relaxing, pleasant bathing experience.  I think this soak would be perfect if you had a cold or were feeling kind of down from a sinus problem.  Just didn&#x27;t work on aches and pains for me but I will still use it for the scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying various methods to ensure more sound sleep.  I work out at a high intensity so this is important to me and sometimes the adrenaline/caffeine carry-over from the day doesn&#x27;t facilitate the soundest sleep.  I have tried supplementation (ZMA, melatonin), over the counter drugs (diphenhydramine and one other), lightbox therapy and virtually every other non-prescription modality you&#x27;ll find articles about online for better sleep.  I heard about epsom salts when reading a book by charlie francis (sprint coach who&#x27;s well known for that drug scandal) and tried them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product puts me in a state of total relaxation and I&#x27;ve never slept more soundly.  This particular product is the best I&#x27;ve tried of a few epsom salts available on amazon.  Enjoyable smell, works as advertised, no issues with asthma/allergies, reasonable price (but not the lowest).  I typically use about half a bottle with a bath that&#x27;s 105-110 degrees F.  This is way more than the bottle recommends, but it works best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to look very far to spot the extremism and lack of logical thought in the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I enjoy taking baths and this is a nice additions.  However, if you live anywhere near a walmart I&#x27;d look there first as its about a third of the price.</li>
            <li> These bath salts are a unique combination of being affordable, smelling good, and actually doing what they claim to. I would have settled for just smelling good. I honestly thought the aches and pains part would just be a placebo. But my husband, who was in pain waiting to have knee surgery, used these up fast taking baths every night to sooth his knee pain. He&#x27;s the kind of person who balks at me using Lavender oil for allergies and barely believes in the value of taking vitamins, definitely not a natural medicine kind of guy, so for him to say these worked actually meant something. The scent is subtle and was appealing to a man. I also liked the scent (I&#x27;m a woman). These didn&#x27;t dry out his skin or negatively effect his skin in any way (a new cheaper replacement has, so I need to go back to buying this brand). The packaging is also nice. Lid fits well and plastic container is nice, even reusable, so this is a high enough quality for gift giving. I&#x27;m not big on baths, but I got into them while we had this on hand because I felt significantly more relaxed after soaking in this. Would highly recommend a try!</li>
            <li> I use these as smelling salts, so I can&#x27;t rate how they work in the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sinus problems and have constant facial pain. When the pain gets really bad, I open the jar, place my nose as close to the salts as possible WITHOUT inhaling them,  and take a deep breath through each nostril. After about 5 deep inhalations on each side, the sinus pressure greatly decreases. It feels like the aroma is gently burning - in a good way - the pain away. Never found a product like this that works so quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a jar on my desk at work, and my coworkers periodically come over and take a couple of inhalations. They love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for price - you can purchase this item for under ten dollars. Village Naturals sells it for seven, and most drugstores sell the product for seven or eight.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I have so many aches and pains from having a failed back surgery in 2012. I draw a nice hot bath with Village Naturals Therapy Aches &amp; Pains Mineral Bath Soak and it really does help soothe my aches and pains. I also really enjoy the scent it even doubles to clear up your sinuses which can sometimes go hand in hand with an achy body! I am a repeat purchaser of this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well for minor aches in my experience and is very relaxing. The aroma could be a bit strong for some but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I have tried their stress and tension one as well and also enjoyed it very much. If you are looking for a good bath soak you should try one of their line of options.</li>
            <li> It´s ok, smells good and gives you the &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; of menthol, but it did absolutely nothing for aches and pains, so if you buy it, buy it for the smell mostly. Want something that will actually decrease some of the aches and pains? then look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my Mom. She is the only one in the family taking a bath. She wants more.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and then bought some for my mother.  Now we both use it and love it!  It truly does help to ease aches and pains. I have Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition, and I am always trying to find natural ways to help reduce my pain.  It does help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I really like to use it on cold days)  I also realized that many of the natural ingredients in the soak eased my breathing when I had a cold. When my twin boys caught a cold I added a small amount to their bath water and their congestion eased right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any Village Naturals product is worth trying in my opinion. I&#x27;ve yet to find one I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The smell of this is mild but I will tell you that if you do not like the smell of menthol or vapor rubs....you most likely won&#x27;t care for the smell of this bath soak. Just thought that was worth mentioning.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this but thought the scent was too strong. When I finally tried it I was pleasantly surprised. The scent in the bath is light &amp; refreshing. It does help relieve those aches &amp; pains. It&#x27;s become one of my favorites &amp; I just ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> This stuff was awesome to use during pregnancy when I was working. The menthol can be a bit much but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> With the aid of these bath salts in a soak before bedtime, I have found significant relief from arthritis pain.</li>
            <li> Unless u use it in a big amount in your bath then u can feels the salt or else it not as strong as the one I often use.</li>
            <li> Great reviews from my fiance. She loves the product. Best thing is that the soakk is very concentrated and you don&#x27;t need much to get a great effect for your bath.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bath soak for my wife.  She&#x27;s a marathon runner and frequently gets aches and pains from her training.  She likes to take baths to help ease pain, so this seemed like a natural fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent that this generates is mild and pleasant.  I can&#x27;t speak too much about how much it helps with actually relieving her pain, but she certainly enjoys it so I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a positive test.</li>
            <li> I got my husband to try this and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than local and just as good :)</li>
            <li> I have always loved Epsom salt baths. These salts take a bath to another level of relief. The smell is amazing and really relieves my aches and pains. I sleep like a baby after these.</li>
            <li> I bought it at the request of my 18 year old daughter after trying a sample size. She loves it and says it smells &amp;#34;Amazing!&amp;#34; ... and works wonders on her sore muscles after a workout.</li>
            <li> This Eucalyptus, Rosehips,and Chamomile mixture is amazing. By soaking in it, the body begins to feel a chilling sensation. The best part is that even in very very hot water the cooling sensation of these salts tricks the body into thinking that its sitting in cold water.</li>
            <li> I was looking to give this as a gift - so I bought it and put it in several small boxes for lady friends along with a tub for a foot soak.  They loved it and so did I</li>
            <li> These made great gifts - put in with a nice coffee mug and scrubby!  They are new, perfect to soak away those tired aches &amp; pains while enjoying a cup of fresh coffee!</li>
            <li> This smells so amazing very relaxing</li>
            <li> I have been buying this variety as well as the Restless Nights variety for mother&#x27;s day/birthday gifts for mom, she is a huge fan of bath salts but these are by far her favorite. The fragrance itself is very pleasant, strong eucalyptus scent that will pierce your olfactory nerve. The container is about the size of an Arizona Ice tea(give or take) and is decently packed. Depending on your usage habits it can last a while, I plan to continue buying it until mom finds an easier gift</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed many of the products in this line. They do what they say on the label! I have found it better than just a epsom salt soak for aches and pains or headaches. It really does help soothe muscles and a headache as well.</li>
            <li> I could not find relief for sore, tired feet.  This is it. Just a few minutes in a bath of the liquid or crystals and you feel the cool refreshment relieving the pain.  Happy feet!!!!!</li>
            <li> It works well for me.  I usually use it in a foot soak if I play several days of tennis in a row.  I see it on the shelves of Walmart and Target for under $6 though.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Opens my sinuses, unblocks stuffy head, and soothes my entire body&#x27;s aches and pains.  Wonderful stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It relieves the pain temporary. The price on Amazon is too much I just picked this up at target for 4.99 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression it would feel different during a bath vs a normal bath but i didnt notice any difference even after I put in twice as much . The salt is supposed to be good.for you because it gives you magnesium but other than that...idk. I guess if you had muscule pains you might feel it more</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift and used it myself and it helped to relax me and I can say it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF WORKS, GREAT SOAK!</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and pleased with item.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nearly every bath salt that Village Naturals makes and I personally love the Aches &amp; Pains the best. I usually put about 1/4 of a bottle and then add a cup of ebsom salt. Heaven!</li>
