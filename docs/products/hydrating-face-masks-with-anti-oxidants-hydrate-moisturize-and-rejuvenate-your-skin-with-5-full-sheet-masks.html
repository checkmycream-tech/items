            <li>Great for hydration and most of all, it is safe to use for my sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>The ingredients for these are for drier skin, which makes them an excellent choice for winter when the air gets dry inside our homes from the heater.  </li>
            <li>From there you want to make sure you press it into place make sure to secure it in the creases around your nose lips and eyes.</li>
            <li>My best freind came over the other day and we decided to have a pamper session.</li>

            <li>They are really easy to do.</li>
            <li>Cool and refreshing.</li>

            <li>are (it makes it smooth).</li>
            <li>and the solution is on a cloth like piece that fits smoothly over the face.</li>
            <li>They are individually packaged which I thought was great, we could each have one and still not interfere with the quality of the remaining masks.</li>

            <li>When I opened up the package I noticed that it was very generous amount of stuff that I knew I would be able to attach it to my face without any problems.</li>
            <li>It is a good deal for 5 individual masks.</li>
            <li>better a bit too much than not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I have dry skin so seeing that this mask helped hydrate my skin through the next day was very impressive for me.</li>

            <li>As far as the serum goes, it works ok.  </li>
            <li>Defentely worth purchase.</li>
            <li>My skin easily absorbed the moisture and it leaves no greasy feeling or residue.</li>
            <li>Once in place you feel that it is sticking to your face (in a good way)very carefully pull the plastic away from the cloth material.</li>
            <li>This is a very quick and easy way to give yourself a vitamin enriched, hydrating facial.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes it warmed up a bit and was quite pleasant feeling on my face.  </li>
            <li>Also perfect for adding moisture back into your skin from too much sun, or too much time spent in chlorinated pools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These masks are wonderful to use if you have dry skin, or have spent a bit too much time out in the sun.</li>
            <li>ERH Group Anti-Oxidant &amp; Hydration Facial Mask is an excellent mask for all those looking for a little pick me up!</li>
            <li>Used these for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>, my skin feels very supple, fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I felt a cooling sensation when it first went on...</li>
            <li>I love the fact they are each individual and could take it with me if I was going on a trip.</li>

            <li>After removing the mask, there was so much product left, that I was able to spread it on my neck/chest, and also my hands.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried this mask I took it straight from the package.  </li>
            <li>It comes packaged professionally, and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>Super soft for days!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use various types of masks as a regular part of my skin care routine and I credit this as the main factor for my good skin.</li>
            <li>These masks are very powerful, much more so than ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>The one thing that I didn&#x27;t do was to warm it a little bit.</li>
            <li>These fit better than the original masks the company makes, they have added small slits in the corners of the eyes to accommodate larger eye sizes.</li>
            <li>It feels so much smoother and nicer after using this.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother after using a mask.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package the face mask was really saturated.</li>
            <li>There is so much product on this mask that I would also have to use it on my stomach and leg</li>
            <li>I really  </li>
            <li>I appreciated it did not have an overpowering scent as those tend to bother my breathing.  </li>
            <li>A very relaxing experience as the warmth changes over to body temperature just sitting there</li>
            <li>it really needs.</li>
            <li>very well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very moisturization.</li>
            <li>so it stuck very well to my skin</li>
            <li>Reduces dryness of skin and hydrates face very well.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a very cooling affect the moment you apply it to your face.</li>
            <li>I really noticed a change in the way my skin felt and looked afterwards.</li>
            <li>I really like this new thing of doing something for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The cold weather isn&#x27;t doing my skin very good</li>
            <li>Feels refreshing on your skin, and leaves face feeling and looking firm.</li>
            <li>I could tell a big difference right away.</li>
            <li>When you use a new product it sometimes gets even deeper to get impurities out.</li>
            <li>My face feels very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>You have to unfold the mask, on one side it feels like plastic then the side you put on your face is very soft cloth</li>
            <li>I feel like I had a bigger improvement in my skin and more immediate results with this mask than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>Since it was the first time I had done anything like this, I went back onto the page</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Mask leaves my skin feeling great, but I just find it awkward to put on.</li>
            <li>In between I would just use masks to get similar results without having to spend too much money in spas that often.</li>
            <li>The eye holes are too close together, the far edges of the eye holes still go over my lids.  </li>
            <li>so I am thinking I prefer the old fashioned, slather them on masks.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After spending the afternoon outside gardening, my face and shoulders received a bit too much sun.</li>
            <li>When I opened it I was surprised to find that it had a plastic piece that I had to remove.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t irritate me in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say, however, that it made my skin soft.</li>
            <li>This facial mask is very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>(if my eyes were uncovered then it did not fit the sides of my nose; if I moved it to fit the sides of my nose then it covered my mouth, etc)</li>
            <li>If you are busy with work and family</li>
            <li>I have been trying out new things to help me look younger as I am not as young as I feel.</li>
            <li>I really liked that while I waited for the mask to get done working, it was not as messy as a typical wipe on mask.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was how wet it is.</li>
            <li>so I gently massaged the antioxidant solution into my skin until it was dry.  </li>
            <li>I did warm it up first, as several people indicated that it was very cold, when first applied.  </li>
            <li>After using them you feel like you had a professional facial.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I had expected!!</li>
            <li>The cold mask would be great during the hot summer but during this frigid March I preferred to warm it up a bit.  </li>
            <li>Having used many of the high end masks available in luxury and department stores, I was skeptical of these, but give them a try, THEY DO NOT DISAPPOINT!!!</li>
            <li>I did however have other breaking out, but that is do to the new product on my skin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great for hydration and most of all, it is safe to use for my sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>

            <li> Cool and refreshing.</li>

            <li> are (it makes it smooth).</li>
            <li> and the solution is on a cloth like piece that fits smoothly over the face.</li>

            <li> (it has that &#x27;cool&#x27; feeling).</li>
            <li> When I opened up the package I noticed that it was very generous amount of stuff that I knew I would be able to attach it to my face without any problems.</li>
            <li> It is a good deal for 5 individual masks.</li>
            <li> better a bit too much than not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Will come back for more review!</li>
            <li> My face is super soft and feels fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so seeing that this mask helped hydrate my skin through the next day was very impressive for me.</li>
            <li> This mask is made from premium Japanese silk that shapes very well to your face for a nice fit.</li>
            <li> As far as the serum goes, it works ok.  </li>
            <li> Defentely worth purchase.</li>
            <li> My skin easily absorbed the moisture and it leaves no greasy feeling or residue.</li>
            <li> Once in place you feel that it is sticking to your face (in a good way)very carefully pull the plastic away from the cloth material.</li>
            <li> This is a very quick and easy way to give yourself a vitamin enriched, hydrating facial.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes it warmed up a bit and was quite pleasant feeling on my face.  </li>
            <li> Also perfect for adding moisture back into your skin from too much sun, or too much time spent in chlorinated pools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These masks are wonderful to use if you have dry skin, or have spent a bit too much time out in the sun.</li>
            <li> ERH Group Anti-Oxidant &amp; Hydration Facial Mask is an excellent mask for all those looking for a little pick me up!</li>
            <li> Used these for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> , my skin feels very supple, fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I felt a cooling sensation when it first went on...</li>
            <li> I love the fact they are each individual and could take it with me if I was going on a trip.</li>
            <li> I get more out facial masks out of that.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done to many facial masks</li>
            <li> Real results that you will notice!</li>
            <li> Left my skin smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> I got the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so refreshing and invigorating that you just can&#x27;t wait til your next one!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to any one who wants a in home spa treatment and save money as well!</li>
            <li> After removing the mask, there was so much product left, that I was able to spread it on my neck/chest, and also my hands.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried this mask I took it straight from the package.  </li>
            <li> It comes packaged professionally, and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Super soft for days!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use various types of masks as a regular part of my skin care routine and I credit this as the main factor for my good skin.</li>
            <li> These masks are very powerful, much more so than ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that I didn&#x27;t do was to warm it a little bit.</li>
            <li> These fit better than the original masks the company makes, they have added small slits in the corners of the eyes to accommodate larger eye sizes.</li>
            <li> It feels so much smoother and nicer after using this.</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother after using a mask.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package the face mask was really saturated.</li>
            <li> There is so much product on this mask that I would also have to use it on my stomach and leg</li>
            <li> I really  </li>
            <li> I appreciated it did not have an overpowering scent as those tend to bother my breathing.  </li>
            <li> A very relaxing experience as the warmth changes over to body temperature just sitting there</li>
            <li> it really needs.</li>
            <li> very well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very moisturization.</li>
            <li> so it stuck very well to my skin</li>
            <li> Reduces dryness of skin and hydrates face very well.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a very cooling affect the moment you apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> I really noticed a change in the way my skin felt and looked afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really like this new thing of doing something for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The cold weather isn&#x27;t doing my skin very good</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing on your skin, and leaves face feeling and looking firm.</li>
            <li> I could tell a big difference right away.</li>
            <li> When you use a new product it sometimes gets even deeper to get impurities out.</li>
            <li> My face feels very soft and supple.</li>
            <li> You have to unfold the mask, on one side it feels like plastic then the side you put on your face is very soft cloth</li>
            <li> I feel like I had a bigger improvement in my skin and more immediate results with this mask than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> Since it was the first time I had done anything like this, I went back onto the page</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Mask leaves my skin feeling great, but I just find it awkward to put on.</li>
            <li> In between I would just use masks to get similar results without having to spend too much money in spas that often.</li>
            <li> The eye holes are too close together, the far edges of the eye holes still go over my lids.  </li>
            <li> so I am thinking I prefer the old fashioned, slather them on masks.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After spending the afternoon outside gardening, my face and shoulders received a bit too much sun.</li>
            <li> When I opened it I was surprised to find that it had a plastic piece that I had to remove.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t irritate me in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say, however, that it made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> This facial mask is very hydrating.  </li>
            <li> (if my eyes were uncovered then it did not fit the sides of my nose; if I moved it to fit the sides of my nose then it covered my mouth, etc)</li>
            <li> If you are busy with work and family</li>
            <li> I have been trying out new things to help me look younger as I am not as young as I feel.</li>
            <li> I really liked that while I waited for the mask to get done working, it was not as messy as a typical wipe on mask.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was how wet it is.</li>
            <li> so I gently massaged the antioxidant solution into my skin until it was dry.  </li>
            <li> I did warm it up first, as several people indicated that it was very cold, when first applied.  </li>
            <li> After using them you feel like you had a professional facial.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had expected!!</li>
            <li> The cold mask would be great during the hot summer but during this frigid March I preferred to warm it up a bit.  </li>
            <li> Having used many of the high end masks available in luxury and department stores, I was skeptical of these, but give them a try, THEY DO NOT DISAPPOINT!!!</li>
            <li> I did however have other breaking out, but that is do to the new product on my skin.</li>
            <li> You can relax while wearing it or vacuum your living room</li>
            <li> When I received this to try and review for my honest opinion I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> i suffer from really dry skin especially in the winter time.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t break out from using it but will likely not use this again because the eye holes are not large enough.</li>
            <li> My skin has been feeling pretty dry lately</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not like the process at all and will not be ordering again (although I believe the product is fine</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s normal for masks</li>
            <li> I put the sealed packet in warm water for a few minutes to take the chill out and it took away the initial shock of cold</li>
            <li> and I personally had a little red redness afterward  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the time was up I removed the skin and there was only a little bit left over to massage in.  </li>
            <li> I really love these masks, you may feel a little silly wearing them</li>
            <li> Nice little trick to remember if the cold bothers you.</li>
            <li> After I take off the mask, I allow my skin to dry before putting on my Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is to oily to dry.</li>
            <li> Then just rinse and dry my face.  </li>
            <li> and it will dry.</li>
            <li> These masks do leave your skin soft but they are definitely messy!</li>
            <li> The second time I used this mask I warmed it up a little.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the three colors of masks from this company, green, gold and now red.</li>
            <li> but it was really wet</li>
            <li> Now your skin is still wet.</li>
            <li> my other two friends had no reaction whatso ever&lt;</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this facemask at first.</li>
            <li> My face was still very wet</li>
            <li> My face was still very wet</li>
            <li> I used it at night and my skin felt much less dry and tight</li>
            <li> It covers most of my skin without covering my eyes or nose in a way that is annoying-</li>
            <li> I noticed some of the acne going down.</li>
            <li> and I waited till the kids went down for their afternoon nap</li>
            <li> but liquid was running down my arms as I put it on and then ran down the sides of my face.</li>
            <li> As an active blogger I received this item for little or no cost.</li>
            <li> slightly headache after using it when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> not sure due to this or some other</li>
            <li> Then I peeled away the plastic backing and smoothed it down firmly around my nose, eyes and lips.  </li>
            <li> guess I just was a little sensation to it</li>
            <li> It had a little pinkish color.</li>
            <li> Feels like you have just spent a 1000,00 bucks at the spa!!!</li>
            <li> After unfolding I placed it on my face and removed the backing,  I did have a few problems with the liquid running into my eyes but after the mask was positioned correctly it stoped.</li>
            <li> They come with the white plastic mask you see which is thin</li>
            <li> It has been about an hour since I removed the mask and my face has since dried and is not sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a deep poor cleansing mask, this is not the product for you.  </li>
            <li> The mask did not fit my face</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s messy -</li>
            <li> I usually lie down and watch some TV while I let the mask do its work.</li>
            <li> you know it is difficult to find time to care for yourself properly.  </li>
            <li> It wad a little tough to get it to stick to the sides of my nose</li>
            <li> When the time was up, I then took off the mask and looked at my face in the mirror and thought that my face didn&#x27;t look dull anymore.</li>
            <li> ( it wasn&#x27;t hard at all to put on) and I waited twenty minutes and then peeled the mask off</li>
            <li> With these being the cold, windy, drying winter months in PA - this is such a blessing to have received this discounted promotional item to review.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to doing this at least once a week from now on.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little too expensive to go all the time.</li>
            <li> The mask tingle after a few min but wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time leaving it on my face for the required amount of time because it kept slipping &amp; was very cold.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time using them because I usually have a bad reaction to them.</li>
            <li> It was initially VERY cold and very wet.  </li>
            <li> When you 1st put it on it feels awkward and cold but it warms up.</li>
            <li> I put it on and it was cold.</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t be so cold when applied.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I had expected!! Speedy delivery and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I like to go to spas and massages but it&#x27;s a little too expensive to go all the time. In between I would just use masks to get similar results without having to spend too much money in spas that often. This mask is great. The cold weather isn&#x27;t doing my skin very good but this mask is great in hydrating it. It feels so much smoother and nicer after using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the masks once.  The eye holes are too close together, the far edges of the eye holes still go over my lids.  The eye holes need to be cut larger.  As far as the serum goes, it works ok.  I didn&#x27;t break out from using it but will likely not use this again because the eye holes are not large enough.</li>
            <li> love sheet masks  this one defiantly does not disappoint! There is a lot of product on the mask. My skin very hydrated and looking great in the morning. So simple to use! Love it and how my skin feels!</li>
            <li> Love how my face feels after using these!</li>
            <li> i suffer from really dry skin especially in the winter time.  This anti-oxidant and hydration facial mask made my face feel so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> These masks are very powerful, much more so than ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  There is plenty of gel left in the mask after use to wipe over the rest of the neck, chest, area.  My skin is much smoother after using a mask.</li>
            <li> Used these for the first time tonight. When I opened the package the face mask was really saturated. After unfolding I placed it on my face and removed the backing,  I did have a few problems with the liquid running into my eyes but after the mask was positioned correctly it stoped. It wad a little tough to get it to stick to the sides of my nose but i think it will be easier nexttime. The mask tingle after a few min but wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable. My face feels very soft and supple. My forehead looks more relaxed. Defentely worth purchase.</li>
            <li> These masks are AMAZING! Great for hydration and most of all, it is safe to use for my sensitive and acne prone skin. I put this on at night and I like to put it on for more than 30 minutes. Why? I just love how it feels on my skin (it has that &#x27;cool&#x27; feeling). After I take off the mask, I allow my skin to dry before putting on my Vitamin C serum. There is so much product on this mask that I would also have to use it on my stomach and leg are (it makes it smooth). My face feels very smooth and it gives my face that beautiful glow when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have tried the three colors of masks from this company, green, gold and now red. I absolutely love how easy these go on and how soft my face is afterward. They come with the white plastic mask you see which is thin and the solution is on a cloth like piece that fits smoothly over the face. These masks are just like the spa uses and at a fraction of the cost. I keep them on hand and use them once a week. Absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Invigorating!! Skin feels amazing after using mask!</li>
            <li> I needed extra hydration and a spa day! I got both!</li>
            <li> Mask leaves my skin feeling great, but I just find it awkward to put on. It slides and I get gaps so I am thinking I prefer the old fashioned, slather them on masks.</li>
            <li> Love it! Got to try it now! Will come back for more review!</li>
            <li> very comfortable ! The skin become more bright after use.</li>
            <li> Spa day with the girls.&lt;br /&gt;I tried these out with my girl friends and I personally had a little red redness afterward  my other two friends had no reaction whatso ever&lt;br /&gt;I guess I just was a little sensation to it</li>
            <li> My skin has been feeling pretty dry lately and I tried this mask 1 night, after leaving the mask on my face for 15 mins, my skin feels very supple, fresh and hydrated. And there are plenty of essence inside the bag, enough foe me to put it on my neck and hand. I really  like  this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful experience of using a stay at home mask the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions of warming then removing the foil and applying without any problems.  I appreciated it did not have an overpowering scent as those tend to bother my breathing.  I could feel my skin just drinking into the essence of the hydration oils.  A very relaxing experience as the warmth changes over to body temperature just sitting there relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the time was up I removed the skin and there was only a little bit left over to massage in.  I have sensitive skin and I did not have any adverse reaction to this at all.  With these being the cold, windy, drying winter months in PA - this is such a blessing to have received this discounted promotional item to review.  I will be coming back for more !!</li>
            <li> These feel amazing. My mom loved them as well.</li>
            <li> This is a very quick and easy way to give yourself a vitamin enriched, hydrating facial. You just apply the mask to your face and it will stick to your face. It has a cooling sort of feel to it. Then wait for 15-20 minutes before removing the mask. Your face will feel much more moisturized than before. I love the way this feels on my skin. I also love knowing that it is giving my skin nutrients it really needs. I usually lie down and watch some TV while I let the mask do its work. My skin easily absorbed the moisture and it leaves no greasy feeling or residue. This box comes with five facial masks. I bought this product with a discount and I am so happy with it. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My best freind came over the other day and we decided to have a pamper session. I got out these masks for us and they were perfect! This mask was such a treat. They are individually packaged which I thought was great, we could each have one and still not interfere with the quality of the remaining masks. Plus I thought that would be be perfect for travel, you could just toss one in your overnight bag!&lt;br /&gt; The masks were easy to apply and felt great on the skin. Cool and refreshing. The liner was easy to remove. We left them on for the instructed 15 minutes, removed and rubbed in excess essence. My skin felt soft and wonderfully hydrated after. What a great spa like treatment at home! *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> I was so glad to be able to get this Anti-oxidant &amp; Hydration Facial Mask from a promotional offer for my unbiased and honest review. I have been trying out new things to help me look younger as I am not as young as I feel. I was told that doing facial masks would make me feel wonderful. I can truly say that they are really nice to do, but don&#x27;t do it in front of your grand babies that don&#x27;t recognize you... My grand son kept looking at me and tried to remove it before the 20 minutes were up. When I opened up the package I noticed that it was very generous amount of stuff that I knew I would be able to attach it to my face without any problems. I felt a cooling sensation when it first went on... It felt really nice. Ah... now to pamper myself for 20 minutes. Just to take care of myself. When the time was up, I then took off the mask and looked at my face in the mirror and thought that my face didn&#x27;t look dull anymore. It had a little pinkish color. My face was smooth and felt nice. I am looking forward to doing this at least once a week from now on. Thank you for helping me take care of me. I really like this new thing of doing something for me. You have help me more than you know.</li>
            <li> Great product! Makes my skin look and feel great!</li>
            <li> This mask is wonderful.  They are not stingy with the serum/product.  I used as directed.  I did warm it up first, as several people indicated that it was very cold, when first applied.  After removing the mask, there was so much product left, that I was able to spread it on my neck/chest, and also my hands.  It comes packaged professionally, and shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> These hydrating masks do their job!! Super easy to apply and stays in place for the required time.</li>
            <li> This is a box of 5 individual face sheet masks. I have found as I have gotten older my skin changes more often than it used too. Sometimes it is to oily to dry. I also have been battling breaking out again like I did in my teens. I used this mask for the maximum time of 20 minutes. I feel after I have used these my skin my had more hydration. I noticed some of the acne going down. I did however have other breaking out, but that is do to the new product on my skin. When you use a new product it sometimes gets even deeper to get impurities out. I love the fact they are each individual and could take it with me if I was going on a trip. It is nice to see it is animal free. The reason for 4 stars is I just wish there was more for the price. It is a good deal for 5 individual masks. It seems with a tube of mask I get more out facial masks out of that. As an active blogger I received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done to many facial masks but I wanted to try this one. This Anti-oxidant &amp; Hydration mask from ERH Group was offered to me for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it. I got it and I waited till the kids went down for their afternoon nap so they wouldn&#x27;t bother...lol. I opened the package that the mask was in and pulled it out. The first thing I noticed was how wet it is. Not sure if that&#x27;s normal for masks but it was almost dripping. I put it on my face and made sure everything was on spot. It sat on my face for almost 20 minutes. I removed the mask and had to towel it off. Not all of it but it was really wet still so I dabbed some off and let the remaining moisture just soak in. It has been about an hour since I removed the mask and my face has since dried and is not sticky or oily. My face is super soft and feels fantastic! I definitely recommend this Anti-oxidant &amp; Hydration mask from ERH Group.</li>
            <li> was a cooling refreshing mask to use skin felt great after use. I am a country person and do not use alot of facial products but was given the chance to try this. will use again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product once (saving to use after day at the pool or beach to re-hydrate). Good product (forgot to remove the plastic covering, so probably would worked better had I done that...LOL).</li>
            <li> These masks are wonderful to use if you have dry skin, or have spent a bit too much time out in the sun. These fit better than the original masks the company makes, they have added small slits in the corners of the eyes to accommodate larger eye sizes. I love the moisturizing ingredients in these masks, hyaluronic acid is a favorite of mine and works wonderfully in these masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After spending the afternoon outside gardening, my face and shoulders received a bit too much sun. After washing my face I put the mask on and left in on for 15 minutes letting the serum soak into my skin. The cool mask felt wonderful on the parts of my face that had received too much sun. After removing I rubbed the rest of the serum into my face and neck so it could finish soaking into my skin. I also rubbed the mask into my arms and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Like the original masks, these masks make your skin feel soft and very smooth. The ingredients for these are for drier skin, which makes them an excellent choice for winter when the air gets dry inside our homes from the heater.  Also perfect for adding moisture back into your skin from too much sun, or too much time spent in chlorinated pools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Just once a week for 15 minutes and your skin will look and feel so much better. I really love these masks, you may feel a little silly wearing them but they do work very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sample received for review purposes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good! I like it. slightly headache after using it when I wake up in the morning. not sure due to this or some other</li>
            <li> I know the quality of treatment mask of Taiwan is very great. It&#x27;s amazing experience to use this mask. My face becomes so hydrating even if the next day. Very moisturization.</li>
            <li> This mask was very simple to use. I used it at night and my skin felt much less dry and tight and I didn&#x27;t need to apply any nightly lotion. It made my skin feel refreshed and looking great.</li>
            <li> My face feels so refreshed after using the mask. I love uy. So easy to use. I highly recommend if you want a great at home facial mask.</li>
            <li> Love this mask, my face felt refreshed and rejuvenated after trying it.</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing on your skin, and leaves face feeling and looking firm.</li>
            <li> ERH Group Anti-Oxidant &amp; Hydration Facial Mask is an excellent mask for all those looking for a little pick me up! They&#x27;re individually packaged, easy to apply and are soaked with great ingredients to hydrate and sooth your freshly exfoliated skin. Simply open the package, apply to your face - don&#x27;t worry there are eye, nose and mouth openings - and relax for 15- 20 minutes. Once you&#x27;re all set, simply peel off, toss in the trash and rub some of the excess &amp;#34;essences&amp;#34; into your face. I did find that there is a LOT of excess and rubbing it all in, just wasn&#x27;t going to happen....better a bit too much than not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product for the purpose of a review. All opinions are my own and not influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> i liked your product and the results</li>
            <li> I feel like I had a bigger improvement in my skin and more immediate results with this mask than any other I have tried. This mask is made from premium Japanese silk that shapes very well to your face for a nice fit. It covers most of my skin without covering my eyes or nose in a way that is annoying- My biggest problem with sheet masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this during my bath and soaked the packet in my warm bath water before opening it so it wasn&#x27;t so cold when applying it. Nice little trick to remember if the cold bothers you. When I opened it I was surprised to find that it had a plastic piece that I had to remove. I put the fabric side to my face, pressed it up against my forehead and then started pulling the plastic off. The sheet is full of serum so it stuck very well to my skin and I was able to relax without it sliding off. I left it on for about 30 minutes and then pulled it off. My face was still very wet so I just massaged the extra serum into my face. I have dry skin so seeing that this mask helped hydrate my skin through the next day was very impressive for me. I also have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t irritate me in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a quick pampering that works great then you should definitely give this a shot. I can&#x27;t think of one thing that I don&#x27;t like about this masks. *Product provided at a promotional price in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Real results that you will notice!</li>
            <li> These masks are really great! When you 1st put it on it feels awkward and cold but it warms up. I really liked that while I waited for the mask to get done working, it was not as messy as a typical wipe on mask. The best part is how my skin felt after I took that mask off. Super soft for days!&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I noticed a discount code for this product and ordered it quickly. I am happy to give a review for this product as it is very good and I would recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> What a great set of Facial Treatment Masks.  They come in a nice box of 5 masks.  They are great to hydrate and moisturize my skin..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face then apply mask.  It has a great cooling sensation.  I keep it on for about 20 minutes.  Why go to a spa when you can do this at home.  Then just rinse and dry my face.  Any extra I have I use on my elbows and knees.  My skin feels great.</li>
            <li> These masks do leave your skin soft but they are definitely messy! I had a hard time leaving it on my face for the required amount of time because it kept slipping &amp; was very cold. I have to say, however, that it made my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Great hydrating mask, My skin feels great.</li>
            <li> These are totally awesome and I wish I had discovered them sooner..After using them you feel like you had a professional facial.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply. Reduces dryness of skin and hydrates face very well. Will recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was an experience!  I was looking for a different type of treatment for my skin, that is how I came across this.  Since it was the first time I had done anything like this, I went back onto the page and I saw that someone had posted a video walking you through the steps of putting it on - and she did a fabulous job!  I followed what she said (and the directions it comes with are exactly what she did), I put it on and enjoyed the process!  I am so glad I got these.  My skin felt wonderful when I took it off and I can&#x27;t wait until I do it again!</li>
            <li> These facial masks work great!  Very easy to use. Left my skin smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> This facial mask is very hydrating.  If you are looking for a deep poor cleansing mask, this is not the product for you.  I would only recommend the product if you are looking to hydrate your face. I like that it has a very cooling affect the moment you apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> I use various types of masks as a regular part of my skin care routine and I credit this as the main factor for my good skin. Using these ERH masks was the first time I used this type of paper mask and I was excited to add it to my system after reading so many great reviews. Unfortunately I did not like the process at all and will not be ordering again (although I believe the product is fine and therefore it received 3 stars from me). The mask did not fit my face (if my eyes were uncovered then it did not fit the sides of my nose; if I moved it to fit the sides of my nose then it covered my mouth, etc) and it&#x27;s messy - I thought I&#x27;d be relaxing on my bed with this but liquid was running down my arms as I put it on and then ran down the sides of my face. I saw no visible difference to my skin the day after use.</li>
            <li> Having used many of the high end masks available in luxury and department stores, I was skeptical of these, but give them a try, THEY DO NOT DISAPPOINT!!! Wish my current regimen, my skin is the plumpest and softest it&#x27;s been in my 31 years!!!! I will continue buy these, and have them in my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Anti-oxidant facial masks are a great way to pamper yourself at home.  If you are busy with work and family like I am you know it is difficult to find time to care for yourself properly.  I am always excited to find out about at home ways to get the &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; experience.  I purchased these masks for trial during a promotion to share my experience with amazon shoppers.  The first time I tried this mask I took it straight from the package.  Unfolded it and pressed it to my face on the fabric side.  Then I peeled away the plastic backing and smoothed it down firmly around my nose, eyes and lips.  It was initially VERY cold and very wet.  After a few minutes it warmed up a bit and was quite pleasant feeling on my face.  I sat on the couch and relaxed with my husband and got a good chuckle out of him every time he looked at me. After my 20 minutes was up I removed and discarded the mask.  My face was still very wet so I gently massaged the antioxidant solution into my skin until it was dry.  My skin felt very clean and refreshed afterwards.  The second time I used this mask I warmed it up a little.  I put the sealed packet in warm water for a few minutes to take the chill out and it took away the initial shock of cold I got the first time I used it.  The cold mask would be great during the hot summer but during this frigid March I preferred to warm it up a bit.  The best part about this mask is that it stays in place really well.  You can relax while wearing it or vacuum your living room and this mask won&#x27;t move.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have to admit,I am not one who has done many of these types of mask.When I received this to try and review for my honest opinion I was a little skeptical. i am so glad that I did. WOW! I can&#x27;t believe the difference that I felt on my face after the hydration mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great to use after a shower.The one thing that I didn&#x27;t do was to warm it a little bit. I put it on and it was cold.I see that you can put in a bowl of warm water so it won&#x27;t be so cold when applied.I guess I should read instructions instead of just trying it out on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it to my face ( it wasn&#x27;t hard at all to put on) and I waited twenty minutes and then peeled the mask off and then I just took a cloth and dabbed off any remaining gel on my face.I could tell a big difference right away. You can also apply some moisturizer or cream on your face to lock in the nourishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly recommend this Hydration Facial Mask for anyone that wants to be pampered and have a great looking skin.</li>
            <li> OMG...This just arrived earlier today and I just used my first one!! It comes packaged in a foil sealed pouch. Once you open it and start to remove it you will find that it is soaked in the anti-oxidant solution. You have to unfold the mask, on one side it feels like plastic then the side you put on your face is very soft cloth like. Once you have it unfolded, it has cut outs for your eyes, nose and mouth, just place it on your face,(warning) it is a cold feeling, but will warm to your body&#x27;s temperature. Once in place you feel that it is sticking to your face (in a good way)very carefully pull the plastic away from the cloth material. From there you want to make sure you press it into place make sure to secure it in the creases around your nose lips and eyes. Once you leave it on for 20/25 minutes, you remove it as easy as it was to apply. Now your skin is still wet. at this point just massage the wetness in and all around your face and it will dry. once you have done this your skin will feel amazing! Feels like you have just spent a 1000,00 bucks at the spa!!! Your skin will feel like it has been thru a hydrating spa treatment. It&#x27;s so refreshing and invigorating that you just can&#x27;t wait til your next one! I recommend this product to any one who wants a in home spa treatment and save money as well! I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing mask.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this facemask at first. I have a hard time using them because I usually have a bad reaction to them. I am always trying different products. These are great. I really noticed a change in the way my skin felt and looked afterwards. They are really easy to do. Best part is that there is no big mess afterwards like most.</li>
