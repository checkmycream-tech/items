            <li>This is a great beginner kit</li>

            <li>Nice tweezer set for brow grooming!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for awesome tweezers you should buy them separately and pay a bit more</li>
            <li>/&gt;the tweezers do a very good job and the scissors have a perfect bend that is useful</li>
            <li>case is good..</li>
            <li>Good value for a fair price.</li>
            <li>The scissors also work good as well.</li>
            <li>I went to every beauty store looking for a good pair of tweezers but at the price of $3-$5 for one I couldn&#x27;t justify the purchase.</li>
            <li>Good set for the price.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Generally, good.</li>
            <li>Because of the good reviews I decided to try it</li>
            <li>items if I happen to lose my good tweezers.</li>
            <li>Good deal</li>
            <li>Good quality, the items and the case.  </li>
            <li>I loved the tweezers that came in this set.</li>
            <li>Overal, good product.</li>
            <li>Good Quality!&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li>Great kit for more than eyebrow maintenance.</li>
            <li>-It is very important that you invest in good tweezers.</li>
            <li>really nice stuff here.  </li>
            <li>Nice grip on the tweezer work just as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>The case they are all in is really nice too.</li>
            <li>Deluxe indeed.</li>
            <li>She was always borrowing my tweezers, so now she has her own kit.</li>
            <li>The case is also nice and practical.</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice case.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does well representing the products they carry.</li>
            <li>Nice set.</li>
            <li>The main tweezer is great!</li>
            <li>Excellent and very complete kit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good price as well!</li>
            <li>i love this kit, it is amazing</li>
            <li>Wow this set is awesome.......</li>
            <li>Great Kit, scissors feel a bit cheap, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, and it works great.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all quality tools and very precise.</li>
            <li>Love the tweezers on this set and you get three for the price you would pay for just one.</li>
            <li>I glad I bought these.</li>
            <li>I love these tools.</li>
            <li>They are better than I expec.</li>
            <li>Need I say any more?  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Body Toolz Eyebrow kit.</li>
            <li>The scissors and comb are okay and still work, though.</li>
            <li>-The eyebrow brush is okay, I have seen better</li>
            <li>The ones that come with this kit are okay</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t believe why some one would put more that a star.</li>
            <li>and I use them them the most.  </li>
            <li>The brow comb is okay</li>
            <li>but Sephora sells a better one for .99.</li>
            <li>It has everything you need and more.</li>
            <li>Love this set.</li>
            <li>Well, it is not awful, and I use it every now and then, but not on my face.</li>
            <li>Mostly on my husbands ears and for arts and crafts.</li>
            <li>Love this item , everything I need in a kit.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!!!:)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, and will update as I put them to good use with me and my daughters facials...</li>
            <li>Been using this set for nearly two years, and everything is still in great shape.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman makes lots of different kinds of tweezers, invest in a good one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the other utensils, but the tweezers were excellent.</li>
            <li>It bent too easy in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and i love that there is different styles of tweezers and the scissors are great</li>
            <li>pretty nice kit.</li>
            <li>They work fine for someone who plucks every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>This is a fine kit to perform said chore.  </li>
            <li>The quality is just fine.</li>
            <li>wonderful little kit, everything I need.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap set</li>
            <li>All you need for your eyebrows and mustache to succeed in one cheap kit.  </li>
            <li>Cheap case and cheap tools.  </li>
            <li>but they make them so cheap</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look great thanks to this cheap and very efficient grooming kit.</li>
            <li>and I believe they are very worth it.</li>
            <li>Very useful, daily use, good quality.</li>
            <li>but you really need to invest in a better pair.    </li>
            <li>Or maybe I know too much about eyebrow work to expect better.</li>
            <li>I would buy the scissors, comb, and tweezers separately - I love my eyebrows too much.</li>
            <li>Simple, good quality and assortment of tweezers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad for pricing</li>
            <li>This is the perfect little kit for a guy who wants to stay well groomed.</li>
            <li>I was able to use them for more purposes than simply grooming my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>only 1 of the tweezers are decent, and the eye brow comb is nice to perfect the brow lenth scissors are sharp.</li>
            <li>I use the fine point one to get tics off of my dog and it works really well</li>
            <li>This little kit works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great little kit; does what it is made for.</li>
            <li>Great little kit.</li>
            <li>l have huge eyebrows this kit really helps keep them neat</li>
            <li>For $11 it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is useful.</li>
            <li>Very professional, high quality tools in a nice faux leather zippered case.</li>
            <li>Bought this hoping for the best, but the truth is the other 4 &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; are only there to justify an overpriced eyebrow tweezer.</li>
            <li>I mostly use the flat tweezers, and the scissors and brush are also very useful.</li>
            <li>Everything is great but the small tweezers don&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>Buying the items individually would definitely cost more, and they come in a nice kit that fits in your purse.  </li>
            <li>Thumbs down to Body Toolz as these kits are a good idea</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay a little more for better tools.</li>
            <li>I wish the twezers grabbed a little bit better but for the most part it works well.</li>
            <li>The tweezers have a soft rubber tip on them to protect the fine points.  </li>
            <li>Some of the tweezers needed a little move to make the ends meet, but once that was done, all is good.</li>
            <li>The case is pretty and look sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I love that I get three different sizes of tweezers along with the trimming scissors and comb.</li>
            <li>The scissors are the only redeeming thing about this set...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Looks, feels, operates exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see why the 4.5 stars rating and sadly, I do not fall into that category.</li>
            <li>They help my pluck exactly like I want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was please enough to purchase 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It has everything you need to do you own eyebrows or do other people eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The zipper is starting to run less smoothly, but the tools themselves are really good.</li>
            <li>Three good tweezers and small scissors for miscellaneous hair trimming/extraction and splinter removal.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the comb or scissors yet, so I&#x27;m not sure how good they are.</li>
            <li>Really nice little set for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Sephora makes a nice one but it is more expensive.</li>
            <li>I really just wanted an eye brow brush &amp; scissors, but I figured he could use the tweezers if he got a splinter or something.</li>
            <li>I guess it wasn&#x27;t glued together very well.</li>
            <li>-The scissors of this kit are better than expected</li>
            <li>but this one is very usable.</li>
            <li>not  terrible, not really water proof but holds everything snugly and neatly.</li>
            <li>Although the brush really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Which,, means I didn&#x27;t need to buy this whole kit.</li>
            <li>This is better than expected.</li>
            <li>Travel pack is very convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li>Look all you want when you get tired of messing around come back and get this best price and quality phone.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the quality of the product and somewhat surprised because of the low cost I was not expecting the quality I received.</li>
            <li>I sit my bushy browed fella down every now and again to torture him with super light &amp;#34;manscaping.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>The scissors are nothing to get to excited about, but they do take care of the occasional hang nail.  </li>
            <li>The sharp ends may be ok for &amp;#34;splinter removal&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care though since I will probably never use that particular tool.</li>
            <li>The outside of the case feels a little cheap, like a dollar store item, but the inside is much better with snug elastic straps.  </li>
            <li>They probably aren&#x27;t good enough quality for someone with fuller brows who plucks daily or several times a week.</li>
            <li>Good little kit for the money, I like all the different tweezers!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but instead it had HIGH quality tools at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>The tools are all high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both the kit and seller.</li>
            <li>The scissors are great to have for snipping off my split ends when I&#x27;m bored.</li>
            <li>the tweezers are great and the scissors are sharp may seem small</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t travel much at all, but if/when I do that case will fit all those little tools, including the Seki in one bundle.</li>
            <li>SO precise and sharp to pull out hairs</li>
            <li>If I hear any complaints I will write a new review.</li>
            <li>I needed a new tweezer kit for my work as an esthetician and these did the trick.</li>
            <li>The tweezers work great but be careful of the two smaller size one they are very sharp.</li>
            <li>They actually work and pull the eyebrow hair out the first time.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this because of the case or any of the tweezers, they&#x27;re cheap and not worth it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a extra-portable and complete eyebrow kit, I&#x27;d recommend this BodyToolz product!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, not bad quality, the scissors and tweezers have lasted longer than some of my other kits.</li>
            <li>I pluck my eyebrows regularly since they grow back so quickly.</li>
            <li>grip isn&#x27;t phenomenal which means those little stubs you were trying to pull out might bounce back into your skin.</li>
            <li>She uses frequently to shape her eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse eye brows and fill them in daily, but I used the tweezers to get some stray hairs.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality and sharpness.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but the two tweezers were like needle sharp!</li>
            <li>Three different tweezers, scissors and eyebrow brush included in small blue case which is handy.</li>
            <li>Nice little set with 2 very sharp tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Now I need a decent magnifying glass for when I get one of those tiny metal splinters.</li>
            <li>you would get such high quality products bit you do.</li>
            <li>It is pretty sharp and kids should stay away from it.</li>
            <li>The scissors are a little strange and cheaply made...</li>
            <li>The head of the brush actually fell off the stick after a few use and the scissors are actually pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I have spent THREE times as much on the tweezers alone, and so I suspected that this kit would be sub-par -</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok but not great</li>
            <li>these little tools are just what i need, as i&#x27;m always getting something in my fingers and there is always the right tool.</li>
            <li>The scissors are a little hard to open, so be careful when using them, but everything works great for my needs.</li>
            <li>Stainless steel tweezers with sharp edges for ease of use.</li>
            <li>I threw in an extra nail clipper in this thing and it seems to be a full grooming kit in an extremely small package.</li>
            <li>Got all of these little tools along with a Seki nail clipper in a small glass on my vanity top.</li>
            <li>For a guy who was told by many people to pluck his eyebrows, I was very hesitant on buying tweezers because I&#x27;ve heard that some tweezers, the cheaper ones, have rounded ends and make it very difficult to use.</li>
            <li>Design is poor, quality is ok, the little scissors would have better use for clipping some serious toe nails.</li>

            <li> The tools in this kit were of great quality.</li>
            <li> This is a great beginner kit</li>

            <li> and it works great.</li>

            <li> For ~$12 it is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> You can tell that the case though, kinda rinky-dink, but the tools are great.  </li>

            <li> Nice tweezer set for brow grooming!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for awesome tweezers you should buy them separately and pay a bit more</li>
            <li> /&gt;the tweezers do a very good job and the scissors have a perfect bend that is useful</li>
            <li> case is good..</li>
            <li> Good value for a fair price.</li>
            <li> The scissors also work good as well.</li>
            <li> I went to every beauty store looking for a good pair of tweezers but at the price of $3-$5 for one I couldn&#x27;t justify the purchase.</li>
            <li> Good set for the price.  </li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> Generally, good.</li>
            <li> Because of the good reviews I decided to try it</li>
            <li> items if I happen to lose my good tweezers.</li>
            <li> Good deal</li>
            <li> Good quality, the items and the case.  </li>
            <li> I loved the tweezers that came in this set.</li>
            <li> Overal, good product.</li>
            <li> Good Quality!&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li> Great kit for more than eyebrow maintenance.</li>
            <li> -It is very important that you invest in good tweezers.</li>
            <li> really nice stuff here.  </li>
            <li> Nice grip on the tweezer work just as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> The case they are all in is really nice too.</li>
            <li> Deluxe indeed.</li>
            <li> She was always borrowing my tweezers, so now she has her own kit.</li>
            <li> The case is also nice and practical.</li>
            <li> Comes in a nice case.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does well representing the products they carry.</li>
            <li> Nice set.</li>
            <li> The main tweezer is great!</li>
            <li> Excellent and very complete kit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good price as well!</li>
            <li> i love this kit, it is amazing</li>
            <li> Wow this set is awesome.......</li>
            <li> Great Kit, scissors feel a bit cheap, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, and it works great.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all quality tools and very precise.</li>
            <li> Love the tweezers on this set and you get three for the price you would pay for just one.</li>
            <li> I glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> I love these tools.</li>
            <li> They are better than I expec.</li>
            <li> Need I say any more?  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Body Toolz Eyebrow kit.</li>
            <li> The scissors and comb are okay and still work, though.</li>
            <li> -The eyebrow brush is okay, I have seen better</li>
            <li> The ones that come with this kit are okay</li>
            <li> I love this kit.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t believe why some one would put more that a star.</li>
            <li> and I use them them the most.  </li>
            <li> The brow comb is okay</li>
            <li> but Sephora sells a better one for .99.</li>
            <li> It has everything you need and more.</li>
            <li> Love this set.</li>
            <li> Well, it is not awful, and I use it every now and then, but not on my face.</li>
            <li> Mostly on my husbands ears and for arts and crafts.</li>
            <li> Love this item , everything I need in a kit.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!!:)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, and will update as I put them to good use with me and my daughters facials...</li>
            <li> Been using this set for nearly two years, and everything is still in great shape.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes lots of different kinds of tweezers, invest in a good one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the other utensils, but the tweezers were excellent.</li>
            <li> It bent too easy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and i love that there is different styles of tweezers and the scissors are great</li>
            <li> pretty nice kit.</li>
            <li> They work fine for someone who plucks every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a fine kit to perform said chore.  </li>
            <li> The quality is just fine.</li>
            <li> wonderful little kit, everything I need.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap set</li>
            <li> All you need for your eyebrows and mustache to succeed in one cheap kit.  </li>
            <li> Cheap case and cheap tools.  </li>
            <li> but they make them so cheap</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look great thanks to this cheap and very efficient grooming kit.</li>
            <li> and I believe they are very worth it.</li>
            <li> Very useful, daily use, good quality.</li>
            <li> but you really need to invest in a better pair.    </li>
            <li> Or maybe I know too much about eyebrow work to expect better.</li>
            <li> I would buy the scissors, comb, and tweezers separately - I love my eyebrows too much.</li>
            <li> Simple, good quality and assortment of tweezers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Not bad for pricing</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little kit for a guy who wants to stay well groomed.</li>
            <li> I was able to use them for more purposes than simply grooming my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> only 1 of the tweezers are decent, and the eye brow comb is nice to perfect the brow lenth scissors are sharp.</li>
            <li> I use the fine point one to get tics off of my dog and it works really well</li>
            <li> This little kit works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great little kit; does what it is made for.</li>
            <li> Great little kit.</li>
            <li> l have huge eyebrows this kit really helps keep them neat</li>
            <li> For $11 it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is useful.</li>
            <li> Very professional, high quality tools in a nice faux leather zippered case.</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping for the best, but the truth is the other 4 &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; are only there to justify an overpriced eyebrow tweezer.</li>
            <li> I mostly use the flat tweezers, and the scissors and brush are also very useful.</li>
            <li> Everything is great but the small tweezers don&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> Buying the items individually would definitely cost more, and they come in a nice kit that fits in your purse.  </li>
            <li> Thumbs down to Body Toolz as these kits are a good idea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay a little more for better tools.</li>
            <li> I wish the twezers grabbed a little bit better but for the most part it works well.</li>
            <li> The tweezers have a soft rubber tip on them to protect the fine points.  </li>
            <li> Some of the tweezers needed a little move to make the ends meet, but once that was done, all is good.</li>
            <li> The case is pretty and look sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love that I get three different sizes of tweezers along with the trimming scissors and comb.</li>
            <li> The scissors are the only redeeming thing about this set...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Looks, feels, operates exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see why the 4.5 stars rating and sadly, I do not fall into that category.</li>
            <li> They help my pluck exactly like I want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was please enough to purchase 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It has everything you need to do you own eyebrows or do other people eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The zipper is starting to run less smoothly, but the tools themselves are really good.</li>
            <li> Three good tweezers and small scissors for miscellaneous hair trimming/extraction and splinter removal.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the comb or scissors yet, so I&#x27;m not sure how good they are.</li>
            <li> Really nice little set for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Sephora makes a nice one but it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> I really just wanted an eye brow brush &amp; scissors, but I figured he could use the tweezers if he got a splinter or something.</li>
            <li> I guess it wasn&#x27;t glued together very well.</li>
            <li> -The scissors of this kit are better than expected</li>
            <li> but this one is very usable.</li>
            <li> not  terrible, not really water proof but holds everything snugly and neatly.</li>
            <li> Although the brush really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Which,, means I didn&#x27;t need to buy this whole kit.</li>
            <li> This is better than expected.</li>
            <li> Travel pack is very convenient when traveling.</li>
            <li> Look all you want when you get tired of messing around come back and get this best price and quality phone.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quality of the product and somewhat surprised because of the low cost I was not expecting the quality I received.</li>
            <li> I sit my bushy browed fella down every now and again to torture him with super light &amp;#34;manscaping.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The scissors are nothing to get to excited about, but they do take care of the occasional hang nail.  </li>
            <li> The sharp ends may be ok for &amp;#34;splinter removal&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care though since I will probably never use that particular tool.</li>
            <li> The outside of the case feels a little cheap, like a dollar store item, but the inside is much better with snug elastic straps.  </li>
            <li> They probably aren&#x27;t good enough quality for someone with fuller brows who plucks daily or several times a week.</li>
            <li> Good little kit for the money, I like all the different tweezers!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but instead it had HIGH quality tools at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> The tools are all high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both the kit and seller.</li>
            <li> The scissors are great to have for snipping off my split ends when I&#x27;m bored.</li>
            <li> the tweezers are great and the scissors are sharp may seem small</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t travel much at all, but if/when I do that case will fit all those little tools, including the Seki in one bundle.</li>
            <li> SO precise and sharp to pull out hairs</li>
            <li> If I hear any complaints I will write a new review.</li>
            <li> I needed a new tweezer kit for my work as an esthetician and these did the trick.</li>
            <li> The tweezers work great but be careful of the two smaller size one they are very sharp.</li>
            <li> They actually work and pull the eyebrow hair out the first time.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this because of the case or any of the tweezers, they&#x27;re cheap and not worth it.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a extra-portable and complete eyebrow kit, I&#x27;d recommend this BodyToolz product!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, not bad quality, the scissors and tweezers have lasted longer than some of my other kits.</li>
            <li> I pluck my eyebrows regularly since they grow back so quickly.</li>
            <li> grip isn&#x27;t phenomenal which means those little stubs you were trying to pull out might bounce back into your skin.</li>
            <li> She uses frequently to shape her eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse eye brows and fill them in daily, but I used the tweezers to get some stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality and sharpness.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but the two tweezers were like needle sharp!</li>
            <li> Three different tweezers, scissors and eyebrow brush included in small blue case which is handy.</li>
            <li> Nice little set with 2 very sharp tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Now I need a decent magnifying glass for when I get one of those tiny metal splinters.</li>
            <li> you would get such high quality products bit you do.</li>
            <li> It is pretty sharp and kids should stay away from it.</li>
            <li> The scissors are a little strange and cheaply made...</li>
            <li> The head of the brush actually fell off the stick after a few use and the scissors are actually pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I have spent THREE times as much on the tweezers alone, and so I suspected that this kit would be sub-par -</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok but not great</li>
            <li> these little tools are just what i need, as i&#x27;m always getting something in my fingers and there is always the right tool.</li>
            <li> The scissors are a little hard to open, so be careful when using them, but everything works great for my needs.</li>
            <li> Stainless steel tweezers with sharp edges for ease of use.</li>
            <li> I threw in an extra nail clipper in this thing and it seems to be a full grooming kit in an extremely small package.</li>
            <li> Got all of these little tools along with a Seki nail clipper in a small glass on my vanity top.</li>
            <li> For a guy who was told by many people to pluck his eyebrows, I was very hesitant on buying tweezers because I&#x27;ve heard that some tweezers, the cheaper ones, have rounded ends and make it very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Design is poor, quality is ok, the little scissors would have better use for clipping some serious toe nails.</li>
            <li> These will last a long time and do not rust~</li>
            <li> , these are luxurious but they work well and last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> They are a little sharp but very well made.</li>
            <li> The tweezers don&#x27;t grasp tiny hairs well, so it takes multiple attempts to pluck those little stray devils.  </li>
            <li> Now everyone has 3 different types of tweezers to choose from as well as some other accessories.</li>
            <li> These will work for you initially, but don&#x27;t expect them to last past a couple of months.</li>
            <li> the tweezers 10 to actually break my hairs in half and the brow coma leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit along with the manicure kit from Body Toolz and both came in poor quality cases and the tools were cheap and not very good.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any of the other four but everything is as advertised.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the eyebrow comber but the other tools in this kit</li>
            <li> Tweezers are really sharp and often &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the hair instead of grab to pull out.</li>
            <li> Some of them are a bit too sharp for my taste, but perhaps that&#x27;s how they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Tools all perfectly sharp, and pointed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this would be that the brush thing has a very loose handle.</li>
            <li> this for my Wife who was frustrated with cheap ash tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> not worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s probably because of my eyebrow&#x27;s unruly thick coarse nature.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are very sharp.</li>
            <li> After 5 months of use, the tweezers have lost their quality and now break my hairs in half.</li>
            <li> This kit was just what I needed for typical eyebrow maintanence.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are all very sharp, so it took a little getting used to when plucking.</li>
            <li> disappointed to get this, it has the feel and look of cheap product.</li>
            <li> I just threw away the little brush thing, but maybe the ladies out there will want that.</li>
            <li> I have those sharp tweezers too., and none of them in the past has ever punctured me.</li>
            <li> The ends do not fit together as tightly as I had hoped for eyebrow removal..  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the Tweezers, but figured these would act as a backup in case I ever lost my Sephora tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 4 out of 5 because the scissor is dull and not as sharp as the tweezers.</li>
            <li> No better than the ones you can get at the drugstore - don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> get EVERY little hair!</li>
            <li> the quality is bad the only thing i got left is the small scissors</li>
            <li> quality is bad but not because how it feel or the materials I really wouldn&#x27;t care about the</li>
            <li> I usually wax my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I especially like the tweezers they can  be used for removing slivers as well as hair in the wrong places.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too small.</li>
            <li> Usually products like this</li>
            <li> but I have small hands.  </li>
            <li> Scissors not at all dull.</li>
            <li> however I mean beginner as in you&#x27;re going to want to add stuff to it.</li>
            <li> The tools are flimsy and designed poorly.  </li>
            <li> Very annoying to say the least, but considering the price I should have expected it.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Im even afraid to touch the scissors, it doesnt perform its function.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so bad quality.</li>

            <li> case is good..and frankly i brought this kit coz of its case only..tweezers are also bended at the tip and works great!!</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my wife,  She loves it..  SO, when the wife is happy, I am happy...  Good value for a fair price.</li>
            <li> really nice stuff here.  Quality seems to be great, tried the angled tweezer, works great.</li>
            <li> I gave it my sister for her birthday she loves it. She uses frequently to shape her eyebrows. If I hear any complaints I will write a new review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and this kit is such a help in the eyebrow department. I bought two - one for clients and one for myself!</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with my waxing kit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the tweezers do a very good job and the scissors have a perfect bend that is useful</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with what I got. The case is pretty and look sturdy. Nice grip on the tweezer work just as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Made a great gift! Very professional, high quality tools in a nice faux leather zippered case. My Niece loved it!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed. The scissors are a little strange and cheaply made... the tweezers are acceptable but not a quality that I&#x27;d purchase again. I&#x27;d rather pay a little more for better tools.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Nice tweezer set for brow grooming!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my boyfriend to force him to trim his eye brows. I really just wanted an eye brow brush &amp; scissors, but I figured he could use the tweezers if he got a splinter or something. For $11 it&#x27;s well worth the money. I have very sparse eye brows and fill them in daily, but I used the tweezers to get some stray hairs. They work fine for someone who plucks every couple of weeks. They probably aren&#x27;t good enough quality for someone with fuller brows who plucks daily or several times a week. The case is sparkly blue, so if you aren&#x27;t into glitter, you may not want to travel with it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to replace a great tweezers I lost while traveling, but this won&#x27;t do it.  The tweezers don&#x27;t grasp tiny hairs well, so it takes multiple attempts to pluck those little stray devils.  No better than the ones you can get at the drugstore - don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It has everything you need to do you own eyebrows or do other people eyebrows. Works greats. Just used it couple days ago. Got it in great time. Just finally needed to use it this week.</li>
            <li> Look all you want when you get tired of messing around come back and get this best price and quality phone. Excellent delivery time and good product, I would buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> The eye browe tweazers and every thing else in the kit are great - they are excellent tools for the price!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, and it works great.</li>
            <li> This little kit works great. All three tweezers work just as they should. Haven&#x27;t used the eyebrow comb.. I guess my eyebrows aren&#x27;t bushy enough. The scissors also work good as well.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look great thanks to this cheap and very efficient grooming kit. I mostly use the flat tweezers, and the scissors and brush are also very useful. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the tweezers on this set and you get three for the price you would pay for just one. They are a little sharp but very well made. I glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> I love these tools. They are better than I expec.</li>
            <li> BEST tweezer kit ever!</li>
            <li> The eye browe tweazers and every thing else in the kit are great - they are excellent tools for the price!</li>
            <li> Need I say any more?  They actually work and pull the eyebrow hair out the first time.  Also worked awesome on the splinter my grandson got in his hand.</li>
            <li> The tools in this kit were of great quality. Very happy with this buy! I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price and the amount of tools in the case. These will last a long time and do not rust~</li>
            <li> not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> only 1 of the tweezers are decent, and the eye brow comb is nice to perfect the brow lenth scissors are sharp.</li>
            <li> I bought this my sophomore year in college (currently a senior).&lt;br /&gt;The grip isn&#x27;t phenomenal which means those little stubs you were trying to pull out might bounce back into your skin. The head of the brush actually fell off the stick after a few use and the scissors are actually pretty decent. It&#x27;s okay especially for the price. However, I would suggest Tweezerman or learning to thread your brows.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Body Toolz Eyebrow kit. I usually wax my eyebrows but I recently decided to stop and started threading and plucking again. I went to every beauty store looking for a good pair of tweezers but at the price of $3-$5 for one I couldn&#x27;t justify the purchase. Finding this kit was miracle. I love that I get three different sizes of tweezers along with the trimming scissors and comb. The tweezers work great but be careful of the two smaller size one they are very sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the Tweezers, but figured these would act as a backup in case I ever lost my Sephora tweezers. The Eyebrow trimmer and eyebrow brush thing are great though! The case they are all in is really nice too. Great price, great delivery time!</li>
            <li> This is a cheap set and I do not recommend it.  The tools are flimsy and designed poorly.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this would be that the brush thing has a very loose handle. I guess it wasn&#x27;t glued together very well. I don&#x27;t really care though since I will probably never use that particular tool. I&#x27;ve used all three tweezers and the scissors. The tweezers work well. The scissors work well. They do what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This is perfect! Coming from a family who always fights over the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; tweezers in the house, I ordered one of these for everyone! Now everyone has 3 different types of tweezers to choose from as well as some other accessories. This was a great find!</li>
            <li> the tweezers 10 to actually break my hairs in half and the brow coma leaves a lot to be desired. when the tweezers don&#x27;t break I heard he have they tend to break my skin. The scissors are the only redeeming thing about this set...not worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> Nice little set with 2 very sharp tweezers.  One of the tweezers had a bent tip that only took a minute or two with a knife sharpening stone to fix.  The scissors are nothing to get to excited about, but they do take care of the occasional hang nail.  The tweezers have a soft rubber tip on them to protect the fine points.  The tweezers don&#x27;t have allot of spring tension to spring open again.</li>
            <li> I pluck my eyebrows regularly since they grow back so quickly. After 5 months of use, the tweezers have lost their quality and now break my hairs in half. Very annoying to say the least, but considering the price I should have expected it. These will work for you initially, but don&#x27;t expect them to last past a couple of months. The scissors and comb are okay and still work, though.</li>
            <li> quality is bad but not because how it feel or the materials I really wouldn&#x27;t care about the but its that it doesnt take ur hair out, it doesn&#x27;t do what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect little kit for a guy who wants to stay well groomed. It has all the tools to trim your eyebrows, brush your mustache, and pluck unwanted hairs. They&#x27;re all quality tools and very precise.</li>
            <li> I especially like the tweezers they can  be used for removing slivers as well as hair in the wrong places.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. A compact kit.</li>
            <li> I sit my bushy browed fella down every now and again to torture him with super light &amp;#34;manscaping.&amp;#34;  This is a fine kit to perform said chore.  Deluxe indeed.</li>
            <li> This is a great little kit; does what it is made for.</li>
            <li> Great Kit, scissors feel a bit cheap, but they work just fine. Looks, feels, operates exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> I have spent THREE times as much on the tweezers alone, and so I suspected that this kit would be sub-par - but instead it had HIGH quality tools at a fraction of the price.  Totally love it!!!</li>
            <li> Good little kit for the money, I like all the different tweezers!</li>
            <li> All you need for your eyebrows and mustache to succeed in one cheap kit.  I put an eyebrow stencil in there with it as well.</li>
            <li> Three good tweezers and small scissors for miscellaneous hair trimming/extraction and splinter removal. Now I need a decent magnifying glass for when I get one of those tiny metal splinters. I just threw away the little brush thing, but maybe the ladies out there will want that. Got all of these little tools along with a Seki nail clipper in a small glass on my vanity top. Put the carrying case in a drawer. I don&#x27;t travel much at all, but if/when I do that case will fit all those little tools, including the Seki in one bundle. Can&#x27;t beat this set for the price.</li>
            <li> Good set for the price.  The tweezers are all very sharp, so it took a little getting used to when plucking. The pointier ones make it easier to get the smaller hairs.  I haven&#x27;t used the comb or scissors yet, so I&#x27;m not sure how good they are.</li>
            <li> This is a great beginner kit however I mean beginner as in you&#x27;re going to want to add stuff to it. The outside of the case feels a little cheap, like a dollar store item, but the inside is much better with snug elastic straps.  -The scissors of this kit are better than expected and I was happy with them.  -The eyebrow brush is okay, I have seen better but this one is very usable. Sephora makes a nice one but it is more expensive. I personally got the [[ASIN:B004JZNKH2 Revlon Double Ended Brow Brush, Premium]] and it works great. especially for it&#x27;s price. If you have the money though, I might recommend you invest in one with metal teeth and a boar bristle brush (not synthetic), these are luxurious but they work well and last a very long time.  -It is very important that you invest in good tweezers. I use ones by tweezerman that I got at my local drug store for about $24 and I believe they are very worth it. Tweezerman makes lots of different kinds of tweezers, invest in a good one! The ones that come with this kit are okay but you really need to invest in a better pair.    This makes for a great way to carry all your eyebrow tools and I recommend it. For ~$12 it is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I wish the twezers grabbed a little bit better but for the most part it works well. I use the fine point one to get tics off of my dog and it works really well</li>
            <li> Cheap case and cheap tools.  I bought this kit along with the manicure kit from Body Toolz and both came in poor quality cases and the tools were cheap and not very good.  Thumbs down to Body Toolz as these kits are a good idea but they make them so cheap it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a great deal!  The quality is just fine. I was searching for a pointed tweezer, but everything Prime was over $10 for just that one tool.  Then I found this kit, for the same cost. I like having all these eyebrow tools in one place - the case is terrific!  You can tell that the case though, kinda rinky-dink, but the tools are great.  Again, the PRICE!  The scissors are great to have for snipping off my split ends when I&#x27;m bored.</li>
            <li> I AM A MAN. simple grooming needs. tweezers and metal scissors for trimming my beard. I threw in an extra nail clipper in this thing and it seems to be a full grooming kit in an extremely small package. the case, is ehhh. its sort of glittery metallic navy blue. not  terrible, not really water proof but holds everything snugly and neatly. Toss it in a ziplock bag and take it anywhere.</li>
            <li> This was a great stocking stuffer for my daughter. She was always borrowing my tweezers, so now she has her own kit.</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping for the best, but the truth is the other 4 &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; are only there to justify an overpriced eyebrow tweezer.</li>
            <li> For a guy who was told by many people to pluck his eyebrows, I was very hesitant on buying tweezers because I&#x27;ve heard that some tweezers, the cheaper ones, have rounded ends and make it very difficult to use. That being said, I took my chances and bought this one because it includes a brush, three sized tweezers, and a clipper. I haven&#x27;t used any of the other four but everything is as advertised. Stainless steel tweezers with sharp edges for ease of use. Although the brush really doesn&#x27;t do anything for my eyebrows. However, that&#x27;s probably because of my eyebrow&#x27;s unruly thick coarse nature.</li>
            <li> pretty nice kit. It is useful. Good quality. It is pretty sharp and kids should stay away from it. Generally, good.</li>
            <li> Conratulations, excellent supplier again for a good business with him, poi everything reported was correct and this is very good</li>
            <li> The scissors are a little hard to open, so be careful when using them, but everything works great for my needs.</li>
            <li> Great set of eyebrow manicuring tools.</li>
            <li> Excellent and very complete kit</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so bad quality.The scissors doesn&#x27;t cut at all. Because of the good reviews I decided to try it but I can&#x27;t believe why some one would put more that a star.</li>
            <li> Has everything you could need.&lt;br /&gt;The materials are of quality, the case leaves a bit too be desired.</li>
            <li> I did not this you would get such high quality products bit you do. And the price is great I use all of the tweezers and the brush but u don&#x27;t know what to do with the scissors.</li>
            <li> Everything is great but the small tweezers don&#x27;t do anything. They&#x27;re too small.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but the two tweezers were like needle sharp! It punctured my eye lid numerous times. I ended up just using the one. Which,, means I didn&#x27;t need to buy this whole kit. I have those sharp tweezers too., and none of them in the past has ever punctured me. Sorry., I cannot recommend. The quality isn&#x27;t great either. I wanted to see why the 4.5 stars rating and sadly, I do not fall into that category. Or maybe I know too much about eyebrow work to expect better. But I did get what I paid for. I will keep these as &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; items if I happen to lose my good tweezers.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality of the tools for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> Some of the tweezers needed a little move to make the ends meet, but once that was done, all is good.</li>
            <li> amazing!!! SO precise and sharp to pull out hairs</li>
            <li> I will never have to get my eyebrows waxed again - everything you need for perfect brows in a compact case.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok but not great</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this because of the case or any of the tweezers, they&#x27;re cheap and not worth it. The scissors are the best in the kit and I use them them the most.  The brow comb is okay but Sephora sells a better one for .99. If you&#x27;re looking for awesome tweezers you should buy them separately and pay a bit more so you get quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it again I would buy the scissors, comb, and tweezers separately - I love my eyebrows too much.</li>
            <li> The main tweezer is great! Also the the rest of the tools. The case is also nice and practical. Good deal</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the quality of the product and somewhat surprised because of the low cost I was not expecting the quality I received. Comes in a nice case.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does well representing the products they carry.</li>
            <li> disappointed to get this, it has the feel and look of cheap product. Im even afraid to touch the scissors, it doesnt perform its function.</li>
            <li> Wow. This is better than expected. The tools are all high quality. The zippy holder is actually convenient. I like these tools would buy again. They help my pluck exactly like I want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that they are different sizes for different needs and people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for the tweezer in the middle. Not bad for pricing</li>
            <li> the quality is bad the only thing i got left is the small scissors</li>
            <li> This is the perfect eyebrow kit. It has everything you need and more. It&#x27;s a pretty good price as well!</li>
            <li> Great kit. Just as described.</li>
            <li> This product is great for trimming and getting rid of unwanted hair. Travel pack is very convenient when traveling. L</li>
            <li> All the perfect tools you need!</li>
            <li> wonderful little kit, everything I need.</li>
            <li> Great kit for the price.  Buying the items individually would definitely cost more, and they come in a nice kit that fits in your purse.  Good quality, the items and the case.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Made a great Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> l have huge eyebrows this kit really helps keep them neat it appearance. I highly recommend both the kit and seller.</li>
            <li> Awesome tweezers! Best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I loved the tweezers that came in this set. I&#x27;m not a fan of the other utensils, but the tweezers were excellent. They had superb grasping and holding abilities. Would definitely purchase again!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, and will update as I put them to good use with me and my daughters facials...YAY!!</li>
            <li> I bought them for a present, i think they are going to b very Happy. Very useful, daily use, good quality. Thank you</li>
            <li> 4 stars out of 5 for every utensil I&#x27;ve used in this kit. I haven&#x27;t used the eyebrow comber but the other tools in this kit helped greatly. I was able to use them for more purposes than simply grooming my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Love this set. The only reason I dropped it a star was Because I dropped one of the tweezers and the end bent. It bent too easy in my opinion. Great buy anyway.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality and sharpness.  Usually products like this I have to pay extra.  I was please enough to purchase 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the tweezers worked as well as I would wanted.  The ends do not fit together as tightly as I had hoped for eyebrow removal..  The sharp ends may be ok for &amp;#34;splinter removal&amp;#34;.  I have not used that pair yet.</li>
            <li> Well, it is not awful, and I use it every now and then, but not on my face. Mostly on my husbands ears and for arts and crafts. Design is poor, quality is ok, the little scissors would have better use for clipping some serious toe nails. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are really sharp and often &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; the hair instead of grab to pull out.</li>
            <li> This kit was just what I needed for typical eyebrow maintanence. Simple, good quality and assortment of tweezers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a extra-portable and complete eyebrow kit, I&#x27;d recommend this BodyToolz product!</li>
            <li> i love this kit, it is amazing and i love that there is different styles of tweezers and the scissors are great</li>
            <li> The tools are a bit flimsy but they will do. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will last for a while I would recommend purchasing something else.</li>
            <li> Now I have perfect eyebrows</li>
            <li> Nice set. I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> these little tools are just what i need, as i&#x27;m always getting something in my fingers and there is always the right tool.</li>
            <li> the tweezers are great and the scissors are sharp may seem small but I have small hands.  case works for me</li>
            <li> Really nice little set for eyebrows. Three different tweezers, scissors and eyebrow brush included in small blue case which is handy. I like to maintain between waxes and these get EVERY little hair!</li>
            <li> Love this item , everything I need in a kit.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!!:)</li>
            <li> Been using this set for nearly two years, and everything is still in great shape. The zipper is starting to run less smoothly, but the tools themselves are really good. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 4 out of 5 because the scissor is dull and not as sharp as the tweezers. Overal, good product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great for me. Some of them are a bit too sharp for my taste, but perhaps that&#x27;s how they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I needed a new tweezer kit for my work as an esthetician and these did the trick. Arrived quickly, not bad quality, the scissors and tweezers have lasted longer than some of my other kits.</li>
            <li> Wow this set is awesome.......</li>
            <li> Good Quality!&lt;br /&gt;Bought this for my Wife who was frustrated with cheap ash tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;3 Heavy guage stainless steel tweezers included.&lt;br /&gt;These tweezers work great for her without breaking the bank!</li>
            <li> Great little kit. Tools all perfectly sharp, and pointed. Scissors not at all dull. Great for the price, and wonderful for shaping brows.</li>
            <li> Great kit for more than eyebrow maintenance. I use it to pull splinters and thread my needles. Tweezers are very sharp. Scissors and brush come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen&lt;br /&gt;Oakland, CA</li>
