            <li>Better price.</li>
            <li>Still the favorite in our house.</li>
            <li>I had three authentic bottles before, two i bought at the airport and one at macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts for almost 10 hours, and I love it.</li>
            <li>but I love him in Issey Miyake.</li>
            <li>it smelled more like a knockoff.</li>
            <li>Love it on my boyfriend</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I simply love this fragrance, a master piece of perfume</li>
            <li>Will gladly buy again when this bottle&#x27;s gone (in a year or two).</li>
            <li>Very Nice, the fragance odor is very mellow...</li>
            <li>good perfume, nice smell, worth to have, and worth to be as a gift, strong smell with nice feeling</li>
            <li>Everyone always wants to know who smells soooo amazing!</li>
            <li>The smell used to stay in my clothes for 3 days and people would easily recognize it .  </li>
            <li>I bit strong.  </li>
            <li>smells so good that I can forget for 24 hours to pour it again on my body.&lt;br /&gt;the price is high but</li>
            <li>Mine is original, the scent lasts for hours and stays strong.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m a huge cologne buff this is one of my favs</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li>Genuine product.</li>
            <li>I will enjoy it a lot.</li>
            <li>Refreshed scent, sends senses into a tizzy of happiness and action.</li>
            <li>the young lady made a comment about, &amp;#34;Who smells so good, today&amp;#34;?  </li>
            <li>High quality product, super seller honest and sincere to its obligations as a seller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right strength and the ladies love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real!!!</li>
            <li>Its kinda funny smelling at first but very satisfying.</li>
            <li>This product is 100% original no doubt.  </li>
            <li>I have an original &amp;#34;1 million&amp;#34; by Paco Rabanne</li>
            <li>Not the original product.</li>
            <li>Smells great, lasts long.</li>
            <li>This cologne has an extremely unique fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very elegant scent for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can attest to the fact that this is not a fake, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>It smells like sweet bubblegum.</li>
            <li>This is really growing on me for my favorite.</li>
            <li>and it is true.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it, but was repulsed by the sweet smell.</li>
            <li>I love it so much .</li>
            <li>like it for winter days, think it is too &#x27;sweet&#x27; for summer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 6.8 oz bottle is a good deal because you buy more for less.</li>
            <li>It smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Entrega super r&amp;aacute;pida e vendedor nota 100&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produto</li>
            <li>de alta qualidade, vendedor super honesto e sincero para com suas obrigações como vendedor.</li>
            <li>The smell fades quickly.</li>
            <li>guess I got lucky...</li>
            <li>I have sent 3 e-mails to &amp;#34;cosmetic super deal&amp;#34; without success.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the seller was very quick and I very satified</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed  using  it so far.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a knock off of the original, has features of the oringinal sent but no all and is not as potent or lasts as long as the original.</li>
            <li>its worth it to buy one every 6 months.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For years I used to wear Christian Diors FAHRENHEIT perfume, 1 MILLION by Paco Rabanne completely replaced it as my favorite most used fragance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an in-your-face scent; somewhat more subtle, and very satisfying.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>The product arrived very fast</li>
            <li>My second bottle and my wife and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>This is my current favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>It just makes more sense to buy the bigger quantity bottle.</li>
            <li>was upset because the perfume bottle slipped from my hands the first time that I use here in Brazil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought the big bottle.</li>
            <li>The first time Ive experience this cologne was on a friend of mine.....</li>
            <li>Smells great and is very long lasting.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is bold and strong but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Thanks you very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Almost one month after they do not have a positive answer&lt;</li>
            <li>Th first one was 3.4 oz, I used it every single day and it lasted more</li>
            <li>it pulls the ladies for sure and long lastinggg</li>
            <li>Fragance smells good and last long in the weather of Trinidad &amp; Tobago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh, clean scent that lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>A must for any man who wants to smell like a million.</li>
            <li>Thank you much.</li>
            <li>SMELL LIKE THE REAL ONE.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really fell the smell anymore</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s so much cheaper to buy it here that.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to spray much on you.</li>
            <li>Also the price is very affordable</li>
            <li>It lasted my whole work shift and to bed.</li>
            <li>me wish I had a real gold bar</li>
            <li>but really I have no plan</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Check if it has a high % of positive comments and reviews</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but it&#x27;s not strong at all.</li>
            <li>On me it smelss spicy sweet not candy sweet like a lot of other people</li>
            <li>This big gold bar in 200 mL is great for long lasting perfume.</li>
            <li>Highly suggestive this product to everybody</li>
            <li>/&gt;Woman love this One Million fragrance and it carries far and wide so buy it!</li>
            <li>It was the real cologne, not some cheap imitation where the smell is gone in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s less masculine / musky than I&#x27;m used to, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>I think the 200 ml bottle is the right way to go with this perfume, as you receive twice the product of the 100 ml bottle and only an increase of around 20-30% in the price</li>
            <li>This one looks exactly the same, the smell is a bit different from the original and it only lasts for 3 hours maximum.</li>
            <li>( I would recommend higher than 95% for obvious reasons).</li>
            <li>It does not last more then an hour , diffidently not the same i had before from different places</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never liked a perfume like this one , girl love it</li>
            <li>Bought directly from amazon not one of their seller&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m like wow.</li>
            <li>am really upset and would like my money back.</li>
            <li>From the moment I smelled this scent I was completely hooked to it.</li>
            <li>Product is 100% real and came in ONE day with standard shipping.</li>
            <li>its hard to say, maybe some likes this but its too strong for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I started wearing this cologne roughly a week ago, and in that time I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments than I had in the previous 5 years of wearing different colognes.  </li>
            <li>Be careful if you plan to travel with this as it is too large to be brought in a carry-on bag while flying</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and this bottle is huge.  </li>
            <li>Also, go into YouTube.com and learn what are the differences between a fake and original so that you know exactly what you have when you receive it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance a little sweet at first draws enough attention without becoming unpleasant.</li>
            <li>It was somewhat close, but different I never had something so fruity like and really sweet little bit dark which I like.</li>

            <li> Everyone always wants to know who smells soooo amazing!</li>

            <li> I bit strong.  </li>
            <li> smells so good that I can forget for 24 hours to pour it again on my body.&lt;br /&gt;the price is high but</li>

            <li> Refreshed scent, sends senses into a tizzy of happiness and action.</li>
            <li> the young lady made a comment about, &amp;#34;Who smells so good, today&amp;#34;?  </li>
            <li> High quality product, super seller honest and sincere to its obligations as a seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right strength and the ladies love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real!!!</li>
            <li> Its kinda funny smelling at first but very satisfying.</li>
            <li> This product is 100% original no doubt.  </li>
            <li> I have an original &amp;#34;1 million&amp;#34; by Paco Rabanne</li>
            <li> Not the original product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, lasts long.</li>
            <li> This cologne has an extremely unique fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very elegant scent for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can attest to the fact that this is not a fake, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> It smells like sweet bubblegum.</li>
            <li> This is really growing on me for my favorite.</li>
            <li> and it is true.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it, but was repulsed by the sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I love it so much .</li>
            <li> like it for winter days, think it is too &#x27;sweet&#x27; for summer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 6.8 oz bottle is a good deal because you buy more for less.</li>
            <li> It smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Received quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Entrega super r&amp;aacute;pida e vendedor nota 100&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produto</li>
            <li> de alta qualidade, vendedor super honesto e sincero para com suas obrigações como vendedor.</li>
            <li> The smell fades quickly.</li>
            <li> guess I got lucky...</li>
            <li> I have sent 3 e-mails to &amp;#34;cosmetic super deal&amp;#34; without success.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the seller was very quick and I very satified</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed  using  it so far.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a knock off of the original, has features of the oringinal sent but no all and is not as potent or lasts as long as the original.</li>
            <li> its worth it to buy one every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For years I used to wear Christian Diors FAHRENHEIT perfume, 1 MILLION by Paco Rabanne completely replaced it as my favorite most used fragance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an in-your-face scent; somewhat more subtle, and very satisfying.</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> The product arrived very fast</li>
            <li> My second bottle and my wife and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> This is my current favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> It just makes more sense to buy the bigger quantity bottle.</li>
            <li> was upset because the perfume bottle slipped from my hands the first time that I use here in Brazil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought the big bottle.</li>
            <li> The first time Ive experience this cologne was on a friend of mine.....</li>
            <li> Smells great and is very long lasting.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is bold and strong but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Thanks you very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Almost one month after they do not have a positive answer&lt;</li>
            <li> Th first one was 3.4 oz, I used it every single day and it lasted more</li>
            <li> it pulls the ladies for sure and long lastinggg</li>
            <li> Fragance smells good and last long in the weather of Trinidad &amp; Tobago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh, clean scent that lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> A must for any man who wants to smell like a million.</li>
            <li> Thank you much.</li>
            <li> SMELL LIKE THE REAL ONE.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really fell the smell anymore</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s so much cheaper to buy it here that.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to spray much on you.</li>
            <li> Also the price is very affordable</li>
            <li> It lasted my whole work shift and to bed.</li>
            <li> me wish I had a real gold bar</li>
            <li> but really I have no plan</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Check if it has a high % of positive comments and reviews</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but it&#x27;s not strong at all.</li>
            <li> On me it smelss spicy sweet not candy sweet like a lot of other people</li>
            <li> This big gold bar in 200 mL is great for long lasting perfume.</li>
            <li> Highly suggestive this product to everybody</li>
            <li> /&gt;Woman love this One Million fragrance and it carries far and wide so buy it!</li>
            <li> It was the real cologne, not some cheap imitation where the smell is gone in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s less masculine / musky than I&#x27;m used to, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> I think the 200 ml bottle is the right way to go with this perfume, as you receive twice the product of the 100 ml bottle and only an increase of around 20-30% in the price</li>
            <li> This one looks exactly the same, the smell is a bit different from the original and it only lasts for 3 hours maximum.</li>
            <li> ( I would recommend higher than 95% for obvious reasons).</li>
            <li> It does not last more then an hour , diffidently not the same i had before from different places</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked a perfume like this one , girl love it</li>
            <li> Bought directly from amazon not one of their seller&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like wow.</li>
            <li> am really upset and would like my money back.</li>
            <li> From the moment I smelled this scent I was completely hooked to it.</li>
            <li> Product is 100% real and came in ONE day with standard shipping.</li>
            <li> its hard to say, maybe some likes this but its too strong for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I started wearing this cologne roughly a week ago, and in that time I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments than I had in the previous 5 years of wearing different colognes.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if you plan to travel with this as it is too large to be brought in a carry-on bag while flying</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and this bottle is huge.  </li>
            <li> Also, go into YouTube.com and learn what are the differences between a fake and original so that you know exactly what you have when you receive it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance a little sweet at first draws enough attention without becoming unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It was somewhat close, but different I never had something so fruity like and really sweet little bit dark which I like.</li>
            <li> however it doesnt really last for too long.</li>
            <li> and it last all day long p 0 t @</li>
            <li> The fragrant is off and does not last as long as the ones I bought from England.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting.</li>
            <li> It last for a very long time .</li>
            <li> Do not be afraid and buy one, I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I can continue to smell it long after I&#x27;ve put it on.</li>
            <li> The Armani smell stays for long and everyone around can smell it.</li>
            <li> One drawback is that it does not have a long lasting effect.....seems to dissipate faster than other products.  </li>
            <li> It was advertised as OdeThis product, however almost seemed like a sickening sweet version of the rich scent of Paco Rabanne Million</li>
            <li> The smell lasts for a long time too !</li>
            <li> I was checking out in the Home Depot the other day (Commercial section) and</li>
            <li> and I almost came a guess perfume for women that is not worth the same no where to report this fault</li>
            <li> It is very crisp &amp; sharp but not overpowering and flashy at the same time.</li>
            <li> This is because of the huge discount and also few people claiming that they received a fake one.</li>
            <li> Now I am trying to figure out how to complain on Amazon as it is my first experience with a fake product.</li>
            <li> This was my first blind buy,</li>
            <li> I purchased this I stead of buying Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male when I ran out because they changed the formula for Le Male and it is weak and fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a contractor behind me in line (who obviously had been on a site working) and he said it definitely is not me!  </li>
            <li> That will last as long and and not go weak.</li>
            <li> I have to use less than other colognes.  </li>
            <li> I like the bottle, but it is massive &amp; hard to travel with.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wanna spend 100$ on watered down knockoffs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;100% watered down version..</li>
            <li> I have been scammed with this product aroma will once and is not original</li>
            <li> serial match, but the fragrance is not original and It is not durable</li>
            <li> a few hours (3-4) maximum.</li>
            <li> one lasts no more than an hour and it smells like alcohol.</li>
            <li> Well, This is definitely not authentic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I did!</li>
            <li> Hard to find cologne</li>
            <li> My hope was high for this purchase, but i am disappointed to say, its not like the others (Paco Rabanne.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product, because it did not smell like  the original one</li>
            <li> Seriously, it smells like BUBBLEGUM.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this purchase, the fragrance is apparently not original or something happens.</li>
            <li> IT IS FAKE, DON NOT BUY IT!&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Was always skeptical about buying online...</li>
            <li> This product is a fake!</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy it, unless you want a fake!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> 2 hours is a maximum time someone can notice smell and that&#x27;s not meet the price :(</li>
            <li> Failed miserably..</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible cologne.  </li>

            <li> This is by far the best perfume ever made. What a beautiful masterpiece. I get one million compliments. Women love it. They come like bees on flowers.

            <li> good perfume, nice smell, worth to have, and worth to be as a gift, strong smell with nice feeling, everybody can notice. i bought another one as a gift</li>
            <li> I knew the scent, but not often used. Making frequent use now see the excellent fixation. The fragrance a little sweet at first draws enough attention without becoming unpleasant. Recommend it to everyone.</li>

            <li> The item is very good I like it very much</li>
            <li> It smells like bubblegum.  Seriously, it smells like BUBBLEGUM.  Horrible cologne.  I&#x27;ll never wear this.</li>
            <li> Very nice, people always ask what I am wearing</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. It was the real cologne, not some cheap imitation where the smell is gone in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This product is a fake! I have an original &amp;#34;1 million&amp;#34; by Paco Rabanne and it lasts more than 24 hours, even after washing.&lt;br /&gt;This one lasts no more than an hour and it smells like alcohol. DO NOT buy it, unless you want a fake!</li>
            <li> Excellent, and it arrived early</li>
            <li> One of the best perfumes</li>
            <li> Great buy ! smells Great! I get compliments all the time for wearing this.</li>
            <li> the seller was very quick and I very satified</li>
            <li> This is my current favorite cologne.  I get lots of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> My hope was high for this purchase, but i am disappointed to say, its not like the others (Paco Rabanne. one million) I have used. The fragrant is off and does not last as long as the ones I bought from England.</li>
            <li> It does not last more then an hour , diffidently not the same i had before from different places</li>
            <li> Although a bit pricey it&#x27;s worth the scent and awesome design. It just makes more sense to buy the bigger quantity bottle.</li>
            <li> THE UPS TRACK APPEARS AS IT HAD ARRIVED ON SEPTEMBER THE 13TH BUT IT NEVER CAME TO MY FRONT DOOR</li>
            <li> It smells nice. it is my signature cologne.</li>
            <li> Not the original product. Casing is partly malfunction. I&#x27;m not satisfy with the product. Better to get one from macy&#x27;s. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> THE BEST OF THE BEST SERVICE &amp; PRODUCT, THANKS 4 ALL</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I have made from Amazon!</li>
            <li> good product was very good buy I like the product thank you very much I will be making future purchases of different products</li>
            <li> Really liked the smell!</li>
            <li> was a present for my husband, and he like it. was a something i didn&#x27;t know he liked, he say it a mag and told me about it</li>
            <li> Very nice  product. I have enjoyed  using  it so far. I will recommend  it to a  friend. Thank you much.</li>
            <li> IT IS FAKE, DON NOT BUY IT!&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T SMELL LIKE THE REAL ONE. GUYS, PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and delivery was on time</li>
            <li> the best mens colone.  lots of compliments</li>
            <li> My husband was asked several time what cologne is this...Priceless!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second bottle of 1 Million. Th first one was 3.4 oz, I used it every single day and it lasted more that one year.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really fell the smell anymore but that&#x27;s is because I got used to it. I still get compliment from people.&lt;br /&gt;The 6.8 oz bottle is a good deal because you buy more for less.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle and awesome smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this one from Amazon, and I bought with it Armani Code. There is no doubt this one is fake and the Armani is authentic. The Armani smell stays for long and everyone around can smell it. For this one, the smell goes after minutes. I put some before going to prayer and by the time I reached the mosque there was almost no smell. Now I am trying to figure out how to complain on Amazon as it is my first experience with a fake product. NB: the perfume came from PAFNY LTD.</li>
            <li> Excellent colonge. Excellent price. Smells great, lasts long. Received quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> great cologne. very nice formal scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The product arrived very fast</li>
            <li> This cologne is just perfect. Its kinda funny smelling at first but very satisfying. Iv wear gio Armani. This is really growing on me for my favorite.</li>
            <li> excellent product reached me in time</li>
            <li> High quality product, super seller honest and sincere to its obligations as a seller. I recommend! I would do business with him again when I return to the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance of this perfume. I recommend to all who love him.&lt;br /&gt;I was upset because the perfume bottle slipped from my hands the first time that I use here in Brazil. But once you return to the States, I will contact the seller and buy a bottle of 200ml.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portuguese:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entrega super r&amp;aacute;pida e vendedor nota 100&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produto de alta qualidade, vendedor super honesto e sincero para com suas obrigações como vendedor. Recomendo! Eu faria novamente neg&amp;oacute;cios com ele quando eu voltar aos Estados Unidos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eu adoro a fragância desse perfume. Recomendo a todos que gostam dele.&lt;br /&gt;Fiquei chateado porque o frasco do perfume escorregou das minhas mãos na primeira vez que fui usar aqui no Brasil. Mas assim que retornar aos Estados Unidos, irei entrar em contato com o vendedor e comprar mais um frasco de 200ml.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot.  I bit strong.  I have to use less than other colognes.  It is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Beautiful packaging. Refreshed scent, sends senses into a tizzy of happiness and action.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a knock off of the original, has features of the oringinal sent but no all and is not as potent or lasts as long as the original.</li>
            <li> smells so good that I can forget for 24 hours to pour it again on my body.&lt;br /&gt;the price is high but its worth it to buy one every 6 months.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this purchase, the fragrance is apparently not original or something happens. The smell fades quickly. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I get compliments about it all the time.</li>
            <li> It is a very good perfume...  it is the second time that I bought this perfume and Im loving it. I recommend</li>
            <li> Very elegant scent for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can attest to the fact that this is not a fake, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it!</li>
            <li> The best Cologne I have used ever...</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this I get comments about how great it smells.  I was checking out in the Home Depot the other day (Commercial section) and the young lady made a comment about, &amp;#34;Who smells so good, today&amp;#34;?  There was a contractor behind me in line (who obviously had been on a site working) and he said it definitely is not me!  The checkout girl then asked me what I was wearing and said it smelled really good.  I guess the proof is in the pudding.  BTW, my wife and kids like it too!  :)  One drawback is that it does not have a long lasting effect.....seems to dissipate faster than other products.  I believe someone else mentioned that in a review and it is true.</li>
            <li> loved it, excellent fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I have used it before, and it smelled wonderful. It was advertised as OdeThis product, however almost seemed like a sickening sweet version of the rich scent of Paco Rabanne Million I was expecting. I tried to use it, but was repulsed by the sweet smell. Now I have a 6.7 oz of something I can&#x27;t use. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> My guy friend loved it!!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but it&#x27;s not strong at all. 2 hours is a maximum time someone can notice smell and that&#x27;s not meet the price :(</li>
            <li> I bought this 1 Million, it doesn&#x27;t smell like one million.  It&#x27;s fake don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Well it was delivered on the day they said it would be . This is my second bottle of this cologne. I have another order on its way . So that would be my third bottle. I love it so much . It smells so clean and fresh. I get nothing but good compliments. One girl even told me that every time she smells it on me it makes her want to kiss me. I&#x27;m like wow. That&#x27;s some good cologne. I would give it a try if I were you. Plus it&#x27;s so much cheaper to buy it here that. In the mall. What I payed for 2 bottles you would only get one an a smaller bottle at that.also this cologne is very addictive. It&#x27;s like I can&#x27;t wait to put it on after my morning shower and my night shower. Also every time I go somewhere like the store or the drug store I have one bottle in my car and I spray one stay on me. Lol. You don&#x27;t need to spray much on you. It last for a very long time .</li>
            <li> My husband loved it arrived on time and unbroken.</li>
            <li> Very good I loved this perfume ,It was a purchase that I regret not buyy it and good  !!!!! Ok</li>
            <li> Definitely love it...It is high class people staffs, and fabulously makes you happy! Highly suggestive this product to everybody I know!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought the big bottle. I feel like a million bucks! It&#x27;s just the right strength and the ladies love it.</li>
            <li> the best product I recommend it 100% fragrance everyone is super rich and very good quality Also the price is very affordable</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume, I love it. 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> Awesome company fast ship and I love this scent. Get asked all the time and sniffed by women.  On me it smelss spicy sweet not candy sweet like a lot of other people guess I got lucky...</li>
            <li> Awesome cologne.  Will no doubt buy again.</li>
            <li> i can now get some girls&lt;br /&gt;l l l l l l l l l l l l l i</li>
            <li> This was my first blind buy, w/out smelling it. I tried to find something that was similar to the D&amp;G cologne that was discontinued. It was somewhat close, but different I never had something so fruity like and really sweet little bit dark which I like. It lasted my whole work shift and to bed. Hard to find cologne that&#x27;s not edp. That will last as long and and not go weak. No need to respray used it from 12 to 12 and it&#x27;s awesome. Make sure u get it from Amazon u don&#x27;t wanna spend 100$ on watered down knockoffs.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is bold and strong but it lasts a long time. I purchased this I stead of buying Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male when I ran out because they changed the formula for Le Male and it is weak and fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woman love this One Million fragrance and it carries far and wide so buy it!</li>
            <li> Excelente frangancia, excelente tama&amp;ntilde;o, vale la pena la inversi&amp;oacute;n especialmente si eres fanatico de esta fragancia y la quieres usar para el diario</li>
            <li> Getting compliments all the time on this scent! It was the highest rated scent online and a top seller so I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad that I did!</li>
            <li> serial match, but the fragrance is not original and It is not durable</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I get the perfume was not buy a one million 200ml cost me $ 100 and I almost came a guess perfume for women that is not worth the same no where to report this fault</li>
            <li> My fav! Gets all the ladies!</li>
            <li> Perfume One Million &amp;eacute; o melhor perfume que j&amp;aacute; fizeram para homem, com fragrância marcante e bem agrad&amp;aacute;vel.&lt;br /&gt;Perfume excelente para usar a noite.</li>
            <li> Great deal, love it and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great product.  Better price.</li>
            <li> Perfume is the best I&#x27;ve had. I am proud to have bought it, Uele to money, simply spectacular thaks bye.</li>
            <li> This big gold bar in 200 mL is great for long lasting perfume. And the essence os One Million has its power.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, really popular. So if you want anything that is &#x27;exclusive&#x27;, go for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it for winter days, think it is too &#x27;sweet&#x27; for summer.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. It smells good and it came nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Very good product, the best mark in the vendor announced, 100 percent patched, ESPECIALLY THAT Nara seeking something useful and good</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described. Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, and this is a great value.</li>
            <li> Still the favorite in our house.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, economical size (if that&#x27;s appropriate for a cologne) .</li>
            <li> its hard to say, maybe some likes this but its too strong for me.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly have no idea why it is so popular.</li>
            <li> Well, This is definitely not authentic. I had three authentic bottles before, two i bought at the airport and one at macy&#x27;s. The smell used to stay in my clothes for 3 days and people would easily recognize it .  This one looks exactly the same, the smell is a bit different from the original and it only lasts for 3 hours maximum. My recommendation, Don&#x27;t buy it from here! mine was sold by \\&quot;DeGlamorous\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Genuine product. The fragrance lasts for almost 10 hours, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have sent 3 e-mails to &amp;#34;cosmetic super deal&amp;#34; without success.&lt;br /&gt;They said the good was delivered on December 1st 2013. I did not receive nothing ans askd for the delivery proof.&lt;br /&gt;Almost one month after they do not have a positive answer&lt;br /&gt;I am really upset and would like my money back. I will never use this system again</li>
            <li> -This does make you smell like a million bucks&lt;br /&gt;-Get used to getting compliments if you wear this cologne&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m never getting rid of the bottle, it&#x27;s god damn beautiful&lt;br /&gt;-Makes me wish I had a real gold bar</li>
            <li> I feel when people smell me wear this they think I&#x27;m a man with a plan but really I have no plan so I feel like I&#x27;m lying to people when I wear it</li>
            <li> Was always skeptical about buying online... Went by reviews and Amazon trust.. Failed miserably..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% watered down version.. Don&#x27;t waste your money, I did!</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE COMPRA Y NEGOCIO MUY CONTENTO CON LA COMPRA DEL PERFUME ONE MILLION DE PACO RABANNE NO LOP CAMBIO Y SIGUYE SIENDO EL MEJOR</li>
            <li> All excelent venezuela</li>
            <li> Great product, my husband like it but I love him in Issey Miyake.</li>
            <li> I would have to admit, I was skeptical that the cologne was going to be an authentic one. This is because of the huge discount and also few people claiming that they received a fake one. Mine is original, the scent lasts for hours and stays strong. Take in consideration the store (inside Amazon) that you are buying the cologne from. Check if it has a high % of positive comments and reviews ( I would recommend higher than 95% for obvious reasons). Also, go into YouTube.com and learn what are the differences between a fake and original so that you know exactly what you have when you receive it. Do not be afraid and buy one, I am completely satisfied. I&#x27;m just trying to help you people out.</li>
            <li> From the moment I smelled this scent I was completely hooked to it. For years I used to wear Christian Diors FAHRENHEIT perfume, 1 MILLION by Paco Rabanne completely replaced it as my favorite most used fragance. I think the 200 ml bottle is the right way to go with this perfume, as you receive twice the product of the 100 ml bottle and only an increase of around 20-30% in the price</li>
            <li> Amazing. Smells great and is very long lasting. This is panty dropper cologne. Huge bottle and amazing discount too. Product is 100% real and came in ONE day with standard shipping.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this! I would reccomend it to others!</li>
            <li> Very nice smell. This is a quality scent &amp; one of my favorites. I like the bottle, but it is massive &amp; hard to travel with.</li>
            <li> it smelled more like a knockoff. I was very disappointed in this product, because it did not smell like  the original one</li>
            <li> Absolutely the greatest scent out there. Be careful if you plan to travel with this as it is too large to be brought in a carry-on bag while flying</li>
            <li> Well done. Good quality item. Thanks</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend, she loved it.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m a huge cologne buff this is one of my favs</li>
            <li> hmmm smell so so so good . must have</li>
            <li> This cologne has an extremely unique fragrance. It is very crisp &amp; sharp but not overpowering and flashy at the same time. The smell stays on me all day and even my clothes have it the next day as well. Very much loved by everybody around me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real!!! Lasts all day . Love it on my boyfriend</li>
            <li> smell awesome excellent price five stars</li>
            <li> excelent product. I will enjoy it a lot. Thanks. On time and it was protteccted. Thanks you very much. ok</li>
            <li> I simply love this fragrance, a master piece of perfume</li>
            <li> I started wearing this cologne roughly a week ago, and in that time I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments than I had in the previous 5 years of wearing different colognes.  It&#x27;s a fresh, clean scent that lasts a long time.  A little goes a long way, and this bottle is huge.  Well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s less masculine / musky than I&#x27;m used to, but I love it.  Will gladly buy again when this bottle&#x27;s gone (in a year or two).</li>
            <li> Bought this a year ago and sprayed it on before going to bed and woke up still smelling it. Repurchased it and now it&#x27;s nothing like before, guess its a hit or miss thing.</li>
            <li> Everyone always wants to know who smells soooo amazing! That would be me with this awesome unforgettable attention grabbing scent! Every mans must have in your cologne collection!</li>
            <li> My wife and friends like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Most of people will like it.</li>
            <li> Great,light fragrance. It will make you stand out from the crowd.. But it won&#x27;t last 10 hours.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne.</li>
            <li> The first time Ive experience this cologne was on a friend of mine.....i had to ask what he was wearing, it was smelling up the room...since then ive been wearing it....it pulls the ladies for sure and long lastinggg</li>
            <li> Buying on line is my we hobby.  Let it snow!</li>
