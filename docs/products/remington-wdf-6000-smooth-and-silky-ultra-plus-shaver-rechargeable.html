            <li>Mine, was a good experience!</li>
            <li>It does a great job under the arms and the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>but this razor is great.</li>
            <li>a Remington)was not all that great,</li>

            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>The results are better than any manual shaver and the best part is there are no knicks and unsightly cuts on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled!  </li>
            <li>My good one&#x27;s battery died and they tell me I cannot replace</li>
            <li>I&#x27;D RECOMMEND AND GOOD FOR GIFTING.</li>
            <li>This turns out to be a really good, close shave for legs/underarms.  </li>
            <li>As for the legs NO electric shaver has ever been as good as a razor.</li>
            <li>Shaves close and smooth and once you get your hair adjusted for shaving with an electric shaver and get used to using a shaver, it is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>Also, the shaver I was replacing was a Remington, and I had loved it.  </li>
            <li>But as they promised once you did the shave would be good and close.    </li>
            <li>I figured if I was going to buy one it had better be good one, so I coughed up the dough and I am so happy I did.  </li>
            <li>Very handy , nice colors , nice shave.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is really nice, and does a good job shaving my legs.</li>
            <li>Nice shaver, fits in your hand nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice grip&lt;BR</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that I got a good shaver</li>
            <li>I went with this one because it looks nice and it wasn&#x27;t the cheapest one.</li>
            <li>and she is thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Am happy with this item, arrived quickly and works well.</li>
            <li>so it is great for quick shaving any time you need it.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like I do, then this is the perfect product for you.  </li>
            <li>I did a search online to find the most popular women&#x27;s shaver and &lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>It was very smooth, with no pulling or scraping sensations.</li>
            <li>This product has very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>My legs are very smooth after shaving.  </li>
            <li>This one does seem to do a better job then most.</li>
            <li>I read reviews on Amazon of many razors before I decided which one to try.  </li>
            <li>Glad I chose this one, it does not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts around 45 mins, although I haven&#x27;t timed it to make sure.</li>
            <li>Based on user reviews, I purchased this product and love it.  </li>
            <li>In fact, this shaver did a better, actually a MUCH BETTER job shaving my underarms than a blade.  </li>
            <li>the Remington WDF-6000 the shave is actually better and closer, no stubble, no nicks, no bumps.  </li>
            <li>Better than others I have bought.</li>
            <li>It provides a nice smooth shave without any irritation.</li>
            <li>so pleased with this shaver</li>
            <li>I have owned many razors over the years.</li>
            <li>I am glad to have a close shave once again with it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>It has more than met my expectations.  </li>
            <li>The indicator light to let you know when you&#x27;re almost out of juice is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>But given legs have more surface area than a face...      </li>
            <li>But the shave is great, very close and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver for several years now and it has always worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Not as close as a razor, but pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, compared to some older shavers that I have had.</li>
            <li>I´ll prefer on dry because is faster and the best you don´t get any irritation or nothing like that.</li>
            <li>I find it works best for me with extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>design is elegant and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>My special thanks for Amazon for great deal.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to be as smooth as a blade, but it&#x27;s pretty good.    </li>
            <li>But since customer service from Discount Jungle was fantastic, we were able to return it and get another piece with no hassles.</li>
            <li>Oct 2008:  OK, I found a fantastic shaver.  </li>
            <li>She is just beginning to shave her legs, and I felt this would be a good choice, since she is not quite ready to use a razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but you have make sure you charge it the night before, because it looses power quickly.</li>
            <li>it shaves close, it doesn&#x27;t pinch or nick the skin, and it&#x27;s well-balanced making it easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>It was then easy to make the purchase.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to turn on and use and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty color for a shaver and the holder is nice and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>and I have always liked the consistent quality of Remington products.</li>
            <li>B001EJG10Y Remington WDF-7000 Smooth and Silky Womens Foil Shaver with Clean and Charge System]]I have used an electric shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li>THE WDF 6000 WORKS FINE</li>
            <li>Cleaning it is easy, and it has a light to indicate when the battery is dying.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s noisy, but easy to handle, comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>They wear out to quickly!   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It is noisy, but easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Cuts well and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and sits on its charger without burning out the battery.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>This prodcut is really working nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a comfortable size, portable, rechargable...</li>
            <li>moisturing\\&quot; gel on the market, every trick on the internet to get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>the Smooth and Silky wdf-6000 was the winner.  </li>
            <li>it is absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I had an earlier version of this model and it worked great but didn&#x27;t give as close of a shave, and it lasted forever -</li>
            <li>This shaver is light and easy-to-hold.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I get a close shave (almost as close as good old faithful)</li>
            <li>Quick, easy and thorough.  </li>
            <li>I love this product I recommend it very highly!</li>
            <li>but as long as I can shave my legs with my skin conditions - I am happy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle, easy to clean, and does provide a nice, smooth shave much more quickly than other razors used.</li>
            <li>Had an older Remington and was happy with it, so decided to upgrade when it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>You can clean it with the brush or under water.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it often, but have tried it in the shower and it worked great wet too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll shave my legs more often now because it is so much easier than using a blade with all the shaving cream, foam, or gel.</li>
            <li>So I cannot attest to the razor&#x27;s abilities for a full growth.  </li>
            <li>We had to pay our part of shipping charge which is not bad.     </li>
            <li>I love the many heads and versatility of the multiple heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it for my wife mostly because of high star ratings and the fact that it is dual voltage capable(220/110).</li>
            <li>This new one is very smooth with plenty of energy.  </li>
            <li>the best one ever they seem to have available only in foreign countries or not at all.</li>
            <li>Love my new razor.</li>
            <li>You can clean very fast your shaver an</li>
            <li>you really don&#x27;t like shaving in the shower, you are fine with having stubbly legs, and don&#x27;t mind taking a longer time to shave, then by all means buy this and have stubbly legs.</li>
            <li>Prior to that I used a Remington for many years which worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>This is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth every dollar I paid for it.</li>
            <li>This was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I replace mine 2-3 times more frequently than my husband does his.   </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a shaver that gives a smooth, quick shave, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I liked my first Remington Shaver so much, I decided to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li>Pros: low battery light, lightweight design, great shave, wet/dry, flip-top head for easy cleaning, charging stand has a place for the cleaning brush and takes up little counter space, travel case included.  </li>
            <li>I reviewed the products available and found that the Remington WDF - 6000 was highly rated.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t use a regular blade everyday, but my electric shaver works GREAT!</li>
            <li>No excuse now not to have smooth legs!</li>
            <li>At first it seems as though it doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.  </li>
            <li>The Remington WDF-6000 is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It gives a pretty close shave without leaving nicks/ cuts/ irritation.  </li>
            <li>Most definitely, this product&#x27;s strengths outweight its weaknesses.</li>
            <li>My legs are smooth and soft just like silk.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaver, I will never go back to the razor again.  </li>
            <li>It can wake the whole house up...but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>going through the suggested 2-3 weeks of daily shaving to allow my skin to adjust to the shaver, I have to say that I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been married 38 years</li>
            <li>This Remington works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the Remington Titanium shaver because I wasn&#x27;t interested in the cleaning system - it seems like overkill since all you need to do is rinse the cutters off with water after each use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Remington shavers for years, previously had a WDF-5000, and have always been very pleased with their performance.  </li>
            <li>I have been underwhelmed by past ladies electric shavers I&#x27;ve used, but this one is quite good.</li>
            <li>I used it dry for 3 days and was pleased with the job it did.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after my old electric shaver died and was amazed how quick I could shave my legs with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;First of all, the bikini trimmer does not lift up and away from the shaver, making it much less effective.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the wet shave feature yet, since I&#x27;ve been so happy with the dry results.</li>
            <li>It does not shave closely and requires many, many runs over the same area to trim half a hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I stuck with the Remington brand and look forward to years of convenient dry shaving!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice when you have to shave on short notice to wear shorts or a skirt, since it can be used either wet or dry, and it&#x27;s effective used either way.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, the Remington WDF-6000 is safe for someone with limited sensations under the arms (at least it has been for me).</li>
            <li>This electric razor will give you a close shave, it just takes to much of my time, I have to go over and over an area.</li>
            <li>After some years the battery just doesn&#x27;t hold much of a charge.  </li>
            <li>I really like this one....</li>
            <li>I have had this product for the past 2 years and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Very loud&lt;BR</li>
            <li>Of course in some spots I have to go over the area twice to get really close</li>
            <li>A VERY close shave.   </li>
            <li>Really like the shave of this shaver.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend it!</li>
            <li>it really can do.  </li>
            <li>REALLY HURT my armpits.</li>
            <li>so I dreaded shaving just as much as doing my taxes.  </li>
            <li>My biggest doubt was getting as smooth a shave with an electric razor as is supposedly possible with a disposable.  </li>
            <li>It provides a very close shave for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Oh yes, and the screen head has a pop up edge and a plastic comb cover that goes over the screen/pop up edge to take longer hairs to a short enough length to epilate or just to leave short - great for bikini</li>
            <li>She was ready to start shaving her legs, and I didn&#x27;t want her to cut herself on bladed shavers.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>found the reviews very helpful before I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very disapointed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that for this much money they can&#x27;t figure out how to put a pop up trimmer on this thing.</li>
            <li>Really??</li>
            <li>When you get this razor, keep in mind that Remington gives it a 30-day guarantee - so you can use it for a few weeks and make up your own mind about it.  </li>
            <li>If I get lazy about shaving my legs in the winter this shaver is good about mowing down the hair before I use a razor for the REALLY smooth shave!</li>
            <li>This razor works wonderfully, but I&#x27;d have to say the only down fall is how long the shave itself lasts.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It was highly recommended by the manufacturer that if you have limited sensation under the arms (due to mastectomy surgery) that you treat the foils and cutters with great care (no dropping, denting, and dinging) and replace the foils and cutters if they are damaged before continuing to use the shaver.</li>
            <li>The second one runs for about 40 mins after full charge.</li>
            <li>I am not real impressed with this product it does not shave close and leave your legs soft and smooth, I was hoping for a better product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver as a replacement for an older Remington ladies shaver.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver because its customer rating was so high.  </li>
            <li>Even wet, it&#x27;s comfortable to handle.</li>
            <li>It was not quite as close as a normal razor, but it was almost as close.</li>
            <li>To the touch, you could not tell the difference between a normal razor and this one.</li>
            <li>Almost as close as a normal razor&lt;BR</li>
            <li>&gt;Takes longer than a normal razor&lt;BR</li>
            <li>my wife loves her new razor.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have to buy new razors or worry about my skin freaking out from shaving.</li>
            <li>I get a close and smooth shave, but the hair is back the next day.</li>
            <li>VERY loud.</li>
            <li>While it IS very loud, the shave is quite close</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin, and with this shaver NO irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend their line of electric shavers for anyone with sensitive skin prone to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I like this enough to have bought another one once the first one died (upon being dropped on a tile floor)...</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned the ladies shaver industry has come a long way and this shaver proves it.</li>
            <li>Used wet (in the shower) or dry (as a touch up...or more)</li>
            <li>Nice razor, no more nicks!!</li>
            <li>Has sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use the regular razor and wants a close shave OR 2.</li>
            <li>It is giving clear shave.</li>
            <li>Loud, though.</li>
            <li>Yes, I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is loud.</li>
            <li>although if you do not have sensitive skin, I do not know if it would be needed.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I have Psoriasis and extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use the \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; Bic®, or Schick® or any of those razors for fear of bleeding to death.  </li>
            <li>I was very reserved about buying an electric shaver, especially considering it was $60, but</li>
            <li>Nothing compares to a regular razor and a real close shave -</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve tried every disposable razor and \\&quot;sensitive skin/</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Someone had made the comment that it was really loud...</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver as a replacement for my old Remington 3500 that I had for 6+years.  </li>
            <li>And, so far, the charge appears to hold for weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and shaving was a nightmare.  </li>
            <li>It gives a smooth cut without have to go over and over the same spot as with other Remington models.  </li>
            <li>this product is extremely easy to use, you can shave on dry or wet,</li>
            <li>Big improvement over an older model Remington I had.</li>
            <li>which is a bonus especially for someone of African-American decent with coily hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor but wish I had purchased it when it was only $29.99!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud like everyone mentioned, but no big whoop.  </li>
            <li>Only complain is that it is loud.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like any pubic hair at all, and it keeps it shaved completely smooth, everyday!!  </li>
            <li>Takes a little while to get used to an electric razor, but once you get the hang of it, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product that certainly lives up to its name I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone especially if you have a difficult time with shaving every day and becoming irritated or those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s speed relates to other razors, but it took me longer with this razor than it does with a normal disposable one.</li>
            <li>Using it wet or dry took much longer than a razor.  </li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair, and it didn&#x27;t shave it off evenly, it missed a lot.  </li>
            <li>With an regular razor I can usually get away with shaving every other day, but with an electric I have to shave every day if I want the smooth and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>One of the epilator heads is narrow and small for taking off hair anywhere delicate, and one that has three rotating heads to quickly and easily epilate larger areas like the legs.  </li>

            <li> It was a very good purchase.</li>
            <li> Mine, was a good experience!</li>
            <li> It does a great job under the arms and the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> but this razor is great.</li>
            <li> a Remington)was not all that great,</li>
            <li> just a great product.    </li>
            <li> If mama ain&#x27;t happy, ain&#x27;t nobody happy.  </li>

            <li> This is a great razor for women.  </li>
            <li> it comes in a very nice case.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> The results are better than any manual shaver and the best part is there are no knicks and unsightly cuts on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled!  </li>
            <li> My good one&#x27;s battery died and they tell me I cannot replace</li>
            <li> I&#x27;D RECOMMEND AND GOOD FOR GIFTING.</li>
            <li> This turns out to be a really good, close shave for legs/underarms.  </li>
            <li> As for the legs NO electric shaver has ever been as good as a razor.</li>
            <li> Shaves close and smooth and once you get your hair adjusted for shaving with an electric shaver and get used to using a shaver, it is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li> Also, the shaver I was replacing was a Remington, and I had loved it.  </li>
            <li> But as they promised once you did the shave would be good and close.    </li>
            <li> I figured if I was going to buy one it had better be good one, so I coughed up the dough and I am so happy I did.  </li>
            <li> Very handy , nice colors , nice shave.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is really nice, and does a good job shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver, fits in your hand nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice grip&lt;BR</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I got a good shaver</li>
            <li> I went with this one because it looks nice and it wasn&#x27;t the cheapest one.</li>
            <li> and she is thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Am happy with this item, arrived quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> so it is great for quick shaving any time you need it.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like I do, then this is the perfect product for you.  </li>
            <li> I did a search online to find the most popular women&#x27;s shaver and &lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> It was very smooth, with no pulling or scraping sensations.</li>
            <li> This product has very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> My legs are very smooth after shaving.  </li>
            <li> This one does seem to do a better job then most.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on Amazon of many razors before I decided which one to try.  </li>
            <li> Glad I chose this one, it does not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts around 45 mins, although I haven&#x27;t timed it to make sure.</li>
            <li> Based on user reviews, I purchased this product and love it.  </li>
            <li> In fact, this shaver did a better, actually a MUCH BETTER job shaving my underarms than a blade.  </li>
            <li> the Remington WDF-6000 the shave is actually better and closer, no stubble, no nicks, no bumps.  </li>
            <li> Better than others I have bought.</li>
            <li> It provides a nice smooth shave without any irritation.</li>
            <li> so pleased with this shaver</li>
            <li> I have owned many razors over the years.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have a close shave once again with it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> It has more than met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> The indicator light to let you know when you&#x27;re almost out of juice is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> But given legs have more surface area than a face...      </li>
            <li> But the shave is great, very close and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for several years now and it has always worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor, but pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Very nice, compared to some older shavers that I have had.</li>
            <li> I´ll prefer on dry because is faster and the best you don´t get any irritation or nothing like that.</li>
            <li> I find it works best for me with extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> design is elegant and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> My special thanks for Amazon for great deal.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to be as smooth as a blade, but it&#x27;s pretty good.    </li>
            <li> But since customer service from Discount Jungle was fantastic, we were able to return it and get another piece with no hassles.</li>
            <li> Oct 2008:  OK, I found a fantastic shaver.  </li>
            <li> She is just beginning to shave her legs, and I felt this would be a good choice, since she is not quite ready to use a razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but you have make sure you charge it the night before, because it looses power quickly.</li>
            <li> it shaves close, it doesn&#x27;t pinch or nick the skin, and it&#x27;s well-balanced making it easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> It was then easy to make the purchase.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to turn on and use and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty color for a shaver and the holder is nice and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> and I have always liked the consistent quality of Remington products.</li>
            <li> B001EJG10Y Remington WDF-7000 Smooth and Silky Womens Foil Shaver with Clean and Charge System]]I have used an electric shaver for many years.  </li>
            <li> THE WDF 6000 WORKS FINE</li>
            <li> Cleaning it is easy, and it has a light to indicate when the battery is dying.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s noisy, but easy to handle, comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> They wear out to quickly!   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It is noisy, but easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Cuts well and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and sits on its charger without burning out the battery.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> This prodcut is really working nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comfortable size, portable, rechargable...</li>
            <li> moisturing\\&quot; gel on the market, every trick on the internet to get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> the Smooth and Silky wdf-6000 was the winner.  </li>
            <li> it is absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of this model and it worked great but didn&#x27;t give as close of a shave, and it lasted forever -</li>
            <li> This shaver is light and easy-to-hold.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I get a close shave (almost as close as good old faithful)</li>
            <li> Quick, easy and thorough.  </li>
            <li> I love this product I recommend it very highly!</li>
            <li> but as long as I can shave my legs with my skin conditions - I am happy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle, easy to clean, and does provide a nice, smooth shave much more quickly than other razors used.</li>
            <li> Had an older Remington and was happy with it, so decided to upgrade when it was time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> You can clean it with the brush or under water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often, but have tried it in the shower and it worked great wet too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll shave my legs more often now because it is so much easier than using a blade with all the shaving cream, foam, or gel.</li>
            <li> So I cannot attest to the razor&#x27;s abilities for a full growth.  </li>
            <li> We had to pay our part of shipping charge which is not bad.     </li>
            <li> I love the many heads and versatility of the multiple heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife mostly because of high star ratings and the fact that it is dual voltage capable(220/110).</li>
            <li> This new one is very smooth with plenty of energy.  </li>
            <li> the best one ever they seem to have available only in foreign countries or not at all.</li>
            <li> Love my new razor.</li>
            <li> You can clean very fast your shaver an</li>
            <li> you really don&#x27;t like shaving in the shower, you are fine with having stubbly legs, and don&#x27;t mind taking a longer time to shave, then by all means buy this and have stubbly legs.</li>
            <li> Prior to that I used a Remington for many years which worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> This is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth every dollar I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I replace mine 2-3 times more frequently than my husband does his.   </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a shaver that gives a smooth, quick shave, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I liked my first Remington Shaver so much, I decided to purchase a new one.</li>
            <li> Pros: low battery light, lightweight design, great shave, wet/dry, flip-top head for easy cleaning, charging stand has a place for the cleaning brush and takes up little counter space, travel case included.  </li>
            <li> I reviewed the products available and found that the Remington WDF - 6000 was highly rated.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use a regular blade everyday, but my electric shaver works GREAT!</li>
            <li> No excuse now not to have smooth legs!</li>
            <li> At first it seems as though it doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.  </li>
            <li> The Remington WDF-6000 is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It gives a pretty close shave without leaving nicks/ cuts/ irritation.  </li>
            <li> Most definitely, this product&#x27;s strengths outweight its weaknesses.</li>
            <li> My legs are smooth and soft just like silk.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaver, I will never go back to the razor again.  </li>
            <li> It can wake the whole house up...but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> going through the suggested 2-3 weeks of daily shaving to allow my skin to adjust to the shaver, I have to say that I am extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been married 38 years</li>
            <li> This Remington works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the Remington Titanium shaver because I wasn&#x27;t interested in the cleaning system - it seems like overkill since all you need to do is rinse the cutters off with water after each use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington shavers for years, previously had a WDF-5000, and have always been very pleased with their performance.  </li>
            <li> I have been underwhelmed by past ladies electric shavers I&#x27;ve used, but this one is quite good.</li>
            <li> I used it dry for 3 days and was pleased with the job it did.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after my old electric shaver died and was amazed how quick I could shave my legs with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;First of all, the bikini trimmer does not lift up and away from the shaver, making it much less effective.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the wet shave feature yet, since I&#x27;ve been so happy with the dry results.</li>
            <li> It does not shave closely and requires many, many runs over the same area to trim half a hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I stuck with the Remington brand and look forward to years of convenient dry shaving!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice when you have to shave on short notice to wear shorts or a skirt, since it can be used either wet or dry, and it&#x27;s effective used either way.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, the Remington WDF-6000 is safe for someone with limited sensations under the arms (at least it has been for me).</li>
            <li> This electric razor will give you a close shave, it just takes to much of my time, I have to go over and over an area.</li>
            <li> After some years the battery just doesn&#x27;t hold much of a charge.  </li>
            <li> I really like this one....</li>
            <li> I have had this product for the past 2 years and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Very loud&lt;BR</li>
            <li> Of course in some spots I have to go over the area twice to get really close</li>
            <li> A VERY close shave.   </li>
            <li> Really like the shave of this shaver.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> it really can do.  </li>
            <li> REALLY HURT my armpits.</li>
            <li> so I dreaded shaving just as much as doing my taxes.  </li>
            <li> My biggest doubt was getting as smooth a shave with an electric razor as is supposedly possible with a disposable.  </li>
            <li> It provides a very close shave for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Oh yes, and the screen head has a pop up edge and a plastic comb cover that goes over the screen/pop up edge to take longer hairs to a short enough length to epilate or just to leave short - great for bikini</li>
            <li> She was ready to start shaving her legs, and I didn&#x27;t want her to cut herself on bladed shavers.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> found the reviews very helpful before I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very disapointed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that for this much money they can&#x27;t figure out how to put a pop up trimmer on this thing.</li>
            <li> Really??</li>
            <li> When you get this razor, keep in mind that Remington gives it a 30-day guarantee - so you can use it for a few weeks and make up your own mind about it.  </li>
            <li> If I get lazy about shaving my legs in the winter this shaver is good about mowing down the hair before I use a razor for the REALLY smooth shave!</li>
            <li> This razor works wonderfully, but I&#x27;d have to say the only down fall is how long the shave itself lasts.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It was highly recommended by the manufacturer that if you have limited sensation under the arms (due to mastectomy surgery) that you treat the foils and cutters with great care (no dropping, denting, and dinging) and replace the foils and cutters if they are damaged before continuing to use the shaver.</li>
            <li> The second one runs for about 40 mins after full charge.</li>
            <li> I am not real impressed with this product it does not shave close and leave your legs soft and smooth, I was hoping for a better product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as a replacement for an older Remington ladies shaver.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because its customer rating was so high.  </li>
            <li> Even wet, it&#x27;s comfortable to handle.</li>
            <li> It was not quite as close as a normal razor, but it was almost as close.</li>
            <li> To the touch, you could not tell the difference between a normal razor and this one.</li>
            <li> Almost as close as a normal razor&lt;BR</li>
            <li> &gt;Takes longer than a normal razor&lt;BR</li>
            <li> my wife loves her new razor.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have to buy new razors or worry about my skin freaking out from shaving.</li>
            <li> I get a close and smooth shave, but the hair is back the next day.</li>
            <li> VERY loud.</li>
            <li> While it IS very loud, the shave is quite close</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin, and with this shaver NO irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend their line of electric shavers for anyone with sensitive skin prone to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I like this enough to have bought another one once the first one died (upon being dropped on a tile floor)...</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned the ladies shaver industry has come a long way and this shaver proves it.</li>
            <li> Used wet (in the shower) or dry (as a touch up...or more)</li>
            <li> Nice razor, no more nicks!!</li>
            <li> Has sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use the regular razor and wants a close shave OR 2.</li>
            <li> It is giving clear shave.</li>
            <li> Loud, though.</li>
            <li> Yes, I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is loud.</li>
            <li> although if you do not have sensitive skin, I do not know if it would be needed.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I have Psoriasis and extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use the \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; Bic®, or Schick® or any of those razors for fear of bleeding to death.  </li>
            <li> I was very reserved about buying an electric shaver, especially considering it was $60, but</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to a regular razor and a real close shave -</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve tried every disposable razor and \\&quot;sensitive skin/</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Someone had made the comment that it was really loud...</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a replacement for my old Remington 3500 that I had for 6+years.  </li>
            <li> And, so far, the charge appears to hold for weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and shaving was a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> It gives a smooth cut without have to go over and over the same spot as with other Remington models.  </li>
            <li> this product is extremely easy to use, you can shave on dry or wet,</li>
            <li> Big improvement over an older model Remington I had.</li>
            <li> which is a bonus especially for someone of African-American decent with coily hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor but wish I had purchased it when it was only $29.99!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud like everyone mentioned, but no big whoop.  </li>
            <li> Only complain is that it is loud.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like any pubic hair at all, and it keeps it shaved completely smooth, everyday!!  </li>
            <li> Takes a little while to get used to an electric razor, but once you get the hang of it, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that certainly lives up to its name I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone especially if you have a difficult time with shaving every day and becoming irritated or those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s speed relates to other razors, but it took me longer with this razor than it does with a normal disposable one.</li>
            <li> Using it wet or dry took much longer than a razor.  </li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair, and it didn&#x27;t shave it off evenly, it missed a lot.  </li>
            <li> With an regular razor I can usually get away with shaving every other day, but with an electric I have to shave every day if I want the smooth and silky feeling.</li>
            <li> One of the epilator heads is narrow and small for taking off hair anywhere delicate, and one that has three rotating heads to quickly and easily epilate larger areas like the legs.  </li>
            <li> But with the absence of angry-looking razor bumps, I now have a smoother shave - and no pain/blood!  </li>
            <li> The only down side is like someone else wrote, it is rather loud, but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin, and normal razors would leave me with little red bumps, and a burning sensation, that lasted for a few days.</li>
            <li> I like how it cuts both short and long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not too terribly loud and only vibrates a little.</li>
            <li> Although there was difficulty due to a defective initial product, Discount Jungle went above and beyond to help me resolve it.  </li>
            <li> My only real complaint - the on/off button can get turned on too easily while packed, and run the shaver down</li>
            <li> Cons: a little loud.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge a long time as it says so I don&#x27;t have to keep it in the charger somewhere.  </li>
            <li> Has a long life after charging.</li>
            <li> Another quibble is the overly feminine color, but that&#x27;s minor.  </li>
            <li> wish i had known about it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> It has finally reached the point where I can&#x27;t get it closed at all, and I have to hold it together in order to shave.  </li>
            <li> Took me a long while, 2 months, to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> I use the Remington SDF-6000 dry, but it can be used in the shower and with shaving gels/cremes.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t shave my legs as close as a razor when I used it dry.</li>
            <li> You use this razor dry</li>
            <li> After trying everything from conventional razors to creams to waxing, this electric shaver is definitely the method of hair removal that I am sticking with.</li>
            <li> I have a toddler who will only bathe if I&#x27;m in the tub too, so shaving with a conventional razor</li>
            <li> She can use it wet or dry, and it is rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> It has lots of little tiny pieces inside that are difficult to get back in the right place, including little plastic things and tiny springs.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and thick hair</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have noticed is that it is a little loud.</li>
            <li> FORGET Remington - they can keep it and their bad rechargeable batteries : )</li>
            <li> With my blasted skin, that is important.  </li>
            <li> There was absolutely no irritation after I used it.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I still have a few red bumps from ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> If the hair is long, it takes a few passes to remove it all, but it&#x27;s easy on your skin, and it&#x27;s virtually impossible to cut yourself with it.  </li>
            <li> I turned to Remington after trying other electric shavers and found my match.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like pink!</li>
            <li> - I shave every other day</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading the reviews from other buyers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to find it a lot less painful that my first epilator the Epilady.  </li>
            <li> so she has to be very careful with razors.  </li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s as close as if I shave with a conventional razor.  </li>
            <li> I dreaded shaving with a conventional razor.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint - the wear on the heads and screens.  </li>
            <li> I agree that it&#x27;s loud, but that&#x27;s a very small price to pay!</li>
            <li> The battery runs down quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if that&#x27;s crucial for you then maybe look into a men&#x27;s shaver that pulls the hair up a bit before cutting it (not for sensitive skin though!), or stick with razors.  </li>
            <li> Holy cow this hurts!</li>
            <li> I have had other electric shavers in the past.</li>
            <li> But as the directions say it takes a few weeks for your skin to adjust to it</li>
            <li> I can shave everyday without irritation.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver for a few years, I would suggest giving this one a try.  </li>
            <li> , there are a few problems.</li>
            <li> I notice I may have to go over some spots a few times -</li>
            <li> Am I the only one that gets tired of cordless electric razors dying on cue?</li>
            <li> I have never owned an electric shaver before, but with summer here I wanted something I could shave with everyday.</li>
            <li> It does take a few days or weeks for your legs, hair and you  to get used to the electric shaver.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE HAS COMPLAINED FOR YEARS ABOUT OTHER ELECTRIC SHAVERS.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant in getting this shaver because from my past experience with the ladies shavers.  </li>
            <li> Who, like me, are a little too lazy when it comes to \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Since she is petite, it felt a little heavy, but she&#x27;ll definetly grow into it!</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace one that was less than a year old and just wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;cutting it\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble wearing a shirt!</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that I&#x27;m unable to replace the batteries when they no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m missing something, please enlighten me!  </li>
            <li> and I usually do from the knee-down, bikini line, underarms.  </li>
            <li> I live overseas and my apartment has a miniscule shower in which it is impossible to shave one&#x27;s legs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but hopefully that will mean it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> In my time, I have tried at least million ladies shavers.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing, especially for the cost.</li>
            <li> They were all red, and it did an awful job; I still had clearly visible stubble.</li>
            <li> Others have complained about the noise, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow.</li>
            <li> After surgery in 2004 and the resulting limited sensation under my arms, the small barber clipper was dangerous.</li>
            <li> Little difficult coming up On leg from ankles.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is the noise level.</li>
            <li> I just hold itunder rapidly running cold/warm water (never hot), shake off the excess water, dry the handle with a towel, unplug the base and place the shaver in the base to air dry.</li>
            <li> (I think my skin is just hyper-sensitive) but at least this razor doesn&#x27;t buzz them off!  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that it is not in stock and availability is not certain at this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disappointing and not worth .05, let alone the sales price.</li>
            <li> I have never used an electric shaver and was skeptical.</li>
            <li> But every time I ended up with nasty red razor bumps and painful razor burn that prevented me from shaving again for at least 4 days or else I&#x27;d be shaving off those bumps.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s useless</li>
            <li> Seriously, it hurt so bad.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> It also gives me nicks occassionally when I do awkward angular spots like armpits, backs of knees, and bikini line.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that it is VERY DIFFICULT to handle it while having to hold the on-button down.  </li>
            <li> The almost $60 price tag was scary, but it&#x27;s not regretted!</li>
            <li> I was shocked, with</li>
            <li> But we were disappointed because the battery always ran out after 5-10 mins.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!!  </li>
            <li> and i hated it</li>
            <li> This razor /shaver is one of the worst ever.</li>
            <li> This razor was horrible.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that as the battery dies I find it starts to nick me.</li>
            <li> using a a razor was so terrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Takes a little while to get used to an electric razor, but once you get the hang of it, it works pretty well. Don&#x27;t expect it to be as smooth as a blade, but it&#x27;s pretty good.    Loud, though.</li>
            <li> Holy cow this hurts! it scratches and nicks and drags and pulls. This razor /shaver is one of the worst ever. the best one ever they seem to have available only in foreign countries or not at all. My good one&#x27;s battery died and they tell me I cannot replace it.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this unless you are into pain and want to get ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver, fits in your hand nicely. It gives a smooth shave. I have been using this shaver for about a month now and i still don&#x27;t think it gives me a close shave like a razor would. It says it take about 3 weeks of shaving to get you hair used to it for the closeness. I get a close and smooth shave, but the hair is back the next day.</li>
            <li> I have had other electric shavers in the past. This one does seem to do a better job then most. It is noisy, but easy to clean. &lt;br /&gt;I still find using a blade in the shower alot faster in the mornings. This electric razor will give you a close shave, it just takes to much of my time, I have to go over and over an area.When you are out of the house by 6:30 AM every day, every minute counts.</li>
            <li> This is the best.  I can&#x27;t stop shaving my legs.  At first it seems as though it doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.  But as the directions say it takes a few weeks for your skin to adjust to it and now it&#x27;s as close as if I shave with a conventional razor.  I can shave everyday without irritation.  I would recommend this product to anyone especially if you have a difficult time with shaving every day and becoming irritated or those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace its predecessor.  After some years the battery just doesn&#x27;t hold much of a charge.  This new one is very smooth with plenty of energy.  It holds a charge for 2-3 weeks which makes it perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> This razor was horrible. It gave me razor burn on my armpits for 3 days after using it-I had trouble wearing a shirt! Yes, I do have sensitive skin but I have never had this happen before when shaving. &lt;br /&gt;Stay away-far away from this razor!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as a replacement for an older Remington ladies shaver.  I really like this one....it shaves close, it doesn&#x27;t pinch or nick the skin, and it&#x27;s well-balanced making it easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> When searching for a ladies razor for my wife. I reviewed the products available and found that the Remington WDF - 6000 was highly rated.  It was then easy to make the purchase.  Amazon is always on my list when buying on the net.  The Product was as described and the purchase experience was perfect.  The best part is that my wife is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. Does not give a close shave. I practically have to rub my skin off to try to get a closer shave. Feels like it pulls the hair while trying to shave.</li>
            <li> Whether you have male or female skin, this shaver is terrific. I&#x27;ve been using them for years. My only gripe is that I&#x27;m unable to replace the batteries when they no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for the past 2 years and am very satisfied with it. It was a very good purchase.</li>
            <li> Finally a woman&#x27;s razor that actually provides a close shave!! It took no time at all for my legs to get used to it.  It holds a charge a long time as it says so I don&#x27;t have to keep it in the charger somewhere.  The only down side is like someone else wrote, it is rather loud, but you get used to it. Nice razor, no more nicks!!</li>
            <li> MY WIFE HAS COMPLAINED FOR YEARS ABOUT OTHER ELECTRIC SHAVERS.  THE WDF 6000 WORKS FINE AND SHE ACTUALLY SAYS SHE LOVES HOW IT WORKS.  I&#x27;D RECOMMEND AND GOOD FOR GIFTING.</li>
            <li> Had an older Remington and was happy with it, so decided to upgrade when it was time for a new one.  Am happy with this item, arrived quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> The Remington WDF-6000 is exactly what I wanted. It was a Christmas gift from my husband.  I read reviews on Amazon of many razors before I decided which one to try.  Glad I chose this one, it does not disappoint.  No excuse now not to have smooth legs!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver for a few years, I would suggest giving this one a try.  The results are better than any manual shaver and the best part is there are no knicks and unsightly cuts on my legs.  I can use this shaver in the shower the same as I did with my manual shaver.  It is easy to clean.  I am so glad I bought it.  I would never go back to a manual shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll shave my legs more often now because it is so much easier than using a blade with all the shaving cream, foam, or gel. This is a really pretty color for a shaver and the holder is nice and unobtrusive. I like that it holds the cleaning brush too. You can clean it with the brush or under water. It is easy to turn on and use and gives a close shave. It&#x27;s also not too terribly loud and only vibrates a little. Very nice, compared to some older shavers that I have had. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like I do, then this is the perfect product for you.  It gives a pretty close shave without leaving nicks/ cuts/ irritation.  After trying everything from conventional razors to creams to waxing, this electric shaver is definitely the method of hair removal that I am sticking with. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.  I agree that it&#x27;s loud, but that&#x27;s a very small price to pay!</li>
            <li> The Remington WDF-6000, like any product, has it&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses. Most definitely, this product&#x27;s strengths outweight its weaknesses. &lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, and normal razors would leave me with little red bumps, and a burning sensation, that lasted for a few days. After years of wearing pants because of this problem, I tried this razor as a last resort. It worked wonderfully. I used it in the shower with a soap lather. It was not quite as close as a normal razor, but it was almost as close. To the touch, you could not tell the difference between a normal razor and this one. It was very smooth, with no pulling or scraping sensations. There was absolutely no irritation after I used it. Cleaning it is easy, and it has a light to indicate when the battery is dying. The battery lasts around 45 mins, although I haven&#x27;t timed it to make sure. &lt;br /&gt;but, there are a few problems. It&#x27;s slow. I&#x27;ve never had an electric razor before, so I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s speed relates to other razors, but it took me longer with this razor than it does with a normal disposable one. It is loud. VERY loud. So prepare for that. &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product... although if you do not have sensitive skin, I do not know if it would be needed.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;BR&gt;No irritation&lt;BR&gt;Nice grip&lt;BR&gt;Lights for battery charge - turns red when needs to be recharged&lt;BR&gt;Easy to clean&lt;BR&gt;Easy to charge overnight&lt;BR&gt;Smooth&lt;BR&gt;Almost as close as a normal razor&lt;BR&gt;Doesn&#x27;t miss hairs&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;BR&gt;Very loud&lt;BR&gt;Takes longer than a normal razor&lt;BR&gt;Not quite as close</li>
            <li> I live overseas and my apartment has a miniscule shower in which it is impossible to shave one&#x27;s legs.  I have never used an electric shaver and was skeptical. Based on user reviews, I purchased this product and love it.  While it IS very loud, the shave is quite close and I can now shave my legs while watching tv, etc.  I highly recommend this razor but wish I had purchased it when it was only $29.99!</li>
            <li> In my time, I have tried at least million ladies shavers.  After years of confiscating my husbands&#x27; electric shaver, I finally found a ladies&#x27; that works as well as the mens&#x27;.  I have Psoriasis and extremely sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t use the \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; Bic®, or Schick® or any of those razors for fear of bleeding to death.  I was a little hesitant in getting this shaver because from my past experience with the ladies shavers.  As far as I am concerned the ladies shaver industry has come a long way and this shaver proves it. After using this shaver for 4 weeks, I have no complaints.  I get a close shave (almost as close as good old faithful) Of course in some spots I have to go over the area twice to get really close but hey that beat the heck out of bleeding to death. There is absolutely no irritation.  With my blasted skin, that is important.  I TOTALLY RECOMMEND this shaver to any of you ladies out there who: 1. Has sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use the regular razor and wants a close shave OR 2. Who, like me, are a little too lazy when it comes to \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I like this enough to have bought another one once the first one died (upon being dropped on a tile floor)... but the battery is not sufficient for shaving my legs all the way up. I can get up to my mid thighs done and then it croaks. The worst part is that as the battery dies I find it starts to nick me. It also gives me nicks occassionally when I do awkward angular spots like armpits, backs of knees, and bikini line. I like how it cuts both short and long hair. Big improvement over an older model Remington I had.</li>
            <li> This turns out to be a really good, close shave for legs/underarms.  It&#x27;s a little expensive, but hopefully that will mean it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> What a great shaver!  I was very reserved about buying an electric shaver, especially considering it was $60, but using a a razor was so terrible I found it preferrable to not to shave at all. I figured if I was going to buy one it had better be good one, so I coughed up the dough and I am so happy I did.  A VERY close shave.   In fact, this shaver did a better, actually a MUCH BETTER job shaving my underarms than a blade.  With a blade there was always nicks and bumps, and always seemed to be the slightest bit of stubble even if I carved the heck out of my underarms.  I was shocked, with the Remington WDF-6000 the shave is actually better and closer, no stubble, no nicks, no bumps.  I am thrilled!  With my legs, definetly as close as a blade, just no itchy bumps. Hooray!   I can even shave my bikini area now.  I tried it once before with a blade and was in anguish for days.  It&#x27;s loud like everyone mentioned, but no big whoop.  I love this product I recommend it very highly!</li>
            <li> Really like the shave of this shaver. Has a long life after charging. Cuts well and is comfortable to hold. Better than others I have bought. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love my new razor. Nothing compares to a regular razor and a real close shave - but if you have medical issues with your skin - bumps, etc., this razor does not cut your skin, does not irritate your skin. and does do the job. I notice I may have to go over some spots a few times - but as long as I can shave my legs with my skin conditions - I am happy.</li>
            <li> I have had several Remington razors and I have always liked the consistent quality of Remington products.</li>
            <li> This shaver does an excellent job on underarms. I have VERY sensitive skin, and with this shaver NO irritation whatsoever. My last shaver at the end of it&#x27;s life started to pull the hair out in spots, with this one NO pulling at all! As for the legs NO electric shaver has ever been as good as a razor. If I get lazy about shaving my legs in the winter this shaver is good about mowing down the hair before I use a razor for the REALLY smooth shave!</li>
            <li> this product is extremely easy to use, you can shave on dry or wet, I´ll prefer on dry because is faster and the best you don´t get any irritation or nothing like that. You can clean very fast your shaver an it comes in a very nice case. I truly recommended it to everybody.</li>
            <li> For reason that I won&#x27;t go into here, I can no longer use strait edge razors.  I turned to Remington after trying other electric shavers and found my match.  This is well worth the money.  Shaves close and smooth and once you get your hair adjusted for shaving with an electric shaver and get used to using a shaver, it is the best I have found.  I highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> I liked my first Remington Shaver so much, I decided to purchase a new one. It provides a nice smooth shave without any irritation. Easy to clean and sits on its charger without burning out the battery.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my neice&#x27;s 12th birthday.  She is just beginning to shave her legs, and I felt this would be a good choice, since she is not quite ready to use a razor. She can use it wet or dry, and it is rechargeable.  Since she is petite, it felt a little heavy, but she&#x27;ll definetly grow into it!</li>
            <li> Disappointing, especially for the cost. The battery runs down quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Initially would not recharge then seemed to gain a second life. Now it will not charge at all.&lt;br /&gt;If I could return or exchange at this point I would.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!  This is a fantastic product.  I used it dry for 3 days and was pleased with the job it did.  Not as close as a razor, but pretty good.  It does a great job under the arms and the bikini area.  No irritation at all!!!  It wasn&#x27;t until I tried it with shaving cream and water that I found out what a close shave it really can do.  My legs are smooth and soft just like silk.  Very similar to the same closeness you get from a razor...with out the cuts, nicks and irritation.  I love this shaver, I will never go back to the razor again.  The only bad thing about it is the noise level. It can wake the whole house up...but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I was seeking an electric shaver to use for shaving my underarm area.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Razors were out of the question for me in that area because of the resulting razor bumps from ingrown hairs. Hair removal cremes irritated my skin. In the past, I used a small barber clipper (an edger) and was pleased with the results. After surgery in 2004 and the resulting limited sensation under my arms, the small barber clipper was dangerous. I removed a couple of layers of skin while shaving my underarms post surgery and ended up on oral antibiotic treatment for a week.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The medical staff recommended an electric shaver, but they could not recommend a brand. Research and an e-mail to Remington helped me decide to purchase the Remington WDF 6000 in April 2005.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After going through the suggested 2-3 weeks of daily shaving to allow my skin to adjust to the shaver, I have to say that I am extremely pleased with the results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s noisy, but easy to handle, comfortable to hold and it shaves close (after the suggested break in period) which is a bonus especially for someone of African-American decent with coily hair. Most importantly, the Remington WDF-6000 is safe for someone with limited sensations under the arms (at least it has been for me). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was highly recommended by the manufacturer that if you have limited sensation under the arms (due to mastectomy surgery) that you treat the foils and cutters with great care (no dropping, denting, and dinging) and replace the foils and cutters if they are damaged before continuing to use the shaver. Using damaged foils or cutter can cause injury. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased with this shaver and I highly recommend it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth every dollar I paid for it. I even use it to shave my legs now. I use the Remington SDF-6000 dry, but it can be used in the shower and with shaving gels/cremes. Even wet, it&#x27;s comfortable to handle. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Clean up is a breeze. I just hold itunder rapidly running cold/warm water (never hot), shake off the excess water, dry the handle with a towel, unplug the base and place the shaver in the base to air dry. A cleaning brush comes with the unit.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t shave my legs as close as a razor when I used it dry. Using it wet or dry took much longer than a razor.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It REALLY HURT my armpits. They were all red, and it did an awful job; I still had clearly visible stubble. Seriously, it hurt so bad.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you really don&#x27;t like shaving in the shower, you are fine with having stubbly legs, and don&#x27;t mind taking a longer time to shave, then by all means buy this and have stubbly legs. Just don&#x27;t use it on your armpits.</li>
            <li> I have owned many razors over the years. In fact my last razor was a Remington and i hated it but this razor is great. The cut is the best i have seen for a Remington. It gives a smooth cut without have to go over and over the same spot as with other Remington models.  This is the best razor i have owned yet. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> This is not a quality razor. It does not shave closely and requires many, many runs over the same area to trim half a hair. It&#x27;s very disappointing and not worth .05, let alone the sales price.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001EJG10Y Remington WDF-7000 Smooth and Silky Womens Foil Shaver with Clean and Charge System]]I have used an electric shaver for many years.  The shaver I had which recently stopped working (not a Remington)was not all that great, but it was a gift so I struggled with it -- didn&#x27;t cut closely and took forever to do the job.  Prior to that I used a Remington for many years which worked just fine.  Now this newest one seems to be comparable.  I am glad to have a close shave once again with it.</li>
            <li> This prodcut is really working nice. I too buy this on-line for 29.99$. This product has very smooth shave. I highly recommend this product. It is giving clear shave. My special thanks for Amazon for great deal.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been married 38 years and I have been through COUNTLESS discourses regarding shaved legs.  Something like, \\&quot;can&#x27;t wear shorts today I haven&#x27;t shaved my legs!\\&quot;.  Those days are now gone.  Used wet (in the shower) or dry (as a touch up...or more) my wife loves her new razor.  I only wish I had bought it for her so I could get the credit.  It&#x27;s a comfortable size, portable, rechargable...just a great product.    What about the price?  Doesn&#x27;t matter.  If mama ain&#x27;t happy, ain&#x27;t nobody happy.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> it works great for underarms and legs.  I don&#x27;t like any pubic hair at all, and it keeps it shaved completely smooth, everyday!!  great razor!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife mostly because of high star ratings and the fact that it is dual voltage capable(220/110). But we were disappointed because the battery always ran out after 5-10 mins. But since customer service from Discount Jungle was fantastic, we were able to return it and get another piece with no hassles. We had to pay our part of shipping charge which is not bad.     The second one runs for about 40 mins after full charge. My wife is fairly happy with the product. Only complain is that it is loud.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shaver.  Bought it to replace one that was less than a year old and just wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;cutting it\\&quot;.  This shaver has two titanium heads and works like a dream.  Quick, easy and thorough.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair, and it didn&#x27;t shave it off evenly, it missed a lot.  The worst part is that it is VERY DIFFICULT to handle it while having to hold the on-button down.  They need a on/off switch!  It would shave better if it did, because you wouldn&#x27;t have to hold your hand in an uncomfortable postion, with your thumb not staying on the button when you needed it to.</li>
            <li> Very handy , nice colors , nice shave.  Little difficult coming up On leg from ankles.</li>
            <li> Although there was difficulty due to a defective initial product, Discount Jungle went above and beyond to help me resolve it.  The replacement item arrived, works well, and problem solved!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington shavers for years, previously had a WDF-5000, and have always been very pleased with their performance.  This one cuts even closer than the last shaver I had, and causes no skin irritation.  I&#x27;d highly recommend their line of electric shavers for anyone with sensitive skin prone to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve tried every disposable razor and \\&quot;sensitive skin/moisturing\\&quot; gel on the market, every trick on the internet to get a smooth shave.  But every time I ended up with nasty red razor bumps and painful razor burn that prevented me from shaving again for at least 4 days or else I&#x27;d be shaving off those bumps.  Ouch!  It got so I dreaded shaving just as much as doing my taxes.  Finally I was at the point of \\&quot;what have I got to lose?\\&quot; and bought this razor.  Now I can only say, \\&quot;What took me so long????\\&quot;  Now I can shave EVERY NIGHT and I actually look forward to it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have rather coarse hair but the 6000 makes short work of it.  My biggest doubt was getting as smooth a shave with an electric razor as is supposedly possible with a disposable.  But with the absence of angry-looking razor bumps, I now have a smoother shave - and no pain/blood!  I still have a few red bumps from ingrown hairs (I think my skin is just hyper-sensitive) but at least this razor doesn&#x27;t buzz them off!  I haven&#x27;t tried the wet shave feature yet, since I&#x27;ve been so happy with the dry results. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only cons that I can think of is the rather short battery life (about 2 shaves) and the fact that you can&#x27;t attach a cord to it and use it plugged in.  So if the battery dies when you&#x27;ve still got some shaving to do, you&#x27;re just SOL.  If I&#x27;m missing something, please enlighten me!  Others have complained about the noise, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Another quibble is the overly feminine color, but that&#x27;s minor.  I just don&#x27;t like pink! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros are ease of use - to hold onto, cleaning, storage in its nifty cradle. The almost $60 price tag was scary, but it&#x27;s not regretted! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I did a search online to find the most popular women&#x27;s shaver and &lt;br /&gt;and the Smooth and Silky wdf-6000 was the winner.  I have to agree.  It has more than met my expectations.  It provides a very close shave for an electric razor.  I find it works best for me with extremely dry skin.  I dreaded shaving with a conventional razor.  Now I shave my legs every day.  It is very convenient.  I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I NEVER even dreamed I could get this close of a shave with an electric razor.  I read the reviews and determined that this shaver would give me the closest shave of all the electrics, but I resigned myself to the fact that even the closest of electric shaves would leave me with stubble.  Boy was I wrong!!  This electric razors shaves as close as any blade I&#x27;ve ever used.  Both of my daughters have borrowed it and have now asked for one for their birthday.  I have sent the link to every female member of my extended family!  If it ever breaks, I&#x27;m buying another one just like it!</li>
            <li> Am I the only one that gets tired of cordless electric razors dying on cue? At one year - poof! I called Remington and they said the battery is only supposed to last a year. I have had every generation of this Remington.  I&#x27;m trying another brand this time - maybe the Panasonic Close Curves.  If I do, I&#x27;ll edit this review as to the outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT Oct 2008:  OK, I found a fantastic shaver.  I bought the Panasonic ES2067W Wet/Dry Epiglide Ultra Epilator for $99.  It has a regular head with a screen for shaving close, and two epilator heads.  One of the epilator heads is narrow and small for taking off hair anywhere delicate, and one that has three rotating heads to quickly and easily epilate larger areas like the legs.  Oh yes, and the screen head has a pop up edge and a plastic comb cover that goes over the screen/pop up edge to take longer hairs to a short enough length to epilate or just to leave short - great for bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to find it a lot less painful that my first epilator the Epilady.  I love the many heads and versatility of the multiple heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is elegant and easy to hold.  FORGET Remington - they can keep it and their bad rechargeable batteries : )</li>
            <li> I have never owned an electric shaver before, but with summer here I wanted something I could shave with everyday. I have sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use a regular blade everyday, but my electric shaver works GREAT! I wanted to make sure that I got a good shaver so I read all the reviews - I decided that everyone will have a different experience! Mine, was a good experience! I went with this one because it looks nice and it wasn&#x27;t the cheapest one. It does take a few days or weeks for your legs, hair and you  to get used to the electric shaver. I have had my shaver now for a week and I use it everyday. The shave gets smoother each time I use it. Someone had made the comment that it was really loud...it&#x27;s not any louder than my husbands shaver.</li>
            <li> Have used versions of this shaver for years.  My only real complaint - the on/off button can get turned on too easily while packed, and run the shaver down so it&#x27;s useless (this happened to me on one trip where I didn&#x27;t pack the recharger, thinking I wouldn&#x27;t need it).</li>
            <li> i have already written a review on this item.  it is absolutely fantastic.  wish i had known about it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> This is hands-down the best women&#x27;s shaver on the market, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Pros: low battery light, lightweight design, great shave, wet/dry, flip-top head for easy cleaning, charging stand has a place for the cleaning brush and takes up little counter space, travel case included.  Cons: a little loud.  I had an earlier version of this model and it worked great but didn&#x27;t give as close of a shave, and it lasted forever - I had to give it away!  This was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and myself last Christmas.  She was ready to start shaving her legs, and I didn&#x27;t want her to cut herself on bladed shavers.  This Remington works pretty well.  If the hair is long, it takes a few passes to remove it all, but it&#x27;s easy on your skin, and it&#x27;s virtually impossible to cut yourself with it.  It&#x27;s nice when you have to shave on short notice to wear shorts or a skirt, since it can be used either wet or dry, and it&#x27;s effective used either way.  I have been underwhelmed by past ladies electric shavers I&#x27;ve used, but this one is quite good.</li>
            <li> I have a toddler who will only bathe if I&#x27;m in the tub too, so shaving with a conventional razor is not an option for the time being.  I bought this shaver as a replacement for my old Remington 3500 that I had for 6+years.  It&#x27;s great!  This shaver is light and easy-to-hold.  I have very sensitive skin and thick hair and I have no problems, I just shave and put some lotion on after.  If you&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before, it takes some getting used to, especially around curvy areas.  It won&#x27;t be as close as a razor-blade shave, so if that&#x27;s crucial for you then maybe look into a men&#x27;s shaver that pulls the hair up a bit before cutting it (not for sensitive skin though!), or stick with razors.  I almost bought a ladies shaver made by Braun (LS5500) until I found out that it only had 1 row of cutters instead of 2 like Remington&#x27;s.  I didn&#x27;t get the Remington Titanium shaver because I wasn&#x27;t interested in the cleaning system - it seems like overkill since all you need to do is rinse the cutters off with water after each use.  I haven&#x27;t made the battery run out yet - I shave every other day and I usually do from the knee-down, bikini line, underarms.  The indicator light to let you know when you&#x27;re almost out of juice is a nice feature.  When you get this razor, keep in mind that Remington gives it a 30-day guarantee - so you can use it for a few weeks and make up your own mind about it.  I&#x27;m glad I stuck with the Remington brand and look forward to years of convenient dry shaving!</li>
            <li> I bought this after my old electric shaver died and was amazed how quick I could shave my legs with this shaver.  My legs are very smooth after shaving.  Works well under my arms, too.  If you&#x27;re looking for a shaver that gives a smooth, quick shave, I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but you have make sure you charge it the night before, because it looses power quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading the reviews from other buyers.  While it took approximately 2 weeks to get the smooth shave I was seeking [the information contained within the packaging advises to expect this], this razor is wonderful. It is easy to handle, easy to clean, and does provide a nice, smooth shave much more quickly than other razors used. **Note: I have had electrolysis on my legs, and needed a razor for those hairs that still continue to grow.  So I cannot attest to the razor&#x27;s abilities for a full growth.  And, so far, the charge appears to hold for weeks.  I would absolutely recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Everyone woman should have one of these or one similar!  I have sensitive skin and shaving was a nightmare.  I don&#x27;t have to use shaving gel now and I don&#x27;t have to shave in the shower which saves money on the utilities bills.  I also don&#x27;t have to buy new razors or worry about my skin freaking out from shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor for women.  I have ben using it for over a year now to shave my legs.  I never worry about cuts anymore.  You use this razor dry so it is great for quick shaving any time you need it.  My mother is on blood thinners so she has to be very careful with razors.  I gave her this shaver for Christmas and she is thrilled.  Every woman needs one of these.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that certainly lives up to its name I have not been disappointed. The only complaint I have noticed is that it is a little loud. &lt;br /&gt;I found the reviews very helpful before I made this purchase. &lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because its customer rating was so high.  Also, the shaver I was replacing was a Remington, and I had loved it.  I&#x27;ve been very disapointed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;First of all, the bikini trimmer does not lift up and away from the shaver, making it much less effective.  Second, it did not shave as close as the cheaper Remington I replaced.  But the big disapointment has been that it FALLS APART WHILE I AM SHAVING on a regular basis.  It has lots of little tiny pieces inside that are difficult to get back in the right place, including little plastic things and tiny springs.  It has finally reached the point where I can&#x27;t get it closed at all, and I have to hold it together in order to shave.  I am going to get another shaver today, and it&#x27;s not going to be this one.</li>
            <li> This razor works wonderfully, but I&#x27;d have to say the only down fall is how long the shave itself lasts.  With an regular razor I can usually get away with shaving every other day, but with an electric I have to shave every day if I want the smooth and silky feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful shaver.  Took me a long while, 2 months, to get used to it.  But as they promised once you did the shave would be good and close.    My only complaint - the wear on the heads and screens.  They wear out to quickly!   I replace mine 2-3 times more frequently than my husband does his.   But given legs have more surface area than a face...      I&#x27;d buy this again!  Or maybe the newer titanium model.</li>
            <li> I am not real impressed with this product it does not shave close and leave your legs soft and smooth, I was hoping for a better product.</li>
            <li> This shaver is really nice, and does a good job shaving my legs. I don&#x27;t use it often, but have tried it in the shower and it worked great wet too. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that for this much money they can&#x27;t figure out how to put a pop up trimmer on this thing. Really?? But the shave is great, very close and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for several years now and it has always worked perfectly.  I was disappointed to find that it is not in stock and availability is not certain at this time.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  I would buy another one if I could find it.  Hopefully Remington will make it available soon!!!!</li>
