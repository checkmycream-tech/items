            <li>Nice box</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it does not work as well for my own hair.</li>
            <li>Another nice feature are the bristles on the brush.  </li>
            <li>RECEIVED THIS item in Exchange FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW.</li>

            <li>The fun colors are great for her.</li>
            <li>I got the Detangling Hair Brush from SH&amp;SH in hopes that the compact design, the mirror, and colorful bristles would win her over.  </li>

            <li>Brush is just ok.</li>
            <li>Works better as a child&#x27;s brush.</li>
            <li>bristles are so cute and funky.</li>
            <li>That’s why I am so fortunate to be chosen to honestly review this product based on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will still not brush her hair with it, she cries more with this brush than my others)</li>
            <li>but I had to tell you how much I love this brush.</li>

            <li>I have already told many others to order this brush</li>
            <li>and i plan on buying three more</li>
            <li>but says  the 8.98 is better.</li>
            <li>I guess that is why so many reviewers commented on how it is in their purses.  </li>

            <li>This brush works so much better</li>
            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>I used this brush and was able to use it without pulling my hair when brushing through the tangles.</li>
            <li>It is a smaller brush, perfect for a child&#x27;s hand and hair.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to have gotten it at a promo price to be able to review it.</li>

            <li>I would buy this brush again if I needed to. :)</li>
            <li>I feel this does better in shorter hair because it seems to work better</li>
            <li>I think it is okay.</li>
            <li>, mostly I think cause I had never heard of the maker before.</li>
            <li>And when my daughter brushes her hair at night she is able to get it all the way through her hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I gave this brush a try.</li>
            <li>They love the colors and the mirror even though there is one in the bathroom.</li>

            <li>This brush is great so far!!  </li>
            <li>Very cute and fun detangling brush.  </li>
            <li>brush is just the perfect size to take a long and the colors are</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush that has a couple of cool features.  </li>
            <li>Worked pretty good, but still pulled out a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>This brush makes it SO easy and PAIN FREE!</li>
            <li>After washing it I went back to my own hair and use it every time I walk in the bathroom as it makes my hair feel great.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, doesn&#x27;t work  any better than a $1.99 brush from WalMart.</li>
            <li>Makes brushing a child&#x27;s hair go a lot more smoothly.</li>
            <li>Focusing on the usage of the brush my wife has naturally straight hair but its a PAIN to comb it out after a shower even using good conditioner.</li>
            <li>The design is very colorful and cute.</li>
            <li>but with brush and little water all was great and was good size to put away in her bag</li>
            <li>She uses this brush in the shower and when she gets out its quick and easy to do her hair because NO TANGLES!</li>
            <li>and it slid easily through her hair.</li>
            <li>Tangles easily.</li>
            <li>My daughter gets tangled hair easily.  </li>
            <li>The brush is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the hair out of the brush is also easy to do.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much I bought two more.  </li>
            <li>but my kids hair is curly and gets natted easy and the brush doesnt seem to do the work.</li>
            <li>it tangles easy.</li>
            <li>Ok there is nothing Great about this Comb its actually Garbage.  </li>
            <li>It does a very good job on long damaged hair like mine.</li>
            <li>First of all, for the size of this brush it does amazing work.</li>
            <li>My 6yo has fine hair that easily gets tangled.  </li>
            <li>As a father of three beautiful girls, brushing through tangled hair is a constant nightmare.</li>
            <li>super cute and easy to detanle hair  </li>
            <li>have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>I got this for my mother, who has brittle fine hair but tends to tangle.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is that it removes tangles, and I have less hair loss.</li>
            <li>This brush is fine for detangling hair.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I won&#x27;t need to do this as I really enjoy the brush!</li>
            <li>It is a very attractive little brush</li>
            <li>one complaint, the bright bristle colors are great</li>
            <li>While this brush is fun and does do the trick, it was not the magic detangler I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>If you click on the comments below, the company offered to send me another brush, free of charge.  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed I even called a few of my friends to tell them about this brush.</li>
            <li>week later it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t available colorized for boys.</li>
            <li>It has a compact design so it can easily fit in almost any purse and not take up all the room.</li>
            <li>Because the size is so manageable, the brush will fit into a purse or backpack.</li>
            <li>I love the colorful bristles ad</li>
            <li>reveiw free</li>
            <li>That said, it is a fantastic detangler for my daughter.</li>
            <li>: I received a sample for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.</li>
            <li>Price: $28.00 Price: $8.98 Free Shipping for Prime Members</li>
            <li>and I am doing a public service (you&#x27;re welcome)</li>
            <li>Got the brush free...</li>
            <li>The back of the brush has a mirror on it, which is great for checking your make-up or hair after you are done brushing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*product received free or at a discount in exchange for my review</li>
            <li>But after just one use I realized it fit my hand</li>
            <li>I had originally gone online to buy my favorite brush, the Cricket Static Free Fast Flo brush because Ulta had been out when I went to the store.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it one star though, because its pretty and cute, so my 5 year old daughter loved it and decided it was her</li>
            <li>My girls thought it was adorable so much so that they was willing to brush their own hair without me even asking.</li>
            <li>The fun colours means it&#x27;s good fun and would make an excellent present for a teenage girl.  </li>
            <li>Its so colorful!</li>
            <li>GREAT, cute little brush.</li>
            <li>I very rarely give a full 5 stars..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute and pretty</li>
            <li>They were true to their word.  </li>
            <li>One of my daughters favorite brushes because it gets the tangles out without pulling much at all.</li>
            <li>now, this brush doesn&#x27;t pull and I don&#x27;t get the brush full of hair after using.</li>
            <li>Also, because the handle is short and the roundness of the brush head, you get a good massage for your scalp when you brush.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the 8.00 ones on here, this handle is way to short, this pulls my hair and grandson</li>
            <li>The brush is good - smaller than I thought, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it had a full size handle.</li>
            <li>The size is just right to fit inside my purse.</li>
            <li>I came on here to give it one more star, mainly because the company does seem to care a lot.  </li>
            <li>Fun bright colors and mirror on the back of the brush.</li>
            <li>The mirror side also helps when we are quick on the go looks</li>
            <li>I love how brushing her hair is almost painless now, this is an Amazing product and would recommend it to anyone who has hard to detangle hair:-)</li>
            <li>I was given this product at a deep discount to review and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice shine and soft touch to the hair and easy enough to hold so my three year old daughter can easily brush her own hair.</li>
            <li>I was attracted to the cute colors and good reviews, but it is really small.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush, works really well on my natural hair, no pulls or snags!!!!</li>
            <li>This brush is awesome and not only does it keep the frizz down for me, but I haven&#x27;t experienced a single incident of having to break off ends.</li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me review this product!!</li>
            <li>I love this dress its so adorable and I love the fact it has a small mirror</li>
            <li>I was amazed how fast and pain free</li>
            <li>I took a look at how you would redeem this, and it looks very hassle free.  </li>
            <li>This is a great brush, especially on wet hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still useful.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen the price swings others have mentioned, but at 65% off, well worth it.</li>
            <li>This brush is medium sized and colorful.</li>
            <li>I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying.</li>
            <li>The mirror at the back is also a nice touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bristles are colorful and squiggly.</li>
            <li>She also loves the fun design and colors.</li>
            <li>my girl just love to brush her hair with it super cute and has a little mirror on back really cute!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It went right though</li>
            <li>I can even brush my hair right after showering without fear of all my hair breaking off.</li>
            <li>I got the brush in and put it to the test right away.</li>
            <li>This brush went right through it , didnt catch one tangle</li>
            <li>, it did the job great without lots of agony , it glides through the tangles with very little effort .&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush is the best wet dry brush.  </li>
            <li>I love that the rubber bristles are waved so as not to catch big sections in each one but to work together to make tangles come out quickly.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing we no longer have to fight with her to brush her hair and  the little mirror on the other side is a great touch~~~</li>
            <li>so my wife and daughters each have their own!&lt;br /&gt;Incredible pricing and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery as well.</li>
            <li>It very gently eases through her curls and makes for a painless experience.</li>
            <li>The brissles are like no other fun colorful and unique.  </li>
            <li>Definitely great for kids that dont like getting their hair done, and even for people with thinning hair or extensions as this brush also HIGHLY cuts down on shedding!.</li>
            <li>My first review was written on 11/18/14</li>
            <li>I’ve had this for days now and it never fails to amaze</li>
            <li>With this, I am a able to detangle my hair without damaging my hair by using different kinds of detangler sprays.</li>
            <li>It REALLY does do what it says it does!  </li>
            <li>I just know it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It even comes with a cute mirror on the back.</li>
            <li>This brush is so pretty as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My teenage daughters think the brush is totally cute and are trying to steal it from me now too.</li>
            <li>Also love the mirror on the back!</li>
            <li>Now it only takes me a couple minutes and my hair is in so much better shape in that couple minutes with this brush</li>
            <li>It goes through hair better and is a bigger brush.</li>
            <li>This is more like a tiny purse brush.</li>
            <li>Overall, its okay</li>
            <li>I love the funky colors and the fact that it has a mirror on the back.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t prevent static electricity, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal for me.</li>
            <li>I am just tickled pink that she&#x27;ll brush her own hair</li>
            <li>I used it first on myself.</li>
            <li>It also has a mirror on the back which is super useful for quick touch ups through out the day, be it your hair or makeup.</li>
            <li>Love the small size, bright colors and mirror on back.</li>
            <li>so it could be carried in my purse, other than that it’s marvelous, and I truly love the little mirror that’s included on the back.</li>
            <li>Sorry, but I can&#x27;t, in good conscience, give this brush more than 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a real, normal sized, brush.</li>
            <li>My little girls love this product!</li>
            <li>Not only could I easily brush my hair, but I could see a difference without a bunch of hair in the brush or on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter has long, thick hair and this brush works great!</li>
            <li>The brush also has a large head area that spreads the hair out and makes it easier to pull through your hair and remove</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean for what little hair is in at the end.</li>
            <li>This is a great little brush my daughter hates getting her  hair brushed.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit too rigid and it ends up pulling her hair too much, even using a spray- in detangler.</li>
            <li>Came really fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough</li>
            <li>It is so much work to get her to sit</li>
            <li>It is better than the wet brushes out there.  </li>
            <li>i thought this might be a real loser.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast; I received this brush within 2 days of ordering it.</li>
            <li>I like this brush, it works really well.</li>
            <li>It really does untangle your hair without pulling, or snagging.</li>
            <li>This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush !</li>
            <li>She also didn&#x27;t cry or complain at all which is unusual for her.</li>
            <li>This brush really does what is claims to do.</li>
            <li>I tried it and my hair does get very tangled</li>
            <li>My niece absolutely loves this brush.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter who has very curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To start with the bristles are covered in a material that makes it go through your hair much easier without pulling.</li>
            <li>and she loves it, plus now the whole Volley Ball team wants one.</li>
            <li>but I know how much she hates brushing her hair</li>
            <li>, its just not what I was hoping for or expecting for that much money</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it and said &amp;#34;this brush doesn&#x27;t &#x27;jank&#x27; my hair out!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>this brush works very well.</li>
            <li>I would really like to know what it is that makes it so helpful.</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves this brush.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair</li>
            <li>and because of this it gets very tangled.</li>
            <li>Starting off I didn&#x27;t know what to think of the size, but as it turns out it fits comfortably in my hand when I do her hair every morning.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work with tangles, pulls too much.</li>
            <li>Its pretty, has a cool mirror on the back.</li>
            <li>Its firm bristles also provide a nice massage to the scalp without scratching.</li>
            <li>;  Whereas before she&#x27;d run when I picked up the hairbrush, now she&#x27;s walking around the house brushing her own hair everyday.  </li>
            <li>There is a little mirror on the back that comes in very handy.</li>
            <li>It goes right through curls &amp; knots with no crying.  </li>
            <li>My niece loves this brush, it is small like her, and so cute with all the pretty colors!</li>
            <li>sure didn&#x27;t like it, he said use the other.</li>
            <li>It is a bit small in my opinion, but she is only 11, so it fits great in her hand.  </li>
            <li>it just makes it bigger and more fluffy and easy to deal with</li>
            <li>We tried brushing it through my daughter long, fine hair</li>
            <li>Handy little brush!</li>
            <li>What can I say, it allows one to easily brush my son&#x27;s hair when it is longer, wet, and all tangled/knotted up/frizzed out and separates the tangles gently.</li>
            <li>Some hair does come out in the brush, but not as much as you would see in a normal hairbrush.</li>
            <li>I definitely would but another at full price for my daughter of anything should ever happen to this or even for my tender headed nieces.</li>
            <li>It probably is perfect for little girls with thinner hair, but my daughter and I are not thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>We have bought similar brushes, so I was just thinking this would be an extra to have on hand, however, this works fabulous!</li>
            <li>It is pretty small, but it is cute.</li>
            <li>Its a bit stiff bristled for a tear free tangle brush, but it does work pretty well!</li>
            <li>I can honestly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brush to everyone with tangled hair and kids.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>I gave my 19 yr old grand daughter the other one</li>
            <li>I am not completely convinced yet that it is better than other types of brushes, but the design and colors are funky and fun.  </li>
            <li>Bonus mirror on the bad is a great idea!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think such a small brush would do much good.</li>
            <li>you are in the market for a brush that will actually move through your hair smoother and easier, this hair brush is worth consideration.</li>
            <li>(This would be 5 star except for the fact that on  the brush I received the mirror isn&#x27;t quite right and if you hold your hand over the edge of it it will actually cut a bit.</li>
            <li>This brush is great whether you have a little one that gets knots, or your own locks are hard to tame.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new hairbrush, as I noticed it was breaking.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, the brush is good in wet and now dry hair.</li>
            <li>She does not like brushing her hair as her scalp is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>My next to youngest had bad bed hair that morning and her hair for sure needed a good brushing.</li>
            <li>Like the mirror on the handle but never use too small maybe it would be okay for traveling</li>
            <li>Holly wow.!</li>
            <li>I went back to Ulta and bought the Cricket after the first time I used this one.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it works well for a small child</li>
            <li>I am thinking about sending it back , not worth the money, this one is better.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is that it would be nice to have a small bag</li>
            <li>Next I tried it on my 5 year old granddaughter that hates having her hair brushed because it is quite curly and also full of tangles.</li>
            <li>When I bought my original brush less than a month ago, the price was $15.  </li>
            <li>But my five year old hates it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 8 yr old.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>My 11 year old spotted this,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then my 14 year old daughter used it and wanted one.</li>
            <li>(My 1 year old loves this brush and runs off with it whenever she gets the chance.)</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I used to spend with my old brush.</li>
            <li>I have a 3 year old who hates to brush her hair, I used this brush</li>
            <li>I only brush my hair before I wash it since my hair is very curly</li>
            <li>My 12 yr old has hair longer then</li>
            <li>My daughter saw a &amp;#34;Magic Hair Brush&amp;#34; in the Young Explorer&#x27;s catalog and specifically asked for that for Christmas in her list to Santa.</li>
            <li>I use it on my 4 year old.</li>
            <li>and I have struggled for years to find a brush that won&#x27;t completely frizz it out or cause me to break of pieces off because it gets tangled in the ends.</li>
            <li>- my 4 year old screamed when I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li>I didnt believe it would make that much of a difference but having a money back guarantee</li>
            <li>This brush took me by complete surprise.</li>
            <li>just has a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Well what a pleasure after a few minutes she realized it didn’t hurt and we both got to enjoy the experience, this alone makes it worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering a few more for back ups.  </li>
            <li>This did brush through my thick, curly hair, but I am not in love with it.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I fixed the mirror, thinking that if the brush does all for my hair that it has apparently done for other reviewers&#x27; hair, then the mirror coming unattached is a minor problem.    </li>
            <li>I have super long hair past midway of my back that often and easily tangles.</li>
            <li>This brush glides right through my hair with minimal tugging or pulling.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work any better than other brushes with widely spaced bristles.</li>
            <li>Probably fit for people with SHORT hair, not worth the price.  </li>
            <li>She has a full coat and when her hair gets wet from going outside it can be a nightmare to brush out her legs and belly.</li>
            <li>I only wish the handle was slightly longer nevertheless I found myself comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>The kinky bristles of the brush detangle and style (even wet) hair pretty effortlessly.</li>
            <li>I have a medium thick hair so it easily tangles up in no time.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair a little over shoulder lenght that tangles easily</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>but she&#x27;s extremely pleased with the brush and really likes the size now that she&#x27;s been using it for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li>, I would never willingly spend that much on a brush for my 5 year old.</li>
            <li>Now I have short, very fine, thin hair, after only a few days I noticed a difference, my hair seemed to have some extra body to it and did not just lay flat on top of my head.</li>
            <li>When I got this brush in the mail I was skeptical at first because it does look cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Handle is too short for an adult hand to hold on to.</li>
            <li>It used to take me about 15 minutes of constant brushing with my old hair brush to get the knots worked out of it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad eliterwviews game me this chance to try with one of there codes</li>
            <li>This makes it so much nicer when brushing through dry, damage, knotted, spilt ends, hair, enough about my hair though.</li>
            <li>and she enjoys getting her hair done by mommy because she can watch me with that handy mirror on the back or make silly</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant when I first ordered it</li>
            <li>It brushes right through my daughters hair when it is wet or dry!!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised because teens are a little particular.</li>
            <li>It really does de tangle the hair with such ease and I didn&#x27;t hear one &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; come out of my daughters mouth while I brushed her extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li>We both have very long, curly, fine textured, but thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have 2 young daughters with long, thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are just not long enough to get all the way to the underneath of my hair.</li>
            <li>For me it makes it a little more difficult to hang onto since I have fairly large hands.</li>

            <li> Nice box</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it does not work as well for my own hair.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature are the bristles on the brush.  </li>
            <li> RECEIVED THIS item in Exchange FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in her purse and she always carries it with her.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect size for kids as well and fits your hand perfectly as an adult or kid!!  </li>
            <li> The fun colors are great for her.</li>
            <li> I got the Detangling Hair Brush from SH&amp;SH in hopes that the compact design, the mirror, and colorful bristles would win her over.  </li>

            <li> I have already told many others to order this brush</li>
            <li> and i plan on buying three more</li>
            <li> but says  the 8.98 is better.</li>
            <li> I guess that is why so many reviewers commented on how it is in their purses.  </li>

            <li> I feel this does better in shorter hair because it seems to work better</li>
            <li> I think it is okay.</li>
            <li> , mostly I think cause I had never heard of the maker before.</li>
            <li> And when my daughter brushes her hair at night she is able to get it all the way through her hair</li>

            <li> Worked pretty good, but still pulled out a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> This brush makes it SO easy and PAIN FREE!</li>
            <li> After washing it I went back to my own hair and use it every time I walk in the bathroom as it makes my hair feel great.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, doesn&#x27;t work  any better than a $1.99 brush from WalMart.</li>
            <li> Makes brushing a child&#x27;s hair go a lot more smoothly.</li>
            <li> Focusing on the usage of the brush my wife has naturally straight hair but its a PAIN to comb it out after a shower even using good conditioner.</li>
            <li> The design is very colorful and cute.</li>
            <li> but with brush and little water all was great and was good size to put away in her bag</li>
            <li> She uses this brush in the shower and when she gets out its quick and easy to do her hair because NO TANGLES!</li>
            <li> and it slid easily through her hair.</li>
            <li> Tangles easily.</li>
            <li> My daughter gets tangled hair easily.  </li>
            <li> The brush is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the hair out of the brush is also easy to do.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much I bought two more.  </li>
            <li> but my kids hair is curly and gets natted easy and the brush doesnt seem to do the work.</li>
            <li> it tangles easy.</li>
            <li> Ok there is nothing Great about this Comb its actually Garbage.  </li>
            <li> It does a very good job on long damaged hair like mine.</li>
            <li> First of all, for the size of this brush it does amazing work.</li>
            <li> My 6yo has fine hair that easily gets tangled.  </li>
            <li> As a father of three beautiful girls, brushing through tangled hair is a constant nightmare.</li>
            <li> super cute and easy to detanle hair  </li>
            <li> have baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother, who has brittle fine hair but tends to tangle.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is that it removes tangles, and I have less hair loss.</li>
            <li> This brush is fine for detangling hair.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I won&#x27;t need to do this as I really enjoy the brush!</li>
            <li> It is a very attractive little brush</li>
            <li> one complaint, the bright bristle colors are great</li>
            <li> While this brush is fun and does do the trick, it was not the magic detangler I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> If you click on the comments below, the company offered to send me another brush, free of charge.  </li>
            <li> I was so impressed I even called a few of my friends to tell them about this brush.</li>
            <li> week later it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t available colorized for boys.</li>
            <li> It has a compact design so it can easily fit in almost any purse and not take up all the room.</li>
            <li> Because the size is so manageable, the brush will fit into a purse or backpack.</li>
            <li> I love the colorful bristles ad</li>
            <li> reveiw free</li>
            <li> That said, it is a fantastic detangler for my daughter.</li>
            <li> : I received a sample for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.</li>
            <li> Price: $28.00 Price: $8.98 Free Shipping for Prime Members</li>
            <li> and I am doing a public service (you&#x27;re welcome)</li>
            <li> Got the brush free...</li>
            <li> The back of the brush has a mirror on it, which is great for checking your make-up or hair after you are done brushing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*product received free or at a discount in exchange for my review</li>
            <li> But after just one use I realized it fit my hand</li>
            <li> I had originally gone online to buy my favorite brush, the Cricket Static Free Fast Flo brush because Ulta had been out when I went to the store.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it one star though, because its pretty and cute, so my 5 year old daughter loved it and decided it was her</li>
            <li> My girls thought it was adorable so much so that they was willing to brush their own hair without me even asking.</li>
            <li> The fun colours means it&#x27;s good fun and would make an excellent present for a teenage girl.  </li>
            <li> Its so colorful!</li>
            <li> GREAT, cute little brush.</li>
            <li> I very rarely give a full 5 stars..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cute and pretty</li>
            <li> They were true to their word.  </li>
            <li> One of my daughters favorite brushes because it gets the tangles out without pulling much at all.</li>
            <li> now, this brush doesn&#x27;t pull and I don&#x27;t get the brush full of hair after using.</li>
            <li> Also, because the handle is short and the roundness of the brush head, you get a good massage for your scalp when you brush.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the 8.00 ones on here, this handle is way to short, this pulls my hair and grandson</li>
            <li> The brush is good - smaller than I thought, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it had a full size handle.</li>
            <li> The size is just right to fit inside my purse.</li>
            <li> I came on here to give it one more star, mainly because the company does seem to care a lot.  </li>
            <li> Fun bright colors and mirror on the back of the brush.</li>
            <li> The mirror side also helps when we are quick on the go looks</li>
            <li> I love how brushing her hair is almost painless now, this is an Amazing product and would recommend it to anyone who has hard to detangle hair:-)</li>
            <li> I was given this product at a deep discount to review and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice shine and soft touch to the hair and easy enough to hold so my three year old daughter can easily brush her own hair.</li>
            <li> I was attracted to the cute colors and good reviews, but it is really small.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush, works really well on my natural hair, no pulls or snags!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome and not only does it keep the frizz down for me, but I haven&#x27;t experienced a single incident of having to break off ends.</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me review this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this dress its so adorable and I love the fact it has a small mirror</li>
            <li> I was amazed how fast and pain free</li>
            <li> I took a look at how you would redeem this, and it looks very hassle free.  </li>
            <li> This is a great brush, especially on wet hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still useful.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the price swings others have mentioned, but at 65% off, well worth it.</li>
            <li> This brush is medium sized and colorful.</li>
            <li> I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying.</li>
            <li> The mirror at the back is also a nice touch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bristles are colorful and squiggly.</li>
            <li> She also loves the fun design and colors.</li>
            <li> my girl just love to brush her hair with it super cute and has a little mirror on back really cute!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It went right though</li>
            <li> I can even brush my hair right after showering without fear of all my hair breaking off.</li>
            <li> I got the brush in and put it to the test right away.</li>
            <li> This brush went right through it , didnt catch one tangle</li>
            <li> , it did the job great without lots of agony , it glides through the tangles with very little effort .&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is the best wet dry brush.  </li>
            <li> I love that the rubber bristles are waved so as not to catch big sections in each one but to work together to make tangles come out quickly.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing we no longer have to fight with her to brush her hair and  the little mirror on the other side is a great touch~~~</li>
            <li> so my wife and daughters each have their own!&lt;br /&gt;Incredible pricing and super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery as well.</li>
            <li> It very gently eases through her curls and makes for a painless experience.</li>
            <li> The brissles are like no other fun colorful and unique.  </li>
            <li> Definitely great for kids that dont like getting their hair done, and even for people with thinning hair or extensions as this brush also HIGHLY cuts down on shedding!.</li>
            <li> My first review was written on 11/18/14</li>
            <li> I’ve had this for days now and it never fails to amaze</li>
            <li> With this, I am a able to detangle my hair without damaging my hair by using different kinds of detangler sprays.</li>
            <li> It REALLY does do what it says it does!  </li>
            <li> I just know it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It even comes with a cute mirror on the back.</li>
            <li> This brush is so pretty as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My teenage daughters think the brush is totally cute and are trying to steal it from me now too.</li>
            <li> Also love the mirror on the back!</li>
            <li> Now it only takes me a couple minutes and my hair is in so much better shape in that couple minutes with this brush</li>
            <li> It goes through hair better and is a bigger brush.</li>
            <li> This is more like a tiny purse brush.</li>
            <li> Overall, its okay</li>
            <li> I love the funky colors and the fact that it has a mirror on the back.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent static electricity, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> I am just tickled pink that she&#x27;ll brush her own hair</li>
            <li> I used it first on myself.</li>
            <li> It also has a mirror on the back which is super useful for quick touch ups through out the day, be it your hair or makeup.</li>
            <li> Love the small size, bright colors and mirror on back.</li>
            <li> so it could be carried in my purse, other than that it’s marvelous, and I truly love the little mirror that’s included on the back.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I can&#x27;t, in good conscience, give this brush more than 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a real, normal sized, brush.</li>
            <li> My little girls love this product!</li>
            <li> Not only could I easily brush my hair, but I could see a difference without a bunch of hair in the brush or on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, thick hair and this brush works great!</li>
            <li> The brush also has a large head area that spreads the hair out and makes it easier to pull through your hair and remove</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean for what little hair is in at the end.</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush my daughter hates getting her  hair brushed.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit too rigid and it ends up pulling her hair too much, even using a spray- in detangler.</li>
            <li> Came really fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap enough</li>
            <li> It is so much work to get her to sit</li>
            <li> It is better than the wet brushes out there.  </li>
            <li> i thought this might be a real loser.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast; I received this brush within 2 days of ordering it.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, it works really well.</li>
            <li> It really does untangle your hair without pulling, or snagging.</li>
            <li> This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this brush !</li>
            <li> She also didn&#x27;t cry or complain at all which is unusual for her.</li>
            <li> This brush really does what is claims to do.</li>
            <li> I tried it and my hair does get very tangled</li>
            <li> My niece absolutely loves this brush.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has very curly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To start with the bristles are covered in a material that makes it go through your hair much easier without pulling.</li>
            <li> and she loves it, plus now the whole Volley Ball team wants one.</li>
            <li> but I know how much she hates brushing her hair</li>
            <li> , its just not what I was hoping for or expecting for that much money</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it and said &amp;#34;this brush doesn&#x27;t &#x27;jank&#x27; my hair out!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> this brush works very well.</li>
            <li> I would really like to know what it is that makes it so helpful.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this brush.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair</li>
            <li> and because of this it gets very tangled.</li>
            <li> Starting off I didn&#x27;t know what to think of the size, but as it turns out it fits comfortably in my hand when I do her hair every morning.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work with tangles, pulls too much.</li>
            <li> Its pretty, has a cool mirror on the back.</li>
            <li> Its firm bristles also provide a nice massage to the scalp without scratching.</li>
            <li> ;  Whereas before she&#x27;d run when I picked up the hairbrush, now she&#x27;s walking around the house brushing her own hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> There is a little mirror on the back that comes in very handy.</li>
            <li> It goes right through curls &amp; knots with no crying.  </li>
            <li> My niece loves this brush, it is small like her, and so cute with all the pretty colors!</li>
            <li> sure didn&#x27;t like it, he said use the other.</li>
            <li> It is a bit small in my opinion, but she is only 11, so it fits great in her hand.  </li>
            <li> it just makes it bigger and more fluffy and easy to deal with</li>
            <li> We tried brushing it through my daughter long, fine hair</li>
            <li> Handy little brush!</li>
            <li> What can I say, it allows one to easily brush my son&#x27;s hair when it is longer, wet, and all tangled/knotted up/frizzed out and separates the tangles gently.</li>
            <li> Some hair does come out in the brush, but not as much as you would see in a normal hairbrush.</li>
            <li> I definitely would but another at full price for my daughter of anything should ever happen to this or even for my tender headed nieces.</li>
            <li> It probably is perfect for little girls with thinner hair, but my daughter and I are not thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> We have bought similar brushes, so I was just thinking this would be an extra to have on hand, however, this works fabulous!</li>
            <li> It is pretty small, but it is cute.</li>
            <li> Its a bit stiff bristled for a tear free tangle brush, but it does work pretty well!</li>
            <li> I can honestly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this brush to everyone with tangled hair and kids.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I gave my 19 yr old grand daughter the other one</li>
            <li> I am not completely convinced yet that it is better than other types of brushes, but the design and colors are funky and fun.  </li>
            <li> Bonus mirror on the bad is a great idea!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think such a small brush would do much good.</li>
            <li> you are in the market for a brush that will actually move through your hair smoother and easier, this hair brush is worth consideration.</li>
            <li> (This would be 5 star except for the fact that on  the brush I received the mirror isn&#x27;t quite right and if you hold your hand over the edge of it it will actually cut a bit.</li>
            <li> This brush is great whether you have a little one that gets knots, or your own locks are hard to tame.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new hairbrush, as I noticed it was breaking.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, the brush is good in wet and now dry hair.</li>
            <li> She does not like brushing her hair as her scalp is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> My next to youngest had bad bed hair that morning and her hair for sure needed a good brushing.</li>
            <li> Like the mirror on the handle but never use too small maybe it would be okay for traveling</li>
            <li> Holly wow.!</li>
            <li> I went back to Ulta and bought the Cricket after the first time I used this one.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it works well for a small child</li>
            <li> I am thinking about sending it back , not worth the money, this one is better.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is that it would be nice to have a small bag</li>
            <li> Next I tried it on my 5 year old granddaughter that hates having her hair brushed because it is quite curly and also full of tangles.</li>
            <li> When I bought my original brush less than a month ago, the price was $15.  </li>
            <li> But my five year old hates it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 yr old.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old spotted this,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then my 14 year old daughter used it and wanted one.</li>
            <li> (My 1 year old loves this brush and runs off with it whenever she gets the chance.)</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I used to spend with my old brush.</li>
            <li> I have a 3 year old who hates to brush her hair, I used this brush</li>
            <li> I only brush my hair before I wash it since my hair is very curly</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old has hair longer then</li>
            <li> My daughter saw a &amp;#34;Magic Hair Brush&amp;#34; in the Young Explorer&#x27;s catalog and specifically asked for that for Christmas in her list to Santa.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 4 year old.</li>
            <li> and I have struggled for years to find a brush that won&#x27;t completely frizz it out or cause me to break of pieces off because it gets tangled in the ends.</li>
            <li> - my 4 year old screamed when I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> I didnt believe it would make that much of a difference but having a money back guarantee</li>
            <li> This brush took me by complete surprise.</li>
            <li> just has a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Well what a pleasure after a few minutes she realized it didn’t hurt and we both got to enjoy the experience, this alone makes it worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering a few more for back ups.  </li>
            <li> This did brush through my thick, curly hair, but I am not in love with it.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I fixed the mirror, thinking that if the brush does all for my hair that it has apparently done for other reviewers&#x27; hair, then the mirror coming unattached is a minor problem.    </li>
            <li> I have super long hair past midway of my back that often and easily tangles.</li>
            <li> This brush glides right through my hair with minimal tugging or pulling.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work any better than other brushes with widely spaced bristles.</li>
            <li> Probably fit for people with SHORT hair, not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> She has a full coat and when her hair gets wet from going outside it can be a nightmare to brush out her legs and belly.</li>
            <li> I only wish the handle was slightly longer nevertheless I found myself comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> The kinky bristles of the brush detangle and style (even wet) hair pretty effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I have a medium thick hair so it easily tangles up in no time.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair a little over shoulder lenght that tangles easily</li>
            <li> No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> but she&#x27;s extremely pleased with the brush and really likes the size now that she&#x27;s been using it for the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> , I would never willingly spend that much on a brush for my 5 year old.</li>
            <li> Now I have short, very fine, thin hair, after only a few days I noticed a difference, my hair seemed to have some extra body to it and did not just lay flat on top of my head.</li>
            <li> When I got this brush in the mail I was skeptical at first because it does look cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Handle is too short for an adult hand to hold on to.</li>
            <li> It used to take me about 15 minutes of constant brushing with my old hair brush to get the knots worked out of it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad eliterwviews game me this chance to try with one of there codes</li>
            <li> This makes it so much nicer when brushing through dry, damage, knotted, spilt ends, hair, enough about my hair though.</li>
            <li> and she enjoys getting her hair done by mommy because she can watch me with that handy mirror on the back or make silly</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant when I first ordered it</li>
            <li> It brushes right through my daughters hair when it is wet or dry!!  </li>
            <li> I was surprised because teens are a little particular.</li>
            <li> It really does de tangle the hair with such ease and I didn&#x27;t hear one &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; come out of my daughters mouth while I brushed her extremely curly hair.</li>
            <li> We both have very long, curly, fine textured, but thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have 2 young daughters with long, thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are just not long enough to get all the way to the underneath of my hair.</li>
            <li> For me it makes it a little more difficult to hang onto since I have fairly large hands.</li>
            <li> To this, the wet brush is sooo much more gentle on my hair, this one does not do as it claims, I can only think all the great reviews were from people using pretty bad bbrushes to begin with, I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t the worst brush out there, but its worse than the wet brush!</li>
            <li> It is very short only about 3 inches long.</li>
            <li> I really like this little brush, it works as stated &amp; it fits in my purse, so that&#x27;s a plus too!</li>
            <li> When I first open the package was surprised at the size and thought it seemed a little small.</li>
            <li> At the very least it looked cool and she would use it based off of appeal.</li>
            <li> Was hopeful that this would help eliminate fighting with tangles in my hair, but really do not notice much improvement over previous brush I had.  </li>
            <li> We got the detangle hair brush today and it is absolutely what we were missing!</li>
            <li> Apparently, not.  </li>
            <li> It is not the typical straight bristles like the other brushes I’ve had.</li>
            <li> First off, the product is very small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i got this for my little 2 year old granddaughter long hair .</li>
            <li> and she complained just as much.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that gets tangled all the time.</li>
            <li> She has long hair, and she says it glides through without snagging.  </li>
            <li> but when I tried it wasn&#x27;t unknotting my long hair</li>
            <li> Funky long bristles that take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think the brush is over priced and not very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smaller than expected but works well.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a little small, but she thinks it is just right.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin, baby fine and very long.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem any different than our other brushes.</li>
            <li> He likes the mirror on the other side for when we&#x27;re not in front of a bigger mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad to be wrong!  </li>
            <li> , so I thought maybe other women carry giant brushes around in their purses.  </li>
            <li> Its very small (the whole thing is maybe 6 inches tall) and does not look like a $22 hair brush.</li>
            <li> and it is very long</li>
            <li> I use this brush on damp and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I can NEVER  comb through my daughters curls dry.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my hair when it is dry as well</li>
            <li> The only thing I would mention is that it was a little smaller than I had expected.</li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t for people with long hair, it doesn&#x27;t detangle wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Normal brushes pull on my hair too much and rip it out when I try to brush my hair when its wet (I usually try to air dry my hair if time permits otherwise its a pretty painful process to try and brush it out).</li>
            <li> I bouth this brush after the first one I purchased arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> I used this brush on her hair wet and dry</li>
            <li> She has used it with both dry and wet hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not large enough, nor are the bristles long enough, to work on long thick hair as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well on wet or dry hair!  </li>
            <li> I would have rated a 5 if it were a little bigger, as I think for thicker hair you need the leverage.</li>
            <li> Using an ordinary brush caused some major breakage with my hair resting in even frizzier hair.</li>
            <li> The handle is a little short</li>
            <li> Theres a little mirror on the back side of the brush as well.</li>
            <li> Little bit short for my liking.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has 2 other wet dry brushes, she no longer is using them.  </li>
            <li> I can still take it out of the box and leave it with her Santa gifts but that makes the $22 more painful since I will just be throwing into a basket or her stocking or something.</li>
            <li> Esp wet.</li>
            <li> Wavy esp when wet.</li>
            <li> and I had minimal hair</li>
            <li> Since using this brush, I have not experienced any breakage and my hair is much, much smoother and manageable.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the simple round design, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it showed up with a completely ripped and busted up box and the entire box is covered in Korean writing so it will be obvious</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as the Wet Brush</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m using it in the shower as a wet brush.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hear a scream out of my daughter while I was brushing her wet hair.</li>
            <li> Certainly not a $15 brush.</li>
            <li> The brush head is about half of the size of the one I currently use yet it passes through my hair with so much less effort</li>
            <li> and I really expected it to have the same results as any other brush that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I ran the brush through my hair, and unlike other reviews, there was a lot of my hair in the brush.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t glide through my hair, like it did for the other reviewers, either.    </li>
            <li> as a couple of other reviewers said that they noticed an improvement in their hair over time.  </li>
            <li> I  officially will never use any other brush besides this one from now on .I</li>
            <li> I did come to realize that this brush does have some benefits over the other brushes I had used</li>
            <li> They work out knots in hair a bit easier than other ones I have used.  </li>
            <li> , I gave to her the other day</li>
            <li> so I ordered this brush from Amazon because it looked just like the other one</li>
            <li> This brush works extremely well to detangle and get kinks out of hair.</li>
            <li> Mirror on other side of head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; brushes, but she&#x27;s refused to use them because they pull her hair and she has a tender scalp.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from extreme sensitivity of the scalp when brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> One of them has hair she can sit on the other</li>
            <li> It does take a little more work to use this on wet hair according to her but its a lot less painful then using her other brushes she has.</li>
            <li> soo much so that i stopped brushing my hair unless it was wash day and even then it was literally so painful that i nearly cried.</li>
            <li> She was a little taken back by how small it was when she opened the box</li>
            <li> She has long curly hair that is hard to comb unless its wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not worth $22.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and coarse hair and wish the brush was a little bigger and the handle a little longer.</li>
            <li> It cut the brushing time for me down a lot.</li>
            <li> and they usually always complain and they loose a lot of hair....</li>
            <li> It pulls less, which prevents pain, whining, hairs being pulled out and breakage.</li>
            <li> She said it pulled every so slightly but there were no tears or screaming.</li>
            <li> It now takes half the time to brush my hair.</li>
            <li> No kid ever likes to have their hair brushed when it&#x27;s tangled but with this brush it makes getting through those tangles so much easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> Its an odd request</li>
            <li> We have had a lot less complaints with this brush with both girls.</li>
            <li> When I am done brushing my hair the brush is not full of hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long thick hair and always cries when we try to brush it.</li>
            <li> On a side note, I also noticed that no hair was left behind every time I brush my hair compared to the other ones I owned.</li>
            <li> She has very long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> When the brush arrived, I took it out of the box, and the mirror was missing.  </li>
            <li> this goes through effortlessly with no pull I g or crying or fighting me.</li>
            <li> It even has a mirror on one side, so no more using your little make-up mirror.</li>
            <li> Brushing her hair usually means crying and screaming and frustration.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and the tangles I get are outrageous.</li>
            <li> If you have a hard time brushing your little ones hair</li>
            <li> her back and very thick!</li>
            <li> I dont usually comment on things like this</li>
            <li> My daughter usually cries when I brush her hair, she said this brush did not hurt her at all.  </li>
            <li> This item is extremely small.</li>
            <li> This thing is really small</li>
            <li> No more complaining from the kids that it hurts when I brush their hair.  </li>
            <li> i can brush my hair everyday now!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if its the placement of the plastic or the angles</li>
            <li> Smaller than a travel brush which, in my opinion, makes it difficult to handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this Detangling Brush for my 8 year old daughter who has extremely difficult hair to brush!</li>
            <li> you have hard to handle hair</li>
            <li> I find the brush hard to use for styling, but then have to admit it is probably not designed for that anyway.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick hair that reachs her waist.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my daughter who has extremely thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> She has really thick hair</li>
            <li> I then tried it on my waist length thick hair and noticed no difference.</li>
            <li> Very small.  </li>
            <li> our kids have a curly hair and after the shower it is almost impossible to comb their hair with a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I have seen videos and reviews for the wet brush and was consider purchasing one, when I seen this crazy looking brush in the recommended feed line.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on thick hair as intended but works well on thin hair</li>
            <li> She has thin curly hair, while mine is thick and curly.</li>
            <li> My little girl loves this Brush!!!  </li>
            <li> He  hated the older brush when it was tugging on knots and practically pulling the hair out.</li>
            <li> This brush was horrible, totally pulled my hair, maybe its because I went from the wet brush</li>
            <li> worst $15 ever spent... does nothing different than a $2 brush.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who&#x27;s hair is very thick and is very hard to manage.</li>
            <li> I thought it would never go through my very (very) thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It goes through her hair which is very thick.  </li>
            <li> I have four girls who hate to have their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> I was shocked how small it is.</li>
            <li> If you are on the go and are brushing blind, it lets you see how your hair looks.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> Their hair is very thick, brushing is very painful for them</li>
            <li> I never give bad reviews</li>
            <li> Pulled Wife&#x27;s hair badly.  </li>
            <li> but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> they hate brushing thier hair because of knots..not anymore</li>
            <li> Very disappointed....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My grand daughter asked for a detangling brush.  She has very long, thick hair.  She was very pleased with this brush.  I thought it might be a little small, but she thinks it is just right.</li>
            <li> I have 2 young daughters with long, thin, fine hair.  It is always a struggle to detangle in the mornings.  While this brush is fun and does do the trick, it was not the magic detangler I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> this really is a good brush.  I have two...one for home and one in my purse.  Also gave one as a gift.</li>
            <li> Does not hurt tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Very cute and fun detangling brush.  The wavy shape of the bristles means that it is easier to get through tangles.  The fun colours means it&#x27;s good fun and would make an excellent present for a teenage girl.  The size is brilliant for fitting in your bag, yet with the size of the head of the brush it&#x27;s still useful. You even get a mirror on the reverse to check how you are looking</li>
            <li> I was shocked how small it is. Like the mirror on the handle but never use too small maybe it would be okay for traveling but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on the raving reviews.  When the brush arrived, I took it out of the box, and the mirror was missing.  It was in the bottom of the box.  Okay, I fixed the mirror, thinking that if the brush does all for my hair that it has apparently done for other reviewers&#x27; hair, then the mirror coming unattached is a minor problem.    I ran the brush through my hair, and unlike other reviews, there was a lot of my hair in the brush.  It didn&#x27;t glide through my hair, like it did for the other reviewers, either.    Honestly, I think the brush is way over-priced.    I&#x27;m going to continue to use the brush, as a couple of other reviewers said that they noticed an improvement in their hair over time.  I will change my review if I see changes.    Update:  My first review was written on 11/18/14 and I gave it 3 stars.  Today&#x27;s date is 12/03/14.  If you click on the comments below, the company offered to send me another brush, free of charge.  They were true to their word.  I received another one yesterday.  The mirror was intact on this one.  I&#x27;ve continued to use the brush, and I just don&#x27;t see a change in my hair.      I came on here to give it one more star, mainly because the company does seem to care a lot.  They didn&#x27;t have to send me a replacement brush, but they did.  And, I appreciate their effort.  But then, I saw the current price of the brush.  When I bought my original brush less than a month ago, the price was $15.  Now these are selling for $22?  That&#x27;s quite a jump in such a short amount of time.  Sorry, but I can&#x27;t, in good conscience, give this brush more than 3 stars.  It&#x27;s definitely not worth $22.</li>
            <li> Really works I am a natural woman with thick hair and it helps me in my detangling process! !</li>
            <li> One of my daughters favorite brushes because it gets the tangles out without pulling much at all.</li>
            <li> Great brush!!! My daughter has long thick hair and always cries when we try to brush it. This brush is amazing we no longer have to fight with her to brush her hair and  the little mirror on the other side is a great touch~~~</li>
            <li> Its pretty, has a cool mirror on the back. detangles ok. But my five year old hates it. Since its for her that I bought it, it gets 3 stars. The bristles are a bit too rigid and it ends up pulling her hair too much, even using a spray- in detangler. We both prefer the Global Hands detangling brush. Amazon carries it. It pulls less, which prevents pain, whining, hairs being pulled out and breakage. Which is my goal.  We both have very long, curly, fine textured, but thick hair. A challenge for any brush. So we are discerning hair care cutomers.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing brush! It really does de tangle the hair with such ease and I didn&#x27;t hear one &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; come out of my daughters mouth while I brushed her extremely curly hair. I was so impressed I even called a few of my friends to tell them about this brush. It leaves a nice shine and soft touch to the hair and easy enough to hold so my three year old daughter can easily brush her own hair. I  officially will never use any other brush besides this one from now on .I included before and after photos of my daughters hair</li>
            <li> Mirror fell off when it came out of the package. Doesn&#x27;t work any better than other brushes with widely spaced bristles.</li>
            <li> Came really fast. I use it in my hair, it doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt. Great price really cute and a nice size. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick hair that reachs her waist. Brushing her hair usually means crying and screaming and frustration. I used this brush on her after she had been swimming and then riding in a convertible and it slid easily through her hair. She said it pulled every so slightly but there were no tears or screaming. This is the best brush ever! And there&#x27;s a mirror on the back side of it. I didn&#x27;t realize that when I bought it. She liked the addition of the mirror.</li>
            <li> Great brush for me...been on high duty drugs and my hair had been falling out....now, this brush doesn&#x27;t pull and I don&#x27;t get the brush full of hair after using. Nice having the mirror, too.</li>
            <li> My hair it took me 3 years to grow from shaving it. The knots. The pain. Esp wet. I figured why not for the price. Last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine hair. Wavy esp when wet. Tangles easily. Brushing it after a shower hurt no matter what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I&#x27;d give this the ultimate test. I used it after dying my hair with 30vol developer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small size at first threw me off. I didn&#x27;t think such a small brush would do much good. Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It went right though and I had minimal hair loss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later it&#x27;s still working great. Idk how it works but it does and my hairdresser has started do sell them at her shop even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hard to handle hair try it. It&#x27;s cheap enough it&#x27;s no loss, and it helped me a LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my daughter who has extremely thick curly hair.  It works really well for her and is great for getting out knots and tangles. She loves the colors and the mirror on the back of the brush.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem any different than our other brushes. At least my daughter likes it because it is colorful.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. There is a little mirror on the back that comes in very handy. My little girl loved the colors and was happy to let me brush her hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush. It is so much work to get her to sit so I can fix her hair but this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt her head to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 yr old.  She swears  this is the best brush in her life!  It goes right through curls &amp; knots with no crying.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Was hopeful that this would help eliminate fighting with tangles in my hair, but really do not notice much improvement over previous brush I had.  Still fighting every time I wash my hair....debating if I need to just go back to short hair!</li>
            <li> What can I say, it allows one to easily brush my son&#x27;s hair when it is longer, wet, and all tangled/knotted up/frizzed out and separates the tangles gently. He  hated the older brush when it was tugging on knots and practically pulling the hair out. Makes brushing a child&#x27;s hair go a lot more smoothly. He likes the mirror on the other side for when we&#x27;re not in front of a bigger mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint, the bright bristle colors are great but it isn&#x27;t available colorized for boys. I haven&#x27;t seen the price swings others have mentioned, but at 65% off, well worth it. Good deal at 65% off / $15.79.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received sample from vendor for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This brush is phenomenal.  It is better than the wet brushes out there.  My daughter gets tangled hair easily.  She uses this brush going over it one time and her hair is left shiny, and non frizzy.  I have never seen such with just a hair brush and NO product.  I would totally recommend this to anyone.  I personally use this brush in the shower when I have conditioner in to brush out my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t pull or anything.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair a little over shoulder lenght that tangles easily and I was recently rethinking the kinds of hair products I use. Normal brushes pull on my hair too much and rip it out when I try to brush my hair when its wet (I usually try to air dry my hair if time permits otherwise its a pretty painful process to try and brush it out). This is a great product that does the job and I also use it as a scalp massager because my hair does not get caught in it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on thick hair as intended but works well on thin hair</li>
            <li> I purchase this brush in excjange for a review. I had my doubts about this brush and since my hair it the easitest tangled hair ever....i thought this might be a real loser. To my surprise.. It works great!!!</li>
            <li> My niece loves this brush, it is small like her, and so cute with all the pretty colors!</li>
            <li> Handy little brush! I got this for my mother, who has brittle fine hair but tends to tangle. It works miracles on knots without breaking the hair. Its firm bristles also provide a nice massage to the scalp without scratching. Overall, I really like this brush. I would have rated a 5 if it were a little bigger, as I think for thicker hair you need the leverage. Bonus mirror on the bad is a great idea!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush! It does the trick for detangling and getting through thicker hair. My 11 year old spotted this,&lt;br /&gt;she liked it. Then my 14 year old daughter used it and wanted one. I was surprised because teens are a little particular. The only thing I would mention is that it was a little smaller than I had expected. It still works and fits in a purse well.</li>
            <li> Nice brush.  Detangles my curly hair well.  Works well on wet or dry hair!  Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair was frizzy and hair to maintain. Using an ordinary brush caused some major breakage with my hair resting in even frizzier hair. I did some research and found that a good detangling brush could help. I found this detangling brush at a great price and couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try. The shipping was fast; I received this brush within 2 days of ordering it. This brush is medium sized and colorful. (My 1 year old loves this brush and runs off with it whenever she gets the chance.) The brush has a convenient mirror on the back which makes it convenient when you&#x27;re on the go. I use this brush on damp and dry hair. It brushes through my hair with ease. Since using this brush, I have not experienced any breakage and my hair is much, much smoother and manageable. This is a must have for all hair types!!</li>
            <li> This brush is great whether you have a little one that gets knots, or your own locks are hard to tame.  It has a compact design so it can easily fit in almost any purse and not take up all the room. The design is very colorful and cute. It also has a mirror on the back which is super useful for quick touch ups through out the day, be it your hair or makeup. The brush is lightweight and easy to use. I only wish the handle was slightly longer nevertheless I found myself comfortable using it. My hair is very fine and the tangles I get are outrageous. It now takes half the time to brush my hair. I can even brush my hair right after showering without fear of all my hair breaking off. This brush glides right through my hair with minimal tugging or pulling.The best thing about this product is that it removes tangles, and I have less hair loss. When I am done brushing my hair the brush is not full of hair. Some hair does come out in the brush, but not as much as you would see in a normal hairbrush. Cleaning the hair out of the brush is also easy to do. I received a sample of this product for test and review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome.</li>
            <li> Brush is just ok. Handle is too short for an adult hand to hold on to. Works better as a child&#x27;s brush.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, it works really well. It is the perfect size to throw in a purse, leave in the car, or put in a book bag. It really does untangle your hair without pulling, or snagging. It even has a mirror on one side, so no more using your little make-up mirror. So this product is a winner in my book. I can honestly highly recommend this product. I count on Amazon reviews when I make purchases, and know that others do the same. I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying. If my review is helpful, let me know by checking helpful. This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
            <li> I’ve had this for days now and it never fails to amaze me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are so cute and funky. It is not the typical straight bristles like the other brushes I’ve had. The size is just right to fit inside my purse. I have a medium thick hair so it easily tangles up in no time. With this, I am a able to detangle my hair without damaging my hair by using different kinds of detangler sprays. The mirror at the back is also a nice touch. No need to buy a separate compact mirror, which costs money and can just take up space in my purse. Basically, this is 2-in-1, which is great. On a side note, I also noticed that no hair was left behind every time I brush my hair compared to the other ones I owned. That’s why I am so fortunate to be chosen to honestly review this product based on my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever! I very rarely give a full 5 stars.. But this brush is the best. I can NEVER  comb through my daughters curls dry. I get tears and a fight.  this goes through effortlessly with no pull I g or crying or fighting me. I didn&#x27;t even use detsngling spray. I will be ordering a few more for back ups.  My daughter has mixed hair . my texture his dryness and curl.. I wish I would have found this brush sooner</li>
            <li> This brush was horrible, totally pulled my hair, maybe its because I went from the wet brush http://www.amazon.com/Brush-Detangling-Shower-Colors-Vary/dp/B000L596FE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1423057356&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;the+wet+brush To this, the wet brush is sooo much more gentle on my hair, this one does not do as it claims, I can only think all the great reviews were from people using pretty bad bbrushes to begin with, I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t the worst brush out there, but its worse than the wet brush! I&#x27;ll give it one star though, because its pretty and cute, so my 5 year old daughter loved it and decided it was her brush(however I will still not brush her hair with it, she cries more with this brush than my others) I know it has a money back guarantee, and had I not just let my daughter have it I would have sent it back, I would never willingly spend that much on a brush for my 5 year old.</li>
            <li> I dont usually comment on things like this but I had to tell you how much I love this brush. It REALLY does do what it says it does!  I cant believe it. I have long hair that gets tangled all the time. Buy this brush! I promise you will be happy you did! Thank you to the company who made it. Brenda</li>
            <li> This brush is excellent! My daughter hates brushing her hair. She has really thick hair and it was always a  struggle to get to brush her hair.&lt;br /&gt;Now she volunteers to brush hair hair since it is almost painless. The wavy bristle are just a genius invention.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is just the perfect size to take a long and the colors are so gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;This was a great buy for us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10-19-2016:&lt;br /&gt;Its been well over a year and we are still have our brush and it was truly one great buy for us!&lt;br /&gt;We had one addition to our family and she enjoys getting her hair done by mommy because she can watch me with that handy mirror on the back or make silly faces.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush !</li>
            <li> First of all, for the size of this brush it does amazing work. The brush head is about half of the size of the one I currently use yet it passes through my hair with so much less effort it is amazing. When I took it out of the box, I saw a &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; brush with a mirror. I thought it would never go through my very (very) thick wavy hair. So glad to be wrong!  Not only could I easily brush my hair, but I could see a difference without a bunch of hair in the brush or on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grip of the handle is very comfortable. The kinky bristles of the brush detangle and style (even wet) hair pretty effortlessly. Maybe it&#x27;s the simple round design, I don&#x27;t know. I just know it works pretty well. Because the size is so manageable, the brush will fit into a purse or backpack. Also, because the handle is short and the roundness of the brush head, you get a good massage for your scalp when you brush. It&#x27;s easy to clean for what little hair is in at the end. (This would be 5 star except for the fact that on  the brush I received the mirror isn&#x27;t quite right and if you hold your hand over the edge of it it will actually cut a bit. Overall though, the brush is good in wet and now dry hair. I did receive a discount on purchase for my review, but I did pay for the product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This brush is great so far!!  It brushes right through my daughters hair when it is wet or dry!!  She loves it!!  I have also used it on my hair when it is dry as well and it did GREAT!!  I would recommend this brush to anyone.  I was asked to give a review on this product and give my honest opinion about the product.  It is the perfect size for kids as well and fits your hand perfectly as an adult or kid!!  Thanks for letting me review this product!!</li>
            <li> Hair brush ist ausgezeichnet  fantastich wow.</li>
            <li> Holly wow.! It&#x27;s super cute and pretty plus it does help with the tangles very nice products</li>
            <li> It works well.  Wish the handle was longer</li>
            <li> super cute and easy to detanle hair  my girl just love to brush her hair with it super cute and has a little mirror on back really cute!</li>
            <li> Works well. I like the mirror on the back too.</li>
            <li> This brush works wonders on getting through the knots in my daughters hair!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush on the market! My little girls love this product! Their hair is very thick, brushing is very painful for them and they usually always complain and they loose a lot of hair....that is until we found this product! This brush is a great. I was amazed how fast and pain free I detangled their hair without any hair loss.  If you have a hard time brushing your little ones hair then this brush is a must have! Do not hesitate, buy it!</li>
            <li> I have four girls who hate to have their hair brushed. I recieved the SH&amp;SH detagling brush. It&#x27;s bristles are colorful and squiggly. It even comes with a cute mirror on the back. My girls thought it was adorable so much so that they was willing to brush their own hair without me even asking. My next to youngest had bad bed hair that morning and her hair for sure needed a good brushing. We ran the brush through about four times and all the tangles are gone. She also didn&#x27;t cry or complain at all which is unusual for her. The brush also comes with a product guarantee so you never have to worry about any problems with it. A great brush that got my girls to brush their own hair, got the tangles out quickly, and didnt pull or hurt my kids while it was being used makes me one happy mamma.</li>
            <li> We got the detangle hair brush today and it is absolutely what we were missing! our kids have a curly hair and after the shower it is almost impossible to comb their hair with a regular brush. It is indeed doing what it is described with close to no effort. Recommended for every parent that have a curly hair children.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush for my daughter&#x27;s hair! We have bought similar brushes, so I was just thinking this would be an extra to have on hand, however, this works fabulous! For the first time ever after bathtime there was NO tears and whining and crying! This brush is so pretty as well. I&#x27;m going to be looking for a couple of more of these to have on hand for traveling. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I received this brush today , and I must say I was so impressed . This brush really does what is claims to do. I tried it and my hair does get very tangled , it did the job great without lots of agony , it glides through the tangles with very little effort .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is a very attractive little brush I love the colorful bristles ad it is very comfortable to hold . There is also a added bonus of a mirror on the underside of the brush .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush to everyone with tangled hair and kids.</li>
            <li> I never give bad reviews but i have a mixed baby with big hair and this did not come close to making brushing it any easier save your money</li>
            <li> This brush is the best wet dry brush.  My daughter has 2 other wet dry brushes, she no longer is using them.  It goes through her hair which is very thick.  Love this brush.</li>
            <li> reveiw free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i got this for my little 2 year old granddaughter long hair . we normall brushing her hear come to tears . but with brush and little water all was great and was good size to put away in her bag</li>
            <li> This brush really does work great. My stepdaughters hair is so knotted every time she gets out of the shower no matter what products we use. We purchased this brush to try to see if it would work for her hair. At the very least it looked cool and she would use it based off of appeal. It comes with a mirror on the back which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> My niece absolutely loves this brush.  It is a bit small in my opinion, but she is only 11, so it fits great in her hand.  She has long hair, and she says it glides through without snagging.  She also loves the rainbow colors.</li>
            <li> Great product! Perfect size to carry with you wherever you go. Fun bright colors and mirror on the back of the brush. Nice box it comes in. I was given this product at a deep discount to review and am very pleased with it. I have super long hair past midway of my back that often and easily tangles. I always have it pulled back. I got the brush in and put it to the test right away. It cut the brushing time for me down a lot. My teenage daughters think the brush is totally cute and are trying to steal it from me now too.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Its so colorful! Also love the mirror on the back! So cute! Its a bit stiff bristled for a tear free tangle brush, but it does work pretty well!</li>
            <li> My girls absolutely love this brush! No kid ever likes to have their hair brushed when it&#x27;s tangled but with this brush it makes getting through those tangles so much easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who has very curly hair. It very gently eases through her curls and makes for a painless experience. I have noticed that it does not work as well for my own hair. She has thin curly hair, while mine is thick and curly. The bristles are just not long enough to get all the way to the underneath of my hair. So I would recommend this for people with thinner hair. That said, it is a fantastic detangler for my daughter.</li>
            <li> GREAT, cute little brush. Does the job.</li>
            <li> I saw this brush and 1st thing I thought was oh my that&#x27;s cute  the next thing was my daughter needs a detangling hair brush because she lost her last one.  The brissles are like no other fun colorful and unique.  The mirror side also helps when we are quick on the go looks so she can check her hair out. I love how it works wonderful on her hair and tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved a coupon code for my unbiased opinion and review with that I definitely would but another at full price for my daughter of anything should ever happen to this or even for my tender headed nieces.</li>
            <li> I really like this little brush, it works as stated &amp; it fits in my purse, so that&#x27;s a plus too!</li>
            <li> This brush is fabulous!  My daughter usually cries when I brush her hair, she said this brush did not hurt her at all.  Her hair look great after using it too.  Love this brush!!</li>
            <li> I was sent this brush from SH&amp;SH and I really expected it to have the same results as any other brush that I have used in the past. I did come to realize that this brush does have some benefits over the other brushes I had used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with the bristles are covered in a material that makes it go through your hair much easier without pulling. This makes it so much nicer when brushing through dry, damage, knotted, spilt ends, hair, enough about my hair though. The brush also has a large head area that spreads the hair out and makes it easier to pull through your hair and remove knots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with this brush is the handle. It is very short only about 3 inches long. For me it makes it a little more difficult to hang onto since I have fairly large hands. I do understand why it has a short handle to save room for those that might want to carry in their hand bag. The brush also has a mirror surface on the back of it as well for those that might need to check out if there is something on their face or make up check to see if it needs fixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I have this brush laying on my bathroom sink counter. I use it daily to brush through my hair. It does a very good job on long damaged hair like mine. It used to take me about 15 minutes of constant brushing with my old hair brush to get the knots worked out of it. Now it only takes me a couple minutes and my hair is in so much better shape in that couple minutes with this brush then the 15 I used to spend with my old brush. Also with this brush it does not feel like I am pulling my hair out with every stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a brush that will actually move through your hair smoother and easier, this hair brush is worth consideration. I would like to thank SH&amp;SH and affiliates for sending me this hair brush to try out and leave my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a sample for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers. No other form of compensation was received.

            <li> This is an amazing brush.  I have a 3 year old who hates to brush her hair, I used this brush and she did not cry once.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It gives a good scalp massage</li>
            <li> I needed a new hairbrush, as I noticed it was breaking.  It&#x27;s a nice brush that has a couple of cool features.  The SH&amp;SH brush has a mirror on the back of it.  If you are on the go and are brushing blind, it lets you see how your hair looks.  Another nice feature are the bristles on the brush.  They work out knots in hair a bit easier than other ones I have used.  Finally, what drove me to buy it was the guarantee - the company guarantees product satisfaction.  I took a look at how you would redeem this, and it looks very hassle free.  Luckily, I won&#x27;t need to do this as I really enjoy the brush!</li>
            <li> As a father of three beautiful girls, brushing through tangled hair is a constant nightmare. This brush makes it SO easy and PAIN FREE! I absolutely love it and wish I had purchased one years ago. I can&#x27;t thank the inventor enough for eliminating the tears and fits that used to accompany hair-brushing time! The only problem we have now is our girls fighting over the brush! I have already told many others to order this brush and i plan on buying three more so my wife and daughters each have their own!&lt;br /&gt;Incredible pricing and super fast delivery. If you have hair, you want this brush!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the 8.00 ones on here, this handle is way to short, this pulls my hair and grandson sure didn&#x27;t like it, he said use the other. I am thinking about sending it back , not worth the money, this one is better. The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush, Colors Vary by Luxor Pro  1,247 customer reviews  | 31 answered questions&lt;br /&gt;List Price: $28.00 Price: $8.98 Free Shipping for Prime Members You Save: $19.02 (68%)&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest you buy this one. It goes through hair better and is a bigger brush. I gave my 19 yr old grand daughter the other one and she loves it, plus now the whole Volley Ball team wants one. She did not like this one, I gave to her the other day and she likes the mirror but says  the 8.98 is better.</li>
            <li> My little girl loves this Brush!!!  Received a promo code for a review!!!!</li>
            <li> Great brush!  My kids love it!</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the claim it was the number one brush.  I did not notice the sizing.  I had originally gone online to buy my favorite brush, the Cricket Static Free Fast Flo brush because Ulta had been out when I went to the store.  I was attracted to the cute colors and good reviews, but it is really small.  I guess that is why so many reviewers commented on how it is in their purses.  I only brush my hair before I wash it since my hair is very curly and I am doing a public service (you&#x27;re welcome), so I thought maybe other women carry giant brushes around in their purses.  Apparently, not.  This did brush through my thick, curly hair, but I am not in love with it.  I went back to Ulta and bought the Cricket after the first time I used this one.  It probably is perfect for little girls with thinner hair, but my daughter and I are not thrilled with it.  It&#x27;s a brush.  It brushes.  It is pretty small, but it is cute.</li>
            <li> granddaugher has very fine hair,when brushing her hair it hurt her.does not work has said.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my niece and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Liked it so much I bought two more.  Additional one for me, and one for a gift.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work, it was to small. It works. Surprise me.</li>
            <li> I love this dress its so adorable and I love the fact it has a small mirror and it works perfectly with my afro texture hair doesn&#x27;t pull any hair it just makes it bigger and more fluffy and easy to deal with</li>
            <li> My granddaughters love this brush..they hate brushing thier hair because of knots..not anymore since i bought them this brush</li>
            <li> I bought this Detangling Brush for my 8 year old daughter who has extremely difficult hair to brush! This brush works so much better then I thought it would, my daughter calls it her &amp;#34;Magic&amp;#34; Hairbrush! I love how brushing her hair is almost painless now, this is an Amazing product and would recommend it to anyone who has hard to detangle hair:-)</li>
            <li> worst $15 ever spent... does nothing different than a $2 brush. Mirror fell off back within a week of having... Would not recommend</li>
            <li> This item is extremely small. I was expecting a real, normal sized, brush. This is more like a tiny purse brush. Absolutely not large enough, nor are the bristles long enough, to work on long thick hair as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars, instead of 1 simply because my daughter decided to keep it in her purse.</li>
            <li> Great brush. The handle is a little short but it fits into my purse. Feels great on my scalp. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> It works good but not the best. My kids still scream</li>
            <li> Got the brush free... Love the color but my kids hair is curly and gets natted easy and the brush doesnt seem to do the work. Its smaller then i had imanged and girls cry when i use the brush.</li>
            <li> I like this brush since I have curly hair it tangles easy. I used this brush and was able to use it without pulling my hair when brushing through the tangles. I would recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> My 12 yr old has hair longer then her back and very thick! She uses this brush in the shower and when she gets out its quick and easy to do her hair because NO TANGLES! We both LOVED this brush. I&#x27;m getting one for my niece now!&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS item in Exchange FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> This brush looks like it will probably work as advertised but its definitely not what I was expecting. Its very small (the whole thing is maybe 6 inches tall) and does not look like a $22 hair brush. My daughter saw a &amp;#34;Magic Hair Brush&amp;#34; in the Young Explorer&#x27;s catalog and specifically asked for that for Christmas in her list to Santa. Its an odd request but I know how much she hates brushing her hair so I planned to comply. I wasn&#x27;t planning on getting anything from that catalog so I ordered this brush from Amazon because it looked just like the other one but unfortunately it showed up with a completely ripped and busted up box and the entire box is covered in Korean writing so it will be obvious its not what she asked for. I can still take it out of the box and leave it with her Santa gifts but that makes the $22 more painful since I will just be throwing into a basket or her stocking or something. Overall, its okay and I&#x27;m sure it works well for a small child, its just not what I was hoping for or expecting for that much money</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this and so does her her. The build quality is great and for the price you cant beat it.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush, especially on wet hair. I use it on my 4 year old. It is a smaller brush, perfect for a child&#x27;s hand and hair. The fun colors are great for her. I am so glad to have gotten it at a promo price to be able to review it. I plan to buy more to put in our car to keep to have onhand at all times.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and I have struggled for years to find a brush that won&#x27;t completely frizz it out or cause me to break of pieces off because it gets tangled in the ends. This brush is awesome and not only does it keep the frizz down for me, but I haven&#x27;t experienced a single incident of having to break off ends. I love the funky colors and the fact that it has a mirror on the back. It&#x27;s the perfect size to take in my purse if i want to or in my gym bag. Super fast delivery as well. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush my daughter hates getting her  hair brushed. She has long curly hair that is hard to comb unless its wet. This brush went right through it , didnt catch one tangle and she stood their without fussing. This brush will makes things 10x easier for me in the am.</li>
            <li> Love the small size, bright colors and mirror on back. Worked pretty good, but still pulled out a lot of hair. Better than what I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> When I got this brush in the mail I was skeptical at first because it does look cheaply made. Boy was I wrong! This brush works extremely well to detangle and get kinks out of hair. I am an African American woman and my daughter has kinky curly hair. I used this brush on her hair wet and dry and it got the tangles out.</li>
            <li> I have the mini version of this because I wanted one for my purse. I love it. I like that it has a mirror on the back of it! It doesn&#x27;t prevent static electricity, but that&#x27;s not really a big deal for me. I would buy this brush again if I needed to. :)</li>
            <li> This brush isn&#x27;t for people with long hair, it doesn&#x27;t detangle wet or dry hair.  It&#x27;s cute but doesn&#x27;t do the job!  Probably fit for people with SHORT hair, not worth the price.  Very disappointed....</li>
            <li> I feel this does better in shorter hair because it seems to work better but when I tried it wasn&#x27;t unknotting my long hair but I&#x27;m glad eliterwviews game me this chance to try with one of there codes</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter who&#x27;s hair is very thick and is very hard to manage. She does not like brushing her hair as her scalp is very sensitive. She said using this brush does not bother her at all.</li>
            <li> Very small.  Funky long bristles that take some getting used to.  Mirror on other side of head.</li>
            <li> Ok there is nothing Great about this Comb its actually Garbage.  Pulled Wife&#x27;s hair badly.  This thing is really small I would say for Toddler if that.</li>
            <li> My 6yo has fine hair that easily gets tangled.  She is also fiercely independent and hates for me to brush her hair.  I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;detangling&amp;#34; brushes, but she&#x27;s refused to use them because they pull her hair and she has a tender scalp.  I got the Detangling Hair Brush from SH&amp;SH in hopes that the compact design, the mirror, and colorful bristles would win her over.  She absolutely loves it and said &amp;#34;this brush doesn&#x27;t &#x27;jank&#x27; my hair out!&amp;#34;  Whereas before she&#x27;d run when I picked up the hairbrush, now she&#x27;s walking around the house brushing her own hair everyday.  She&#x27;s asked me to get her a purple one, too, and I think I will.  I am just tickled pink that she&#x27;ll brush her own hair now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount to facilitate this review.  All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I think it is okay. probably not all that it is hyped up to be.</li>
            <li> this brush works very well. I bought it to use on my Maltese. She has a full coat and when her hair gets wet from going outside it can be a nightmare to brush out her legs and belly. I love that the rubber bristles are waved so as not to catch big sections in each one but to work together to make tangles come out quickly. I would highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is good - smaller than I thought, but it does the job.  I would not call it a detangler brush though - my 4 year old screamed when I tried to use it.  It tugged at my hair too.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, works really well on my natural hair, no pulls or snags!!!! Brushes my products into my hair with ease!!! Very pleased and fast delivery!!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush is fine for detangling hair. I am not completely convinced yet that it is better than other types of brushes, but the design and colors are funky and fun.  The back of the brush has a mirror on it, which is great for checking your make-up or hair after you are done brushing.  I have very thick and coarse hair and wish the brush was a little bigger and the handle a little longer. I find the brush hard to use for styling, but then have to admit it is probably not designed for that anyway. Overall I think the brush is over priced and not very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*product received free or at a discount in exchange for my review</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  No more complaining from the kids that it hurts when I brush their hair.  My daughter has long, thick hair and this brush works great!</li>
            <li> I have seen videos and reviews for the wet brush and was consider purchasing one, when I seen this crazy looking brush in the recommended feed line. I suffer from extreme sensitivity of the scalp when brushing my hair. soo much so that i stopped brushing my hair unless it was wash day and even then it was literally so painful that i nearly cried. I didnt believe it would make that much of a difference but having a money back guarantee, i decided to try it. I am still amazed at how amazing this brush is! i can brush my hair everyday now! I would really like to know what it is that makes it so helpful. Definitely great for kids that dont like getting their hair done, and even for people with thinning hair or extensions as this brush also HIGHLY cuts down on shedding!. MAGIC!</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves this brush. She was a little taken back by how small it was when she opened the box but I told her that there were a bunch of amazon reviews raving about it. The colors are pretty funky and look great. Theres a little mirror on the back side of the brush as well. Focusing on the usage of the brush my wife has naturally straight hair but its a PAIN to comb it out after a shower even using good conditioner. This brush detangles her hair with great ease. She has used it with both dry and wet hair. It does take a little more work to use this on wet hair according to her but its a lot less painful then using her other brushes she has. I am not sure if its the placement of the plastic or the angles but she&#x27;s extremely pleased with the brush and really likes the size now that she&#x27;s been using it for the past few weeks. It fits nicely in her purse and she always carries it with her. She&#x27;s been bugging me to pick up a second one. Maybe I will as an anniversary gift haha.</li>
            <li> smaller than expected but works well.</li>
            <li> This brush took me by complete surprise. I was a little hesitant when I first ordered it, mostly I think cause I had never heard of the maker before. But when I got it and tried it on my daughters hair it was amazing. My daughter has very curly hair and it is very long and because of this it gets very tangled.Starting off I didn&#x27;t know what to think of the size, but as it turns out it fits comfortably in my hand when I do her hair every morning. And when my daughter brushes her hair at night she is able to get it all the way through her hair and it&#x27;s the perfect size for her. She also loves the fun design and colors. I&#x27;m so glad I gave this brush a try.</li>
            <li> This brush helped both of my girls a lot in the mornings with brushing their hair. One of them has hair she can sit on the other just has a sensitive scalp. We have had a lot less complaints with this brush with both girls. They love the colors and the mirror even though there is one in the bathroom. The only wish I have is that the handle was longer so that it was easier for me to brush their hair with it.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as the Wet Brush</li>
            <li> A week later I found one on ebay for $0.99 on ebay. It does help untangle my waste length hair without too much breakage.</li>
            <li> This brush made my hair frizzy so I&#x27;m using it in the shower as a wet brush.  It doesn&#x27;t work with tangles, pulls too much.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, been using it for 1 month and has been doing great its job...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this brush works on tangles.  My hair is very thin, baby fine and very long.  This brush removes all tangles without ripping the hair out of my scalp.</li>
            <li> I bouth this brush after the first one I purchased arrived broken.  A wonderful brush of getting out snarls in very curly hair!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I didn&#x27;t hear a scream out of my daughter while I was brushing her wet hair. I just wish it had a full size handle. Especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. When I first open the package was surprised at the size and thought it seemed a little small. But after just one use I realized it fit my hand perfect was comfortable and super easy to use. I used it first on myself. Now I have short, very fine, thin hair, after only a few days I noticed a difference, my hair seemed to have some extra body to it and did not just lay flat on top of my head. Next I tried it on my 5 year old granddaughter that hates having her hair brushed because it is quite curly and also full of tangles. Well what a pleasure after a few minutes she realized it didn’t hurt and we both got to enjoy the experience, this alone makes it worth every penny spent. Next I tried in on my longhaired dachshund (I know it’s for humans but what the heck) and he just stood and let me comb his ears without a fight. After washing it I went back to my own hair and use it every time I walk in the bathroom as it makes my hair feel great.  My only suggestion is that it would be nice to have a small bag so it could be carried in my purse, other than that it’s marvelous, and I truly love the little mirror that’s included on the back. All in all a great product. Oh almost forgot even thought it had said 7 to 10 days for arrival I got mine in only two days, can’t beat that.</li>
            <li> First off, the product is very small. Smaller than a travel brush which, in my opinion, makes it difficult to handle. Most importantly, doesn&#x27;t work  any better than a $1.99 brush from WalMart. We tried brushing it through my daughter long, fine hair and she complained just as much. I then tried it on my waist length thick hair and noticed no difference. Certainly not a $15 brush.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, just wish the handle was a bit longer.  Little bit short for my liking.  De-tangles with the best of them though.</li>
