            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I was originally happy to receive this product as a solution for my hyperhidrosis problem on my face.</li>
            <li>After reading great reviews I decided to try sweat shield</li>
            <li>i wasnt to happy with this product</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how happy I am but will wait for another 9 weeks after finishing the box to re-assess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I am so happy with that.</li>
            <li>I say that cause I sweat  a great deal.  </li>
            <li>The video on the Kleinert&#x27;s website about SweatShield being a great alternative to Botox injections is spot on.  </li>
            <li>Works great with Kleinert&#x27;s underarm dress shields.</li>
            <li>These work great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>Hi, Great and work better than another popular brand !!!!!  </li>
            <li>These sweat shield wipes are amazing!</li>
            <li>They are amazing!</li>
            <li>And the product is amazing as well!</li>
            <li>Really liked this product!</li>
            <li>Love them the best product I have ever brought myself</li>
            <li>I AM JUST BEING HONEST!</li>
            <li>Love this products works excellent .</li>
            <li>I thought getting this as an alternative to the sweatbloc, and honestly it does not compare!</li>
            <li>Sweat block (which did work but not as good as this), Obaban, Certin Dr, and another</li>
            <li>Fair warning to prospective buyers:  </li>
            <li>I received my product in good condition.</li>
            <li>Is not as good as Sweat Block</li>
            <li>I applied it two days in a row just to see how good it could be</li>
            <li>It is good in situations where I feel I might be nervous and may perspire.</li>
            <li>These work surprisingly well --</li>
            <li>They also have good adhesive to help them stay in place.</li>
            <li>Good coverage.</li>
            <li>and yes just as good as &amp;#34;SweatBlock&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Gave one to my brother to try &amp; he loved them.  </li>
            <li>good product.. does the job its supposed to do</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, will reorder.</li>
            <li>It really is a great product, and I&#x27;m so glad to have found it.</li>
            <li>These are very effective and can be used more than once</li>
            <li>I am on day 5 of this stuff and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>Still better than having b.o.!</li>
            <li>What matters MOST is HOW to STOP the SWEATING!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I have been able to use just deodorant for days, which is a pleasant change.</li>
            <li>They work great and don&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>Just amazing product</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing solution to what has bothered me for years.</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice for them to offer me a product like this.</li>
            <li>I had been using the more pricey brand &amp;#34;Sweatblock&amp;#34; which worked well to be fair, but I decided to try &amp;#34;Kleinerts Sweat Shield&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I tried every kind of stick deodorant including the prescription strenth ones.</li>
            <li>Was using the roll-on type and that worked OK, but this is way more convenient and effective!</li>
            <li>Kleinerts, by far, provides the highest quality product and the best coverage.  </li>
            <li>i sweat more than i should and had to use 2 wipes to get any kind of protection..</li>
            <li>Kleinerts is just bit stronger than Sweatblock and much more cost effective.  </li>
            <li>This product works well and is easy to use!</li>
            <li>Very effective product that allows you to feel confident no matter what life throws your way sold by a business that ships quickly.</li>
            <li>They can make noise if you&#x27;re wearing a more loose-fit shirt, but these are still the best dress shields by far.</li>
            <li>A shower, followed by a quick application and you&#x27;re good for about 5 days to a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is better than sweat block (and way cheaper), lasts longer too</li>
            <li>More relaxed, virtually nothing.</li>
            <li>They lasted most of a 12 hour work day without showing through an stayed in place.</li>
            <li>They function ok.</li>
            <li>Also, if you have the top button of your dress shirt undone be sure to get the &amp;#34;Deep V-Neck&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Works fabulously!  </li>
            <li>I used this product as soon as i received it, because it looked really interesting, i had never seen or used anything like this before.  </li>
            <li>plus you get 2 more.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the application instructions as directed.</li>
            <li>Love this product.y daughter sweats a lot and this product is used once a week and her prespiration has decrease.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been getting so much more compliments on my face complexion from friends and strangers that my skin looks poreless.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>I received this product for free for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li>All-in-all I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and plan to keep using this</li>
            <li>, it works better then this.</li>
            <li>I shall be buying more as I find it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use them on my face and it did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love these antiperspirant wipes.  </li>
            <li>which is at a more discounted price and has more product.</li>
            <li>Me and my husband love this product.</li>
            <li>she feels confident when wearing them that she won&#x27;t have embarrassing sweat stains on her shirt</li>
            <li>These are better than another brand I paid $20 for.</li>
            <li>It blocks the spreading of perspiration on my clothes allowing me to be more confident in my day to day life.</li>
            <li>so I am satisfied and will order again.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Omg I so love these.</li>
            <li>All that, plus the lower cost and more wipes per package makes Sweat Block a winner.  </li>
            <li>Being shiny however is a hell of a lot better than being sweaty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much more than that</li>
            <li>Plus you get more shields per box.  </li>
            <li>They stop my sweating for 3-4 days, which is okay.</li>
            <li>That only lasts for a bit, then it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>i thought what the heck, more snake oil.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using them :)</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I originally tried the Sweat Block, which also works, but this one is as effective.  </li>
            <li>I can now wear whatever color, no need for undershirts, no shirts getting ruined from deodorant and sweat stains, I can wear more fitting close now without worrying about sweating through it so easily, etc etc.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my underarms dry for a couple days just as promised which is awesome.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve never tried the other brand but tried this first because of the good reviews and lower price, and I am very happy with it and it works for me as intended.</li>
            <li>I keep smelling myself to make sure I&#x27;m odor free.</li>
            <li>you will be sweat free, just make sure you apply it at night</li>
            <li>Kleinerts is such a good brand!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed that it worked extremely well</li>
            <li>I have used other types but this has worked the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to resort to using very mild deodorant while the skin under my arms heals.</li>
            <li>Strong tingling sensations comes when you begin to sweat where applied.</li>
            <li>It also smells strongly of cloves.</li>
            <li>the smell isn&#x27;t as strong.  </li>
            <li>Sweat Block pads have a really strong smell.</li>
            <li>an amazing product, I just bought one to try it out and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>but it was effective with hydrocortisone cream during my first use</li>
            <li>Although, of course, I had to reapply the product again once a week was over, but that was completely fine with me.  </li>
            <li>Not prime but came very quickly (couple days) free ship.</li>
            <li>The only quality these have over Sweat Block pads is that they smell a lot more pleasant (to me anyway).</li>
            <li>For me, that&#x27;s fantastic -</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product because it hides underarm marks from overperspiring.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a great track record on the type of sweat that comes from the head and face, and I believe it&#x27;s actually not recommended for use on the face.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Great for when we are traveling and don&#x27;t have daily shower access!</li>
            <li>but I will still sweat a bit and any light activity</li>
            <li>use the wipes for two consecutive days, applying to my forehead, then I can go up to 4 days sweat free, until again applying before bed.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>Both have the same great results.......</li>
            <li>I received it free in exchanged for my unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li>i received the Shield ultra for free to try it and give it a review.</li>
            <li>Great if you are very self-conscious about sweating so much</li>
            <li>so far so good, the dampness irritates my skin a bit</li>
            <li>really like this stuff, its great.. just use one day and the whole week</li>
            <li>I deal with a pretty overwhelming issue with armpit sweat, sometimes to the point where the stain is huge and noticeable.</li>
            <li>But it passes and trust me, its worth it!</li>
            <li>Significant improvement in underarm perspiration.  </li>
            <li>There is a significant reduction of sweating in my underarm.</li>
            <li>But, being rather hairy, I&#x27;ve found it works better if the problem areas are shaved first (and wait 12-24 hours to apply).</li>
            <li>I felt....not clean?  </li>
            <li>Its a great feeling to know I&#x27;m dry.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to everyone, especially those that are hot natured, lol.</li>
            <li>Bright white &amp; protects sheets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a prescription strength of the same ingredient and these are just as good</li>
            <li>We will be purchasing more very soon.</li>
            <li>Although it worked great, it extremely burned my armpits</li>
            <li>May work for a mild sweate .</li>
            <li>Quick update:</li>
            <li>I live in the Phoenix, Arizona area and we sweat most of the year.  </li>
            <li>Lasted all day even on hot and humid days!</li>
            <li>I love them and they are individually wrapped so they are easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Stick with the cheap Certain Dri from Walgreens</li>
            <li>The clove-like scent is nice, but not as strong as the other brand either.  </li>
            <li>While this product is certainly strong and can lead to some irritation with overuse--especially for those with sensitive skin--it also actually significantly curbs sweating.</li>
            <li>and I used this once and got over a week of no sweating or wetness on my shirt from it, way worth it for me.  </li>
            <li>worth it in my opinion</li>
            <li>I took a warm shower, so my sweat glands and pores would open up to absorb the product afterwards.</li>
            <li>I suppose the skin under your arms is more sensitive though.</li>
            <li>It does have a stink to it, and an itch, but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The perspiration did stop but the discomfort wasn&#x27;t worth it to continue use on my back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was pleased and surprised at how well these shields prevent and minimize sweating.</li>
            <li>Either way, it&#x27;s still worth trying and using.</li>
            <li>I started sweating lightly on day 7 and it all came down on day 8, so make sure to keep up with it!</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t start sweating right away.</li>
            <li>This was the first time that nothing happening was such an amazing feeling.</li>
            <li>Able to open up the full wardrobe of clothes again</li>
            <li>I do not get the &amp;#34;7 days” out it, but now it is very effective the first day, and it lessens a little bit each day, but I can get all the way until Friday wearing just one shirt.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not bad or real noticable</li>
            <li>I only recently started to use this and found it to be a great product.</li>
            <li>But, as I said, my problem is pretty profuse.</li>
            <li>So I warned every customers be aware of  the statement maintained by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will immediately throw this product into trash bin as soon as I recovered and went back home.</li>
            <li>She only use deodorant weekly instead of paying more for an antiperspirant /deodorant</li>
            <li>I all but replaced all my clothing with 100% cotton or linen fabrics, traumatized to purchase anything outside of these fabrics because they are the most breathable.</li>
            <li>I ended up choosing Sweat Shield Ultra instead for its higher percentage of Aluminum Chloride than Sweat Block, assuming it must have a stronger effect.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I followed the directions on the box.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t feel discouraged or give up on this product after the first trial.</li>
            <li>First thing I&#x27;ve found to work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be warned, the first use felt like being stung by dozens of bees.</li>
            <li>No burning (as others reviews have &amp;#34;claimed&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used sweat block(recommended by several) and this works waaay better.</li>
            <li>The first time I used 1 wipe per pit, but afterwards 1 wipe was sufficient to reduce my underarm sweating by 90%.</li>
            <li>These really work!  </li>
            <li>These REALLY work!  </li>
            <li>I TRIED IT SEVERAL MORE WEEKS</li>
            <li>Love it this product and sweat block are the only 2 things that work, i tryed all kinds of stuff before nothing worked</li>
            <li>I have bought many different things to help with the sweating but noting worked until this.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>Let me first start by stating, I understand this isn&#x27;t intended for what i used it for</li>
            <li>I have tried many different creams and lotions and face washes and non of them</li>
            <li>I decided to give these a try and let me first explain the feeling, my face felt like it was itchy for minutes and than i couldn&#x27;t feel anything happen at all.</li>
            <li>Then wipes do irritate my face when first applied.</li>
            <li>I used some hydrocortisone cream &amp; it got better but eventually came back.</li>
            <li>but I had itchy for about the first 24 hours.</li>
            <li>One thing to possibly be aware of--when I first start using this product, it caused me some itching and tightening skin for that one night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible and it only happened the first time I used it, but don&#x27;t give up on the product if that happens to you.</li>
            <li>ya get more packets for the same price as the competitor</li>
            <li>The next day, it worked perfectly and I did sweat a little, but I would consider it to be normal sweating.  </li>
            <li>I stopped for about a week and a half and found it wasn&#x27;t as effective as day one (maybe it was too hot?).</li>
            <li>Con: for the first time, I don&#x27;t really have a con, I understand what this chemical is doing</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to stay dry.</li>
            <li>Not only does it resolve the issue within about 96% percent, they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>I even tried certain dri.</li>
            <li>The problem I had was the area on my back where I applied these experienced a &amp;#34;pins and needles&amp;#34; sensation on and off for about a week and a half.  </li>
            <li>But this stuff worked magic for me, and I would strongly encourage anyone with this problem to try it at least once.</li>
            <li>I am the only one dripping in a crowded NYC train while everyone else is fine.</li>
            <li>When I first applied it kinda tingled, kinda stung, but that went away pretty quick (10mins~) and now 3 days later</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I sweat profusely (like a 10&amp;#34; diameter circle of sweat around my armpits and when I use these once a week it is absolutely gone.</li>
            <li>and they really have helped</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to write reviews but this product really works.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anybody!</li>
            <li>I felt very discouraged and decided to stop using the product.  </li>
            <li>This has been a real lifesaver.</li>
            <li>This product really works if you suffer from hyperhidrosis.</li>
            <li>If I wear a shirt for more than two minutes there will be noticeable wet spots under the arms.</li>
            <li>but they really really work.</li>
            <li>Thankfully this product really did eliminate the issue.  </li>
            <li>, it was really embarrassing</li>
            <li>really worked that well for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for this summer to really test this out and.</li>
            <li>I know it is responsible for taming that,</li>
            <li>These work really well for me.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for temporary relief!</li>
            <li>I really like these for the protection they offer.</li>
            <li>no damage at all to my very pricy costume.  </li>
            <li>idk if it was my body or i used to much.</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of fitted blazers often with sleeveless jackets and really needed something like this to stop my jackets deteriorating.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I am a nurse and blocking the glands in one area isn&#x27;t problematic for the whole body unless I&#x27;m in an excess of heat or</li>
            <li>My face does has a shiny look now, at times it appears as if i have on too much lotion.</li>
            <li>I used 1 wipe for all those areas and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Fast forward to me searching the internet for solutions.</li>
            <li>Since I am using mine on my face (as opposed to my pits) I don&#x27;t need to use the whole cloth.</li>
            <li>You get more wipes for less money, and for my first use, the effects were longer-lived.  </li>
            <li>At first I had to do a couple of applications a week, but quickly over time I went to only once a week to now</li>
            <li>This product is MAGICAL, I&#x27;ll be a customer for as long as this company exists!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a terribly &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; person either - no one who knows me would think I have an issue other than my arm</li>
            <li>Many of the other brands didn&#x27;t adhere and would peel off as I put my arm in the sleeve.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to deal with excessive sweating (mostly in the underarm area), since puberty, and now I almost never sweat through my shirts when I use these!</li>
            <li>They are a better value than the other brand we used to buy and have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Better than the other guys.</li>
            <li>The wipes are larger than sweat-block and super moist, I normally keep the wipe in a Ziploc bag after the first use and lasts me another week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I figured maybe it&#x27;d be good for being outside in the heat, but even at the gym I find myself sweating less</li>
            <li>It works as good as any other sweat protector, as long as you apply it correctly.</li>
            <li>Okay, if you really want to nitpick, it stings a little bit but compared to what it does?</li>
            <li>So I reverted back to wearing layers of clothing in an attempt to hide the sweat marks on my shirts, which was not only hot and embarrassing but also costly, as the shirts needed to be replaced more frequently.</li>
            <li>Bought a whole new wardrobe.</li>
            <li>Trust me, you get more and pay less with these.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident and can finally wear shirts that aren&#x27;t white or black.</li>
            <li>If this product can cause chemical burn on my facial skin, I doubt how many others would be affected in a similar way.  </li>
            <li>Except here you get more product, larger sheet, slightly larger package.  </li>
            <li>its decent.</li>
            <li>The main point is that Sweat Shield works just as well as Sweatblock.  </li>
            <li>My particular type of HH is that I sweat profusely from my FACE.</li>
            <li>He wears a bullet proof vest everyday and he tends to get over heated pretty easy - so these shields gives him a bit of protection from the under arm sweat coming thru his work shirts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad that I found this product; I used to worry all day about pit stains and avoid anything that was tight in the sleeves.</li>
            <li>However,  this product may not be for high perspiration activities.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so the high aluminum content will probably gimme Alzheimer&#x27;s</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Truly blown away by the results, my wife and I attended a large formal function that was outdoors in direct sunlight in 90 degree mid-August Georgia humidity......</li>
            <li>So a little bit of pain for not being drenched in sweat all week is okay by me.</li>
            <li>my whole adult life and these wipes make a difference, I use one wipe once a week</li>
            <li>Keep shirts dry and clean.</li>
            <li>I use deodorant as I normally do each morning</li>
            <li>However, it can sting a lot when applied, and it is very precise as to how and when you must apply it, such as at night after a shower and you cannot sweat or get it wet until it dries.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughter who gets embarrassed after PE due to sweat stains, these have made a huge difference in her confidence.  </li>
            <li>I hope this helps and for those of you in my shoes, give this a shot, because you know how embarrassing it can be to live with your face always sweating and everyone wondering why.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t even heard of antiperspirant wipes before, I was trying something new.</li>
            <li>I used these with my Marie Antoinette Halloween costume which had very tight fitting sleeves</li>
            <li>or it can really dry your armpits out  and cause mild itching.</li>
            <li>Through medical tests, I was confirmed that this product is not causing allergic reactions on my facial skin, but in fact a chemical burn situation.  </li>
            <li>and I would be sweating more with big wet stains on my shirt not even halfway through the day</li>
            <li>On busy, high stress days I may end up with about a quarter sized sweat stain.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of itching on my underarms after the first few applications but this quickly went away and was never a problem after that.</li>
            <li>i would say that 7 days is a suggestion, but that could change based on how hot it is outside and your activity level.</li>
            <li>Truly the first thing I&#x27;ve used that has actually worked.  </li>
            <li>At first I was reluctant because you apply at night after showering, and it seemed almost like a cleanser instead of traditional deodorant.  </li>
            <li>They can be a bit itchy at first, but in my experience, that goes away after the 2nd application or so as your skin gets used to them.</li>
            <li>It works exactly the same as the Sweatblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sweat profusely, and have ruined many shirts due to yellow stains under my arms.  </li>
            <li>I also do sweat more than average on my palms, feet, back, etc.</li>
            <li>I previously purchased the &amp;#34;Sweat Block&amp;#34; product marketed by Amazon, but thought I would take a chance to try this product as it contains more wipes per box, a higher concentration of active ingredient, and a lower price.</li>
            <li>It sorta worked, but I didn&#x27;t get the smooth and dry feeling that I get from my regular stick anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li>I am a male and therefore use them for a more typical role but if you have never tried using a product like this</li>
            <li>Not only do you get more wipes with this product than others, it costs less.</li>
            <li>Maybe less it absorbed by the hair or wasted, or more is applied directly to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Effective and less skin irritation than other brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, just to be clear, for me, it&#x27;s not 100%.</li>
            <li>They work really well, last longer than 7 days for me (unless i spend time in the sauna) and do not irritate my (sensitive) skin.  </li>
            <li>I would sometimes sweat through my shirts and it would make me self conscious for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>So far after two week use it works....</li>
            <li>That might just be me, I have sensitive skin and underarms, they get irritated by some deodorants as well.</li>
            <li>Although sweating is natural, over sweating was embarrassing for me.</li>
            <li>Would be 5 stars and beyond if not for the tingling and skin irritation which makes too frequent use prohibitive.</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t complained at all this year :)</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, you will get some redness, but it goes away after a day.</li>
            <li>These really do work if you use them properly (like the directions say).</li>
            <li>It says that there are ten wipes in the package and also says that there were ten weeks worth of wipes in the box</li>
            <li>Otherwise keeps pretty dry all day.</li>
            <li>I assume someone that sweats less than me could probably get the full week out of it.</li>
            <li>After I put it on at night before going to bed, it makes my underarms feel really itchy and irritated, like a bad bug bite sort of, and that seems to last a long time, so I just have to try my best to ignore and fall asleep through the irritation.</li>
            <li>and I knew my chances of it stopping my particular type of sweating weren&#x27;t good, but I was desperate.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my attending doctor said such a high concentration 15% of aluminum chloride is highly likely to cause chemical burn on face, and I am lucky enough that I consult medical treatment early, or else</li>
            <li>They both work the same, only Kleinerts costs less and gives you more product.</li>
            <li>Finally after years of excessively sweating from the face and top of scalp (hairline area), a remedy has been found.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First time using can be sort of itchy/uncomfortable, but after taking a shower the next morning or later in the evening it goes away.</li>
            <li>I’ve read that with regular use, it may last more than the expected 7 days, up to a week or two, so I am now trying regularly, shaving Saturdays and applying Sunday nights.</li>
            <li>I recommend these to anyone that wants to stay dry.</li>
            <li>do a lot of outdoor activity and can really work up a sweat especially when it&#x27;s humid outside.  </li>
            <li>Then to make matters worse,  I get nervous and self conscious which makes me sweat even more.</li>
            <li>I did the same thing as before by using two pads, one on the first night and the second pad on the second night.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, least my pits are still funk free on day 4</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li>My experience may not be the same as those without sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I tried all kinds of different remedies that I read about online, like using baby powder, and apple vinegar, and also trying nearly every type of deodorant/antiperspirant</li>
            <li>it happens, I needed a different thyroid medication, and after the switch, I am virtually back to normal.  </li>
            <li>After some trial and error, I have found this to be rather effective for my difficult hyperhidrosis.</li>
            <li>it works very well and is cheaper compared to other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; antiperspirant products and found that most of the roll on varieties yielded few results but created a lot of skin irritation.</li>
            <li>This product keeps me dry under pressure and saved my professional and social life!!!</li>
            <li>The first night after application had a little irritation but basically just felt like a tickle..</li>
            <li>I highly suggest for face and places where you have less sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Try it for a few time, but did not like it very much.</li>
            <li>However, on the very first night of application of half of a single wipe, I was sent to the chemical burn centre for treatment via the emergency department.</li>
            <li>I use it at night, it does not make me want to scratch my armpits raw in the middle of the night, doesn&#x27;t burn, has a slight odor to it but more like a chemical odor</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s available in stores with little to no success.  </li>
            <li>Little to no sweat stains the first day and the next day , nothing at all.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skiddish of this product at first, seeing how I didn&#x27;t believe a wipe could actually solve my sweating problem.  </li>
            <li>I have extreme armpit sweat at times and this product kept my pits dry for nearly a whole week!</li>
            <li>but, I found that using these towelettes not only irritated my skin, it actually broke me out into hives not long after using it.  </li>

            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I was originally happy to receive this product as a solution for my hyperhidrosis problem on my face.</li>
            <li> After reading great reviews I decided to try sweat shield</li>
            <li> i wasnt to happy with this product</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how happy I am but will wait for another 9 weeks after finishing the box to re-assess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am so happy with that.</li>
            <li> I say that cause I sweat  a great deal.  </li>
            <li> The video on the Kleinert&#x27;s website about SweatShield being a great alternative to Botox injections is spot on.  </li>
            <li> Works great with Kleinert&#x27;s underarm dress shields.</li>
            <li> These work great.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> Love this products works excellent .</li>
            <li> I thought getting this as an alternative to the sweatbloc, and honestly it does not compare!</li>
            <li> Sweat block (which did work but not as good as this), Obaban, Certin Dr, and another</li>
            <li> Fair warning to prospective buyers:  </li>
            <li> I received my product in good condition.</li>
            <li> Is not as good as Sweat Block</li>
            <li> I applied it two days in a row just to see how good it could be</li>
            <li> It is good in situations where I feel I might be nervous and may perspire.</li>
            <li> These work surprisingly well --</li>
            <li> They also have good adhesive to help them stay in place.</li>
            <li> Good coverage.</li>
            <li> and yes just as good as &amp;#34;SweatBlock&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Gave one to my brother to try &amp; he loved them.  </li>
            <li> good product.. does the job its supposed to do</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, will reorder.</li>
            <li> It really is a great product, and I&#x27;m so glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> These are very effective and can be used more than once</li>
            <li> I am on day 5 of this stuff and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> Still better than having b.o.!</li>
            <li> What matters MOST is HOW to STOP the SWEATING!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have been able to use just deodorant for days, which is a pleasant change.</li>
            <li> They work great and don&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Just amazing product</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing solution to what has bothered me for years.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice for them to offer me a product like this.</li>
            <li> I had been using the more pricey brand &amp;#34;Sweatblock&amp;#34; which worked well to be fair, but I decided to try &amp;#34;Kleinerts Sweat Shield&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I tried every kind of stick deodorant including the prescription strenth ones.</li>
            <li> Was using the roll-on type and that worked OK, but this is way more convenient and effective!</li>
            <li> Kleinerts, by far, provides the highest quality product and the best coverage.  </li>
            <li> i sweat more than i should and had to use 2 wipes to get any kind of protection..</li>
            <li> Kleinerts is just bit stronger than Sweatblock and much more cost effective.  </li>
            <li> This product works well and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> Very effective product that allows you to feel confident no matter what life throws your way sold by a business that ships quickly.</li>
            <li> They can make noise if you&#x27;re wearing a more loose-fit shirt, but these are still the best dress shields by far.</li>
            <li> A shower, followed by a quick application and you&#x27;re good for about 5 days to a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is better than sweat block (and way cheaper), lasts longer too</li>
            <li> More relaxed, virtually nothing.</li>
            <li> They lasted most of a 12 hour work day without showing through an stayed in place.</li>
            <li> They function ok.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have the top button of your dress shirt undone be sure to get the &amp;#34;Deep V-Neck&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Works fabulously!  </li>
            <li> I used this product as soon as i received it, because it looked really interesting, i had never seen or used anything like this before.  </li>
            <li> plus you get 2 more.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the application instructions as directed.</li>
            <li> Love this product.y daughter sweats a lot and this product is used once a week and her prespiration has decrease.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been getting so much more compliments on my face complexion from friends and strangers that my skin looks poreless.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I received this product for free for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> All-in-all I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and plan to keep using this</li>
            <li> , it works better then this.</li>
            <li> I shall be buying more as I find it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to use them on my face and it did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love these antiperspirant wipes.  </li>
            <li> which is at a more discounted price and has more product.</li>
            <li> Me and my husband love this product.</li>
            <li> she feels confident when wearing them that she won&#x27;t have embarrassing sweat stains on her shirt</li>
            <li> These are better than another brand I paid $20 for.</li>
            <li> It blocks the spreading of perspiration on my clothes allowing me to be more confident in my day to day life.</li>
            <li> so I am satisfied and will order again.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Omg I so love these.</li>
            <li> All that, plus the lower cost and more wipes per package makes Sweat Block a winner.  </li>
            <li> Being shiny however is a hell of a lot better than being sweaty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much more than that</li>
            <li> Plus you get more shields per box.  </li>
            <li> They stop my sweating for 3-4 days, which is okay.</li>
            <li> That only lasts for a bit, then it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> i thought what the heck, more snake oil.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using them :)</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I originally tried the Sweat Block, which also works, but this one is as effective.  </li>
            <li> I can now wear whatever color, no need for undershirts, no shirts getting ruined from deodorant and sweat stains, I can wear more fitting close now without worrying about sweating through it so easily, etc etc.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my underarms dry for a couple days just as promised which is awesome.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never tried the other brand but tried this first because of the good reviews and lower price, and I am very happy with it and it works for me as intended.</li>
            <li> I keep smelling myself to make sure I&#x27;m odor free.</li>
            <li> you will be sweat free, just make sure you apply it at night</li>
            <li> Kleinerts is such a good brand!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed that it worked extremely well</li>
            <li> I have used other types but this has worked the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to resort to using very mild deodorant while the skin under my arms heals.</li>
            <li> Strong tingling sensations comes when you begin to sweat where applied.</li>
            <li> It also smells strongly of cloves.</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t as strong.  </li>
            <li> Sweat Block pads have a really strong smell.</li>
            <li> an amazing product, I just bought one to try it out and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> but it was effective with hydrocortisone cream during my first use</li>
            <li> Although, of course, I had to reapply the product again once a week was over, but that was completely fine with me.  </li>
            <li> Not prime but came very quickly (couple days) free ship.</li>
            <li> The only quality these have over Sweat Block pads is that they smell a lot more pleasant (to me anyway).</li>
            <li> For me, that&#x27;s fantastic -</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product because it hides underarm marks from overperspiring.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a great track record on the type of sweat that comes from the head and face, and I believe it&#x27;s actually not recommended for use on the face.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Great for when we are traveling and don&#x27;t have daily shower access!</li>
            <li> but I will still sweat a bit and any light activity</li>
            <li> use the wipes for two consecutive days, applying to my forehead, then I can go up to 4 days sweat free, until again applying before bed.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Both have the same great results.......</li>
            <li> I received it free in exchanged for my unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li> i received the Shield ultra for free to try it and give it a review.</li>
            <li> Great if you are very self-conscious about sweating so much</li>
            <li> so far so good, the dampness irritates my skin a bit</li>
            <li> really like this stuff, its great.. just use one day and the whole week</li>
            <li> I deal with a pretty overwhelming issue with armpit sweat, sometimes to the point where the stain is huge and noticeable.</li>
            <li> But it passes and trust me, its worth it!</li>
            <li> Significant improvement in underarm perspiration.  </li>
            <li> There is a significant reduction of sweating in my underarm.</li>
            <li> But, being rather hairy, I&#x27;ve found it works better if the problem areas are shaved first (and wait 12-24 hours to apply).</li>
            <li> I felt....not clean?  </li>
            <li> Its a great feeling to know I&#x27;m dry.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone, especially those that are hot natured, lol.</li>
            <li> Bright white &amp; protects sheets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a prescription strength of the same ingredient and these are just as good</li>
            <li> We will be purchasing more very soon.</li>
            <li> Although it worked great, it extremely burned my armpits</li>
            <li> May work for a mild sweate .</li>
            <li> Quick update:</li>
            <li> I live in the Phoenix, Arizona area and we sweat most of the year.  </li>
            <li> Lasted all day even on hot and humid days!</li>
            <li> I love them and they are individually wrapped so they are easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Stick with the cheap Certain Dri from Walgreens</li>
            <li> The clove-like scent is nice, but not as strong as the other brand either.  </li>
            <li> While this product is certainly strong and can lead to some irritation with overuse--especially for those with sensitive skin--it also actually significantly curbs sweating.</li>
            <li> and I used this once and got over a week of no sweating or wetness on my shirt from it, way worth it for me.  </li>
            <li> worth it in my opinion</li>
            <li> I took a warm shower, so my sweat glands and pores would open up to absorb the product afterwards.</li>
            <li> I suppose the skin under your arms is more sensitive though.</li>
            <li> It does have a stink to it, and an itch, but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The perspiration did stop but the discomfort wasn&#x27;t worth it to continue use on my back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was pleased and surprised at how well these shields prevent and minimize sweating.</li>
            <li> Either way, it&#x27;s still worth trying and using.</li>
            <li> I started sweating lightly on day 7 and it all came down on day 8, so make sure to keep up with it!</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t start sweating right away.</li>
            <li> This was the first time that nothing happening was such an amazing feeling.</li>
            <li> Able to open up the full wardrobe of clothes again</li>
            <li> I do not get the &amp;#34;7 days” out it, but now it is very effective the first day, and it lessens a little bit each day, but I can get all the way until Friday wearing just one shirt.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not bad or real noticable</li>
            <li> I only recently started to use this and found it to be a great product.</li>
            <li> But, as I said, my problem is pretty profuse.</li>
            <li> So I warned every customers be aware of  the statement maintained by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I am sure I will immediately throw this product into trash bin as soon as I recovered and went back home.</li>
            <li> She only use deodorant weekly instead of paying more for an antiperspirant /deodorant</li>
            <li> I all but replaced all my clothing with 100% cotton or linen fabrics, traumatized to purchase anything outside of these fabrics because they are the most breathable.</li>
            <li> I ended up choosing Sweat Shield Ultra instead for its higher percentage of Aluminum Chloride than Sweat Block, assuming it must have a stronger effect.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I followed the directions on the box.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel discouraged or give up on this product after the first trial.</li>
            <li> First thing I&#x27;ve found to work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned, the first use felt like being stung by dozens of bees.</li>
            <li> No burning (as others reviews have &amp;#34;claimed&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sweat block(recommended by several) and this works waaay better.</li>
            <li> The first time I used 1 wipe per pit, but afterwards 1 wipe was sufficient to reduce my underarm sweating by 90%.</li>
            <li> These really work!  </li>
            <li> These REALLY work!  </li>
            <li> I TRIED IT SEVERAL MORE WEEKS</li>
            <li> Love it this product and sweat block are the only 2 things that work, i tryed all kinds of stuff before nothing worked</li>
            <li> I have bought many different things to help with the sweating but noting worked until this.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> Let me first start by stating, I understand this isn&#x27;t intended for what i used it for</li>
            <li> I have tried many different creams and lotions and face washes and non of them</li>
            <li> I decided to give these a try and let me first explain the feeling, my face felt like it was itchy for minutes and than i couldn&#x27;t feel anything happen at all.</li>
            <li> Then wipes do irritate my face when first applied.</li>
            <li> I used some hydrocortisone cream &amp; it got better but eventually came back.</li>
            <li> but I had itchy for about the first 24 hours.</li>
            <li> One thing to possibly be aware of--when I first start using this product, it caused me some itching and tightening skin for that one night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible and it only happened the first time I used it, but don&#x27;t give up on the product if that happens to you.</li>
            <li> ya get more packets for the same price as the competitor</li>
            <li> The next day, it worked perfectly and I did sweat a little, but I would consider it to be normal sweating.  </li>
            <li> I stopped for about a week and a half and found it wasn&#x27;t as effective as day one (maybe it was too hot?).</li>
            <li> Con: for the first time, I don&#x27;t really have a con, I understand what this chemical is doing</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to stay dry.</li>
            <li> Not only does it resolve the issue within about 96% percent, they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I even tried certain dri.</li>
            <li> The problem I had was the area on my back where I applied these experienced a &amp;#34;pins and needles&amp;#34; sensation on and off for about a week and a half.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff worked magic for me, and I would strongly encourage anyone with this problem to try it at least once.</li>
            <li> I am the only one dripping in a crowded NYC train while everyone else is fine.</li>
            <li> When I first applied it kinda tingled, kinda stung, but that went away pretty quick (10mins~) and now 3 days later</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I sweat profusely (like a 10&amp;#34; diameter circle of sweat around my armpits and when I use these once a week it is absolutely gone.</li>
            <li> and they really have helped</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews but this product really works.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anybody!</li>
            <li> I felt very discouraged and decided to stop using the product.  </li>
            <li> This has been a real lifesaver.</li>
            <li> This product really works if you suffer from hyperhidrosis.</li>
            <li> If I wear a shirt for more than two minutes there will be noticeable wet spots under the arms.</li>
            <li> but they really really work.</li>
            <li> Thankfully this product really did eliminate the issue.  </li>
            <li> , it was really embarrassing</li>
            <li> really worked that well for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for this summer to really test this out and.</li>
            <li> I know it is responsible for taming that,</li>
            <li> These work really well for me.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for temporary relief!</li>
            <li> I really like these for the protection they offer.</li>
            <li> no damage at all to my very pricy costume.  </li>
            <li> idk if it was my body or i used to much.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of fitted blazers often with sleeveless jackets and really needed something like this to stop my jackets deteriorating.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and blocking the glands in one area isn&#x27;t problematic for the whole body unless I&#x27;m in an excess of heat or</li>
            <li> My face does has a shiny look now, at times it appears as if i have on too much lotion.</li>
            <li> I used 1 wipe for all those areas and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast forward to me searching the internet for solutions.</li>
            <li> Since I am using mine on my face (as opposed to my pits) I don&#x27;t need to use the whole cloth.</li>
            <li> You get more wipes for less money, and for my first use, the effects were longer-lived.  </li>
            <li> At first I had to do a couple of applications a week, but quickly over time I went to only once a week to now</li>
            <li> This product is MAGICAL, I&#x27;ll be a customer for as long as this company exists!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a terribly &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; person either - no one who knows me would think I have an issue other than my arm</li>
            <li> Many of the other brands didn&#x27;t adhere and would peel off as I put my arm in the sleeve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to deal with excessive sweating (mostly in the underarm area), since puberty, and now I almost never sweat through my shirts when I use these!</li>
            <li> They are a better value than the other brand we used to buy and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Better than the other guys.</li>
            <li> The wipes are larger than sweat-block and super moist, I normally keep the wipe in a Ziploc bag after the first use and lasts me another week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I figured maybe it&#x27;d be good for being outside in the heat, but even at the gym I find myself sweating less</li>
            <li> It works as good as any other sweat protector, as long as you apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> Okay, if you really want to nitpick, it stings a little bit but compared to what it does?</li>
            <li> So I reverted back to wearing layers of clothing in an attempt to hide the sweat marks on my shirts, which was not only hot and embarrassing but also costly, as the shirts needed to be replaced more frequently.</li>
            <li> Bought a whole new wardrobe.</li>
            <li> Trust me, you get more and pay less with these.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident and can finally wear shirts that aren&#x27;t white or black.</li>
            <li> If this product can cause chemical burn on my facial skin, I doubt how many others would be affected in a similar way.  </li>
            <li> Except here you get more product, larger sheet, slightly larger package.  </li>
            <li> its decent.</li>
            <li> The main point is that Sweat Shield works just as well as Sweatblock.  </li>
            <li> My particular type of HH is that I sweat profusely from my FACE.</li>
            <li> He wears a bullet proof vest everyday and he tends to get over heated pretty easy - so these shields gives him a bit of protection from the under arm sweat coming thru his work shirts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I found this product; I used to worry all day about pit stains and avoid anything that was tight in the sleeves.</li>
            <li> However,  this product may not be for high perspiration activities.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> so the high aluminum content will probably gimme Alzheimer&#x27;s</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Truly blown away by the results, my wife and I attended a large formal function that was outdoors in direct sunlight in 90 degree mid-August Georgia humidity......</li>
            <li> So a little bit of pain for not being drenched in sweat all week is okay by me.</li>
            <li> my whole adult life and these wipes make a difference, I use one wipe once a week</li>
            <li> Keep shirts dry and clean.</li>
            <li> I use deodorant as I normally do each morning</li>
            <li> However, it can sting a lot when applied, and it is very precise as to how and when you must apply it, such as at night after a shower and you cannot sweat or get it wet until it dries.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who gets embarrassed after PE due to sweat stains, these have made a huge difference in her confidence.  </li>
            <li> I hope this helps and for those of you in my shoes, give this a shot, because you know how embarrassing it can be to live with your face always sweating and everyone wondering why.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t even heard of antiperspirant wipes before, I was trying something new.</li>
            <li> I used these with my Marie Antoinette Halloween costume which had very tight fitting sleeves</li>
            <li> or it can really dry your armpits out  and cause mild itching.</li>
            <li> Through medical tests, I was confirmed that this product is not causing allergic reactions on my facial skin, but in fact a chemical burn situation.  </li>
            <li> and I would be sweating more with big wet stains on my shirt not even halfway through the day</li>
            <li> On busy, high stress days I may end up with about a quarter sized sweat stain.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of itching on my underarms after the first few applications but this quickly went away and was never a problem after that.</li>
            <li> i would say that 7 days is a suggestion, but that could change based on how hot it is outside and your activity level.</li>
            <li> Truly the first thing I&#x27;ve used that has actually worked.  </li>
            <li> At first I was reluctant because you apply at night after showering, and it seemed almost like a cleanser instead of traditional deodorant.  </li>
            <li> They can be a bit itchy at first, but in my experience, that goes away after the 2nd application or so as your skin gets used to them.</li>
            <li> It works exactly the same as the Sweatblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sweat profusely, and have ruined many shirts due to yellow stains under my arms.  </li>
            <li> I also do sweat more than average on my palms, feet, back, etc.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased the &amp;#34;Sweat Block&amp;#34; product marketed by Amazon, but thought I would take a chance to try this product as it contains more wipes per box, a higher concentration of active ingredient, and a lower price.</li>
            <li> It sorta worked, but I didn&#x27;t get the smooth and dry feeling that I get from my regular stick anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li> I am a male and therefore use them for a more typical role but if you have never tried using a product like this</li>
            <li> Not only do you get more wipes with this product than others, it costs less.</li>
            <li> Maybe less it absorbed by the hair or wasted, or more is applied directly to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Effective and less skin irritation than other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, just to be clear, for me, it&#x27;s not 100%.</li>
            <li> They work really well, last longer than 7 days for me (unless i spend time in the sauna) and do not irritate my (sensitive) skin.  </li>
            <li> I would sometimes sweat through my shirts and it would make me self conscious for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> So far after two week use it works....</li>
            <li> That might just be me, I have sensitive skin and underarms, they get irritated by some deodorants as well.</li>
            <li> Although sweating is natural, over sweating was embarrassing for me.</li>
            <li> Would be 5 stars and beyond if not for the tingling and skin irritation which makes too frequent use prohibitive.</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t complained at all this year :)</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, you will get some redness, but it goes away after a day.</li>
            <li> These really do work if you use them properly (like the directions say).</li>
            <li> It says that there are ten wipes in the package and also says that there were ten weeks worth of wipes in the box</li>
            <li> Otherwise keeps pretty dry all day.</li>
            <li> I assume someone that sweats less than me could probably get the full week out of it.</li>
            <li> After I put it on at night before going to bed, it makes my underarms feel really itchy and irritated, like a bad bug bite sort of, and that seems to last a long time, so I just have to try my best to ignore and fall asleep through the irritation.</li>
            <li> and I knew my chances of it stopping my particular type of sweating weren&#x27;t good, but I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my attending doctor said such a high concentration 15% of aluminum chloride is highly likely to cause chemical burn on face, and I am lucky enough that I consult medical treatment early, or else</li>
            <li> They both work the same, only Kleinerts costs less and gives you more product.</li>
            <li> Finally after years of excessively sweating from the face and top of scalp (hairline area), a remedy has been found.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First time using can be sort of itchy/uncomfortable, but after taking a shower the next morning or later in the evening it goes away.</li>
            <li> I’ve read that with regular use, it may last more than the expected 7 days, up to a week or two, so I am now trying regularly, shaving Saturdays and applying Sunday nights.</li>
            <li> I recommend these to anyone that wants to stay dry.</li>
            <li> do a lot of outdoor activity and can really work up a sweat especially when it&#x27;s humid outside.  </li>
            <li> Then to make matters worse,  I get nervous and self conscious which makes me sweat even more.</li>
            <li> I did the same thing as before by using two pads, one on the first night and the second pad on the second night.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, least my pits are still funk free on day 4</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> My experience may not be the same as those without sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of different remedies that I read about online, like using baby powder, and apple vinegar, and also trying nearly every type of deodorant/antiperspirant</li>
            <li> it happens, I needed a different thyroid medication, and after the switch, I am virtually back to normal.  </li>
            <li> After some trial and error, I have found this to be rather effective for my difficult hyperhidrosis.</li>
            <li> it works very well and is cheaper compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; antiperspirant products and found that most of the roll on varieties yielded few results but created a lot of skin irritation.</li>
            <li> This product keeps me dry under pressure and saved my professional and social life!!!</li>
            <li> The first night after application had a little irritation but basically just felt like a tickle..</li>
            <li> I highly suggest for face and places where you have less sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Try it for a few time, but did not like it very much.</li>
            <li> However, on the very first night of application of half of a single wipe, I was sent to the chemical burn centre for treatment via the emergency department.</li>
            <li> I use it at night, it does not make me want to scratch my armpits raw in the middle of the night, doesn&#x27;t burn, has a slight odor to it but more like a chemical odor</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s available in stores with little to no success.  </li>
            <li> Little to no sweat stains the first day and the next day , nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skiddish of this product at first, seeing how I didn&#x27;t believe a wipe could actually solve my sweating problem.  </li>
            <li> I have extreme armpit sweat at times and this product kept my pits dry for nearly a whole week!</li>
            <li> but, I found that using these towelettes not only irritated my skin, it actually broke me out into hives not long after using it.  </li>
            <li> The first few applications were a little tingly, but the results the next few days were worth it.  </li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter is so active, plays different kinds of sports, volleyball, basketball, softball etc.  </li>
            <li> it may work for other skins, but mine seams too sensitive.</li>
            <li> If they didn&#x27;t itch so much it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal because I could just reapply then, but I don&#x27;t want to be itchin&#x27; my underarms everyday at school!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but I didn&#x27;t find it a feeling that I was willing to continue with, and it wasn&#x27;t from the wipes; it was what accumulated afterward.  </li>
            <li> , I hardly sweated as opposed to my friends, who don&#x27;t have hyperhidrosis like me, that were sweating so much!  </li>
            <li> and you are a person who needs a stronger long lasting antiperspirant you should try this.</li>
            <li> I suffer from profuse facial sweating due to social anxiety.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to put on a little toner first to hopefully &amp;#34;tone&amp;#34; it down a bit.</li>
            <li> This makes mine last twice as long!</li>
            <li> only gave 4/5 stars, and not 5/5 because the lower liquid content of the soaked wipes (compared to SweatBlocker) and their larger size made it feel I was not able to apply as much of the active ingredient per use.  </li>
            <li> Gone are the days of constantly trying new antiperspirants, hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t be embarrassed any longer by excessive sweating.</li>
            <li> Because of how long it lasts and how much the box costs, I use them only for special occasions or when I want to wear outfits that will show sweat badly.</li>
            <li> Everyone will react to using this product differently and may experience different amounts of stinging as noted by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> say goodbye to yellow stains on your white T&#x27;s caused by other antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> We have never had any problems with this product as long as you use it as instructed.</li>
            <li> The more you use the pads the less uncomfortable it is.</li>
            <li> About a week and a half later, I felt the need to give the product a second try.</li>
            <li> These wipes are the real deal ~ no more face sweating for literally days!</li>
            <li> I have tried other similar products and they worked well, but this one blows them all away!  </li>
            <li> Obviously, there is a degree of variability but it is noteworthy because I have never gotten over a week from the other</li>
            <li> It stings a little for a few minutes  (that could be sensitivity after shaving) and then a whole week of using nothing else.  </li>
            <li> Only didn&#x27;t give it five stars due because I don&#x27;t get 7 days out of them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, my husband is a mechanic and works outside and sweats really bad.</li>
            <li> This product delivers what it it claims to, dry underarms.</li>
            <li> It feels itchy like when you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is used once a week and leaves her dry.</li>
            <li> Day 6 for me today and still dry.</li>
            <li> me pits are dry.</li>
            <li> It is followed by completely dry under arms.</li>
            <li> I was dry with the smallest amount of sweat.</li>
            <li> Keeps me completely dry under my arms.</li>
            <li> even when stressed you will stay dry.</li>
            <li> Each day I am amazed and thrilled to have finally found a solution to an annoying problem.</li>
            <li> The little towlettes barely had any moisture to them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had an issue with sweating, at least since high school.</li>
            <li> I was bone dry, not sorta dry, or mostly dry, but completely dry in the areas in which I applied it to, and for days!  </li>
            <li> Finally, between the concentration of the active ingredient and (possibly) less effective moisturizers, if you do anything other than dab the wipes on your underarm you can experience they typical stinging sensations of aluminum chloride skin irritation (though short-lived).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone who has underarm hyperhidrosis, especially if they find sweatblocker has worked for them, and want a less expensive product to treat.  </li>
            <li> It provided absolutely no relief, not sure if it works only under arms but do not waste your money if you&#x27;re trying for other uses.</li>
            <li> This, for me, is a dream come true, that sounds cheesy</li>
            <li> In my mind I thought it was another amount of money down the drain, but than I went to work the next day and the times when I thought I was sweating again, nothing happened.</li>
            <li> It does itch like crazy for a good half an hour, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for the amount of stress it&#x27;s taken away.</li>
            <li> but I was desperate and lightly patted other potentially sweaty areas of my body the night before.</li>
            <li> I used as instructed, once a week, and it blocked all perspiration, 100% dry!</li>
            <li> My shirts have been 100% dry all week, that never ever happens, I always come home with wet pit stained shirts</li>
            <li> Hate the price, love the product!</li>
            <li> I made my wardrobe almost completely black or navy blue because it was harder to tell that I was sweating.</li>
            <li> I cut the wet wipe in half, put it back in the packaging and then into a ziplock bag to seal the moisture in.</li>
            <li> I used to only be able to go out in black t shirts since it was so bad.</li>
            <li> It has been lasting a little over a week</li>
            <li> It stops the sweat and last a little over a week for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is not usually sensitive to any products, but these itch!!!</li>
            <li> It did turn pink and stung, but after being under the fan for about 5-10 minutes, the irritation went away before I went to sleep.  </li>
            <li> But with the wipes I have absolutely no sweat at all.</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> AGAIN AND HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE BURNING OR IRRITATION FOR LAST FEW MONTHS.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different products, but none of them worked for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the name brand &amp;#34; Sweat Block&amp;#34; in the green and white label.</li>
            <li> thanks no more excessive sweating, or embarrassing  wet stains under my arms.</li>
            <li> I still do get wet spots under my arms from time to time, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to how soaked my underarms used to be.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, follow the directions and your pits don&#x27;t sweat.</li>
            <li> TMI, for sure, but sometimes I sweat so bad during meetings that I can feel it literally dripping down my sides.</li>
            <li> Black or dark grey dress shirts.</li>
            <li> In fact I think that the wipe lasted several days past that even through showering as I had no problems.  </li>
            <li> Also, ever since I&#x27;ve been using the product, I&#x27;ve noticed that it has helped with controlling my extremely oily skin that I have always had problems with even with oil control serums, powders, sprays, etc.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed anything with my face makeup or skincare routine other than this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll usually save and re-use a wipe to get an extra two days out of it.</li>
            <li> Not something I&#x27;ll buy again as the other brand I had worked.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure they actually had any of the product on them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used CertainDri and other over the counter &amp;#34;prescription&amp;#34; antiperspirants and none</li>
            <li> After the first failed attempt I applied the stuff three nights in a row</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used them on my chest and back to prevent excessive sweat.  </li>
            <li> (May have shorter effect due to my medications)</li>
            <li> I have tried other sweat guards but none pack the quality to withhold all of it like this brand.</li>
            <li> No more embarrassing sweat head in public.</li>
            <li> Definitely stop my excessive perspiration.</li>
            <li> (look on my profile for the other is you wonder or just drop a comment).</li>
            <li> I have HH due to medications that I have to take, but it&#x27;s not about how or why you have it.</li>
            <li> Minimal effect for half the time.  </li>
            <li> As embarrassing as underarm swear may be, well facial sweat for me, was worse only because everyone would hand me napkins or paper towels during the sweats.</li>
            <li> These shields are a little thinner than I expected but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long I&#x27;ll get in the summer.  </li>
            <li> It would only last about 2-3 days and afterwards I would be sweating from not doing any crazy physical activity</li>
            <li> Only negative is...</li>
            <li> longer wiping myself down after every set at the gym.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always worn dark color clothing to make the sweat less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying several of the newer clinical deodorants (all of which were a total fail for me)</li>
            <li> I use 1 wipe about every week and a half.</li>
            <li> and then it went away, i did notice less sweat, but I did not like the feeling</li>
            <li> I do sweat less...</li>
            <li> This product worked just as well, and was a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> and it was a typical Halloween in Arizona</li>
            <li> She previously used Sweatblock</li>
            <li> I have always been the type of guy who can shower, put on prescription strength deodorant, and have sweat stains under my arms in less than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> my not be typical.</li>
            <li> Now I can add a little color to my wardrobe and ditch the all black garments.  </li>
            <li> Luckily it wasn&#x27;t bad, I just moisturized with SPF.</li>
            <li> After visiting multiple primary care doctors, my gynecologist, endocrinologists and dermatologists - who were all unable to help me, taking medications and using disgusting topical creams, I think I finally found a product that will provide well needed</li>
            <li> Sweat Sheild Ultra feels less harsh on my skin</li>
            <li> my skin a little flaky in the areas</li>
            <li> Kinda wanna go below the belt, but a little worried..</li>
            <li> but it got a little irritated, so I stopped use.</li>
            <li> Even at my job now I would wear a plain black tshirt and have extras in my car so I could change during shift.</li>
            <li> When he used this product he rarely sweats and when he does he does not smell as bad as he used to.</li>
            <li> This product is a total game changer.  </li>
            <li> I am tired and I am currently in the chemical burn treatment centre.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few brands of sweat shields in an effort to protect my shirts and jackets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested the effectiveness of this product by showerering and scrubbing heavily as always, speed walking on warmer humid days and have worm thinner, silky and polyester fabrics to see if I would sweat through my clothing.</li>
            <li> A waste of maney.</li>
            <li> Well after a few weeks of use</li>
            <li> There are a few differences between the two that I like.  </li>
            <li> I sweat alot on my face,  neck, behind my ears, upper lip...basically from every where.</li>
            <li> I put it on my forehead,  upper lip, chin,  jawline, neck, &amp; behind my ears.</li>
            <li> I tried a few products before finding these Kleinerts shields.</li>
            <li> i have been dealing with heavy sweating</li>
            <li> For me it will itch slightly, the first few hours but not too bad, and no burning.  </li>
            <li> If you can take about a half hour of prickling itchiness on your face,  then you must try this!</li>
            <li> it stung a little the first time that i used it,but it was not that bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been bad enough that I typically sweat through several layers - a t-shirt, through to a dress shirt, even through sweaters.</li>
            <li> When patted on the skin, it does tingle and is mildly annoying but the result afterwards is worth the 15-20 minutes of slight discomfort.</li>
            <li> I bought because I have bad hot flashes</li>
            <li> I STOPPED USING THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE AFTER A FEW MORE WEEKS OF USE, MY SKIN, IN AND AROUND MY ARMPITS BEGAN TO SEVERLY BURN AND BECOME IRRITATED BADLY!!</li>
            <li> quite variable as to moisture content of each packet,  would have preferred wetter&lt;br /&gt;...........also, comparing with other sweat pad product, the longevity of use was&lt;br /&gt;definitely not nearly as good.  </li>
            <li> I will buy this from now on, I have excessive sweating under my arms</li>
            <li> too small and doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> No more fussing about pasting cotton sweat &amp;#34;pads&amp;#34; on your shirt.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling through some embarrassing nervous sweating over the past year or so, and decided to give these a try.</li>
            <li> No more, hooray</li>
            <li> No more night sweats either.  </li>
            <li> , I continued to sweat as usual.  </li>
            <li> Excessive sweating has always been an issue.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, I usually get gnarly pit stains and wetness and mens and Women&#x27;s deodorants get all cakey.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my dermatologist because of excessive underarm sweat.</li>
            <li> Sweat shield has eliminated my excessive sweating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually dripping by the time I get to the train station.</li>
            <li> I can usually get by with using one every 2 to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> For what seemed like forever, I struggled with having excessive underarm sweat.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I never experienced extreme or bothersome stinging so unbearable that I would tell you not to use these.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than other brands out there.</li>
            <li> Hyperhydrosis sucks and this helps with small amounts of sweating.</li>
            <li> But I hardly notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> I was a little confused by this product.</li>
            <li> It got so bad that my underarm sweat was clearly visible even if I didn&#x27;t raise my arms.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always sweat a lot, especially from my armpits, no matter what season it may be or how cold, sometimes I would just be sweating for no reason.</li>
            <li> I have a family member that performs a lot of public speaking activities that suffers from profusely sweating when under stress.</li>
            <li> Well at least temporarily.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s bad having it in other places, but those other places can be somewhat temporarily camouflaged.</li>
            <li> I have used SweatBlocker for over a year or so now, and saw this as a potentially less expensive alternative.  </li>
            <li> And they are less expensive than Sweat Block--which I also appreciate.</li>
            <li> And when outdoors in the summer, I want to wear just a single shirt but was afraid of the stains and sweat showing through, so had to wear undershirts in the heat too, or just black/dark colored</li>
            <li> I have bad face sweats and used it on my face despite that it says for armpits only.</li>
            <li> I wish I could resell a partially used package, because this product is expensive!  </li>
            <li> This rather expensive product was no better than any off the shelf anti perspirant.</li>
            <li> I smelled 2 days later :(</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed, I hate having this condition, and this makes my life so much easier and less embarassing.</li>
            <li> it game me, when i applied it.  </li>
            <li> but the downside is they leave sticky glue behind.</li>
            <li> My underarms begin to itch like crazy a few minutes after blotting these on, and the itching continues for another day or two.</li>
            <li> But once I started using Kleinerts Sweat Shield Ultra wipes, my underarm sweat has decreased dramaticially.  </li>
            <li> Other then the painful itching sensation after applying, I noticed no difference at all.  </li>
            <li> I apply it at night after showering- its really uncomfortable for about 45 min to an hour, it feels itchy.</li>
            <li> I forgot and it was extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> There are some skeptical points about this product (after my reflective thinking) 1.</li>
            <li> It just makes a weird layer that he sweats underneaweird</li>
            <li> My reason for removing one star is that in my opinion they are expensive.</li>
            <li> I recently went to a dance festival in this dreadful summer heat and to my surprise</li>
            <li> I had been using Sweat Block, but it is too expensive since I am unable to work now.  </li>
            <li> (Sorry.)</li>
            <li> WORSE!...</li>
            <li> Chalky, uncomfortable residue.  </li>
            <li> I find it too expensive, saw this Kleinerts Sweat Shield which is cheaper and thought she can give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Saves dress shirts from those dreadful yellow stains!</li>
            <li> It felt like someone was using a tiny tazer on my face and shocking me everything where I applied it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a great feeling at all knowing people are looking at you sweating and assume you have worked up a sweat just sitting there!</li>
            <li> but boy was i wrong about this one.</li>
            <li> i was wrong.</li>
            <li> and I was in some cases unable and in others unwilling to continue using these products .</li>
            <li> I was WRONG.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for the past 6 weeks, I am still shocked to say that it works!</li>
            <li> My hyperhydrosis was terrible,  sweat halfway down my ribs when doing minimal activity,  just terrible.</li>
            <li> I had a prescription for excessive unders sweating but hated the side effects.</li>
            <li> I went to bed and started feeling this weird &amp; very uncomfortable prickling itch.</li>
            <li> I recommend sweat shield to anyone who suffers from HH.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t painful, just uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> Quite unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Some of these worked but had unpleasant side effects</li>
            <li> The difference between these and anything you would buy locally is impossible to describe.</li>
            <li> (it got bad)</li>
            <li> I sweat BAD.</li>
            <li> , it was bad, I could be in an air conditioned office</li>
            <li> But I need it so badly, as my face sweats like I&#x27;m in a sauna all the time (and I feel like it too), that I am going to try it again.</li>
            <li> still sweat through it just not as badly</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed, product showed no change in wetness on any part of body after using the product for two weeks.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: (6-13-015)</li>
            <li> its annoying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl, so I&#x27;ve always hated that.</li>
            <li> and I hated</li>
            <li> I needed something to stop sweating from my head, which I had a terrible problem with.  </li>
            <li> What a terrifying experience!!</li>
            <li> It was terrible upon application and my face stung almost unbearably for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Its horrible!</li>

            <li> This is better than sweat block (and way cheaper), lasts longer too and I have tried everything.  Sweat block (which did work but not as good as this), Obaban, Certin Dr, and another I can&#x27;t remember the name.  I use it at night, it does not make me want to scratch my armpits raw in the middle of the night, doesn&#x27;t burn, has a slight odor to it but more like a chemical odor and it&#x27;s not bad or real noticable which shouldn&#x27;t matter anyway since you can&#x27;t smell it the next day.  I will buy this from now on, I have excessive sweating under my arms and I used this once and got over a week of no sweating or wetness on my shirt from it, way worth it for me.  So I am done with certin dri and sweat block, if you suffer from the same issue get this you won&#x27;t be disappointed, I hate having this condition, and this makes my life so much easier and less embarassing.</li>
            <li> This product is a life-changer! It works exactly as advertised, wish I could give it 10 STARS!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great! reduces my sweating. I work a very physical job and I&#x27;m able to stay dry. I have used on my hands, feet, underarms and forearms. Definitely recommend to all the people who struggle with Hyperhidrosis.</li>
            <li> This product works well and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> I deal with a pretty overwhelming issue with armpit sweat, sometimes to the point where the stain is huge and noticeable. It&#x27;s been bad enough that I typically sweat through several layers - a t-shirt, through to a dress shirt, even through sweaters. I&#x27;m not a terribly &amp;#34;sweaty&amp;#34; person either - no one who knows me would think I have an issue other than my arm pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying several of the newer clinical deodorants (all of which were a total fail for me) I googled the issue, and came across the Kleinert wipes. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. Not only does it resolve the issue within about 96% percent, they are easy to use. A shower, followed by a quick application and you&#x27;re good for about 5 days to a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, just to be clear, for me, it&#x27;s not 100%. But, as I said, my problem is pretty profuse. I would say at this stage I probably now produce about the same as a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; person. On busy, high stress days I may end up with about a quarter sized sweat stain. More relaxed, virtually nothing. For me, that&#x27;s fantastic - it&#x27;s a world of difference.</li>
            <li> I got a two count, but it is the same product. I really enjoy this product because it hides underarm marks from overperspiring. They lasted most of a 12 hour work day without showing through an stayed in place. Great if you are very self-conscious about sweating so much</li>
            <li> I needed something to stop sweating from my head, which I had a terrible problem with.  Sweat would simply run in rivulets from my scalp and face.  This product didn&#x27;t work very well.  It slowed the process for about 5 minutes, and that was it.  My hopes were dashed just that quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it happens, I needed a different thyroid medication, and after the switch, I am virtually back to normal.  I wish I could resell a partially used package, because this product is expensive!  I&#x27;d read the reviews and I knew my chances of it stopping my particular type of sweating weren&#x27;t good, but I was desperate.  Fair warning to prospective buyers:  it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a great track record on the type of sweat that comes from the head and face, and I believe it&#x27;s actually not recommended for use on the face.  Oh, well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried them on my underarms.  It sorta worked, but I didn&#x27;t get the smooth and dry feeling that I get from my regular stick anti-perspirant.  It wasn&#x27;t comfortable.  I felt....not clean?  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but I didn&#x27;t find it a feeling that I was willing to continue with, and it wasn&#x27;t from the wipes; it was what accumulated afterward.  It was like I had showered with antibacterial soap and hadn&#x27;t quite reached the smelly stage yet.  But I did stay dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it &amp;#34;sorta&amp;#34; worked, I give it 3-stars.</li>
            <li> I used as instructed, once a week, and it blocked all perspiration, 100% dry! No irritation, no burning sensation after application. I will continue to purchase these and I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> These sweat shield wipes are amazing! I have a tendency to sweat under my arms regardless of the temperature. I would sometimes sweat through my shirts and it would make me self conscious for the rest of the day. I use 1 wipe about every week and a half. I apply it at night after showering- its really uncomfortable for about 45 min to an hour, it feels itchy. But it passes and trust me, its worth it! The more you use the pads the less uncomfortable it is. I use deodorant as I normally do each morning but I don&#x27;t even know if I need to.  I would suggest this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> it works very well and is cheaper compared to other products. i would say that 7 days is a suggestion, but that could change based on how hot it is outside and your activity level. one week i reapplied after 5 days, another week i didn&#x27;t reapply until about 10 days. it did not eliminate sweat, but reduced about 85-90% of it for me. worth it in my opinion</li>
            <li> They are awesome!! Keeps sweat non-visible through clothes</li>
            <li> This product is a total game changer.  Truly the first thing I&#x27;ve used that has actually worked.  Able to open up the full wardrobe of clothes again</li>
            <li> Great product. I still use antiperspirant with and the combo seems to work! only use the wipes once or max twice a week or it can really dry your armpits out  and cause mild itching.</li>
            <li> I received my product in good condition. They function ok. However,  this product may not be for high perspiration activities. Also, if you have the top button of your dress shirt undone be sure to get the &amp;#34;Deep V-Neck&amp;#34; shirts so that it can&#x27;t be seen.</li>
            <li> This product delivers what it it claims to, dry underarms. Since I&#x27;ve been using the wipes, I have not had anymore issues with wetness showing through my clothes.</li>
            <li> This has been one of the biggest lifesavers in my life. I sweat profusely (like a 10&amp;#34; diameter circle of sweat around my armpits and when I use these once a week it is absolutely gone. Occasionally if I apply them too vigorously there is a burning sensation in my armpits but it goes away in about an hour.</li>
            <li> I bought because I have bad hot flashes and they really have helped</li>
            <li> Works fabulously!  It lasts closer to two weeks for me.  Definitely DO NOT shave immediately before using this.  I forgot and it was extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Hyperhydrosis sucks and this helps with small amounts of sweating. Strong tingling sensations comes when you begin to sweat where applied. It feels itchy like when you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> These are the best! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> so far so good, the dampness irritates my skin a bit but i do like it! would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I used this product as soon as i received it, because it looked really interesting, i had never seen or used anything like this before.  You get a 10 week supply, so you are supposed to use only 1 pad a week. I put it on and automatically started feeling a burning sensation, it lasted about 15 minutes and then it went away, i did notice less sweat, but I did not like the feeling it game me, when i applied it.  it may work for other skins, but mine seams too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was originally happy to receive this product as a solution for my hyperhidrosis problem on my face. However, on the very first night of application of half of a single wipe, I was sent to the chemical burn centre for treatment via the emergency department. What a terrifying experience!! Through medical tests, I was confirmed that this product is not causing allergic reactions on my facial skin, but in fact a chemical burn situation.  There are some skeptical points about this product (after my reflective thinking) 1. On its manufacturer website, it says the product can be applied on face. In fact, my attending doctor said such a high concentration 15% of aluminum chloride is highly likely to cause chemical burn on face, and I am lucky enough that I consult medical treatment early, or else, scaring may result. 2. When I review the product packaging, I find the wordings &amp;#34;Apply to underarms only&amp;#34;. So I warned every customers be aware of  the statement maintained by the manufacturer. 3. I personally have no known history of food or drug allergy, no G6PD or any predisposing skin condition before applying this product. I do not have sensitive facial skin. If this product can cause chemical burn on my facial skin, I doubt how many others would be affected in a similar way.  Please give a second thought before purchasing. I am tired and I am currently in the chemical burn treatment centre. Let me take some rest. *End writing.... I am sure I will immediately throw this product into trash bin as soon as I recovered and went back home.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Does not work. Got for my sons sweaty hands and feet. It doesn&#x27;t help at all. It just makes a weird layer that he sweats underneaweird and then it falls off after a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews but this product really works. It&#x27;s been two weeks and it works so well. My t-shirts and sweaters are thankful too.</li>
            <li> I used sweatblock for over a year. Although it worked great, it extremely burned my armpits but I still used the product since it was the only thing that stoped the sweating.  After reading great reviews I decided to try sweat shield and I have to say it works the same, stings for a short amount of time and its a cheaper alternative, plus you get 2 more. The wipes are larger than sweat-block and super moist, I normally keep the wipe in a Ziploc bag after the first use and lasts me another week.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep using sweat shield. I recommend sweat shield to anyone who suffers from HH.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for my palms and feet. It provided absolutely no relief, not sure if it works only under arms but do not waste your money if you&#x27;re trying for other uses.</li>
            <li> This product works very good at reducing underarm perspiration. I use one wipe a week</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few brands of sweat shields in an effort to protect my shirts and jackets. Kleinerts, by far, provides the highest quality product and the best coverage.  Many of the other brands didn&#x27;t adhere and would peel off as I put my arm in the sleeve.</li>
            <li> i wasnt to happy with this product</li>
            <li> These work as advertised. Make sure you follow the application instructions as directed. I had a bit of itching on my underarms after the first few applications but this quickly went away and was never a problem after that. You will have to experiment to find the optimum time between applications, for me I applied every 5 or 6 days for best results.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is the best product of it&#x27;s type I have used and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to this type of product by a friend who uses them to keep her face from sweating and therefore her makeup would not run in the summertime. I am a male and therefore use them for a more typical role but if you have never tried using a product like this and you are a person who needs a stronger long lasting antiperspirant you should try this. Note: My reason for removing one star is that in my opinion they are expensive.</li>
            <li> too small and doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> Great product and great service! Would highly recommend to anybody!</li>
            <li> Excellent. They work. I have only tried them on my underarms.</li>
            <li> Love this product.y daughter sweats a lot and this product is used once a week and her prespiration has decrease. It is used once a week and leaves her dry. She only use deodorant weekly instead of paying more for an antiperspirant /deodorant combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product through a promotion in return for my homest opinion on the product. So far after two week use it works....</li>
            <li> Effective and less skin irritation than other brands.</li>
            <li> Truly blown away by the results, my wife and I attended a large formal function that was outdoors in direct sunlight in 90 degree mid-August Georgia humidity...... My face and head never even attempted to sweat nor did my armpits. This product is MAGICAL, I&#x27;ll be a customer for as long as this company exists!!!!</li>
            <li> Is not as good as Sweat Block</li>
            <li> I have to say these actually work. I keep sweating because of meds Im taking, but this takes care of that sweat problem. No more fussing about pasting cotton sweat &amp;#34;pads&amp;#34; on your shirt.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling through some embarrassing nervous sweating over the past year or so, and decided to give these a try. As a teacher and an exercise enthusiast, I have a lot of energy to burn, but did not need it to show in front of my students and friends. At first I was reluctant because you apply at night after showering, and it seemed almost like a cleanser instead of traditional deodorant.  The first few applications were a little tingly, but the results the next few days were worth it.  Little to no sweat stains the first day and the next day , nothing at all.  In fact I think that the wipe lasted several days past that even through showering as I had no problems.  I have decided to use them every three days to see how it goes.  I&#x27;m a fan and would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Worked as described, but only lasted about 5 days.</li>
            <li> I have tried other similar products and they worked well, but this one blows them all away!  I was bone dry, not sorta dry, or mostly dry, but completely dry in the areas in which I applied it to, and for days!  I will purchase this item again!  Now I can add a little color to my wardrobe and ditch the all black garments.  Thank you Sweat Shield Ultra, you have changed my life!</li>
            <li> I am on day 5 of this stuff and absolutely love it!  I know it&#x27;s meant for your pits only but I was desperate and lightly patted other potentially sweaty areas of my body the night before. This included my nape, under breast, upper arms, creases of forearm, torso front and as much of my back as possible and lastly the groin area along the edges of my underwear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that&#x27;s a lot of area to cover but guess what? I did it with one wipe only. After visiting multiple primary care doctors, my gynecologist, endocrinologists and dermatologists - who were all unable to help me, taking medications and using disgusting topical creams, I think I finally found a product that will provide well needed relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spring I all but replaced all my clothing with 100% cotton or linen fabrics, traumatized to purchase anything outside of these fabrics because they are the most breathable. I&#x27;ve tested the effectiveness of this product by showerering and scrubbing heavily as always, speed walking on warmer humid days and have worm thinner, silky and polyester fabrics to see if I would sweat through my clothing. Nothing happened! I can&#x27;t express how happy I am but will wait for another 9 weeks after finishing the box to re-assess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyone who is suffering along with me please give this a try. Everyone will react to using this product differently and may experience different amounts of stinging as noted by other reviewers.  Fortunately I never experienced extreme or bothersome stinging so unbearable that I would tell you not to use these. The added bonus is that you don&#x27;t even feel it on your skin.</li>
            <li> I waited for about month to try this out before giving this product a proper review.  I was debating between Sweat Block and Sweat Shield Ultra to purchase for my facial hyperhidrosis. I ended up choosing Sweat Shield Ultra instead for its higher percentage of Aluminum Chloride than Sweat Block, assuming it must have a stronger effect.  The first time I used it, I followed the directions on the box. I took a warm shower, so my sweat glands and pores would open up to absorb the product afterwards. I patted it on the areas where I had excess sweating on my face. It did turn pink and stung, but after being under the fan for about 5-10 minutes, the irritation went away before I went to sleep.  The next day, it worked perfectly and I did sweat a little, but I would consider it to be normal sweating.  The following day, the product stopped working and I started to have excess sweating again. I decided to try it again that night and woke up with it not working once again and my skin a little flaky in the areas I applied it at. I felt very discouraged and decided to stop using the product.  About a week and a half later, I felt the need to give the product a second try. I did the same thing as before by using two pads, one on the first night and the second pad on the second night.  To my surprise, it worked perfectly and had no issues with flaky skin this time! Although, of course, I had to reapply the product again once a week was over, but that was completely fine with me.  I recently went to a dance festival in this dreadful summer heat and to my surprise, I hardly sweated as opposed to my friends, who don&#x27;t have hyperhidrosis like me, that were sweating so much!  Also, ever since I&#x27;ve been using the product, I&#x27;ve noticed that it has helped with controlling my extremely oily skin that I have always had problems with even with oil control serums, powders, sprays, etc. and I&#x27;ve been getting so much more compliments on my face complexion from friends and strangers that my skin looks poreless. I haven&#x27;t changed anything with my face makeup or skincare routine other than this product.  Don&#x27;t feel discouraged or give up on this product after the first trial. If it helped change my life, it could possibly do the same for you too!</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I used to only be able to go out in black t shirts since it was so bad. Black or dark grey dress shirts. I applied it two days in a row just to see how good it could be and I&#x27;m four days in and no sweat at all. Bought a whole new wardrobe. Just amazing product</li>
            <li> Really liked this product! Well order again. Great for when we are traveling and don&#x27;t have daily shower access!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. I sweat profusely. May work for a mild sweate .</li>
            <li> My experience may not be the same as those without sensitive skin but, I found that using these towelettes not only irritated my skin, it actually broke me out into hives not long after using it.  I&#x27;ve had to resort to using very mild deodorant while the skin under my arms heals. (it got bad) I patch tested on my arm and had no reaction.  I suppose the skin under your arms is more sensitive though. It also smells strongly of cloves.</li>
            <li> Love them the best product I have ever brought myself</li>
            <li> This has been a real lifesaver. This product really works if you suffer from hyperhidrosis.</li>
            <li> I was a little confused by this product. It says that there are ten wipes in the package and also says that there were ten weeks worth of wipes in the box but there were no directions on the box that said to use one once a week. It did seem to help with the wetness showing on my shirt. I received this product for free for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> OMG this actually works! I sweat on my upper lip and always embarrassed by it. No more, hooray</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d known about these and similar products sooner. I&#x27;ve had to deal with excessive sweating (mostly in the underarm area), since puberty, and now I almost never sweat through my shirts when I use these! One application lasts about 5 days for me.  I&#x27;ll usually save and re-use a wipe to get an extra two days out of it.</li>
            <li> I do sweat less...It is good in situations where I feel I might be nervous and may perspire.</li>
            <li> Not something I&#x27;ll buy again as the other brand I had worked. This for me didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> This rather expensive product was no better than any off the shelf anti perspirant. A waste of maney. The little towlettes barely had any moisture to them so I&#x27;m not sure they actually had any of the product on them.</li>
            <li> I sweat BAD. If I wear a shirt for more than two minutes there will be noticeable wet spots under the arms. I&#x27;m a girl, so I&#x27;ve always hated that. These wipes work, I was unsure about them but they really really work. For me, it only lasts for about 3-4 days, but that is a miracle for me so I am so happy with that. After I put it on at night before going to bed, it makes my underarms feel really itchy and irritated, like a bad bug bite sort of, and that seems to last a long time, so I just have to try my best to ignore and fall asleep through the irritation. That might just be me, I have sensitive skin and underarms, they get irritated by some deodorants as well. All-in-all I absolutely love this product. Because of how long it lasts and how much the box costs, I use them only for special occasions or when I want to wear outfits that will show sweat badly. But with the wipes I have absolutely no sweat at all. I assume someone that sweats less than me could probably get the full week out of it.</li>
            <li> I had basically  given up that besides botox  injections or some procedure that there wasn&#x27;t  a damn thing that could stop me from my underarm sweat.  I was wrong!  Day 6 for me today and still dry. My hyperhydrosis was terrible,  sweat halfway down my ribs when doing minimal activity,  just terrible. Thankfully this product really did eliminate the issue.  The first night after application had a little irritation but basically just felt like a tickle.. That was gone by the morning. This is a product I will be continuously purchasing seeing how nothing else has worked for my.  Clinical deodorants never stood a chance but these... These things work!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest thing ever! I&#x27;ve always sweat a lot, especially from my armpits, no matter what season it may be or how cold, sometimes I would just be sweating for no reason. I also do sweat more than average on my palms, feet, back, etc. so I have some level of hyperhydrosis maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But basically I&#x27;d always be layering or wearing darker colors to hide the pit sweat stains, it was bad, I could be in an air conditioned office but I will still sweat a bit and any light activity and I would be sweating more with big wet stains on my shirt not even halfway through the day, it was really embarrassing and I had to hide it. And when outdoors in the summer, I want to wear just a single shirt but was afraid of the stains and sweat showing through, so had to wear undershirts in the heat too, or just black/dark colored shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used CertainDri and other over the counter &amp;#34;prescription&amp;#34; antiperspirants and none really worked that well for me. This product has literally changed my life. I can now wear whatever color, no need for undershirts, no shirts getting ruined from deodorant and sweat stains, I can wear more fitting close now without worrying about sweating through it so easily, etc etc. I love this product and plan to keep using this, I&#x27;ve never tried the other brand but tried this first because of the good reviews and lower price, and I am very happy with it and it works for me as intended. I can&#x27;t wait for this summer to really test this out and. My shirts have been 100% dry all week, that never ever happens, I always come home with wet pit stained shirts and I hated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> After using this product for the past 6 weeks, I am still shocked to say that it works! Each day I am amazed and thrilled to have finally found a solution to an annoying problem.</li>
            <li> Need to reapply about twice a week</li>
            <li> These work surprisingly well -- I figured maybe it&#x27;d be good for being outside in the heat, but even at the gym I find myself sweating less (although I notice sweat in places I didn&#x27;t even realize could sweat...) and it feels awesome. I received this product in exchange for my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> Hi, Great and work better than another popular brand !!!!!  Trust me, you get more and pay less with these.</li>
            <li> I have hyperhidrosis on my head, chest, and back and this product did not work at all.  After the first failed attempt I applied the stuff three nights in a row and it still had zero effect at stopping sweat.</li>
            <li> Other then the painful itching sensation after applying, I noticed no difference at all.  Stick with the cheap Certain Dri from Walgreens, it works better then this.</li>
            <li> these shields work well for my husband... He wears a bullet proof vest everyday and he tends to get over heated pretty easy - so these shields gives him a bit of protection from the under arm sweat coming thru his work shirts.</li>
            <li> These were purchased once we found out our local store no longer carried Sweat Block. We saw this brand and thought we would give them a try. They work wonderfully! I have a family member that performs a lot of public speaking activities that suffers from profusely sweating when under stress. Using this product creates relief from armpit shirt stains and wetness. They are a better value than the other brand we used to buy and have no complaints. We would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This product is great and protects your clothes very effectively. I recommend this product to everyone, especially those that are hot natured, lol.</li>
            <li> I only recently started to use this and found it to be a great product.</li>
            <li> Finally after years of excessively sweating from the face and top of scalp (hairline area), a remedy has been found.&lt;br /&gt;I use the wipes for two consecutive days, applying to my forehead, then I can go up to 4 days sweat free, until again applying before bed.&lt;br /&gt;No longer wiping myself down after every set at the gym.</li>
            <li> Works wonders. Won&#x27;t go without it. First thing I&#x27;ve found to work. &amp;#34;Life changing.&amp;#34; I use it once a week and it lasts throughout the work-week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, the first use felt like being stung by dozens of bees. Quite unpleasant. But I hardly notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> I had been using Sweat Block, but it is too expensive since I am unable to work now.  This product worked just as well, and was a lot less money.  I shall be buying more as I find it.  Stops my sweating so it stops thehorrible odor that has arrived on my body with the Menopause.  No more night sweats either.  I know it is responsible for taming that, becaus when I forgot to put some on, TWICE, I sweat all night and/or stunk all day, and  even 2 min after showering.</li>
            <li> I should have been using this product years ago!!  I had a prescription for excessive unders sweating but hated the side effects. This product I use once a week and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Definitely use it at night. It does have a stink to it, and an itch, but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used SweatBlocker for over a year or so now, and saw this as a potentially less expensive alternative.  IT IS! You get more wipes for less money, and for my first use, the effects were longer-lived.  Obviously, there is a degree of variability but it is noteworthy because I have never gotten over a week from the other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave 4/5 stars, and not 5/5 because the lower liquid content of the soaked wipes (compared to SweatBlocker) and their larger size made it feel I was not able to apply as much of the active ingredient per use.  The clove-like scent is nice, but not as strong as the other brand either.  Finally, between the concentration of the active ingredient and (possibly) less effective moisturizers, if you do anything other than dab the wipes on your underarm you can experience they typical stinging sensations of aluminum chloride skin irritation (though short-lived).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone who has underarm hyperhidrosis, especially if they find sweatblocker has worked for them, and want a less expensive product to treat.  I have been able to use just deodorant for days, which is a pleasant change.</li>
            <li> Did not do what it claimed.  After using the wipes, I felt itchy and irritated.  Did not work for me, I continued to sweat as usual.  Will have to research another solution.</li>
            <li> Works the same as the Sweatblock product.  Except here you get more product, larger sheet, slightly larger package.  Smells the same too.  I use on my face the night before for sports activities.  No burning (as others reviews have &amp;#34;claimed&amp;#34;).  This will now be my go-to product.  Not prime but came very quickly (couple days) free ship.</li>
            <li> product works, but not quite for a week for me - I have to reapply every 3-5 days</li>
            <li> The difference between these and anything you would buy locally is impossible to describe. I would encourage anyone who does not want to worry about sweating to try these - they work! Period. They can be a bit itchy at first, but in my experience, that goes away after the 2nd application or so as your skin gets used to them.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! I have sweaty pits all the time and nothing worked for them until this product!!!</li>
            <li> Like everyone else I&#x27;ve used Sweatblock before I found this. They both work the same, only Kleinerts costs less and gives you more product. It says it&#x27;s for the armpits but I&#x27;ve used them on my chest and back to prevent excessive sweat.  It does the job well for several days. The only thing is you have to apply it at night before going to bed so you don&#x27;t start sweating right away.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than other brands out there. They work great and don&#x27;t have a strong chemical smell. The insides of my shirts and suit jackets don&#x27;t have to be caked with deodorant. Great product!</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed, product showed no change in wetness on any part of body after using the product for two weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product</li>
            <li> quite variable as to moisture content of each packet,  would have preferred wetter&lt;br /&gt;...........also, comparing with other sweat pad product, the longevity of use was&lt;br /&gt;definitely not nearly as good.  Minimal effect for half the time.  Also, I am sedentary&lt;br /&gt;and couldn&#x27;t expect these to work well if I was working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sweat block(recommended by several) and this works waaay better. Kills sweat and odor about 4 days for me. Others...maybe 8 hrs. (May have shorter effect due to my medications) Lasts through gym sessions, tanning bed, midwest humid horrid heat! Underarm and Groin usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad that I found this product; I used to worry all day about pit stains and avoid anything that was tight in the sleeves.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I say that cause I sweat  a great deal.  I was using Sweat Blocker. But it had been giving  me a rash and not working as well after a while. The price keeps going up. Sweat Sheild Ultra feels less harsh on my skin the smell isn&#x27;t as strong.  Also I can use it without deodrante as well. I keep smelling myself to make sure I&#x27;m odor free. Its a great feeling to know I&#x27;m dry. If this was sold in the store it would great!</li>
            <li> my son cant imagine life without these</li>
            <li> These work really well for me.  I was able to use them on my face and it did not irritate my skin.  Highly recommend for temporary relief!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s not to like. Okay, if you really want to nitpick, it stings a little bit but compared to what it does? Money well spent. I will buy again and again and I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love these antiperspirant wipes.  They work really well, last longer than 7 days for me (unless i spend time in the sauna) and do not irritate my (sensitive) skin.  I&#x27;ll never go back to regular antiperspirant.    The video on the Kleinert&#x27;s website about SweatShield being a great alternative to Botox injections is spot on.  I went into a medspa years ago and asked about Botox injections for this purpose and the woman took one look at me, said it&#x27;s just not affordable, and sent me away with nothing.  It would have been nice for them to offer me a product like this.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good. Though the listing states can use on face (and everywhere else), but package says underarms only. Well, of course I used it on my face anyway. Stings! But I need it so badly, as my face sweats like I&#x27;m in a sauna all the time (and I feel like it too), that I am going to try it again. Of course! I&#x27;m going to put on a little toner first to hopefully &amp;#34;tone&amp;#34; it down a bit. (Sorry.) I say buy it, try it.</li>
            <li> Excessive sweating has always been an issue. After 1 week of using Seat Shield Ultra, that changed. Not only do you get more wipes with this product than others, it costs less. The first time I used 1 wipe per pit, but afterwards 1 wipe was sufficient to reduce my underarm sweating by 90%. I feel more confident and can finally wear shirts that aren&#x27;t white or black.</li>
            <li> Kleinerts is such a good brand! I have tried other sweat guards but none pack the quality to withhold all of it like this brand. The size is perfect for my underarm and isn&#x27;t noticeable under my scrubs for work.  They also have good adhesive to help them stay in place.</li>
            <li> These really work!  I sweat from my head and all I did was pat it on my scalp and went to bed. It has been lasting a little over a week and then I do it again. No more embarrassing sweat head in public.</li>
            <li> Product worked great! Lasted all day even on hot and humid days!</li>
            <li> These shields are a little thinner than I expected but they get the job done. Good coverage.</li>
            <li> Significant improvement in underarm perspiration.  Works great with Kleinert&#x27;s underarm dress shields.</li>
            <li> I really like these for the protection they offer. They can make noise if you&#x27;re wearing a more loose-fit shirt, but these are still the best dress shields by far.</li>
            <li> These REALLY work!  I live in the Phoenix, Arizona area and we sweat most of the year.  I used these with my Marie Antoinette Halloween costume which had very tight fitting sleeves and it was a typical Halloween in Arizona so perspiration happened but no damage at all to my very pricy costume.  I&#x27;d recommend these shields to anyone!</li>
            <li> its decent. i sweat more than i should and had to use 2 wipes to get any kind of protection.. however i did break out in a rash on my left armpit. idk if it was my body or i used to much.</li>
            <li> No joke...this stuff works. It stings a little for a few minutes  (that could be sensitivity after shaving) and then a whole week of using nothing else.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I had been using the more pricey brand &amp;#34;Sweatblock&amp;#34; which worked well to be fair, but I decided to try &amp;#34;Kleinerts Sweat Shield&amp;#34; which is at a more discounted price and has more product. Well after a few weeks of use I was very impressed that it worked extremely well and yes just as good as &amp;#34;SweatBlock&amp;#34;. Both have the same great results.......so why pay more!?!?....  I would recommend these product to everyone needing it.  UPDATE: (6-13-015) I STOPPED USING THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE AFTER A FEW MORE WEEKS OF USE, MY SKIN, IN AND AROUND MY ARMPITS BEGAN TO SEVERLY BURN AND BECOME IRRITATED BADLY!! I TRIED IT SEVERAL MORE WEEKS AND IT GOT WORSE!...SO. I WENT BACK TO USING &amp;#34;SWEAT BLOCK&amp;#34; AGAIN AND HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE BURNING OR IRRITATION FOR LAST FEW MONTHS. I AM JUST BEING HONEST! HOPE IT HELPS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sweater... -especially- a stress sweater. TMI, for sure, but sometimes I sweat so bad during meetings that I can feel it literally dripping down my sides. That out of the way, I&#x27;m happy to report that this stuff works as directed! It&#x27;s a total game-changer, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is simple -- tear open the condom-style foil packet and rub the wipe on your pits. (Don&#x27;t tell anyone, but afterwards you can also use the wipe on your feet!) Time-wise, the antiperspirant protection lasts (for me) about 4 to 6 days. I received an evaluation shipment of Sweat Shield Ultra to assist with writing this review.</li>
            <li> Works well although it&#x27;s lasts only for a couple of days</li>
            <li> Love it this product and sweat block are the only 2 things that work, i tryed all kinds of stuff before nothing worked</li>
            <li> This stuff works, I usually get gnarly pit stains and wetness and mens and Women&#x27;s deodorants get all cakey.  When I first applied it kinda tingled, kinda stung, but that went away pretty quick (10mins~) and now 3 days later and I&#x27;ve totally forgotten about it and me pits are dry. Kinda wanna go below the belt, but a little worried.. I figure everything is poisoning us so the high aluminum content will probably gimme Alzheimer&#x27;s but if this product continues to work this well I say.. um.. I say.. what was I talking about. Oh well, least my pits are still funk free on day 4</li>
            <li> Me and my husband love this product. It works great! It always arrives by estimated delivery date. We have never had any problems with this product as long as you use it as instructed. We will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> These work great.  Definitely stop my excessive perspiration. In the winter I can get longer than 7 days before I have to reuse.  Not sure how long I&#x27;ll get in the summer.  I&#x27;ve used a prescription strength of the same ingredient and these are just as good and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout issue with them like I did the prescription.  Kleinerts is just bit stronger than Sweatblock and much more cost effective.  Gave one to my brother to try &amp; he loved them.  Very pleased, will reorder.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of fitted blazers often with sleeveless jackets and really needed something like this to stop my jackets deteriorating. These are very effective and can be used more than once but the downside is they leave sticky glue behind. If it wasn&#x27;t for that they would be perfect</li>
            <li> Works great!  I used to be embarrassed with sweat all over my face at work. I use this once a week on Sunday and I&#x27;m good to go all week!  Great product.</li>
            <li> These definitely work at preventing sweating!&lt;br /&gt;I do a lot of outdoor activity and can really work up a sweat especially when it&#x27;s humid outside.  In addition to my armpits, I also tried them on my back.  The problem I had was the area on my back where I applied these experienced a &amp;#34;pins and needles&amp;#34; sensation on and off for about a week and a half.  It wasn&#x27;t painful, just uncomfortable.  The perspiration did stop but the discomfort wasn&#x27;t worth it to continue use on my back.&lt;br /&gt;I still use these on my armpits and they work great with no discomfort.  I get about a week out of these before I have to reapply.  I recommend these to anyone that wants to stay dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sweating machine - I like to think of it as an &amp;#34;efficient cooling&amp;#34; guy.  This didn&#x27;t work for me.  Chalky, uncomfortable residue.  No effect on sweat beyond standard antiperspirant sticks.  Not buying again.</li>
            <li> I use this weekly and I have no complaints. I wear a uniform for work so I bought this to alleviate visible sweat. These work with both stress sweat and temp sweat. Although sweating is natural, over sweating was embarrassing for me. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever not use this product. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Better than the other guys. Have used it three times. First time using can be sort of itchy/uncomfortable, but after taking a shower the next morning or later in the evening it goes away. It is followed by completely dry under arms. Will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter is so active, plays different kinds of sports, volleyball, basketball, softball etc.  She previously used Sweatblock I find it too expensive, saw this Kleinerts Sweat Shield which is cheaper and thought she can give it a try.  It works exactly the same as the Sweatblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; antiperspirant products and found that most of the roll on varieties yielded few results but created a lot of skin irritation. While this product is certainly strong and can lead to some irritation with overuse--especially for those with sensitive skin--it also actually significantly curbs sweating. I previously purchased the &amp;#34;Sweat Block&amp;#34; product marketed by Amazon, but thought I would take a chance to try this product as it contains more wipes per box, a higher concentration of active ingredient, and a lower price. It works just as well as the Sweat Block. Would be 5 stars and beyond if not for the tingling and skin irritation which makes too frequent use prohibitive.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. This is an awesome invention.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product . We have ordered these before n she feels confident when wearing them that she won&#x27;t have embarrassing sweat stains on her shirt</li>
            <li> This worked great! I have bought many different things to help with the sweating but noting worked until this.</li>
            <li> This product worked perfectly and as advertised. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist because of excessive underarm sweat. When applied, it worked and lasted for about 6 days. I continued applying antiperspirant along with this product.</li>
            <li> These are better than another brand I paid $20 for. They stay in place and don&#x27;t make my skin itch.</li>
            <li> Kleiners sweat shield is efficient. It blocks the spreading of perspiration on my clothes allowing me to be more confident in my day to day life. There is a significant reduction of sweating in my underarm.I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my mother and she loves using them, as they save her clothing from being ruined from under arm sweating/odor. We will be purchasing more very soon.</li>
            <li> Great product! It definitely reduces sweat!</li>
            <li> Love this products works excellent . And you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> worked great! I have extreme armpit sweat at times and this product kept my pits dry for nearly a whole week!</li>
            <li> Overall the product performed to its claims. One wipe provided 5-7 days of protection so I am satisfied and will order again.</li>
            <li> I have hyperhydrois on my chest and my back and I was iffy about this, but it works wonderful!  And great service too!</li>
            <li> Great product, works well. Solved my sweating problem!!</li>
            <li> I was pleased and surprised at how well these shields prevent and minimize sweating. This is something I will purchase again and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> good product.. does the job its supposed to do</li>
            <li> Works great! Bright white &amp; protects sheets. The wings keep it from sliding around.</li>
            <li> Saves dress shirts from those dreadful yellow stains! Not krinkly at all while moving about.</li>
            <li> really like this stuff, its great.. just use one day and the whole week you will be sweat free, just make sure you apply it at night</li>
            <li> It works like a charm. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who gets embarrassed after PE due to sweat stains, these have made a huge difference in her confidence.  She hasn&#x27;t complained at all this year :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works</li>
            <li> very good product. does leak out the sides, though. Otherwise keeps pretty dry all day. Very satisfied, would buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had an issue with sweating, at least since high school. I don&#x27;t have to do anything strenuous and I would have massive sweat patches under my arms every day. I made my wardrobe almost completely black or navy blue because it was harder to tell that I was sweating. Even at my job now I would wear a plain black tshirt and have extras in my car so I could change during shift. I tried every kind of stick deodorant including the prescription strenth ones. I even tried certain dri. Then I found this stuff and it changed everything. I put it on once a week before bed. It does itch like crazy for a good half an hour, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for the amount of stress it&#x27;s taken away. I&#x27;m not at all saying this would work on everyone. People sweat for different reasons. But this stuff worked magic for me, and I would strongly encourage anyone with this problem to try it at least once.</li>
            <li> Very effective product that allows you to feel confident no matter what life throws your way sold by a business that ships quickly. Will repurchase!</li>
            <li> This really works! I have bad face sweats and used it on my face despite that it says for armpits only. It was terrible upon application and my face stung almost unbearably for an hour or so. But I haven&#x27;t had a sweat break out all week! So a little bit of pain for not being drenched in sweat all week is okay by me.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  It has saved me embarrassment and shirt washing&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I thought getting this as an alternative to the sweatbloc, and honestly it does not compare! It would only last about 2-3 days and afterwards I would be sweating from not doing any crazy physical activity, I rather pay the extra bucks for sweatbloc</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product, my husband is a mechanic and works outside and sweats really bad. When he used this product he rarely sweats and when he does he does not smell as bad as he used to.</li>
            <li> Omg I so love these. I received it free in exchanged for my unbiased opinion.  But I will order some now</li>
            <li> Let me first start by stating, I understand this isn&#x27;t intended for what i used it for and I understood what I was doing and understood the risks as well. I am a nurse and blocking the glands in one area isn&#x27;t problematic for the whole body unless I&#x27;m in an excess of heat or so on but thats for a different conversation. I purchased this product because of the excess of sweat from my face. As embarrassing as underarm swear may be, well facial sweat for me, was worse only because everyone would hand me napkins or paper towels during the sweats.I was embarrassed as I come to talk to patients and have them ask if the labs suggested something else or if I was unsure of what I wanted to say. I have tried many different creams and lotions and face washes and non of them work at all (look on my profile for the other is you wonder or just drop a comment). I decided to give these a try and let me first explain the feeling, my face felt like it was itchy for minutes and than i couldn&#x27;t feel anything happen at all. In my mind I thought it was another amount of money down the drain, but than I went to work the next day and the times when I thought I was sweating again, nothing happened. This was the first time that nothing happening was such an amazing feeling. Pro: face sweats are gone, I have to apply every five days and by the fifth day I can tell its starting to wear off. Con: for the first time, I don&#x27;t really have a con, I understand what this chemical is doing and thats another conversation again but overall this product does what it says it does. For those of you who would try what I did, one recommendation, do it on a day off and during the day to keep an eye on your face, look out for adverse reactions. I hope this helps and for those of you in my shoes, give this a shot, because you know how embarrassing it can be to live with your face always sweating and everyone wondering why.</li>
            <li> Similar to a lot of people, I found Sweat Shield after using Sweatblock for probably 2 years.  I&#x27;ve waited several weeks to post this, but now that I&#x27;ve used Sweat Shield for a while I wanted to leave a review.  The main point is that Sweat Shield works just as well as Sweatblock.  There are a few differences between the two that I like.  The Sweat Shield wipes are larger, which makes application easier.  Sweat Shield is also practically unscented, which I prefer over the synthetic clover-like smell of Sweatblock.  All that, plus the lower cost and more wipes per package makes Sweat Block a winner.  I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Great product. I suffer from profuse facial sweating due to social anxiety. Sweat shield has eliminated my excessive sweating. I do not sweat from my face at all now. My face does has a shiny look now, at times it appears as if i have on too much lotion. Being shiny however is a hell of a lot better than being sweaty. Then wipes do irritate my face when first applied. There is about 20-25 minutes of discomfort. It does not wash off in the shower and is water proof. It is best to apply this product at night so that you can shower in the morning. This product keeps me dry under pressure and saved my professional and social life!!!</li>
            <li> ..... Well at least temporarily. I sweat alot on my face,  neck, behind my ears, upper lip...basically from every where. Its horrible! I am the only one dripping in a crowded NYC train while everyone else is fine. Then to make matters worse,  I get nervous and self conscious which makes me sweat even more. I bought this product and dabbed it on at night (after a shower). I put it on my forehead,  upper lip, chin,  jawline, neck, &amp; behind my ears. I went to bed and started feeling this weird &amp; very uncomfortable prickling itch. It felt like someone was using a tiny tazer on my face and shocking me everything where I applied it. I tried to go to sleep but I couldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s definitely not pain which means it&#x27;s tolerable but its annoying and I felt like washing my face (I didn&#x27;t) I used some hydrocortisone cream &amp; it got better but eventually came back. Next morning, I was on my way to work and realized that I wasn&#x27;t sweating! I&#x27;m usually dripping by the time I get to the train station. NOT THIS TIME! I felt like I was sweating, but I wasn&#x27;t. I was dry with the smallest amount of sweat. To help,  it was 86° &amp;  humid. I sweat even in 50° weather. I used 1 wipe for all those areas and I highly recommend it! If you can take about a half hour of prickling itchiness on your face,  then you must try this! I recommend trying it before bed after a shower and dab it on(push into your skin). Don&#x27;t swipe like a baby wipe. Good luck!  7/14/15 Quick update: It lasted for about 7-8 days. I started sweating lightly on day 7 and it all came down on day 8, so make sure to keep up with it! I later tried it on my neck and it worked but it got a little irritated, so I stopped use. Luckily it wasn&#x27;t bad, I just moisturized with SPF. I also tried between my breasts, it worked but I got a bumpy itchy rash after a couple of days. I highly suggest for face and places where you have less sensitive skin. Definitely spot test.  9/2/15 I&#x27;m still using it but not every week. I stopped for about a week and a half and found it wasn&#x27;t as effective as day one (maybe it was too hot?). This time I used a benydryl cream for the itch which could be the reason why it didn&#x27;t work well but it was effective with hydrocortisone cream during my first use so I have no definite answer. Either way, it&#x27;s still worth trying and using. I work in dermatology and see people pay $400+ for botox which only lasts up to 4 months.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, follow the directions and your pits don&#x27;t sweat.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Try it for a few time, but did not like it very much.</li>
            <li> Was using the roll-on type and that worked OK, but this is way more convenient and effective!</li>
            <li> Works as well as sweat shield but I had itchy for about the first 24 hours. Still better than having b.o.!</li>
            <li> If you are reading this review, you most likely know more about the terrible devil called Hyperhidrosis (HH)~ than you&#x27;d «ever« want to know. I have HH due to medications that I have to take, but it&#x27;s not about how or why you have it. What matters MOST is HOW to STOP the SWEATING! I tried a few products before finding these Kleinerts shields. My particular type of HH is that I sweat profusely from my FACE. I know it&#x27;s bad having it in other places, but those other places can be somewhat temporarily camouflaged. But having sweat pouring from your face no matter what you do is humiliating and beyond embarrassing. Fast forward to me searching the internet for solutions. I tried a few different products, but none of them worked for me. These wipes are the real deal ~ no more face sweating for literally days! Since I am using mine on my face (as opposed to my pits) I don&#x27;t need to use the whole cloth. I cut the wet wipe in half, put it back in the packaging and then into a ziplock bag to seal the moisture in. This makes mine last twice as long! When applying the shield to the face, do the same thing as you would if you were applying to the armpits. Blot it on. Blot it on...blot it on.Do not rub, just say no to rubbing lol. When patted on the skin, it does tingle and is mildly annoying but the result afterwards is worth the 15-20 minutes of slight discomfort. This, for me, is a dream come true, that sounds cheesy but if you&#x27;ve gone through this yourself, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. I can now wear makeup again without it looking like watercolors lol. It&#x27;s so much more than that ~ I&#x27;ve gained my self confidence back. It&#x27;s not a great feeling at all knowing people are looking at you sweating and assume you have worked up a sweat just sitting there! THANK YOU, KLEINERTS! You have a customer for life. This is an amazing solution to what has bothered me for years.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work . I smelled 2 days later :( and I used antibacterial soap , deoderent, antiperspirant, &amp; powder</li>
            <li> Works great. Lasts about 9-10 days before the sweat block fades away. Keeps me completely dry under my arms. I already re-ordered.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that this product came along.  I have suffered with hyperhidrosis for 20 years.  Just wearing deodorant doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I originally tried the Sweat Block, which also works, but this one is as effective.  Plus you get more shields per box.  I can usually get by with using one every 2 to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Gone are the days of constantly trying new antiperspirants, hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t be embarrassed any longer by excessive sweating. I also find these convenient when I&#x27;m about to leave for a week of camping. And they are less expensive than Sweat Block--which I also appreciate. One thing to possibly be aware of--when I first start using this product, it caused me some itching and tightening skin for that one night. It&#x27;s not horrible and it only happened the first time I used it, but don&#x27;t give up on the product if that happens to you. It really is a great product, and I&#x27;m so glad to have found it.</li>
            <li> Great product @ a great price!! I like that ya get more packets for the same price as the competitor</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the name brand &amp;#34; Sweat Block&amp;#34; in the green and white label.</li>
            <li> The pads do the job, but not as well as Sweat Block. My skin is not usually sensitive to any products, but these itch!!! My underarms begin to itch like crazy a few minutes after blotting these on, and the itching continues for another day or two. They stop my sweating for 3-4 days, which is okay. If they didn&#x27;t itch so much it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal because I could just reapply then, but I don&#x27;t want to be itchin&#x27; my underarms everyday at school! Sweat Block pads stopped my sweat for 5-6 days. The only quality these have over Sweat Block pads is that they smell a lot more pleasant (to me anyway). Sweat Block pads have a really strong smell.</li>
            <li> Hate the price, love the product!</li>
            <li> The UPSP lost my package and Kleinert&#x27;s offered to replace it! They are amazing! And the product is amazing as well!</li>
            <li> Did everything I wanted it to in decreasing sweat.  Only negative is...causes itching of my skin.  That only lasts for a bit, then it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> i have been dealing with heavy sweating my whole adult life and these wipes make a difference, I use one wipe once a week and it does help out with the underarm sweating</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have used other types but this has worked the best. It stops the sweat and last a little over a week for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a believer of self help products. but boy was i wrong about this one. i received the Shield ultra for free to try it and give it a review. i thought what the heck, more snake oil. i was wrong. I&#x27;ve been using the product for three weeks and believe me it does work. it stung a little the first time that i used it,but it was not that bad. i thought that not using anything under my arms (pits) would create a funk but to my surprise even that is not an issue. even when stressed you will stay dry. say goodbye to yellow stains on your white T&#x27;s caused by other antiperspirant. as soon as i have finished this pack i will order again.  thanks no more excessive sweating, or embarrassing  wet stains under my arms.</li>
            <li> It works as good as any other sweat protector, as long as you apply it correctly. If you have sensitive skin, you will get some redness, but it goes away after a day.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my underarms dry for a couple days just as promised which is awesome. However, it can sting a lot when applied, and it is very precise as to how and when you must apply it, such as at night after a shower and you cannot sweat or get it wet until it dries.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Keep shirts dry and clean.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found these way sooner. I hadn&#x27;t even heard of antiperspirant wipes before, I was trying something new. These really do work if you use them properly (like the directions say). I love them and they are individually wrapped so they are easy to travel with. They are especially good to use in the summer time to avoid any sweat stains when wearing tank tops and sun dresses or anything sleeveless. I would recommend using them :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased several over the counter &amp;#34;prescription strength&amp;#34; antiperspirants and nothing worked. Some of these worked but had unpleasant side effects and I was in some cases unable and in others unwilling to continue using these products . So I reverted back to wearing layers of clothing in an attempt to hide the sweat marks on my shirts, which was not only hot and embarrassing but also costly, as the shirts needed to be replaced more frequently. Then I discovered the Sweatshield and purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Its an amazing product, I just bought one to try it out and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> For what seemed like forever, I struggled with having excessive underarm sweat.  It got so bad that my underarm sweat was clearly visible even if I didn&#x27;t raise my arms.  I tried all kinds of different remedies that I read about online, like using baby powder, and apple vinegar, and also trying nearly every type of deodorant/antiperspirant that&#x27;s available in stores with little to no success.  But once I started using Kleinerts Sweat Shield Ultra wipes, my underarm sweat has decreased dramaticially.  At first I had to do a couple of applications a week, but quickly over time I went to only once a week to now I only use them occasionally like once a month or so.  I still do get wet spots under my arms from time to time, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to how soaked my underarms used to be.</li>
            <li> I have never been one to take the time to review products, but I HAVE to for this product.  I have always been the type of guy who can shower, put on prescription strength deodorant, and have sweat stains under my arms in less than 30 minutes.  I&#x27;ve always worn dark color clothing to make the sweat less noticeable.  I sweat profusely, and have ruined many shirts due to yellow stains under my arms.  I was a little skiddish of this product at first, seeing how I didn&#x27;t believe a wipe could actually solve my sweating problem.  I was WRONG.  I used one pad Sunday night, and I didn&#x27;t sweat for a WEEK.  This includes work, running, and working out. After the gym, I had sweat all over my body, and none under my arms.  Please let me be living proof that this product WORKS.</li>
            <li> After some trial and error, I have found this to be rather effective for my difficult hyperhidrosis. I tried it from time to time before, and it seemed to work well but only for a day or so. But, being rather hairy, I&#x27;ve found it works better if the problem areas are shaved first (and wait 12-24 hours to apply). Maybe less it absorbed by the hair or wasted, or more is applied directly to the skin.  For me it will itch slightly, the first few hours but not too bad, and no burning.  I also have neuropathy so what i experience my not be typical. I do not get the &amp;#34;7 days” out it, but now it is very effective the first day, and it lessens a little bit each day, but I can get all the way until Friday wearing just one shirt. I used to have to change my shirt 4-5 times a day, and wear multiple layers! I’ve read that with regular use, it may last more than the expected 7 days, up to a week or two, so I am now trying regularly, shaving Saturdays and applying Sunday nights. Only didn&#x27;t give it five stars due because I don&#x27;t get 7 days out of them.</li>
            <li> still sweat through it just not as badly</li>
