            <li>I like it better than the strong tea tree oil and spearmint flavors.</li>
            <li>This product had a great taste for a natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste is good but very pricey.</li>
            <li>I love the flavor and how clean my teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful toothpaste, it&#x27;s so effective that I end up using about 1/4th as much as the other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>#34;taste great,&amp;#34; and this tastes just fine to me.  </li>
            <li>Flavor is fine and it does the job.</li>
            <li>While helping to keep your gums healthy and your breath smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy brushing now.</li>
            <li>Love the taste and the fresh feeling in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>smooth, excellent&lt;br /&gt;Tastes great&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Will reduce any gum bleeding, which proves it&#x27;s working some magic.  </li>
            <li>Also is SLS free and Gluten free.</li>
            <li>It does not taste as good as the main toothpaste brands, but the benefits are considerably higher.</li>
            <li>Gets your teeth super clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean, and look whiter as well.</li>
            <li>I like that it isn&#x27;t sickly sweet.</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth very refreshed feeling and it taste better then any toothpaste i have ever had.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really expect healthy things to &amp;</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth and breath feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves my breath feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Has a fresh clean taste and cleans well.</li>
            <li>I think I should have bought more than 2 on my last order. :)</li>
            <li>This leaves my mouth feeling tingly and fresh, tastes much better,  and I seem to not have as much tartar on my teeth after a night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews, I bought this toothpaste and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>Cool fresh mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to find a toothpast that is natural and replaces Crest!</li>
            <li>and I gag from the overly strong, minty flavor of most commercial brands.</li>
            <li>and if you have a sensitive mouth you should for sure try this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>well and keeps my breath fresh.</li>
            <li>The minty/clove flavor and scent tends to go away pretty quickly after brushing.</li>
            <li>I am very particular about toothpaste and love natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this plus its contains natural ingredients not a bunch of chemical names.</li>
            <li>I would high recommend this toothpaste especially if you are looking for a natural yet great cleaning toothpaste.</li>
            <li>but it tastes a lot better than what I was doing before which was putting a drop of Tea Tree Oil on my regular toothpaste before brushing.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using Jasons natural toothpastes because I feel like I know what is in them.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is the only toothpaste the cleans my teeth</li>
            <li>i first purchased one in  a vitamin store in st augustine fl ona visit to my daughter-</li>
            <li>ARE JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER.</li>
            <li>(it is gonna last for ever), but for me the spices are felt too strong</li>
            <li>Tastes great and is actually very cost efficient, as it takes 2/3&#x27;s less toothpaste to get the same results!  </li>
            <li>This one is OK; the flavor is lighter than I expected but it does the job.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste cleans really well</li>
            <li>, it is very foamy</li>
            <li>With the taste of clove, it leaves your breath feeling fresh and alive like never before.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for its health benefits!</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t really feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot; until my teeth have been attended.</li>
            <li>and I must admit although the flavor is a kaleidoscope of ingredients it all comes together really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My wife and my 93-yr-old mother really like the fact there is no fluoride in it.  </li>
            <li>Really like this.</li>
            <li>Yes, you may have guests say, &#x27;this doesn&#x27;t seem like real toothpaste.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get that same fresh feeling from using regular toothpaste, but I&#x27;m hoping this is better for me.  </li>
            <li>Some tooth sensitivity but absolutely none of the mouth sores that come with SLS.</li>
            <li>It was okay, no big deal I haven&#x27;t used it completely</li>
            <li>nice to have this product to alternate with the regular toothpastes one has grown up with!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is just as good if not better than my previous favorite toothpaste (Melalueca brand).  </li>
            <li>Something else I liked was that it left my mouth with that clean feeling for a longer time than other natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Usually make my own.  </li>
            <li>so I went looking for an alternative and this came highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It actually makes it fun to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>I had to look for new toothpaste because I was having problems with mouth sores.</li>
            <li>It really makes your mouth feel clean and is never once bothered my sensitive teeth like other brands .I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I have a bad reaction to SLS and I was glad to finally find one that didn&#x27;t have any in it and also tastes good.</li>
            <li>But no real complaints other than it&#x27;s kind of soapy.</li>
            <li>I like this natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about 10 days so far, and my teeth feel really clean in a way that other toothpastes haven&#x27;t made them ever feel before and it lasts.</li>
            <li>but it is also clearly well made.</li>
            <li>Am trying to eliminate SLS and flouride, switching to natural toothpastes takes a bit of experimentation.</li>
            <li>We wanted a toothpaste without fluoride and one that is natural.  </li>
            <li>Jason Natural tea tree oil and cinnamon flavor toothpaste (with no fluoride of course.)</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil in this toothpaste cured them completely.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I am way too busy to think</li>
            <li>(Google that action).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying a few different brands for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste, and this is certainly one of the higher rated.</li>
            <li>Occasionally, I add a little neem bark tooth powder in with this toothpaste for an added kick of clean and freshness.</li>
            <li>Decent cinnamon content for lasting freshness, but without staining red dyes.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped really fast and arrived way before expected date.</li>
            <li>that is free of added blue, red or green dyes.</li>
            <li>I love that the flavor isn&#x27;t overpowering and the fact that there aren&#x27;t all these unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find this one didn&#x27;t taste bad at all, and actually was rather pleasant.</li>
            <li>The only critique I have is that I feel that the texture of it is rather odd when I first put it on my toothbrush</li>
            <li>i researched and read a lot of labels and finally found this toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have sugar, xylitol, or another sweetener that will mess with blood sugar levels - and who wants to brush their teeth with sugar?!  </li>
            <li>the tube is pretty small at first sight but you can put half the size of your pinky fingernail and it foams a lot.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste but too expensive and small.</li>
            <li>The tube is smaller than an average tube of say Colgate, but it seemed to last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure if I would like this toothpaste or not, as there have been several of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; variety that I really didn&#x27;t like at all, they were just gross and had a very weird &amp;#34;mouth-feel&amp;#34; to them.</li>

            <li> smooth, excellent&lt;br /&gt;Tastes great&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Will reduce any gum bleeding, which proves it&#x27;s working some magic.  </li>
            <li> Also is SLS free and Gluten free.</li>
            <li> It does not taste as good as the main toothpaste brands, but the benefits are considerably higher.</li>
            <li> Gets your teeth super clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean, and look whiter as well.</li>
            <li> I like that it isn&#x27;t sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth very refreshed feeling and it taste better then any toothpaste i have ever had.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really expect healthy things to &amp;</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth and breath feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves my breath feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Has a fresh clean taste and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I think I should have bought more than 2 on my last order. :)</li>
            <li> This leaves my mouth feeling tingly and fresh, tastes much better,  and I seem to not have as much tartar on my teeth after a night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I bought this toothpaste and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> Cool fresh mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to find a toothpast that is natural and replaces Crest!</li>
            <li> and I gag from the overly strong, minty flavor of most commercial brands.</li>
            <li> and if you have a sensitive mouth you should for sure try this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> well and keeps my breath fresh.</li>
            <li> The minty/clove flavor and scent tends to go away pretty quickly after brushing.</li>
            <li> I am very particular about toothpaste and love natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this plus its contains natural ingredients not a bunch of chemical names.</li>
            <li> I would high recommend this toothpaste especially if you are looking for a natural yet great cleaning toothpaste.</li>
            <li> but it tastes a lot better than what I was doing before which was putting a drop of Tea Tree Oil on my regular toothpaste before brushing.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using Jasons natural toothpastes because I feel like I know what is in them.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is the only toothpaste the cleans my teeth</li>
            <li> i first purchased one in  a vitamin store in st augustine fl ona visit to my daughter-</li>
            <li> ARE JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER.</li>
            <li> (it is gonna last for ever), but for me the spices are felt too strong</li>
            <li> Tastes great and is actually very cost efficient, as it takes 2/3&#x27;s less toothpaste to get the same results!  </li>
            <li> This one is OK; the flavor is lighter than I expected but it does the job.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste cleans really well</li>
            <li> , it is very foamy</li>
            <li> With the taste of clove, it leaves your breath feeling fresh and alive like never before.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for its health benefits!</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t really feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot; until my teeth have been attended.</li>
            <li> and I must admit although the flavor is a kaleidoscope of ingredients it all comes together really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> My wife and my 93-yr-old mother really like the fact there is no fluoride in it.  </li>
            <li> Really like this.</li>
            <li> Yes, you may have guests say, &#x27;this doesn&#x27;t seem like real toothpaste.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that same fresh feeling from using regular toothpaste, but I&#x27;m hoping this is better for me.  </li>
            <li> Some tooth sensitivity but absolutely none of the mouth sores that come with SLS.</li>
            <li> It was okay, no big deal I haven&#x27;t used it completely</li>
            <li> nice to have this product to alternate with the regular toothpastes one has grown up with!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is just as good if not better than my previous favorite toothpaste (Melalueca brand).  </li>
            <li> Something else I liked was that it left my mouth with that clean feeling for a longer time than other natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Usually make my own.  </li>
            <li> so I went looking for an alternative and this came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It actually makes it fun to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> I had to look for new toothpaste because I was having problems with mouth sores.</li>
            <li> It really makes your mouth feel clean and is never once bothered my sensitive teeth like other brands .I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I have a bad reaction to SLS and I was glad to finally find one that didn&#x27;t have any in it and also tastes good.</li>
            <li> But no real complaints other than it&#x27;s kind of soapy.</li>
            <li> I like this natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 10 days so far, and my teeth feel really clean in a way that other toothpastes haven&#x27;t made them ever feel before and it lasts.</li>
            <li> but it is also clearly well made.</li>
            <li> Am trying to eliminate SLS and flouride, switching to natural toothpastes takes a bit of experimentation.</li>
            <li> We wanted a toothpaste without fluoride and one that is natural.  </li>
            <li> Jason Natural tea tree oil and cinnamon flavor toothpaste (with no fluoride of course.)</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil in this toothpaste cured them completely.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I am way too busy to think</li>
            <li> (Google that action).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a few different brands for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste, and this is certainly one of the higher rated.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, I add a little neem bark tooth powder in with this toothpaste for an added kick of clean and freshness.</li>
            <li> Decent cinnamon content for lasting freshness, but without staining red dyes.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped really fast and arrived way before expected date.</li>
            <li> that is free of added blue, red or green dyes.</li>
            <li> I love that the flavor isn&#x27;t overpowering and the fact that there aren&#x27;t all these unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find this one didn&#x27;t taste bad at all, and actually was rather pleasant.</li>
            <li> The only critique I have is that I feel that the texture of it is rather odd when I first put it on my toothbrush</li>
            <li> i researched and read a lot of labels and finally found this toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have sugar, xylitol, or another sweetener that will mess with blood sugar levels - and who wants to brush their teeth with sugar?!  </li>
            <li> the tube is pretty small at first sight but you can put half the size of your pinky fingernail and it foams a lot.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste but too expensive and small.</li>
            <li> The tube is smaller than an average tube of say Colgate, but it seemed to last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure if I would like this toothpaste or not, as there have been several of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; variety that I really didn&#x27;t like at all, they were just gross and had a very weird &amp;#34;mouth-feel&amp;#34; to them.</li>
            <li> The taste is fine, but not fascinating, and I wish they had other flavors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Why can&#x27;t other toothpaste manufacturer&#x27;s take a lesson from Jason&#x27;s and give the public good tasting all natural toothpaste instead of chemical laden crap that harms the body.</li>
            <li> it lasts longer than the regular colgate tube that is 30% longer, I made the test using both tubes at the same time, one inthe morning, the other one in the evening, and I finished the Jason toothpaste about 6 days later.</li>
            <li> The tube wasn&#x27;t as big as we expected however.</li>
            <li> Mouth feel fresh and clean no more bad taste in my mouth</li>
            <li> little pricey, but you can make a tube last</li>
            <li> The taste is about what I expected for the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE FLOURIDE AND THE OTHER INGREDIENTS</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like having endless chemicals in my mouth.</li>
            <li> No baking soda to leave gross hard deposits on your gumline.  </li>
            <li> My doctor recommend I get a toothpaste that is SLS free and after trying a few that tasted horrible or didnt work very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one less thing to worry about staining my teeth.</li>
            <li> a little too spicy for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but dude</li>
            <li> THIS EXPENSIVE TOOTHPASTE IS REALLY NO BIG DEAL.</li>
            <li> No cavities have formed and I have been using it for the past 3 years</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> at least so it must work.</li>
            <li> Even though it contains tea tree oil, it leaves your mouth feeling so clean without that horrible tea tree oil taste.</li>
            <li> I think it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I feel it is a bit expensive</li>
            <li> Store brand toothpastes have dangerous chemicals</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Am trying to eliminate SLS and flouride, switching to natural toothpastes takes a bit of experimentation. This one is OK; the flavor is lighter than I expected but it does the job. I like that it isn&#x27;t sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!  Tastes great and is actually very cost efficient, as it takes 2/3&#x27;s less toothpaste to get the same results!  Very pleased with this toothpaste!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Maybe because it was a paste.</li>
            <li> I Love it when a product does what it says it will do.  Kudos to Jason Healthy Mouth for delivering!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  We wanted a toothpaste without fluoride and one that is natural.  The taste is great!  Leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. Just what we needed.  Definitely will buy again.  The tube wasn&#x27;t as big as we expected however.</li>
            <li> I had to look for new toothpaste because I was having problems with mouth sores. My doctor recommend I get a toothpaste that is SLS free and after trying a few that tasted horrible or didnt work very well I found this one. I absolutely love it. It leaves your mouth very refreshed feeling and it taste better then any toothpaste i have ever had. I would high recommend this toothpaste especially if you are looking for a natural yet great cleaning toothpaste. and if you have a sensitive mouth you should for sure try this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth and breath feel fresh and clean. Tastes good.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes really great it is nice and minty. I&#x27;m glad to find a toothpast that is natural and replaces Crest!</li>
            <li> The toothpaste cleans really well, it is very foamy and you need just a very very tiny bit of it (it is gonna last for ever), but for me the spices are felt too strong, i would prefer its taste was milder, but it is just my preference. It was shipped really fast and arrived way before expected date.</li>
            <li> Mouth feel fresh and clean no more bad taste in my mouth</li>
            <li> a little too spicy for me</li>
            <li> Great taste and leaves my teeth feeling clean and fresh after using.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tasting and most enjoyable toothpaste I have ever used. To top it off, it&#x27;s all narutal. With the taste of clove, it leaves your breath feeling fresh and alive like never before. It actually makes it fun to brush your teeth. Now I look forward to it and even find excuses to brush my teeth more often. I think I should have bought more than 2 on my last order. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why can&#x27;t other toothpaste manufacturer&#x27;s take a lesson from Jason&#x27;s and give the public good tasting all natural toothpaste instead of chemical laden crap that harms the body. I will never buy anything else but Jason&#x27;s from now on.</li>
            <li> Cool fresh mouth.  Alleviates sensitivity as well.  I strongly recommend this plus its contains natural ingredients not a bunch of chemical names.</li>
            <li> I just started using this so I can&#x27;t attest to any earth shattering improvement in my teeth yet but it tastes a lot better than what I was doing before which was putting a drop of Tea Tree Oil on my regular toothpaste before brushing.  This leaves my mouth feeling tingly and fresh, tastes much better,  and I seem to not have as much tartar on my teeth after a night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> Jason Natural tea tree oil and cinnamon flavor toothpaste (with no fluoride of course.) Might just be my all time favorite brand and flavor of toothpaste. Gets your teeth super clean and smooth. While helping to keep your gums healthy and your breath smelling fresh. My eyes tend to water and I gag from the overly strong, minty flavor of most commercial brands. So this toothpaste is a lifesaver. And it&#x27;s safe for children to use too. I also feel good about brushing my teeth with a tooth paste or gel  that is free of added blue, red or green dyes. It&#x27;s one less thing to worry about staining my teeth.</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I bought this toothpaste and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! Some people mentioned an aftertaste, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem. My teeth feel so clean, and look whiter as well. Great product!</li>
            <li> I used to suffer from canker sores. The tea tree oil in this toothpaste cured them completely. I haven&#x27;t had one since I started using  this. It also tastes good!</li>
            <li> After the harshness of Crest and Colgate for many years, this product seems nearly perfect to me! I love that the flavor isn&#x27;t overpowering and the fact that there aren&#x27;t all these unnecessary chemicals. I actually enjoy brushing now. The only critique I have is that I feel that the texture of it is rather odd when I first put it on my toothbrush and it&#x27;s a bit too foamy by the time I stop brushing.</li>
            <li> I love the flavor of this toothpaste.  It reminds me of the Teaberry gum I remember. I love that it contains none of the chemical additives most toothpaste contains . Fresh breath and great taste without the burn.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful toothpaste, it&#x27;s so effective that I end up using about 1/4th as much as the other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love Jason products</li>
            <li> Have been using this toothpaste for several months and am very happy with the results. I like what it DOESN&#x27;T contain. The taste is about what I expected for the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Love the taste and the fresh feeling in the mouth.  Received toothpaste in a timely manner.  I have no complaints about the product or service.  Thank you keep up the good work</li>
            <li> THIS EXPENSIVE TOOTHPASTE IS REALLY NO BIG DEAL. THE OVER THE COUNTERS ARE JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER. YEAH I UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE FLOURIDE AND THE OTHER INGREDIENTS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT CAUSE EMINENT DEATH (WHICH IS INEVITABLE) BUT I TRIED IT AND REMBRANDT DEEPLY IS BETTER, TO ME. YES, I DO TASTE THE CINNAMON AND A HINT OF TEA TREE BUT AGAIN THIS TOOTHPASTE IS TOO EXPENSIVE JUST TO BE OKAY.</li>
            <li> Its great! It does not taste as good as the main toothpaste brands, but the benefits are considerably higher.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this toothpaste.  I love the taste and it&#x27;s great for my gums.  It does foam a lot so you don&#x27;t need a lot to do the job.</li>
            <li> Love these products and use them all the time.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for its health benefits! No Fluoride for one which is huge in itself! Tastes good, works well and arrived fairly quickly</li>
            <li> I enjoy using Jasons natural toothpastes because I feel like I know what is in them. I don&#x27;t like having endless chemicals in my mouth. Leaves my breath feeling fresh and clean. No cavities have formed and I have been using it for the past 3 years at least so it must work.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent and the transaction went very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Really nice toothpaste, it tastes better than I thought it would and best of all itÂ´s natural and no chemicals.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Consistency is smooth, excellent&lt;br /&gt;Tastes great&lt;br /&gt;Only need a little&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey, but you can make a tube last</li>
            <li> I must admit that I am way too busy to think/worry about my toothpaste selections. However, I don&#x27;t really feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot; until my teeth have been attended. I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in 20+ years and I wanna&#x27; keep it that way. I like the taste/scent of tea tree oil so this was within my scope. I&#x27;ve used it for a week and I must admit although the flavor is a kaleidoscope of ingredients it all comes together really well. The cap allows one hand operation which is a big +..!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on a chance and I&#x27;m glad that I did..</li>
            <li> The toothpaste is good but very pricey.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is the only toothpaste the cleans my teeth well and keeps my breath fresh. If you use an electric tooth brush, all you need is a dab of this toothpaste to do the job, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Prompt service and good merchandise. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love how it works and tastes</li>
            <li> My wife and my 93-yr-old mother really like the fact there is no fluoride in it.  And they like how it works.  I think it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste but too expensive and small.</li>
            <li> Nice tasting toothpaste.  I like the way it cleans also. It promotes a healthy mouth.</li>
            <li> Really like this. Just wish the freshness lasted longer. The minty/clove flavor and scent tends to go away pretty quickly after brushing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an interesting flavor, but my mouth feels great and clean! I have a sensitivity to sulfites, so regular toothpastes make my mouth hurt; this toothpaste is perfect.</li>
            <li> very good tooth paste, love it</li>
            <li> Taste good, Has tea tree in it, my mouth already feeling fresher and confident. No breath worries anymore. Love it</li>
            <li> Really good and refreshing. Store brand toothpastes have dangerous chemicals so I went looking for an alternative and this came highly recommended. I&#x27;ve bought it twice now and will repurchase. Great taste, your mouth feels clean and even whitens teeth. I liked it!</li>
            <li> This is the world&#x27;s best toothpaste...it seems like the only option on the market.  The taste is fine, but not fascinating, and I wish they had other flavors.  However:  No Sodium Laureth Sulfate to give you chin acne (Google that action).  No baking soda to leave gross hard deposits on your gumline.  Tea tree instead of fluoride, because it works, and because fluoride is everywhere anyway, killing you with a quickness.  Will reduce any gum bleeding, which proves it&#x27;s working some magic.  Decent cinnamon content for lasting freshness, but without staining red dyes.  Yes, you may have guests say, &#x27;this doesn&#x27;t seem like real toothpaste.&#x27;  Throw their luggage in the street.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really expect healthy things to &amp;#34;taste great,&amp;#34; and this tastes just fine to me.  I don&#x27;t get that same fresh feeling from using regular toothpaste, but I&#x27;m hoping this is better for me.  I actually use this probably 85 - 90% of the time, and occasionally I switch and use regular.  But no real complaints other than it&#x27;s kind of soapy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a few different brands for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste, and this is certainly one of the higher rated.</li>
            <li> This product had a great taste for a natural toothpaste. Will definitely buy again and I recommend to others to try. The tube is smaller than an average tube of say Colgate, but it seemed to last a pretty long time. Something else I liked was that it left my mouth with that clean feeling for a longer time than other natural toothpaste. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but dude.. GIVE IT A TRY!</li>
            <li> Bought this looking for a sodium laureth sulfate free toothpaste, it worked perfectly! Flavor is fine and it does the job. Love how healthy this stuff is.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. Even though it contains tea tree oil, it leaves your mouth feeling so clean without that horrible tea tree oil taste. The cinnamon is the perfect combination with the tea tree oil. I like it better than the strong tea tree oil and spearmint flavors.</li>
            <li> I like this natural toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Superior service!</li>
            <li> Very nice toothpaste.  I like the tree tea oil especially.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste I use. I love the flavor and how clean my teeth feel after brushing. Occasionally, I add a little neem bark tooth powder in with this toothpaste for an added kick of clean and freshness. Cleans well, freshens breath...I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Did not arrive in good condition....</li>
            <li> Very nice tasting toothpaste if you are looking for something without fluoride.  Has a fresh clean taste and cleans well. Also is SLS free and Gluten free.</li>
            <li> Very clean and refreshing taste. No irritations. Some tooth sensitivity but absolutely none of the mouth sores that come with SLS. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It was okay, no big deal I haven&#x27;t used it completely, I think I like my 3d crest better</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I have ever used.  Great flavor and leaves my mouth feeling so clean!  I have been using for several weeks and plan to continue.  I hope it does not disappear like all good things seem to.</li>
            <li> I love this product use faithfully no longer use fluoride toothpaste</li>
            <li> Not quite sure what people are finding wrong with the taste here... it is excellent. This replaced my Tom&#x27;s and I don&#x27;t think I will be going back. It has everything I want in a toothpaste with tea tree and cinnamon as well as Aloe for the gums. I feel it is a bit expensive but it is also clearly well made. 4.5 stars for the cost I guess.</li>
            <li> i first purchased one in  a vitamin store in st augustine fl ona visit to my daughter- i is a  very good product- will repurchase soon again</li>
            <li> i researched and read a lot of labels and finally found this toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t have sugar, xylitol, or another sweetener that will mess with blood sugar levels - and who wants to brush their teeth with sugar?!  this tastes good and not too sweet and uses stevia.....a winner for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure why but since I started using this toothpaste I don&#x27;t like anything else!. It really makes your mouth feel clean and is never once bothered my sensitive teeth like other brands .I&#x27;m hooked- love the product!</li>
            <li> ..... nice to have this product to alternate with the regular toothpastes one has grown up with!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very particular about toothpaste and love natural toothpaste.  Usually make my own.  We absolutely love LOVE this toothpaste!!!  Highly recommend it.  Your mouth feels so fresh and chemical free too!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure if I would like this toothpaste or not, as there have been several of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; variety that I really didn&#x27;t like at all, they were just gross and had a very weird &amp;#34;mouth-feel&amp;#34; to them. I was surprised to find this one didn&#x27;t taste bad at all, and actually was rather pleasant. I have a bad reaction to SLS and I was glad to finally find one that didn&#x27;t have any in it and also tastes good. I&#x27;ve used it for about 10 days so far, and my teeth feel really clean in a way that other toothpastes haven&#x27;t made them ever feel before and it lasts.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste.</li>
            <li> One of the best toothpastes I&#x27;ve used.  This is just as good if not better than my previous favorite toothpaste (Melalueca brand).  It does not contain detergents, which can cause oral sores in some people (me included).</li>
            <li> this is clearly the best taste. the tube is pretty small at first sight but you can put half the size of your pinky fingernail and it foams a lot. it lasts longer than the regular colgate tube that is 30% longer, I made the test using both tubes at the same time, one inthe morning, the other one in the evening, and I finished the Jason toothpaste about 6 days later. And it pairs well with the cinnamon clove mouthwash. ive been using them for 2 years now.</li>
