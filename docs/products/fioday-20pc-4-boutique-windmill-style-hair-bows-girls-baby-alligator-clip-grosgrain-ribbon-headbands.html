            <li>If ordering for a child over the age of one or with a lot of hair I would recommend ordering two sets because they are more piggy tail size than just pull hair up size.</li>

            <li>I love all the color they are really pretty</li>
            <li>The price was worth the quality and selection of ribbons I got too!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a ruler handy to measure to make sure they were in fact 4&amp;#34;, but I have asked to return these and for my money back.</li>
            <li>Other than that, they are beautiful and all are well made.</li>
            <li>As expected, very cute!</li>
            <li>but once I pryed them open they were good to use.</li>
            <li>These arrived fast, they&#x27;re super cute and super sturdy.</li>
            <li>All was great, just what I expected!</li>

            <li>Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>I use these bows for a four year old and a newborn; they look fabulous in both of their hair.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t have any teeth, they are completely flat, so they move around too easily in my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair.</li>
            <li>I got what I expected, love the colors</li>
            <li>Came very promptly</li>

            <li>The bows were cute but smaller than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>They are an ok size for everyday wear for my 7 month old.</li>
            <li>as expected simple and cute bows</li>
            <li>Deleted very is longer than other items but if you can wait they are worth the money.</li>
            <li>My 10 yr old daughter loves the bows.</li>
            <li>Needed this size for my 4 mo old.</li>
            <li>These you generally find two n three to a pack for a couple$$, so a pack of 20 for 10$, I am a fan!</li>
            <li>The only flaw is that the end of the dark yellow has a little stain or some kind of discoloration on it.</li>
            <li>Early actually!</li>
            <li>The right size for little ones.</li>

            <li> The right size for little ones. I have three girls ages 3,4,&amp;7 these bows are perfect! All the colors you&#x27;ll need. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Made great and a nice size</li>
            <li> I got what I expected, love the colors</li>
            <li> Lovely! Very nice as expected!</li>
            <li> They were a lot smaller than what I thought they would be but very cute I kept them but my little girl is only 11 months old</li>
            <li> Great bows! If ordering for a child over the age of one or with a lot of hair I would recommend ordering two sets because they are more piggy tail size than just pull hair up size. They say 4&amp;#34; but they look a little smaller than my other 4&amp;#34; bows. (I haven&#x27;t measured to be exactly sure though)</li>
            <li> These hold up ok, the price is the best. Inspired me to make my own hairbows.</li>
            <li> So cute. Should&#x27;ve ordered 2 to match.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, packaged well! I bought these for my 4 week old to wear on headbands and they are perfect. She&#x27;ll get years of use out of them. The only flaw is that the end of the dark yellow has a little stain or some kind of discoloration on it. Other than that, they are beautiful and all are well made.</li>
            <li> We love these bows! Stay in my daughters hair perfectly!</li>
            <li> this was a great price and quality product! Now my daughter has a bow to match every outfit. it would also be a great gift!</li>
            <li> Beautiful bows for my 19 month old granddaughter! All colors and arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I like the size of these bows but they don&#x27;t have any teeth, they are completely flat, so they move around too easily in my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair. They are made well, I just don&#x27;t like the clip.</li>
            <li> Deleted very is longer than other items but if you can wait they are worth the money.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with these bows.  The same ones sell for 7.75 plus tax at the neighborhood kids clothing boutique.  The edge of one has frayed slightly, but otherwise these are high-quality, cute, cheap, and a great assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> Great bows Mine were perfect for my toddlers hair</li>
            <li> awesome deal and great product i love these can&#x27;t wait to order more</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the quality of the ribbons, very nice. Great range of colors that match back to our daughter&#x27;s clothes. Would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> The bows do not look as pictured, the bows I received are slightly deformed and not shaped as a bow should.</li>
            <li> Nice big pack of hair bows</li>
            <li> A very nice set of Bows for my girls hair. They are about 4inches in size- not too big ....but not too small either. The bows are colorful, reasonably priced and have an alligator clip on.</li>
            <li> My 4 yrs old loving the assorted colors hair bows!!!</li>
            <li> I love all the color they are really pretty</li>
            <li> Great value on these great bows!</li>
            <li> Came very promptly and i love them! They work perfectly for me!</li>
            <li> These bows are adorable! That you very much!</li>
            <li> My 10 yr old daughter loves the bows. They are well made, of a good quality, the clips hold well, and she loves the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Great size quality clips  and every color!</li>
            <li> So cute!  Can&#x27;t wait for niece to try them!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Got them to use on my best friend&#x27;s hair, her daughter&#x27;s, and mine on a recent trip to Disney World. They worked fantastic, stayed in place well, and looked great with all of our themed outfits! The price was worth the quality and selection of ribbons I got too!</li>
            <li> All was great, just what I expected!</li>
            <li> These bows arrived quickly and colors are as pictured. The size is a little smaller than expected. They will look best on my 18 month old and 5 year old. Not so great for the two older tweens. We should have been more observant before purchasing. However the colors are great and go with so many clothes that we will keep them. But will be ordering a set of 4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These are super tiny! I didn&#x27;t have a ruler handy to measure to make sure they were in fact 4&amp;#34;, but I have asked to return these and for my money back. They&#x27;re still sitting in my car in the box they were shipped in.</li>
            <li> These are great!  Fantastic quality, love the colors.  Metal clasp stays in and holds back quite a bit of hair.  Comparable to the bows you find at salons for five to ten dollars each.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but they do slip off the hair</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Needed this size for my 4 mo old. Seem well made. The clip size is good. Also makes a great baby shower gift.</li>
            <li> On time! Early actually! And a great price &amp; product! Super pleased!!!!</li>
            <li> Came all the way from China. Arrived earlier than expected. Good price and look good!</li>
            <li> As expected, very cute!</li>
            <li> Just love them they are amazing. Perfect size perfect&lt;br /&gt;Colors just perfect!!</li>
            <li> I bought a set of 2 for my twin granddaughters They love hair bows!!!!</li>
            <li> They are so adorableðŸŽ€</li>
            <li> The bows were cute but smaller than I had expected.  They are an ok size for everyday wear for my 7 month old. They lay really flat so if you&#x27;re wanting a more boutique style bow these aren&#x27;t for you.  The shipping took a couple of weeks, but I got all the colors listed and I am overall pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> These are cute I was looking for something a little smaller because all I have is the great big ones. The colors are super cute too.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Just as described, nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I loved them for my girls you get every color you can think off!! It&#x27;s perfect to match those outfits on a daily basis. Delivery was fast and price was amazing. Will order more ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> Love it, there are perfect for my daughter</li>
            <li> i wear one every day! love these!</li>
            <li> Very cute bows! Nice size too! But if your child is one to take their barrets out, beware, they may tear it from the clamp..</li>
            <li> Everithing was ok...!</li>
            <li> Received on time. They look so cute and are the perfect size for my three-year old. We bought a lot to give away as presents and giveaways.</li>
            <li> These arrived fast, they&#x27;re super cute and super sturdy. I definitely recommend the purchase!</li>
            <li> These are beautiful for my daughters hair. I live being able to match her hairbows with her outfit.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and well made</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these bows. I want to buy another set for pigtails and braids. I use these bows for a four year old and a newborn; they look fabulous in both of their hair. (I use crochet headbands for the newborn) My four year old wears them to school and out to play and they have held up great. I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love them I have a color for every outfit. .</li>
            <li> Love love love these bows, perfection!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Good size bow, as expected. Good quality ribbon in a nice symetrical bow. Great colors and bang for your buck. The clips are metal as expected- I just prefer the fabric covered clips... And when they arrived 1-2 metal clips were glued shut but once I pryed them open they were good to use.</li>
            <li> as expected simple and cute bows</li>
            <li> Love these bows; they are the perfect size and they look lovely when my daughter wears them. And we have every color!!</li>
            <li> Great value. All the colors I could want.</li>
            <li> Great buy! These bows are a perfect touch for an updo! These you generally find two n three to a pack for a couple$$, so a pack of 20 for 10$, I am a fan! May purchase from them again! They even shipped fast. Happy customer &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Adorable! Great quality!</li>
            <li> So cute, my girls love them!  Would order again!</li>

            <li> I am so pleased with these hairbows! They are great quality and look darling in my toddler&#x27;s hair!! I bought two packs so we can do pigtails. Im planning to buy more in case she loses one!!</li>
            <li> Thrilled to get this many bows for such a great deal. All bows are heat sealed to prevent fraying!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE BOWS!!! THE CLIPS ARE QUALITY...QUALITY IS GREAT AND AMAZING PRICE. I WILL BUY AGAIN IF PRICE REMAINS THE SAME.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Wish they came with two of each color.  I&#x27;ll have to buy another bag. These bows are great</li>
