            <li>Still my favorite China Glaze color!&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li>We love you, make more.</li>
            <li>I love China Glaze polishes and</li>
            <li>And people love it when I tell them it&#x27;s Hunger Games themed.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS COLOR....</li>
            <li>I got Harvest Moon and it is simply stunning.</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite color of all</li>
            <li>also have fast track which is also great.</li>
            <li>It lasts well without chipping (with a top coat) and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Goes on well and is a beautiful color, especially for fall.  </li>
            <li>this when it was originally released as a promotional color for the Hunger Games films, but it is still one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re into this colouring I believe it&#x27;s worth the try!</li>
            <li>Beautiful shimmery dark orange!</li>
            <li>Very pretty for an autumn color.</li>
            <li>In my quest for more nail polish and my new obsession with China Glaze</li>
            <li>This may be my new favorite fall color with a purple accent nail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty coppery color with just the right amount of shimmer in it.</li>
            <li>Warm, shimmery, but solid.  </li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>Be smart... gardening and nail polish don&#x27;t go together.</li>
            <li>I bought Fast Track and Harvest Moon.</li>
            <li>One coat + one clear top coat will last a week!</li>
            <li>Harvest Moon stays on surprisingly well and the color is gorgeous, a dark bronze-gold that shines but is still subtle enough for the office.</li>
            <li>I usually stick with classic nail polish colors but am so glad that I ordered this polish!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend both of them.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t too dark, and it&#x27;s like a light show in the sun.</li>
            <li>I have received numerous compliments on how pretty my hands are.  </li>
            <li>Not too bright or flashy.</li>
            <li>They send out quickly into our greedy little hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this polish once, but so far I adore it!</li>
            <li>I enjoy looking down at my hands and toes!!!</li>

            <li> Beautiful shimmery dark orange! Just want I needed for Halloween :)</li>
            <li> this is a beautiful color. Stays on without chipping for days. Be smart... gardening and nail polish don&#x27;t go together. Use gloves for those things. I&#x27;ve seen people complain that it chipped when they did &amp;#34;some gardening&#x27;...really...</li>
            <li> I bought Fast Track and Harvest Moon. Haven&#x27;t tried on Fast Track yet, but the color looks great, a neutral with flecks of gold. Harvest Moon stays on surprisingly well and the color is gorgeous, a dark bronze-gold that shines but is still subtle enough for the office. Two coats and it&#x27;s good! Will definitely purchase again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite China Glaze color!&lt;br /&gt;Bought this when it was originally released as a promotional color for the Hunger Games films, but it is still one of my favorites.

            <li> This color is gorgeous. Not too bright or flashy. It has a really nice shimmer to it, doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li> In my household, nail polish is the crack of choice. China Glaze consistently has the best product. They send out quickly into our greedy little hands. We love you, make more.</li>
            <li> Great color payoff and very nice formula. For the hunger games! A brilliant copper gold color, great polish for those that love glitter and this shade.</li>

            <li> I got Harvest Moon and it is simply stunning. The color isn&#x27;t too dark, and it&#x27;s like a light show in the sun. Probably my favorite color of all time.&lt;br /&gt;I also have fast track which is also great. It dries to be a beige color with sparklies. They last about a week. Highly recommend both of them.</li>
            <li> In my quest for more nail polish and my new obsession with China Glaze I decided to try to order a few of these colours inspired from the Hunger Games (I saw an ad in a foreign magazine awhile back).  This colour is amazing!  My mom actually tried it on the day it arrived.  I have yet to wear it lol  It is heavily glitterized and takes a few tries to take off I&#x27;m told.  But if you&#x27;re into this colouring I believe it&#x27;s worth the try!</li>
            <li> The picture does not do this polish justice. This is a beautiful warm slightly copper brown perfect for the fall. This may be my new favorite fall color with a purple accent nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this polish once, but so far I adore it! The color is lighter than it looks in the picture. It&#x27;s a very pretty coppery color with just the right amount of shimmer in it. It&#x27;s held up very nicely against chipping, but I did put a good top coat on it.</li>
            <li> It has great color and has wonderful creamy texture. The color is wonderful and doesn&#x27;t chip very easily. I would recommend this to anyone that likes nail polish.</li>
            <li> Beautiful on my hands.  I have received numerous compliments on how pretty my hands are.  I enjoy looking down at my hands and toes!!!</li>
            <li> Very pretty for an autumn color. Item is prettier on than it shows in the bottle.</li>
