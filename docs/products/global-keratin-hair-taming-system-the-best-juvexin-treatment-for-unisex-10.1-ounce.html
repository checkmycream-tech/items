            <li>Thank you GK :)</li>
            <li>and I was given sample sizes of the products to use until the salon was able to obtain the GK products to sell.  </li>
            <li>I was also concerned about losing my curls because I do love them.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Makes my frizzy hair so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be more frizzy.  </li>
            <li>my hair now better than before</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did though.</li>
            <li>you just have to make sure to follow the directions and buy the shampoo and conditioner with it as well.</li>
            <li>I waited 48 hrs just to play it safe.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did not return it, because Gkhair</li>
            <li>I absolutely, positively LOVE this system.  </li>
            <li>I love the shine.  </li>
            <li>That is okay with me.</li>
            <li>The humidity is no t my enemy more.</li>
            <li>I had look for further instructions at utube so that I could achieve best results, but the product is overall very good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that you can wash it right away.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use .</li>

            <li>In love with this product, left my hair shiny and smooth!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and porous so</li>
            <li>I am super satisfied.</li>
            <li>Nice thing about this \\&quot;GK the Best Hair Taming System&#x27; is \\&quot;I\\&quot; had complete control over the process; \\&quot;I\\&quot; decided how long to leave it on (25 min)</li>
            <li>The products have not been available in my salon yet, even though my stylist was promised their availability from the beginning.  </li>
            <li>so it was free for me to have this treatment on my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair has been friz free for about 3 weeks now.  </li>
            <li>so I think I did my part to help keep my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important that the client knows what there getting.</li>
            <li>When I got it done in the salon it was beautiful and silky and healthy but when I washed it again it was a mess</li>
            <li>I love this so much that I have branched out to the conditioner (a must!), shampoo and serum.  </li>
            <li>One of the best taming systems out there because I still have the option to wear my hair curly when I want which is usually during the summer time.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>but it was well worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>This Amazon price tag was worth it!</li>
            <li>but so far I love the results!</li>
            <li>My natural hair is beautiful and soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for when I&#x27;m straight</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important you follow the right directions for the type of treatment; (2) it doesn&#x27;t come with an application brush;</li>
            <li>I recently had the BEST Keratin treatment on Monday, May 11, 2015, for some reason, my blonde highlighted hair turned orange after using the product.  </li>
            <li>The results were not the silky sheen and feel that I have experienced previously.</li>
            <li>I guess if you have to pay at a salon think about it, for 150 it is worth it after all  </li>
            <li>and I love how soft and maneageble</li>
            <li>Worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the initial feel and anti</li>
            <li>And unlike other vendor, I actually receive the one called best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shoulder length, and fine, but I have a decent amount of it.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, good</li>
            <li>my hair is right now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to say this right now</li>
            <li>I have wavy fine hair that shouldn&#x27;t need a whole lot of &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; to get it straight.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping ..</li>
            <li>I would not pay very much for this system if I were you....</li>
            <li>Love these products, they are necessary if you keep keratin treatment in your hair.</li>
            <li>and it is so pretty.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I printed the directions from the GK web site and followed them exactly.</li>
            <li>I waited 2 days before washing my hair out the first time</li>
            <li>Because I didn&#x27;t use the exact items, I&#x27;m sure my application won&#x27;t last 5 months-</li>
            <li>I expected it to &amp; for as much as the bottle cost, it would&#x27;ve been nice.</li>
            <li>My hair looks good, tame and smooth, but after the first wash I noticed a noxious odor when my hair was wet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so pretty and soft!!  </li>
            <li>My hair was never that straight with a chemical relaxer.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered the styling products both for curly and straight styles.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>The product probably doesn&#x27;t make that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it and I am planning to continue using it.</li>
            <li>fast shipment too</li>
            <li>plus I want straight hair since this product ruined my ringlet curls.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and the minute I walk out the salon</li>
            <li>My hair dries really fast after washing it and it looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>It really does what is claims to do.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t look or feel like it to me at all.  </li>
            <li>I believe it is very pricey, depending on where you have it done...between</li>
            <li>your have split ends, this product fix it really</li>
            <li>It does not make hair perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>(max is 60 which I will try next time) and rinsed lightly leaving some of the product in before flat ironing (check out the website for detailed instructions for hair type and desired result).  </li>
            <li>all about this new treatment and was pretty convinced..</li>
            <li>I notice the improvement much more when I do the keratin, but I wanted to try this less aggressive one.</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of deep conditioning I got it to a manageable level, I personally would not recommend this product if you do want to get it be cautious about who does it make sure</li>
            <li>long (mid-back) and has a mind of its own (wavy, curly, frizzy &amp; dry).</li>
            <li>When I went into high school</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Quantum Thermal Straightener</li>
            <li>Wish the price tag wasnt so high though.</li>
            <li>For anyone who is skeptical about this product it works great</li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s worth continuing the treatments in the future, but I&#x27;d like to know why my ends were so affected.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised at how soft my hair felt, afterward.</li>
            <li>I have used other keratin treatments in the past and have had great results.</li>
            <li>I am new to the keratin world.  </li>
            <li>(I went to a new one I had never been to before).</li>
            <li>my hair is new.</li>
            <li>This works wonders on destroyed or damaged hair, makes your hair feel soft and new again.</li>
            <li>If the treatment doesn&#x27;t last close to five months, then I think the salons should charge a lot less or many of their clients won&#x27;t continue using this product.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be a model for this product at my local salon(on 3.17.13)...</li>
            <li>I started natural hair journey after that incident and as I&#x27;m transitioning my hair was so umanagable, curly, frizzy, prone to breakage...</li>
            <li>it was so completely frizzy</li>
            <li>It was delivered one day early.</li>
            <li>Client has text me on 3 different occassions telling me how much she loves her hair and thanking me for introducing her to this product.</li>
            <li>Eliminates frizz, makes your hair soft, shiny, manageable and hassle-free.</li>
            <li>My wife has a very curly (coarse) hair and this product</li>
            <li>Getting my hair professionally straightened, or relaxed, costs well over $250 each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started out on the first time leaving it on for  25 minutes (including application time of 15 minutes and rinsing thoroughly, but on this last time I left is on for 50 minutes</li>
            <li>I can wash and go with curly/wavy hair or blow dry and iron for straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I am completely and utterly unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I expected it to &amp; for as much as the bottle cost, it would&#x27;ve been nice.gloves.  </li>
            <li>After two week her hair came back to normal form (coarse).</li>
            <li>I have had very curly, dry, frizzy hair for my entire life...</li>

            <li> And unlike other vendor, I actually receive the one called best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shoulder length, and fine, but I have a decent amount of it.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, good</li>
            <li> my hair is right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to say this right now</li>
            <li> I have wavy fine hair that shouldn&#x27;t need a whole lot of &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; to get it straight.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping ..</li>
            <li> I would not pay very much for this system if I were you....</li>
            <li> Love these products, they are necessary if you keep keratin treatment in your hair.</li>
            <li> and it is so pretty.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I printed the directions from the GK web site and followed them exactly.</li>
            <li> I waited 2 days before washing my hair out the first time</li>
            <li> Because I didn&#x27;t use the exact items, I&#x27;m sure my application won&#x27;t last 5 months-</li>
            <li> I expected it to &amp; for as much as the bottle cost, it would&#x27;ve been nice.</li>
            <li> My hair looks good, tame and smooth, but after the first wash I noticed a noxious odor when my hair was wet.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so pretty and soft!!  </li>
            <li> My hair was never that straight with a chemical relaxer.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered the styling products both for curly and straight styles.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> The product probably doesn&#x27;t make that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it and I am planning to continue using it.</li>
            <li> fast shipment too</li>
            <li> plus I want straight hair since this product ruined my ringlet curls.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and the minute I walk out the salon</li>
            <li> My hair dries really fast after washing it and it looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> It really does what is claims to do.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t look or feel like it to me at all.  </li>
            <li> I believe it is very pricey, depending on where you have it done...between</li>
            <li> your have split ends, this product fix it really</li>
            <li> It does not make hair perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> (max is 60 which I will try next time) and rinsed lightly leaving some of the product in before flat ironing (check out the website for detailed instructions for hair type and desired result).  </li>
            <li> all about this new treatment and was pretty convinced..</li>
            <li> I notice the improvement much more when I do the keratin, but I wanted to try this less aggressive one.</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of deep conditioning I got it to a manageable level, I personally would not recommend this product if you do want to get it be cautious about who does it make sure</li>
            <li> long (mid-back) and has a mind of its own (wavy, curly, frizzy &amp; dry).</li>
            <li> When I went into high school</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Quantum Thermal Straightener</li>
            <li> Wish the price tag wasnt so high though.</li>
            <li> For anyone who is skeptical about this product it works great</li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s worth continuing the treatments in the future, but I&#x27;d like to know why my ends were so affected.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised at how soft my hair felt, afterward.</li>
            <li> I have used other keratin treatments in the past and have had great results.</li>
            <li> I am new to the keratin world.  </li>
            <li> (I went to a new one I had never been to before).</li>
            <li> my hair is new.</li>
            <li> This works wonders on destroyed or damaged hair, makes your hair feel soft and new again.</li>
            <li> If the treatment doesn&#x27;t last close to five months, then I think the salons should charge a lot less or many of their clients won&#x27;t continue using this product.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be a model for this product at my local salon(on 3.17.13)...</li>
            <li> I started natural hair journey after that incident and as I&#x27;m transitioning my hair was so umanagable, curly, frizzy, prone to breakage...</li>
            <li> it was so completely frizzy</li>
            <li> It was delivered one day early.</li>
            <li> Client has text me on 3 different occassions telling me how much she loves her hair and thanking me for introducing her to this product.</li>
            <li> Eliminates frizz, makes your hair soft, shiny, manageable and hassle-free.</li>
            <li> My wife has a very curly (coarse) hair and this product</li>
            <li> Getting my hair professionally straightened, or relaxed, costs well over $250 each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started out on the first time leaving it on for  25 minutes (including application time of 15 minutes and rinsing thoroughly, but on this last time I left is on for 50 minutes</li>
            <li> I can wash and go with curly/wavy hair or blow dry and iron for straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I am completely and utterly unsatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I expected it to &amp; for as much as the bottle cost, it would&#x27;ve been nice.gloves.  </li>
            <li> After two week her hair came back to normal form (coarse).</li>
            <li> I have had very curly, dry, frizzy hair for my entire life...</li>
            <li> I have normal hair, not curly, not straight but waivy.</li>
            <li> I applied it professionally and don&#x27;t see such a big improvement, although it does look less frizzy and nicer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frizzy-especially in our humid summers, and like cotton candy with deep \\&quot;roller coasters\\&quot; in a few areas!  </li>
            <li> The ONLY strange issue is that in the front third of my hair, the ends became frazzled or fried looking.  </li>
            <li> This product just works for normal and little curly hair.</li>
            <li> I maintained smooth and straight hair for days, plus through a workout, which is impossible in my world.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long it will really last</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how long this stuff last in my hair.</li>
            <li> I rated this product as a 3 because it did not last as long as they mentioned.  </li>
            <li> you will see the defference like the curly its not gone completely but less than before......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, unlike the expensive Brazilian treatment where you have to stay with the product on your hair for 3 days and all the restrictions that go with it.</li>
            <li> I have had the GK treatment done in a salon and my hair was very soft for a few months.</li>
            <li> I waited a long 24 hours and washed it out.</li>
            <li> It took a long time.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts for as long as they say it will.  </li>
            <li> I would like to hear how long it lasted for others...</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay that way for long.</li>
            <li> (Because before another vendor use a bottle of other and just put a decal on it, an it was open!)  </li>
            <li> When it was time to blow dry my hair after rinsing the product out, I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through my hair let alone a brush when blow drying.</li>
            <li> dry-</li>
            <li> Either straight or curly my hair is tame with no frizz!!</li>
            <li> I will be going back to the brand I previously was using...</li>
            <li> I still have over half a bottle left of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It felt a little heavy and stiff for the first 48 hrs</li>
            <li> My hair is thick (Polynesian, Asian, Portuguese &amp; Italian descent);</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have a round brush to dry my hair with</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the results, the product promises it would last up to 5 months and the next time I wash my hair it was gone.</li>
            <li> When I finally dried my hair, which took so long it felt like straw!!</li>
            <li> $200.00-$400.00...definitely NOT worth that!...perhaps $85.00 or $100.00.  </li>
            <li> This product weighs your hair down, it doesn&#x27;t frizz, it gives it a lot of shine and life.</li>
            <li> It depends on multiple factors If you use the wrong shampoo, it will not last.</li>
            <li> I had thick kinky hair long hair.</li>
            <li> Lately however, my hair started breaking and was very dry.  </li>
            <li> every few months i do this treatment</li>
            <li> $300 to smell like a dead animal.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> but it looks horribly messy.</li>
            <li> just tame her hair a little.</li>
            <li> I took these labels off just out of curiosity, and noticed some very odd thing.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair stinks, especially when it is wet.</li>
            <li> My hair had never been so frizzy, dry, and unhealthy in my life.</li>
            <li> coasters\\&quot; and very little waviness or frizziness.  </li>
            <li> No more chemical process for me.  </li>
            <li> but no more than that</li>
            <li> My hair feels dry, nothing like it did when I had it done in the salon, which leads me to believe the product is either bad or really not the GK formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping I get at least three months.</li>
            <li> (1) the writing on the bottle is really, really small! -Invest</li>
            <li> I must say I was a little skeptical on buying this product because of the price and reveiws.</li>
            <li> 2years ago I tried a keratin at a salon and my hair felt so disgusting, straight and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Even after flat ironing it, it felt horrible.</li>
            <li> the product worked well unfortunately there was a horrible smell when hair is wet.</li>
            <li> When wet the hair gives off i an awful smell.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s expensive, time consuming and supposed to be dangerous for your health.</li>
            <li> Very expensive</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Plus my hair smells horrible.</li>

            <li> looooooooooooove it recommended</li>
            <li> Is this the sam as the resistant treatment?</li>
            <li> I am new to the keratin world.  I am bi-racial with curly kinky hair.  For years I have had a 2 step curl process on my hair and loved it.  Lately however, my hair started breaking and was very dry.  It was like needles coming off a Xmas tree.  I have never had breakage issues and I can&#x27;t figure out what happened.  I used GK The Best hoping to smooth out the frizzy damaged areas and to relax the curl at the roots and it worked incredibly.  I have now used it 3 times (every 4 weeks).  No more chemical process for me.  My natural hair is beautiful and soft and shiny.  I started out on the first time leaving it on for  25 minutes (including application time of 15 minutes and rinsing thoroughly, but on this last time I left is on for 50 minutes (max is 60 which I will try next time) and rinsed lightly leaving some of the product in before flat ironing (check out the website for detailed instructions for hair type and desired result).  My hair was never that straight with a chemical relaxer.  I can wash and go with curly/wavy hair or blow dry and iron for straight hair.  I love this so much that I have branched out to the conditioner (a must!), shampoo and serum.  I just ordered the styling products both for curly and straight styles.  This is a protein product so don&#x27;t forget to deep condition (I use Kerastase masquintense and the GK deep conditioner)  and use the serum daily.  I add an extra shot of argan oil that I mix with the serum.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping .. The product is great , the price is excellent and you r the best seller ever ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Love this!!! One of the best taming systems out there because I still have the option to wear my hair curly when I want which is usually during the summer time. Either straight or curly my hair is tame with no frizz!! Simply Amazing!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product , It is the brand my stylist used. It is easy to use . And unlike other vendor, I actually receive the one called best. (Because before another vendor use a bottle of other and just put a decal on it, an it was open!)  My hair is fine, and porous so every few months i do this treatment so I could easy handle my hair, without taking a lot of time.</li>
            <li> Love these products, they are necessary if you keep keratin treatment in your hair. Love the prices on Amazon</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I did on my daughters hair and it is so pretty. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was how her hair felt after doing it. It had it stay in for several days but her hair so so stuff. Other than that, good</li>
            <li> I recently had this process done. My hair looks good, tame and smooth, but after the first wash I noticed a noxious odor when my hair was wet. This happened again at a salon where I was having my hair blow dryed. When wet the hair gives off i an awful smell. I contacted the company.  They told me to go back to the salon and have a deep conditioning process to correct this problem . They  said that this happens in some people but they don&#x27;t know why!!  What an attitude. They should have warned of this beforehand.  $300 to smell like a dead animal. The salon now tells me that this should dissipate in 2 to 3 weeks and that they were misled by the company themselves.</li>
            <li> In love with this product, left my hair shiny and smooth!!!</li>
            <li> I have normal hair, not curly, not straight but waivy. The product probably doesn&#x27;t make that much of a difference. I notice the improvement much more when I do the keratin, but I wanted to try this less aggressive one. I applied it professionally and don&#x27;t see such a big improvement, although it does look less frizzy and nicer. I guess if you have to pay at a salon think about it, for 150 it is worth it after all  but no more than that or you will be wasting your money</li>
            <li> The product is very good. I had look for further instructions at utube so that I could achieve best results, but the product is overall very good and I love how soft and maneageble my hair is right now. Not to mention that I do not have to pay almost two hundred dollars for a simple treatment like this.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I am super satisfied. Easy instructions to follow and work perfectly. I really recommend it and I am planning to continue using it.</li>
            <li> (Writing this under brothers account) Best thing I&#x27;ve put on my hair since I was a kid! Ever since I was about 6 my mom would buy the store bought relaxers and relax my hair. When I went into high school my hair was so damaged and I kept dying it and straightening it every day! 2years ago I tried a keratin at a salon and my hair felt so disgusting, straight and lifeless. I started natural hair journey after that incident and as I&#x27;m transitioning my hair was so umanagable, curly, frizzy, prone to breakage... U name it! But I still kept trying to make it healthy so I saw a video (carlibel55) all about this new treatment and was pretty convinced.. So I bought it, DID IT AT HOME.. With the help of my parents of course.. And it turned out sooooo beautiful, shiny and it actually flows when I walk or when the wind brushes through it.. I&#x27;m in love.. Thank you GK :)</li>
            <li> I, too was a head model for a GK class in St. Louis, MO.  My hair, before the process, would best be described as \\&quot;psycho\\&quot; hair.  It&#x27;s shoulder length, and fine, but I have a decent amount of it.  It&#x27;s very frizzy-especially in our humid summers, and like cotton candy with deep \\&quot;roller coasters\\&quot; in a few areas!  It&#x27;s been about 2 1/2 months since the process and I was given sample sizes of the products to use until the salon was able to obtain the GK products to sell.  The products have not been available in my salon yet, even though my stylist was promised their availability from the beginning.  This is how I happened to find them on Amazon.  I have been very pleased with the results so far.  I haven&#x27;t had the \\&quot;roller coasters\\&quot; and very little waviness or frizziness.  The ONLY strange issue is that in the front third of my hair, the ends became frazzled or fried looking.  My stylist is still working on getting rid of these after 2 1/2 months!  I still think it&#x27;s worth continuing the treatments in the future, but I&#x27;d like to know why my ends were so affected.  If the treatment doesn&#x27;t last close to five months, then I think the salons should charge a lot less or many of their clients won&#x27;t continue using this product.  I was told that the more treatments you have, the longer it lasts, so time will tell!</li>
            <li> Worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;It is excellent. Leaved my hair softer and brilliant because it was really damage before.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipment too</li>
            <li> This product seems different than what I have had before.  The results were not the silky sheen and feel that I have experienced previously.</li>
            <li> I recently had the BEST Keratin treatment on Monday, May 11, 2015, for some reason, my blonde highlighted hair turned orange after using the product.  The stylist used the GK serum afterward which had an orange color that may have tinted my hair afterward.  I was in the sun shortly after my treatment. I am very disappointed.  I have been using GK hair products for years &amp; do not understand how this could have happened. The hair stylist had no idea how this could have happened either &amp; is Denying her responsibility for this mishap with the product. Also, my hair stinks, especially when it is wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to say this right now what happened to me when I used this product could have been a result of the salon I went to. I am completely and utterly unsatisfied with this product. When I got it done in the salon it was beautiful and silky and healthy but when I washed it again it was a mess it was so completely frizzy it looked like I had an Afro. My hair had never been so frizzy, dry, and unhealthy in my life. After a couple weeks of deep conditioning I got it to a manageable level, I personally would not recommend this product if you do want to get it be cautious about who does it make sure you know the salon (I went to a new one I had never been to before). I am although going to try a different treatment soon a keratin straightener to fix the damage caused by this product plus I want straight hair since this product ruined my ringlet curls.</li>
            <li> It was delivered one day early. It was exactly as described. I already used it and I LOVE it!! Best thing to use for months of softness!!</li>
            <li> I have used other keratin treatments in the past and have had great results. I thought I would give this a try since it was a simple application and I could wash my hair immediately. This did nothing for my hair. I am very disappointed in this product. I have wavy fine hair that shouldn&#x27;t need a whole lot of &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; to get it straight. I will be going back to the brand I previously was using...</li>
            <li> This product performed beyond my expectations. Hair came out beautifully. Client has text me on 3 different occassions telling me how much she loves her hair and thanking me for introducing her to this product.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  I have very curly hair and the minute I walk out the salon my hair is moving back to its curly state.  I maintained smooth and straight hair for days, plus through a workout, which is impossible in my world.  I was also concerned about losing my curls because I do love them.  This product maintained the curls without all the frizz.  I love this product for when I&#x27;m straight and when I&#x27;m curly.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes my frizzy hair so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> the product worked well unfortunately there was a horrible smell when hair is wet. lasts for weeks. Tried deep conditioning and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It only lasted 2 days. My hair tends to be more frizzy.  Horrible.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I have had the GK treatment done in a salon and my hair was very soft for a few months. I printed the directions from the GK web site and followed them exactly. When it was time to blow dry my hair after rinsing the product out, I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through my hair let alone a brush when blow drying. When I finally dried my hair, which took so long it felt like straw!! Even after flat ironing it, it felt horrible. I waited a long 24 hours and washed it out. My hair feels dry, nothing like it did when I had it done in the salon, which leads me to believe the product is either bad or really not the GK formula. Plus my hair smells horrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I am going to contact Amazon to find out if I can send the product back for a refund. What a rip off!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as promised by Global Keratin, Both clients I used it on wanted redo with the resistant formula</li>
            <li> my hair now better than before..you will see the defference like the curly its not gone completely but less than before......</li>
            <li> I must say I was a little skeptical on buying this product because of the price and reveiws. I&#x27;m glad I did though. I bought the best juvenix treatment. I did it myself. It took a long time. 4 hours but it was well worth it! For anyone who is skeptical about this product it works great you just have to make sure to follow the directions and buy the shampoo and conditioner with it as well. It&#x27;s only been two weeks since I&#x27;ve done my hair so I don&#x27;t know how long it will really last but so far I love the results! It says you can wash your hair immediately after process is done. I waited 48 hrs just to play it safe. It felt a little heavy and stiff for the first 48 hrs but after I washed it it&#x27;s amazingly softer, smoother, straighter and frizz free and shiney! My hair dries really fast after washing it and it looks so much healthier. It&#x27;s worth the money! I had thick kinky hair long hair. I still have over half a bottle left of this stuff. I can&#x27;t wait to see how long this stuff last in my hair. I&#x27;m hoping I get at least three months. I will update later.</li>
            <li> I ordered some gk hair products 2 weeks ago: shampoo, conditioner and this treatment. When I received my order, I noticed that all 3 of my products have labels stuck over the bottles. I took these labels off just out of curiosity, and noticed some very odd thing. The bottle with a moisturizing shampoo was marked as balancing conditioner, under the label of the best treatment and moisturizing condutioner there was a balancing shampoo. I thought I received mislabeled items and I wanted to return the products back. I contacted the manufacturer to find out what&#x27;s the deal, and they told me that they had to re-label some of their products because the company is no longer called Global Keratin - it&#x27;s now called Gk hair.&lt;br /&gt;Although I don&#x27;t think it was a good idea to reuse the old packaging, the product itself is great! I am glad I did not return it, because Gkhair The best treatment really is the best! I have never seen my hair looking so great and I have never recieved so many compliments! It really does what is claims to do. Eliminates frizz, makes your hair soft, shiny, manageable and hassle-free. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be a model for this product at my local salon(on 3.17.13)...so it was free for me to have this treatment on my hair.  I have had very curly, dry, frizzy hair for my entire life...35 years plus.  I absolutely, positively LOVE this system.  My hair has been friz free for about 3 weeks now.  I hope it lasts for as long as they say it will.  I  guess I will let you know later.  Also, the hair serum is great...smells wonderful!!!  I wish I could attach a picture of my hair so you could see it...it&#x27;s so pretty and soft!!  Great product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to update this post(6.14.13)...the smoothing system only worked for about 7-8 weeks or so. I waited 2 days before washing my hair out the first time and I used the correct shampoo and conditioner after the treatment was finished...so I think I did my part to help keep my hair smooth. I liked the initial feel and anti frizzing look...but it did not last 5 months... My hair stylist said 2 weeks ago (May 31, 2013) that she could still \\&quot;feel the product in my hair\\&quot;... but it really doesn&#x27;t look or feel like it to me at all.  I would not pay very much for this system if I were you....I rated this product as a 3 because it did not last as long as they mentioned.  Even though I did not pay for this treatment...I believe it is very pricey, depending on where you have it done...between $200.00-$400.00...definitely NOT worth that!...perhaps $85.00 or $100.00.  I would like to hear how long it lasted for others...so please chime in if you used this product.</li>
            <li> Very expensive and It did not work on my wife. This product just works for normal and little curly hair. My wife has a very curly (coarse) hair and this product just tame her hair a little. After two week her hair came back to normal form (coarse). So, it is not a permanent straigthener for coarse hair. I highly recommend Quantum Thermal Straightener</li>
            <li> Great Product! It does help greatly with damaged hair and my hair never breaks with color when I use GK. I love the shine.  It will not last for 5 months... That is okay with me. It will last 2.5 to 3, though. It depends on multiple factors If you use the wrong shampoo, it will not last. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair with a beautiful shine.&lt;br /&gt;If your have split ends, this product fix it really nice.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is over-priced at all.&lt;br /&gt;Me: I&#x27;m multi-racial.  My hair is thick (Polynesian, Asian, Portuguese &amp; Italian descent); long (mid-back) and has a mind of its own (wavy, curly, frizzy &amp; dry). My hair \\&quot;drinks\\&quot; conditioner like a camel in the desert. I can straighten it- but it doesn&#x27;t stay that way for long. With product, I can let it air dry- but it looks horribly messy. With humidity- I end up \\&quot;bunning\\&quot; it- which pulls on the strands, causing breakage.  Getting my hair professionally straightened, or relaxed, costs well over $250 each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have a round brush to dry my hair with; my straightener has ceramic plates (not titanium); and I didn&#x27;t order the $20 bottle of GK ph+ clarifying shampoo (-I used a $4 bottle of Neutrogena Anti-Residue shampoo).  Because I didn&#x27;t use the exact items, I&#x27;m sure my application won&#x27;t last 5 months- and that&#x27;s ok! I don&#x27;t mind doing the process again because it was hella simple! I was pretty surprised at how soft my hair felt, afterward. My daughter couldn&#x27;t stop running her fingers through it. Last time I did this in a salon- my hair ended up stick-straight, w/no life. I couldn&#x27;t add a wave, add volume- nothing! It also fried my hair &amp; the strands broke off (she burned my scalp &amp; I could smell my hair, burning). Nice thing about this \\&quot;GK the Best Hair Taming System&#x27; is \\&quot;I\\&quot; had complete control over the process; \\&quot;I\\&quot; decided how long to leave it on (25 min); \\&quot;I\\&quot; decided how I wanted to straighten it; and \\&quot;I\\&quot; can do it again, on my own time and when I need to (3 or 4 applications in the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;*4 Salon applications&#x3D; $1000 ($250+/each) VS. 4 home treatments&#x3D;$108 (one time cost). This Amazon price tag was worth it! This is a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI- (1) the writing on the bottle is really, really small! -Invest in a magnifying glass, or find the directions on line- it&#x27;s important you follow the right directions for the type of treatment; (2) it doesn&#x27;t come with an application brush; (3) - or, gloves.  I expected it to &amp; for as much as the bottle cost, it would&#x27;ve been nice.gloves.  I expected it to &amp; for as much as the bottle cost, it would&#x27;ve been nice.</li>
            <li> This works wonders on destroyed or damaged hair, makes your hair feel soft and new again. Wish the price tag wasnt so high though. Way overpriced.</li>
            <li> AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;Totally Recommended</li>
            <li> This is a nice product if you have your expectations correct. It will defiantly help with fizziness and drying. It does not make hair perfectly straight. It&#x27;s nice that you can wash it right away. It&#x27;s important that the client knows what there getting.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the results, the product promises it would last up to 5 months and the next time I wash my hair it was gone.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I recommend it. It&#x27;s easy to use, unlike the expensive Brazilian treatment where you have to stay with the product on your hair for 3 days and all the restrictions that go with it. Plus it&#x27;s expensive, time consuming and supposed to be dangerous for your health. I have the same results with this product and I have used the Brazilian treatment before. This product weighs your hair down, it doesn&#x27;t frizz, it gives it a lot of shine and life. My hair is silky  now and shinier.</li>
            <li> great product! easy to apply and my hair stays without frizz for about 4 months</li>
            <li> Really the best literally.. my hair is new. The humidity is no t my enemy more.</li>
