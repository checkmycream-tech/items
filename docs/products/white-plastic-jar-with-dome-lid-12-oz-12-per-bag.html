            <li> Its small enough to fit in the zipper part of a purse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, it looks like if this was a single wall container, it would hold twice the lotion/cream that I want to put into it for when I travel by airplane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Solid product...just know that if you are looking for maximum use of space, find a single wall jar.</li>
            <li> They arrived sooner than expected and the packing material protected them from damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered other sizes from this company and will order from them again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems like 50% of the height of the container is dead air space under the &amp;#34;bottom&amp;#34; of the interior of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
