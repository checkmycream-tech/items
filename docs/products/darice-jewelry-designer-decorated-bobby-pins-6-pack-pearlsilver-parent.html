    <ol>
            <li>Awesome for weddings and every day..</li>
            <li>I used them for my wedding and they held up perfect and looked beautiful in my hair!</li>
            <li>Great price and value!</li>
            <li>This was a perfect gift along with a beautiful scarf I bought to go with the bobby pins.  </li>
            <li>I bought 6 of these to give to my bridesmaids and flower girl to wear in my wedding and they looked gorgeous!</li>
            <li>These are beautiful and sturdy</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re beautiful, but there are no rubber or plastic tips on the ends, so they scratch my head, and hurt.  </li>
            <li>Great accents for hair.</li>
            <li>Great for wedding season.</li>
            <li>Great product..</li>
            <li>They are probably great for one-time occasions like a wedding, but they don&#x27;t stand up over time.</li>
            <li>Great choiceðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>These are very nice looking and seemingly well made hair pins.  </li>
            <li>Very nice pins.</li>
            <li>I like that they&#x27;re varied, but it&#x27;s also a problem that the metal is bright silver.  </li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>They hold my hair nicely and look great</li>
            <li>Beautiful and lovely addition to wardrobe.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Arrived quickly after ordering and in perfect shape.  </li>
            <li>I love anything pearl!</li>
            <li>These are cheap, metal bobby pins that snag and tear at the hair (especially fine hair or children&#x27;s hair) when putting in or taking out.  </li>
            <li>Plastic or rubber covers would be nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice variety, sturdy and stay in place.</li>
            <li>They work nicely and added some detail to my hair.</li>
            <li>Great for special events or nightly outings.</li>
            <li>Love the pins they stay nicely in your hair and match everything</li>
            <li>Thought there might be more of them as well.</li>
            <li>The pearls are secured well to the pins, which is more than can be said for many decorative hair pins.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>love.</li>
            <li>Cute.  </li>
            <li>I love them and wear them all the time.  </li>
            <li>They are lovely, but I am searching another company that makes them using better quality bobby pins.</li>
            <li>I love the pop of prettiness these bobby pins add to my hair; and the variety.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased others and love the designs of them all.</li>
            <li>Just wish they came in all one or two designs at the most.</li>
            <li>Pretty and the quality is good, too.</li>
            <li>Well made, many compliments, pearls always look good, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The beads fall of really easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got these just for fun and not for an important occasion.</li>
            <li>If you have anything other than very fair hair, the metal sticks out like a sore thumb.  </li>
            <li>But since they&#x27;re so cheap, it&#x27;s still worth buying 2 sets.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty</li>
            <li>but they are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty &amp; they work well in hair too.</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>Super cute and looks nice against my dark hair.</li>
            <li>Pretty, useful.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much, I bought a set for me, lost one, bought a 3rd set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, i do recommend this to all ladies that want beautiful hair pins that last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Very classy!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautiful, I just have to be extra careful when I am taking them out my hair.</li>
            <li>Pearls fell out the first use.</li>
            <li>These bobby pins are pretty and hold my hair well</li>
            <li>These really dress up any style!</li>
            <li>These look so pretty in my hair</li>
            <li>First use and the pearls came off</li>
            <li>The pearls themselves are pretty and</li>
            <li>These bobby pins are really pretty but not flexible at all.  </li>
            <li>Originally bought these for my 20 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I have to wear my hair up for work and these add a nice little touch.</li>
            <li>Looks cute and adorable, just wish the pins were a little bigger in size</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>they seem very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li>Them very.</li>
            <li>much.</li>
            <li>Very durable Bobby pins for your hair</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting the best quality in what I assumed to be regular bobby pins with some fake pearls glued on, but I wanted them for a whole pearl-jewelry look.</li>
            <li>because I&#x27;m sure this same set would have been much cheaper at a local store</li>
            <li>I purchased these pearl hair pins for my wedding and was amazed to get so many pins for such a low price!</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll be able to use them multiple times, my only qualm is that the prongs can be a bit tricky to separate!</li>
            <li>When I found these, i was very excited, but when I received them, they were not the same quality as the ones I had prior.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend these to all.</li>
            <li>Very classy and fancy.</li>
            <li>They are cute pins for a good price, but they&#x27;re a little cheesy looking.</li>
            <li>When they arrived, I was surprised to find that they were not flimsy at all.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the pearls falling off or loosening even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a little bit, either -- a lot.  </li>
            <li>I order these pins approximately 2 times a year, they are a tight fitting pin for fine or straight hair, the plastic pearls will fall out with multiple use</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and the little pearls were all intact.</li>
            <li>These are pretty and I use them often, however, the ends are sharp and they pull my hair.  </li>
            <li>Very cute and delicate little bobby pins, I wear them a lot.</li>
            <li>Pretty but not worth it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very cute and delicate little bobby pins, I wear them a lot.</li>
            <li> Pretty but not worth it</li>
            <li> I tried using them to hold up my bangs and simply sticking them straight into a bun, but both had the same uncomfortable result when I went to remove the pins.  </li>
            <li> pretty, but too thick and stiff for my hair.</li>
            <li> These broke after very limited use.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made to say the least!!!</li>
            <li> These do wonders for slipping banger-backs.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I would buy these again and wish they came in other colors.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that sometimes when I&#x27;m removing them a strand or two of hair will slide under the pearls and get stuck and no matter how careful I was, it pulled out the strands of hair.</li>
            <li> They are really hard to open and does not glide into the hair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll have at least 3 of the same design.</li>
            <li> None of them have broken so far.</li>
            <li> A little hard to open clip when putting in my hair.  </li>
            <li> They seem sturdy and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with them scratching my scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought a set just like this a few years ago, though I didn&#x27;t look to see the brand.  </li>
            <li> They gave me a little bit of pizazz for hair for my park wedding!</li>
            <li> but I was too lazy to save a buck or two.</li>
            <li> These were a bit tight but I have thin hair and it worked.</li>
            <li> This pins are very hard to put on.</li>
            <li> The bobbie pins arrived with the pearls broken off...</li>
            <li> Poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to write bad reviews, but these are so poorly designed that I felt a need to.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very difficult to find gifts for her.  </li>

            <li> Super cute and looks nice against my dark hair. I love anything pearl!</li>
            <li> These are beautiful and sturdy</li>
            <li> A pearl fell off as I was pulling it out of the bag. Thought there might be more of them as well.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box one of the packages the pearls had already fallen off.  Didn&#x27;t even get to open the package.  They are very pretty</li>
            <li> I purchased these pearl hair pins for my wedding and was amazed to get so many pins for such a low price! Nice variety, sturdy and stay in place. The pearls are secured well to the pins, which is more than can be said for many decorative hair pins.</li>
            <li> This pins are very hard to put on. Just to open them to put them on is a struggle. Pretty but not worth it</li>
            <li> These really dress up any style! I have to wear my hair up for work and these add a nice little touch.</li>

            <li> I bought 6 of these to give to my bridesmaids and flower girl to wear in my wedding and they looked gorgeous!</li>
            <li> These look so pretty in my hair and I&#x27;ve used them around 7-8 times and even a time or two have fallen asleep before taking them out. So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the pearls falling off or loosening even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that sometimes when I&#x27;m removing them a strand or two of hair will slide under the pearls and get stuck and no matter how careful I was, it pulled out the strands of hair. Despite that, I would buy them again. They seem sturdy and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with them scratching my scalp. I would buy these again and wish they came in other colors.</li>
            <li> I order these pins approximately 2 times a year, they are a tight fitting pin for fine or straight hair, the plastic pearls will fall out with multiple use but you can glue them back in the cradle. These do wonders for slipping banger-backs.</li>
            <li> Awesome for weddings and every day..</li>
            <li> Thank you for the prompt delivery of my bobby pins.  I received them today. they seem very sturdy and well made.  I havcen&#x27;t used them yet but they are very pretty.</li>
            <li> The bobbie pins arrived with the pearls broken off...would not order again.  Poor packaging.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and the little pearls were all intact. Given as a gift, so can&#x27;t comment on anything else.</li>
            <li> Love the pins they stay nicely in your hair and match everything</li>
            <li> Very classy and fancy. Looks cute and adorable, just wish the pins were a little bigger in size but like it overall.</li>
            <li> Great accents for hair. These look just like the picture as well. Great for special events or nightly outings.</li>
            <li> Love. love. love. Them very. much. good. for our hair. Got some. o. now smiling</li>

            <li> Cute.  A little hard to open clip when putting in my hair.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very pretty &amp; they work well in hair too.</li>
            <li> I bought a set just like this a few years ago, though I didn&#x27;t look to see the brand.  I love them and wear them all the time.  When I found these, i was very excited, but when I received them, they were not the same quality as the ones I had prior.  These are cheap, metal bobby pins that snag and tear at the hair (especially fine hair or children&#x27;s hair) when putting in or taking out.  I don&#x27;t recommend them.  They are lovely, but I am searching another company that makes them using better quality bobby pins.</li>
            <li> They are cute pins for a good price, but they&#x27;re a little cheesy looking. The threads connecting the beads show.</li>
            <li> Received them and they had all fallen apart!!! Cheaply made to say the least!!! Will not buy again!!!</li>
            <li> My grandmother is in a nursing home and it&#x27;s very difficult to find gifts for her.  This was a perfect gift along with a beautiful scarf I bought to go with the bobby pins.  -1 star because I&#x27;m sure this same set would have been much cheaper at a local store but I was too lazy to save a buck or two.</li>
            <li> Very pretty but I wish the last two also matched. Great for wedding season.</li>
            <li> First use and the pearls came off</li>
            <li> Pretty and the quality is good, too.</li>
            <li> Great product.. I used them for my wedding and they held up perfect and looked beautiful in my hair! Great price and value!</li>
            <li> These are very nice looking and seemingly well made hair pins.  I bought them to help hold my veil in place for my wedding day.  They work nicely and added some detail to my hair.</li>
            <li> These broke after very limited use. They are probably great for one-time occasions like a wedding, but they don&#x27;t stand up over time.</li>
            <li> I love the pop of prettiness these bobby pins add to my hair; and the variety. I&#x27;ve purchased others and love the designs of them all.</li>
            <li> Pretty, useful. Just need to keep track of them all the time. I like the pearls. None of them have broken so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to write bad reviews, but these are so poorly designed that I felt a need to.  These bobby pins don&#x27;t have the rubber/round stops at the end, which means that when you try to take them out, they will pinch and rip at your hair.  Not a little bit, either -- a lot.  I tried using them to hold up my bangs and simply sticking them straight into a bun, but both had the same uncomfortable result when I went to remove the pins.  The pearls themselves are pretty and I like that they&#x27;re varied, but it&#x27;s also a problem that the metal is bright silver.  If you have anything other than very fair hair, the metal sticks out like a sore thumb.  I&#x27;m glad I got these just for fun and not for an important occasion.</li>
            <li> They hold my hair nicely and look great</li>
            <li> These bobby pins are really pretty but not flexible at all.  They are really hard to open and does not glide into the hair.</li>
            <li> Very durable Bobby pins for your hair, i do recommend this to all ladies that want beautiful hair pins that last a very long time. I bought my hair pins 1year ago an i still have them now. Great choiceðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Very nice pins. Haven&#x27;t used the yet but look like they&#x27;ll do the trick. Just wish they came in all one or two designs at the most. I&#x27;ll have to order a second set so I&#x27;ll have at least 3 of the same design. But since they&#x27;re so cheap, it&#x27;s still worth buying 2 sets.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re beautiful, but there are no rubber or plastic tips on the ends, so they scratch my head, and hurt.  I won&#x27;t use them.</li>
