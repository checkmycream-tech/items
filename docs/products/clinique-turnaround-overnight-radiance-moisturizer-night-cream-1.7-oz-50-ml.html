            <li>Love the product &amp; it works</li>
            <li>Another favorite without the parabens and scents.</li>
            <li>My skin looks soft and feels great after using this..</li>
            <li>The cream is light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I really do see changes!!!  </li>
            <li>Most importantly there was nothing written with the ingredients on it to show me exactly what I was getting.</li>
            <li>The picture is of a full sized product.</li>
            <li>This advertises the full 1.7 oz / 50 ml size product, which sells from Clinique for $46.50 which is just over 90 cent a ml.</li>
            <li>I was really looking for intense  Moisturizer  for dry skin.. still looking for the best  Moisturizer...</li>
            <li>This product is excellent for African American skin.</li>
            <li>Was shipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and refreshing; and does not cause my very dry, very sensitive skin to break out.</li>
            <li>It has given me soft, youthful and smooth textured skin.</li>
            <li>Used daily, you will see smoother, brighter skin for sure.</li>
            <li>I knew I should have just gone the the Clinique counter in the first place.</li>
            <li>Moisturizer is very light, no noticeable fragrance, packaging is really small..works ok, not the greatest, not the worst..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to those who want to enhance their face!</li>
            <li>but product was new</li>
            <li>BTW you can purchase this at Macy&#x27;s department store for $46.50, if you happen to live near a Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the seller  who said they would correct the ad ( but clearly hasn&#x27;t yet) and will attempt to return for a refund because this clearly isn&#x27;t the bargain they are advertising.</li>
            <li>It also helps with adult acne.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer makes my skin really soft and helps a lot with dryness.</li>
            <li>Kind of weird</li>

            <li> Package arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is strictly due to the use of this product, but I cut down to using it only every other night and use an exfoliator in between.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this for years. It has given me soft, youthful and smooth textured skin. I love it and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Greaseless after shaving</li>
            <li> good price for a great product, got some points in with the madam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three years prior to this purchase.  I know the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47, and I have used this product twice a day for at least 10-12 years! I cannot put on foundation without this cream, and I always treat my skin at night with a second application. All the patchy spots from sun damage and from taking oral contraceptives are a thing of the past. It also helps with adult acne. You will love the way your skin feels!</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail today. Was shipped pretty quickly. Then I noticed there was not a box with the product and no instructions on how to use it. Most importantly there was nothing written with the ingredients on it to show me exactly what I was getting. And the shocker was, on the bottom of the jar it said: Not for sale. What does this mean...and I wonder.</li>
            <li> BTW you can purchase this at Macy&#x27;s department store for $46.50, if you happen to live near a Macy&#x27;s.  Used daily, you will see smoother, brighter skin for sure.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for African American skin. I can tell the difference in one night. My skin glows in the morning! Literally. It evens out skin discoloration caused by pigmentation in darker skinned women. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> excellent I am very satisfied God bless you</li>
            <li> I am having some trouble with blemishes.  I don&#x27;t think it is strictly due to the use of this product, but I cut down to using it only every other night and use an exfoliator in between.</li>
            <li> I use turnaround during the day and thought that I would try the night cream.  The cream is light and non-greasy.  The agent delivered it as promised and in good condition.  His rating would be 100%.</li>
            <li> Great product .moisturizer does work .Thank You .Would tell all my family and friends to purchase and use every night</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, even for people with combination or oily skin.  My skin looks soft and feels great after using this..even my boyfriend is hooked.</li>
            <li> I was misled. The picture is of a full sized product. What I received is a sample! I paid 15 bucks for a sample. Will never purchase here again. Rip off.</li>
            <li> Love the product &amp; it works but the jar came without the box.  Kind of weird but product was new so I used just would have liked the package for information.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer is very light, no noticeable fragrance, packaging is really small..works ok, not the greatest, not the worst..I have told my family members to try it. I was really looking for intense  Moisturizer  for dry skin.. still looking for the best  Moisturizer...</li>
            <li> Another favorite without the parabens and scents.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Package arrived as expected.  The box was a little squashed from the mailing but the product was just what I was looking for.  Price was good as well.</li>

            <li> This moisturizer makes my skin really soft and helps a lot with dryness.</li>
            <li> This advertises the full 1.7 oz / 50 ml size product, which sells from Clinique for $46.50 which is just over 90 cent a ml. I received the SAMPLE .5 oz size and at this price is just under $1.50 a ml! I contacted the seller  who said they would correct the ad ( but clearly hasn&#x27;t yet) and will attempt to return for a refund because this clearly isn&#x27;t the bargain they are advertising. I knew I should have just gone the the Clinique counter in the first place.</li>
