            <li>It was the exact case I ordered to hold my lipsticks no difference at all but cost me more than lipstick case ..</li>

            <li> It is so small that only lipstick as fit in.</li>
            <li> Very small the only lipsticks that fit are the very thin ones.</li>
            <li> Should have listened to other people reviews,</li>
            <li> You could use this for a million other things in the office kitchen or vanity as well.</li>
            <li> I received my item way faster than expected!</li>
            <li> Will only hold thin lipsticks and definitely will not hold your nail polish unless you are related to Darby O&#x27;Gill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unit was also broken when I received</li>
            <li> Thumbs down!</li>
            <li> Nail polish will not fit</li>
            <li> I put a few mascaras, eyeliners and lipsticks in it.....</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I saw it was broken, not a big deal</li>
            <li> the holes are to small for it.</li>
            <li> And also when I opened the package a piece of it was broken off which was extremely frustrating because I had to wait so long for it.</li>
            <li> hated it was nothing compared to what its described as.</li>
            <li> very disappointed but will find another use for it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for lipstick. Nail polish will not fit but I bought it for lipstick so it worked out great! I recently ordered two more. Took over two weeks to get but other than that it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> hated it was nothing compared to what its described as. Should have listened to other people reviews, Cant fit nail polish in it only like chap sticks and other things. I would not buy.</li>
            <li> Very small the only lipsticks that fit are the very thin ones.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Very well packeged with bubble wrap and styrofoam! No chips/breakage it came in full with no scratches! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for nail polish but definitely would for MAC sized lipsticks or lipgloss!</li>
            <li> This is the exact product I was wanting to hold all of my lipsticks. It is a good price but it took forever for me to receive it. About six weeks. And also when I opened the package a piece of it was broken off which was extremely frustrating because I had to wait so long for it. I just super glued it back on because I don&#x27;t feel like waisting my time to send it back and wait another six weeks for a new one. Other than that I would buy this product again when I get more lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I bought about 4 of these and I loooove my new makeup set up with all of my lipsticks displayed. You could use this for a million other things in the office kitchen or vanity as well.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I wanted to use it as a nail polish holder. But it cannot fit in any nail polish. It is so small that only lipstick as fit in. Also it looks so cheap, made by low quality plastic.&lt;br /&gt;If I can choose 0 star, I would give it zero instead of 1 star.</li>
            <li> I actually had to come back and order another one of theses because it worked so well and I didn&#x27;t realize how many lipsticks I had. I love them.</li>
            <li> Not big enough for nail polish! Thumbs down!</li>
            <li> Good for the vanity.  I hope it makes me organize better!</li>
            <li> Love my new organizer... I put a few mascaras, eyeliners and lipsticks in it..... Looks great but the one thing I would say is that it&#x27;s a bit pricey</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 and got 4 loved them</li>
            <li> Received without a scratch. Works great, well packaged. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.  You can use it for lipsticks, lip gloss, and all kinds of liners.</li>
            <li> I love it. I can&#x27;t complain my lipsticks fit. I don&#x27;t think this would work for nail polish the holes are to small for it.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!  The whole unit is only about 6&amp;#34;.  Will only hold thin lipsticks and definitely will not hold your nail polish unless you are related to Darby O&#x27;Gill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unit was also broken when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest you move on.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps my lipsticks In a designated spot. Need more of them. Very handy to just keep on my dresser</li>
            <li> Reason rating so low is reason I purchased this case was to hold my nail polish however not one fit. It was the exact case I ordered to hold my lipsticks no difference at all but cost me more than lipstick case .. case is sturdy but again if purchasing to hold polish Do NOT buy won&#x27;t hold polish  bottles unless the size of a lipstick case</li>
            <li> great for displaying my lip balm for sale</li>
            <li> Loved it! Looks beautiful and its so affordable! Fits all my lip sticks perfectly. If youre looking for a good quality lipstick stand you found it!</li>
            <li> Love it! Took a bit too long to get here but is definitely useful! Great place for my collection of lipsticks!!</li>
            <li> awesome!! Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Arrived way before it should of. Fits all of my lipsticks perfectly I ordered 3 of them! I might Oder more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for lipstick but TOO small to hold nail polish. I actually needed it for nail polish and they don&#x27;t fit. When I opened the box I saw it was broken, not a big deal but I&#x27;m mad it was not in perfect conditions.</li>
            <li> I received my item way faster than expected! I absolutely love it! Keeps all my lipsticks and lipglosses organized for sure. Might get a second one if my collection keeps growing (which it probably will).</li>
            <li> I need to get a few more of these.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a nail polish organizer but none of my nail polish bottles fit in it.  Not even my stripers.  very disappointed but will find another use for it.</li>
            <li> Does not hold nail polishes at all. Only lipsticks, not as described at all.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive lipstick holder. Lipglosses don&#x27;t work well in it but lipsticks are good to go.</li>
