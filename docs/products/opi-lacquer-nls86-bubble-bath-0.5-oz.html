            <li>I was pleased when it arrived and was happy to have a neutral color for my hands when I wanted a break from colors .</li>
            <li>Very innocent color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too happy with it the texture, but the colour is okay</li>
            <li>The pigment is true to what you see in the bottle and the quality of the polish itself is very good.  </li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this polish!</li>

            <li>I just love this color!  </li>
            <li>Love OPI&#x27;s colors!</li>
            <li>I love this color!  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my favorite friend and now need one for myself!</li>
            <li>I love this color!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Then it started to chip off because I had so many coats on -- ugh!  </li>
            <li>love the color!</li>
            <li>Love how my nails looked!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but you need 4 coats and a top coat for it to get like the picture!</li>
            <li>Adds a lovely finish, I wanted my nails to looks like Giada DiLaurentis does on her cooking show!</li>
            <li>this is too light for my hands, but still a beautiful color for softness,</li>
            <li>My nails have a nice manicured look without a lot of color - which I love!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect shade if you want a slight hint of color and great shine for your nails!  </li>
            <li>Be prepared for plenty of complements on your clean, beautiful nails.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and a great, neutral shade.</li>
            <li>This nail polish has a nice shiny finish, however to get the look advertised in the image it takes about 5 coats.</li>
            <li>I honestly gave up after 3 coats and kept getting thicker lines of color.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and I thought it looked nice.  </li>
            <li>but since I was the one paying for the color, did my own thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks really nice when it goes on.</li>
            <li>Even my trendy teenagers like this one.</li>
            <li>It is just a nice color for me.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase at such a great price.</li>
            <li>Like able and made by Opi, a good product name.</li>
            <li>color is nice neutral..</li>
            <li>Nice color and prompt delivery</li>
            <li>I just got a bottle of this color from Amazon and can&#x27;t wait to try it out on my own.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my daughter and she liked it.</li>
            <li>Makes your nails look nicely groomed w/o looking overdone.  </li>
            <li>I thought that this color would be nice on me but just did not like it  on me.</li>
            <li>Otherwise nice color</li>
            <li>I have also seen it on darker skin tones and it&#x27;s just as nice.</li>
            <li>The color is true to the picture shown and looks beautifully nude on my caramel skin.</li>
            <li>This polish came fast and is perfect!!!</li>
            <li>Ok...let me just say that if you want your nails to look really nice with a buff color, this is it.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use two or three coats and it still has a nice color</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, beautiful color</li>
            <li>Very nice clean look.</li>
            <li>Very light but nice product</li>

            <li>This polish is really glossy and nice, beautiful for Spring.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t chip easy with a good top coat.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great for French manicures or just a simply beautiful clean look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use top coat if I don&#x27;t have to, and you can get away without applying with this nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Top coat too, a must.</li>
            <li>Makes me look a bit more polished.  </li>
            <li>Elegant and understated color, one of my favorites.</li>

            <li>Love OPI brand nail polish, you don&#x27;t have to re-polish as often.  </li>
            <li>The more coats you apply the more \\&quot;milky pink\\&quot; becomes.</li>
            <li>This is a great color when you don&#x27;t want much color....</li>
            <li>I would buy from this company again, just in a diff color. :)</li>

            <li>I love the consistency as well, of course it&#x27;s OPI.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>I am completly in love with this color</li>
            <li>It is perfect for spring/summer time over french manicure!  </li>
            <li>Love this color and this brand, but it takes 4 or more coats to be opaque.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this color when I purchased it</li>
            <li>but now I know why so many people like and purchase it.</li>

            <li>My favorite opi color</li>
            <li>Better prices and availability than in my salon.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I am going to upload a picture of my nails with Bubble Bath polish over them to give you a better idea as to how it looks on one&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>Love the simplicity and elegance of this color.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be much more opaque than it is....</li>
            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>My boyfriend agrees that this is the reason, he said it was a lot more noticeable on her (bless his heart for listening to my nail polish trials and tribulations).</li>
            <li>My search for my favorite &amp;#34;nude-ish&amp;#34; nail continues...</li>
            <li>I love OPI nail polish -</li>
            <li>For me, its just okay..</li>
            <li>yOU CAN DO TWO LAYERS FOR A MODERTE NEUTRAL LOOK AND 3 LAYERS FOR  MORE INTENSITY.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love opi polishes.</li>
            <li>Then lasts some more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Enjoy:)</li>
            <li>and I love it on her</li>
            <li>but O.P.I. seems to appeal to me more.  </li>
            <li>OPI is my favorite brand of polish.</li>
            <li>Buying nail polish online is always risky because you just can&#x27;t be sure of the color unless it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ve ordered before.  </li>
            <li>I love this polish.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite nail polish brands and colors.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a nice light color when i am in the mood for a nude polish.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love neutral tones and the opaque-ness of this</li>
            <li>Perfect for French manicure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not put more than 2 coats on....</li>
            <li>I would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>OPI is my favorite brand</li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>I love OPI nail polish.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this color.  </li>
            <li>but once I put it on I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>I use it as a top coat on occasion.</li>
            <li>It gives my nails a nice, clean look and the color goes with everything.</li>
            <li>Sweet and neutral, but nothing Spectacular.</li>

            <li>This is THE greatest everyday (and travel) shade!  </li>

            <li>I put black and brown leopard over it and its gorgeous!</li>
            <li>If you want a solid color of this then go with 3 coats but its really good with just one or two costs because it nude with peach-pink undertone to it.</li>
            <li>, color is more intense.  </li>

            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>If it does chip - all you need to do is fill in the area with a quick stroke of the polish.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for a polished elegant look.</li>
            <li>I have worn this colr for the last 9 years, It give a very clean sophisticated look.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Very pretty shade.  </li>
            <li>This polish is very pretty and I am hoping it suites me also</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>It not only looks great but it also lasts for several days and in many cases, two weeks without chipping.</li>
            <li>Very light and natural looking if that&#x27;s what your looking for!</li>
            <li>OPI makes great polish, they never let me down.</li>
            <li>This particular color is very subdued and a nice change from the brights.</li>
            <li>I love the new gel line with</li>
            <li>Everytime I fall in love with a new shade from OPI</li>
            <li>I am in love with my new \\&quot;Sugar Daddy\\&quot;..</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen it personally, but OPI is a pretty good brand.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color, may need 3 coats for this to pop or white paint first.</li>
            <li>Cute natural color for when you´re giving your nails a break from gels!</li>
            <li>You do have to put several coats (I used 5) of the polish on for it to give you the best coverage, but overall I thought it was pretty.</li>
            <li>Felt pretty!</li>
            <li>Great everyday polish.</li>
            <li>Great color for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>I love the soft color.</li>
            <li>Smile</li>
            <li>Love the soft hue..</li>
            <li>I have found that for the price, OPI isn&#x27;t really worth it.</li>
            <li>I wanted a sheer pink for manicure, and the Bubble Bath was perfect.</li>
            <li>Looks best when used with OPI Base and Top Coat. :)</li>
            <li>I do not know how many coats I have to apply for this polish to look as it looks on the picture, so far I have applied 3 coats and cannot achieve that creamy color.</li>
            <li>The OPI Bubble Bath shade gives you a great step above natural.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s no where near as cute as it was on her.</li>
            <li>It applys so nicely and evenly, that a second coat is not needed.</li>
            <li>I love soft colors on my nails.  </li>
            <li>But the great thing is that most of these shades are quite wearable, and what I found out was that if you use the darker shade as a base and use Bubble Bath on top, it lightens the whole thing quite nicely.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails look so polished and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I love the nail polish it stays chip free for ten days</li>
            <li>Love the clear opi but never buy this stuff again</li>
            <li>I wanted a pale shade that wouldn&#x27;t draw attention and this is great.  </li>
            <li>But, I don&#x27;t mind with this polish because it dries pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I really like OPI products, but in this particular color, I like much better</li>
            <li>other good nail polish&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Needs two coats to get it just right</li>
            <li>Great summer shade which lasts a long time with clear topcoat.</li>
            <li>My fiancé says it is not the same coverage thickness and chips very easily.</li>
            <li>Offers a clean neutral yet polished look (even on my tan Indian hands!).</li>
            <li>It is more on the tan side, not pink.</li>
            <li>My nails are not long and gorgeous like some I have seen so this natural color suits me for a finished look.</li>
            <li>It arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>I went back and forth about buying this for a while and am happy I finally did.  </li>
            <li>This color has al ittle more color than just a clear finish, but not too much that its matte.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to deal with high maintenance polish but love a classy manicured look this color is for you!</li>
            <li>With a very light coat it looks almost like you had a french manicure.  </li>
            <li>A great soft neutral pink!</li>
            <li>The color is true to the picture just a very light baby pink</li>
            <li>It is a very light pink and for summer and when one wants to use something light.</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty color.</li>
            <li>I have to put about 2 coats on, but it makes your nails look really pretty.</li>
            <li>The polish is so pretty just by looking at it through the bottle.</li>
            <li>Love this polish, its the same polish that the nail shop use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This IS a pretty color, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending the money.</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>But truthfully I just don&#x27;t see what the big deal is!</li>
            <li>It last long holds up great.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Maybe with french tips it&#x27;ll look better</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a pretty nail polish, though.</li>
            <li>I purchased the product based on the picture and the color is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty nude/pink color and OPI&#x27;s brush allows me to paint my nails so effortlessly.</li>
            <li>After comparing many different shades of neutral colors, I decided to purchase OPI Bubble Bath.</li>
            <li>I love painting my nails but in my line of work my nails constantly keep chipping.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>It is so pretty.  </li>
            <li>Should a basecoat be used first?</li>
            <li>Us 3 coats if you want more coverage, but you&#x27;re not going to get that solid color that you see on the model&#x27;s hands.  </li>
            <li>I do not like spending so much on nail polish, but after receiving another color of OPI polish as a gift I realized it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Really versatile!</li>
            <li>And surprisingly it stayed on for almost 8 full days with only 1 minor chip after a 6 jr water park visit</li>
            <li>Very professional and clean looking.</li>
            <li>if you like pale pinks this would be a good choice for you too.</li>
            <li>There is a slight hint of pink which is perfect!  </li>
            <li>It never peels off and doesn&#x27;t chip easily - and, I am not particularly careful with my nails.  </li>
            <li>I love OPI nail polishes in general and this Bubble Bath color in particular.</li>
            <li>It Looks clean soft</li>
            <li>It is good for a French manicure, if I paint white tips over it.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s light any chips barely are visible.  </li>
            <li>Love it for every day wear and even for formal events because it&#x27;s such a classic color.</li>
            <li>Have several colors in OPI and find it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but  Quality of polish is nice though as OPI typically is.</li>
            <li>I stopped painting my nails a long time ago and simply used a transparent top coat, but I was looking for a light shade that would be unobtrusive and yet leave a sheen.</li>
            <li>Instead, it is a very light pink and makes your nails look</li>
            <li>A really good feature for a busy person with little time for maintenance.</li>
            <li>Amazingly it also seems to last quite a bit longer than regular polish which in my case is chipping within three days.</li>
            <li>The feature I like is the chips aren&#x27;t very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>for the name brand and cost, I expected better.  </li>
            <li>Item as described, fast postage.</li>
            <li>Like all Opi nail polishes, it dries fast.</li>
            <li>Its very milky</li>
            <li>product came in the mail extremely fast</li>
            <li>The price is also reasonable .</li>
            <li>but two if you really want that pinkish tint.</li>
            <li>and the shipment is fast, well ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>Always vibrate, in their advertisements, I find OPI to be very streaky when applied.  </li>
            <li>Very neutral.  </li>
            <li>Shipped FAST</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is very feminine and matches all my outfits.</li>
            <li>This is a very neutral shade yet provides some coverage.  </li>
            <li>Almost pink and lovely.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this polish so much</li>
            <li>The color is more of a nude than the pink in the picture.</li>
            <li>(for me that&#x27;s a translucent, slightly pink shade) and a top coat to seal it in.</li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish.</li>
            <li>This polish is not apink color .it is more peachy pink in color.</li>
            <li>The color is more like the ring finger and on the pink side (not peach or nude. )</li>
            <li>very natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this after looking up some light shade polishes, which are the only kinds I like on my toes.</li>
            <li>I also purchased opi its a girl which is more pink, cant wait to try it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping/great product</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t, and its goopy on the nails.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>I really like this color</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to like it that much when I got it in the mail</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite work color, it&#x27;s sheer but gives you that girly feel if you can&#x27;t wear color to work.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color, it doesn&#x27;t chip as fast as other nail polishes I have from OPI.</li>
            <li>Love this color and did not chip like other polishes.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply but not colour from the picture,  very pearl not the pink colour I want.  </li>
            <li>My new foavorite!</li>
            <li>I immedicately watch next show &amp; sure enough there is the color bubble gum</li>
            <li>It sort of looks like the natural color of the nail bed but gives a smooth even color to the entire nail.</li>
            <li>Same as above - love it</li>
            <li>It was so super sheer that I had to put about 6 to 7 coats on.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to know what all the hype was about with this particular color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic.  </li>
            <li>The picture shows it looking more solid pink, probably with lots of layers, but with a single coat you get a much more transparent effect which I like.  </li>
            <li>It looks very soft, yet very chic.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Just a little more than nude.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered this, I wanted something that would look natural but be more pink then my natural nails.  </li>
            <li>When I got it, it seemed like your normal neutral shade.</li>
            <li>Those who are much more adventurist will probably gag at such a bland color (my manicurist did just that when I first tried this Bubble Bath shade)</li>
            <li>It last a very long time without chipping, so I will be purchasing more nail colors from this brand.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; this polish is, I put on about 3-4 coats to be a light pink color.</li>
            <li>One thing that I just LIVE for is that it has NO streaking.</li>
            <li>I live this color......</li>
            <li>I have been using OPI for year and it still continues to surprise me with new colors...</li>
            <li>My opinion is, this is nice if you like natural and want a toned down look in a simple way.</li>
            <li>I have a warm undertone, and the three coats of pale pink almost exactly matches my skin.</li>
            <li>You have to use at least 4 coats to get good overall coverage with no brush marks.  </li>
            <li>I liked this polish because it was subtle and not frosted or glittered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do need 2 coats of this polish to make it look good (along with a base and top coat).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;OPI makes such a strong lacquer that glides on very smoothly and if having used the base coat and top coat, find it lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li>Not gaudy, very classy.  </li>
            <li>Very natural.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking ..</li>
            <li>This is a very light colored nail polish, but I really like how subtle it is.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to mess up and is just a beautiful nude color that is refined and suttle.</li>
            <li>My cousin first recommended this polish and after reading various reviews I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Color is pretty similar to the pictures.</li>
            <li>You need to try this color soft and it doesn&#x27;t chip !</li>
            <li>Paint the white tips on first, then 1 or 2 coats of this color.</li>
            <li>FYI, the first photo has two different colors on the nails.  </li>
            <li>I pretty use this for the whole summer or pink that I order as well</li>
            <li>Both of my granddaughters love the dark blues, deep purples, oranges and greens.  </li>
            <li>Such a pretty natural color.  </li>
            <li>I love OPI but wish this color was less sheer.</li>
            <li>However, you will have to apply several coats to make it look like in the picture (at least 3), otherwise the color is super light -almost translucent.</li>
            <li>I generally do not wear nude shades on my nails and feet, however, this is pretty for the natural look.  </li>
            <li>The color was a little too light, too transparent,even after 2-3 coats on it.</li>
            <li>This shade was, as I said, just a little too light for me.  </li>
            <li>A step up from clear.</li>
            <li>1 coat goes on shiny and mostly clear, 2 coats starts to look like a transparent pinkish color.</li>
            <li>Its a soft, neutral pinky beige.</li>
            <li>I have long been a fan of OPI nail lacquer having first experience it at my beauty salon.</li>
            <li>it offered such an array of colors from very white to such bizarre colors that being a woman who is well into my senior years, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try.</li>
            <li>I do like to change the color pallet up from season to season but always rely on the soft pinks as I think they compliment any skin tones, no matter what the season.  </li>
            <li>Makes a female feel very girly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the lacquer on for 5 days and so far no chips.</li>
            <li>This is my go to color in between professional manicures.</li>
            <li>With one or two coats its a translucent natural look.</li>
            <li>Wow, it made a difference.</li>
            <li>Try this, you will be surprised at the results.</li>
            <li>I like natural looking colors.</li>
            <li>It only requires one coat for me but two if I really want that pinkish tint.  </li>
            <li>I have medium skin and it pairs well for that natural look.  </li>
            <li>if one is looking for a natural or &amp;#34;French Look&amp;#34; manicure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so natural looking.</li>
            <li>this is the nearly nude one.  </li>
            <li>My 12-year old loves it.</li>
            <li>When I travel, I&#x27;ll wear this color on my natural nails so that when the edges start to wear or if I should break a nail, it is not as noticeable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classy glossy neutral.</li>
            <li>When I got home, I rushed to my local Ulta and picked it up straight away.</li>
            <li>It is timeless and tasteful and professional.</li>
            <li>I like it because it gives nails a natural color.will order again.i</li>
            <li>, its classy.</li>
            <li>This color polish makes my nails look so natural which I like and adds that shine.</li>
            <li>, it looks so natural</li>
            <li>It makes your nails look really classy.  </li>
            <li>Works best with OPI base coat and topcoat.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a neutral base for a background i was making on my nails and this was the perfect color.</li>
            <li>Two coats of this with base and top coat give a nice, finished look but NOT opaque.  </li>
            <li>If you want a little sheen and subtle color, this is great.</li>
            <li>disappointed as its More of a very light clear.</li>
            <li>Terrific color and quick dry.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any other polish worth buying, I threw out all that weren&#x27;t OPI.</li>
            <li>I so love the subtle color.</li>
            <li>The polish dries pretty fast, I applied 3 coats and it didn&#x27;t take very long to dry.</li>
            <li>It goes on like OPI but somehow has more pink than the previous bottles that I have purchased from salons.</li>
            <li>If you order one that is too light, like Bubble Bath, then next time you&#x27;ll know how to adjust and get a slightly darker shade.  </li>
            <li>A late review, got this polish as expected, and I love OPI, couldn&#x27;t pass up the price!</li>
            <li>Translucent, pretty pink.</li>
            <li>It goes on not too thick and not too thin, just the right amount of coat - you should be good with just 2.  </li>
            <li>Bubble bath is the second color of their huge collection that I have purchased and I have to admit that I won&#x27;t buy any other brand than OPI in the future.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect base color for a French Manicure.</li>
            <li>This color is perfect for a french manicure base.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way more pink and pale than pictured.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a subtle pink and a nice summer color.</li>
            <li>Great color that lasts and even when it chips, doesn&#x27;t look bad.</li>
            <li>When I travel I&#x27;ll use this shade b/c if it chips you barely notice.  </li>
            <li>because now my nails have such a professional look.  </li>
            <li>barely there look.</li>
            <li>Very feminine, neutral color with just a hint of pink.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little darker skinned, and it just didn&#x27;t look right to me.</li>
            <li>Opaque in four coats, a very pale nude that looks like a cool tinted cream on the hand.</li>
            <li>Painted my nails right away (with 2 coats of base and top), and the manicure has lasted 6 days already!</li>
            <li>Less pink than &amp;#34;Coney Island Cotton Candy&amp;#34; but more pink than &amp;#34;Bare my Soul&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Hint of blush pink with high gloss.</li>
            <li>This look is definitely a step above natural and judging by this brand I will be purchasing future OPI products.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I like to wear fun nail polish colors - and for that I usually buy Sally Hansen because it&#x27;s cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a very soft peach pink nude color.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear with just a tint of pink.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> I was pleased when it arrived and was happy to have a neutral color for my hands when I wanted a break from colors .</li>
            <li> Very innocent color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too happy with it the texture, but the colour is okay</li>
            <li> The pigment is true to what you see in the bottle and the quality of the polish itself is very good.  </li>
            <li> After applying this polish, my nails have never looked better!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this polish!</li>
            <li> This is the color you see on the nails of the actresses in so many shows these days!</li>
            <li> I just love this color!  </li>
            <li> Love OPI&#x27;s colors!</li>
            <li> I love this color!  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my favorite friend and now need one for myself!</li>
            <li> I love this color!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this color!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Then it started to chip off because I had so many coats on -- ugh!  </li>
            <li> love the color!</li>
            <li> Love how my nails looked!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> but you need 4 coats and a top coat for it to get like the picture!</li>
            <li> Adds a lovely finish, I wanted my nails to looks like Giada DiLaurentis does on her cooking show!</li>
            <li> this is too light for my hands, but still a beautiful color for softness,</li>
            <li> My nails have a nice manicured look without a lot of color - which I love!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shade if you want a slight hint of color and great shine for your nails!  </li>
            <li> Be prepared for plenty of complements on your clean, beautiful nails.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and a great, neutral shade.</li>
            <li> This nail polish has a nice shiny finish, however to get the look advertised in the image it takes about 5 coats.</li>
            <li> I honestly gave up after 3 coats and kept getting thicker lines of color.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I thought it looked nice.  </li>
            <li> but since I was the one paying for the color, did my own thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks really nice when it goes on.</li>
            <li> Even my trendy teenagers like this one.</li>
            <li> It is just a nice color for me.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase at such a great price.</li>
            <li> Like able and made by Opi, a good product name.</li>
            <li> color is nice neutral..</li>
            <li> Nice color and prompt delivery</li>
            <li> I just got a bottle of this color from Amazon and can&#x27;t wait to try it out on my own.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my daughter and she liked it.</li>
            <li> Makes your nails look nicely groomed w/o looking overdone.  </li>
            <li> I thought that this color would be nice on me but just did not like it  on me.</li>
            <li> Otherwise nice color</li>
            <li> I have also seen it on darker skin tones and it&#x27;s just as nice.</li>
            <li> The color is true to the picture shown and looks beautifully nude on my caramel skin.</li>
            <li> This polish came fast and is perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Ok...let me just say that if you want your nails to look really nice with a buff color, this is it.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use two or three coats and it still has a nice color</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, beautiful color</li>
            <li> Very nice clean look.</li>
            <li> Very light but nice product</li>
            <li> the polish goes on smooth apply 2 coats and your good to go.</li>

            <li> I liked it better...</li>
            <li> It is light, even with two coats, and im tan latina, but it looks gorgeous.</li>
            <li> This polish is really glossy and nice, beautiful for Spring.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t chip easy with a good top coat.</li>
            <li> Looks great on young and flawless hands as well as my knarley ones that I really don&#x27;t want to call&lt;</li>
            <li> Excellent staying power  and lovely  natural shade that make one&#x27;s nails look healthy.  </li>
            <li> Love this color and it shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li> Very light, even after 2 coatings.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use top coat if I don&#x27;t have to, and you can get away without applying with this nail polish.  </li>

            <li> OPI is my favorite brand of polish.</li>
            <li> Buying nail polish online is always risky because you just can&#x27;t be sure of the color unless it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ve ordered before.  </li>

            <li> I have lots of nail polish (more bottles than I care to admit), and this is one of the two that I have actually finished the whole bottle of-which really tells how attractive it is, and what a great neutral it is.</li>
            <li> It is a very natural color and makes your hands look so gorgeous.</li>

            <li> This is THE greatest everyday (and travel) shade!  </li>

            <li> Apparently she loved the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got it probably more than a month ago and used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> I love this color--it is sheer enough to give a clean look to nails and OPI polish is among the best for wear.</li>

            <li> Love on the days when I want a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> After that, it looked better but it really didn&#x27;t grab me like a fabulous polish should.  </li>
            <li> This color is such a good clean light neutral color.  </li>
            <li> This color is simple but nice in so many ways.</li>
            <li> It gives your nails a clean, chic look.</li>
            <li> Soft, lovely color!  </li>
            <li> You can dress this up,use it for special occasions,or just leave it as is.</li>
            <li> I put black and brown leopard over it and its gorgeous!</li>
            <li> If you want a solid color of this then go with 3 coats but its really good with just one or two costs because it nude with peach-pink undertone to it.</li>
            <li> , color is more intense.  </li>
            <li> This is good polish for an at-home french manicure, but beware!</li>

            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color.</li>
            <li> Very pretty shade.  </li>
            <li> This polish is very pretty and I am hoping it suites me also</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> It not only looks great but it also lasts for several days and in many cases, two weeks without chipping.</li>
            <li> Very light and natural looking if that&#x27;s what your looking for!</li>
            <li> OPI makes great polish, they never let me down.</li>
            <li> This particular color is very subdued and a nice change from the brights.</li>
            <li> I love the new gel line with</li>
            <li> Everytime I fall in love with a new shade from OPI</li>
            <li> I am in love with my new \\&quot;Sugar Daddy\\&quot;..</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen it personally, but OPI is a pretty good brand.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color, may need 3 coats for this to pop or white paint first.</li>
            <li> Cute natural color for when you´re giving your nails a break from gels!</li>
            <li> You do have to put several coats (I used 5) of the polish on for it to give you the best coverage, but overall I thought it was pretty.</li>
            <li> Felt pretty!</li>
            <li> Great everyday polish.</li>
            <li> Great color for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I love the soft color.</li>
            <li> Smile</li>
            <li> Love the soft hue..</li>
            <li> I have found that for the price, OPI isn&#x27;t really worth it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a sheer pink for manicure, and the Bubble Bath was perfect.</li>
            <li> Looks best when used with OPI Base and Top Coat. :)</li>
            <li> I do not know how many coats I have to apply for this polish to look as it looks on the picture, so far I have applied 3 coats and cannot achieve that creamy color.</li>
            <li> The OPI Bubble Bath shade gives you a great step above natural.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no where near as cute as it was on her.</li>
            <li> It applys so nicely and evenly, that a second coat is not needed.</li>
            <li> I love soft colors on my nails.  </li>
            <li> But the great thing is that most of these shades are quite wearable, and what I found out was that if you use the darker shade as a base and use Bubble Bath on top, it lightens the whole thing quite nicely.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails look so polished and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I love the nail polish it stays chip free for ten days</li>
            <li> Love the clear opi but never buy this stuff again</li>
            <li> I wanted a pale shade that wouldn&#x27;t draw attention and this is great.  </li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t mind with this polish because it dries pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I really like OPI products, but in this particular color, I like much better</li>
            <li> other good nail polish&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Needs two coats to get it just right</li>
            <li> Great summer shade which lasts a long time with clear topcoat.</li>
            <li> My fiancé says it is not the same coverage thickness and chips very easily.</li>
            <li> Offers a clean neutral yet polished look (even on my tan Indian hands!).</li>
            <li> It is more on the tan side, not pink.</li>
            <li> My nails are not long and gorgeous like some I have seen so this natural color suits me for a finished look.</li>
            <li> It arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> I went back and forth about buying this for a while and am happy I finally did.  </li>
            <li> This color has al ittle more color than just a clear finish, but not too much that its matte.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to deal with high maintenance polish but love a classy manicured look this color is for you!</li>
            <li> With a very light coat it looks almost like you had a french manicure.  </li>
            <li> A great soft neutral pink!</li>
            <li> The color is true to the picture just a very light baby pink</li>
            <li> It is a very light pink and for summer and when one wants to use something light.</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty color.</li>
            <li> I have to put about 2 coats on, but it makes your nails look really pretty.</li>
            <li> The polish is so pretty just by looking at it through the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this polish, its the same polish that the nail shop use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This IS a pretty color, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending the money.</li>
            <li> So pretty.</li>
            <li> But truthfully I just don&#x27;t see what the big deal is!</li>
            <li> It last long holds up great.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Maybe with french tips it&#x27;ll look better</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly as pictured.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a pretty nail polish, though.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product based on the picture and the color is exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nude/pink color and OPI&#x27;s brush allows me to paint my nails so effortlessly.</li>
            <li> After comparing many different shades of neutral colors, I decided to purchase OPI Bubble Bath.</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails but in my line of work my nails constantly keep chipping.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> It is so pretty.  </li>
            <li> Should a basecoat be used first?</li>
            <li> Us 3 coats if you want more coverage, but you&#x27;re not going to get that solid color that you see on the model&#x27;s hands.  </li>
            <li> I do not like spending so much on nail polish, but after receiving another color of OPI polish as a gift I realized it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Really versatile!</li>
            <li> And surprisingly it stayed on for almost 8 full days with only 1 minor chip after a 6 jr water park visit</li>
            <li> Very professional and clean looking.</li>
            <li> if you like pale pinks this would be a good choice for you too.</li>
            <li> There is a slight hint of pink which is perfect!  </li>
            <li> It never peels off and doesn&#x27;t chip easily - and, I am not particularly careful with my nails.  </li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polishes in general and this Bubble Bath color in particular.</li>
            <li> It Looks clean soft</li>
            <li> It is good for a French manicure, if I paint white tips over it.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s light any chips barely are visible.  </li>
            <li> Love it for every day wear and even for formal events because it&#x27;s such a classic color.</li>
            <li> Have several colors in OPI and find it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but  Quality of polish is nice though as OPI typically is.</li>
            <li> I stopped painting my nails a long time ago and simply used a transparent top coat, but I was looking for a light shade that would be unobtrusive and yet leave a sheen.</li>
            <li> Instead, it is a very light pink and makes your nails look</li>
            <li> A really good feature for a busy person with little time for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Amazingly it also seems to last quite a bit longer than regular polish which in my case is chipping within three days.</li>
            <li> The feature I like is the chips aren&#x27;t very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> for the name brand and cost, I expected better.  </li>
            <li> Item as described, fast postage.</li>
            <li> Like all Opi nail polishes, it dries fast.</li>
            <li> Its very milky</li>
            <li> product came in the mail extremely fast</li>
            <li> The price is also reasonable .</li>
            <li> but two if you really want that pinkish tint.</li>
            <li> and the shipment is fast, well ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> Always vibrate, in their advertisements, I find OPI to be very streaky when applied.  </li>
            <li> Very neutral.  </li>
            <li> Shipped FAST</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is very feminine and matches all my outfits.</li>
            <li> This is a very neutral shade yet provides some coverage.  </li>
            <li> Almost pink and lovely.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this polish so much</li>
            <li> The color is more of a nude than the pink in the picture.</li>
            <li> (for me that&#x27;s a translucent, slightly pink shade) and a top coat to seal it in.</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish.</li>
            <li> This polish is not apink color .it is more peachy pink in color.</li>
            <li> The color is more like the ring finger and on the pink side (not peach or nude. )</li>
            <li> very natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this after looking up some light shade polishes, which are the only kinds I like on my toes.</li>
            <li> I also purchased opi its a girl which is more pink, cant wait to try it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping/great product</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t, and its goopy on the nails.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> I really like this color</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like it that much when I got it in the mail</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite work color, it&#x27;s sheer but gives you that girly feel if you can&#x27;t wear color to work.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color, it doesn&#x27;t chip as fast as other nail polishes I have from OPI.</li>
            <li> Love this color and did not chip like other polishes.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply but not colour from the picture,  very pearl not the pink colour I want.  </li>
            <li> My new foavorite!</li>
            <li> I immedicately watch next show &amp; sure enough there is the color bubble gum</li>
            <li> It sort of looks like the natural color of the nail bed but gives a smooth even color to the entire nail.</li>
            <li> Same as above - love it</li>
            <li> It was so super sheer that I had to put about 6 to 7 coats on.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to know what all the hype was about with this particular color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic.  </li>
            <li> The picture shows it looking more solid pink, probably with lots of layers, but with a single coat you get a much more transparent effect which I like.  </li>
            <li> It looks very soft, yet very chic.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just a little more than nude.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I wanted something that would look natural but be more pink then my natural nails.  </li>
            <li> When I got it, it seemed like your normal neutral shade.</li>
            <li> Those who are much more adventurist will probably gag at such a bland color (my manicurist did just that when I first tried this Bubble Bath shade)</li>
            <li> It last a very long time without chipping, so I will be purchasing more nail colors from this brand.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; this polish is, I put on about 3-4 coats to be a light pink color.</li>
            <li> One thing that I just LIVE for is that it has NO streaking.</li>
            <li> I live this color......</li>
            <li> I have been using OPI for year and it still continues to surprise me with new colors...</li>
            <li> My opinion is, this is nice if you like natural and want a toned down look in a simple way.</li>
            <li> I have a warm undertone, and the three coats of pale pink almost exactly matches my skin.</li>
            <li> You have to use at least 4 coats to get good overall coverage with no brush marks.  </li>
            <li> I liked this polish because it was subtle and not frosted or glittered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do need 2 coats of this polish to make it look good (along with a base and top coat).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;OPI makes such a strong lacquer that glides on very smoothly and if having used the base coat and top coat, find it lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li> Not gaudy, very classy.  </li>
            <li> Very natural.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking ..</li>
            <li> This is a very light colored nail polish, but I really like how subtle it is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to mess up and is just a beautiful nude color that is refined and suttle.</li>
            <li> My cousin first recommended this polish and after reading various reviews I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Color is pretty similar to the pictures.</li>
            <li> You need to try this color soft and it doesn&#x27;t chip !</li>
            <li> Paint the white tips on first, then 1 or 2 coats of this color.</li>
            <li> FYI, the first photo has two different colors on the nails.  </li>
            <li> I pretty use this for the whole summer or pink that I order as well</li>
            <li> Both of my granddaughters love the dark blues, deep purples, oranges and greens.  </li>
            <li> Such a pretty natural color.  </li>
            <li> I love OPI but wish this color was less sheer.</li>
            <li> However, you will have to apply several coats to make it look like in the picture (at least 3), otherwise the color is super light -almost translucent.</li>
            <li> I generally do not wear nude shades on my nails and feet, however, this is pretty for the natural look.  </li>
            <li> The color was a little too light, too transparent,even after 2-3 coats on it.</li>
            <li> This shade was, as I said, just a little too light for me.  </li>
            <li> A step up from clear.</li>
            <li> 1 coat goes on shiny and mostly clear, 2 coats starts to look like a transparent pinkish color.</li>
            <li> Its a soft, neutral pinky beige.</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of OPI nail lacquer having first experience it at my beauty salon.</li>
            <li> it offered such an array of colors from very white to such bizarre colors that being a woman who is well into my senior years, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try.</li>
            <li> I do like to change the color pallet up from season to season but always rely on the soft pinks as I think they compliment any skin tones, no matter what the season.  </li>
            <li> Makes a female feel very girly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the lacquer on for 5 days and so far no chips.</li>
            <li> This is my go to color in between professional manicures.</li>
            <li> With one or two coats its a translucent natural look.</li>
            <li> Wow, it made a difference.</li>
            <li> Try this, you will be surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> I like natural looking colors.</li>
            <li> It only requires one coat for me but two if I really want that pinkish tint.  </li>
            <li> I have medium skin and it pairs well for that natural look.  </li>
            <li> if one is looking for a natural or &amp;#34;French Look&amp;#34; manicure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so natural looking.</li>
            <li> this is the nearly nude one.  </li>
            <li> My 12-year old loves it.</li>
            <li> When I travel, I&#x27;ll wear this color on my natural nails so that when the edges start to wear or if I should break a nail, it is not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classy glossy neutral.</li>
            <li> When I got home, I rushed to my local Ulta and picked it up straight away.</li>
            <li> It is timeless and tasteful and professional.</li>
            <li> I like it because it gives nails a natural color.will order again.i</li>
            <li> , its classy.</li>
            <li> This color polish makes my nails look so natural which I like and adds that shine.</li>
            <li> , it looks so natural</li>
            <li> It makes your nails look really classy.  </li>
            <li> Works best with OPI base coat and topcoat.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a neutral base for a background i was making on my nails and this was the perfect color.</li>
            <li> Two coats of this with base and top coat give a nice, finished look but NOT opaque.  </li>
            <li> If you want a little sheen and subtle color, this is great.</li>
            <li> disappointed as its More of a very light clear.</li>
            <li> Terrific color and quick dry.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any other polish worth buying, I threw out all that weren&#x27;t OPI.</li>
            <li> I so love the subtle color.</li>
            <li> The polish dries pretty fast, I applied 3 coats and it didn&#x27;t take very long to dry.</li>
            <li> It goes on like OPI but somehow has more pink than the previous bottles that I have purchased from salons.</li>
            <li> If you order one that is too light, like Bubble Bath, then next time you&#x27;ll know how to adjust and get a slightly darker shade.  </li>
            <li> A late review, got this polish as expected, and I love OPI, couldn&#x27;t pass up the price!</li>
            <li> Translucent, pretty pink.</li>
            <li> It goes on not too thick and not too thin, just the right amount of coat - you should be good with just 2.  </li>
            <li> Bubble bath is the second color of their huge collection that I have purchased and I have to admit that I won&#x27;t buy any other brand than OPI in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect base color for a French Manicure.</li>
            <li> This color is perfect for a french manicure base.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way more pink and pale than pictured.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle pink and a nice summer color.</li>
            <li> Great color that lasts and even when it chips, doesn&#x27;t look bad.</li>
            <li> When I travel I&#x27;ll use this shade b/c if it chips you barely notice.  </li>
            <li> because now my nails have such a professional look.  </li>
            <li> barely there look.</li>
            <li> Very feminine, neutral color with just a hint of pink.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little darker skinned, and it just didn&#x27;t look right to me.</li>
            <li> Opaque in four coats, a very pale nude that looks like a cool tinted cream on the hand.</li>
            <li> Painted my nails right away (with 2 coats of base and top), and the manicure has lasted 6 days already!</li>
            <li> Less pink than &amp;#34;Coney Island Cotton Candy&amp;#34; but more pink than &amp;#34;Bare my Soul&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Hint of blush pink with high gloss.</li>
            <li> This look is definitely a step above natural and judging by this brand I will be purchasing future OPI products.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I like to wear fun nail polish colors - and for that I usually buy Sally Hansen because it&#x27;s cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a very soft peach pink nude color.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear with just a tint of pink.</li>
            <li> The color is pale enough that the polish is very unobtrusive.  </li>
            <li> If using for my pedicure, this is truly a long lasting product.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Can not beat opi can not beat this color, stay on a long time and low maintance.</li>
            <li> On me, you can barely tell I&#x27;m wearing pink nail polish at all.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s kind of inconvenient because if I brush this over the white tip of my nail, the tip turns pink, but it doesn&#x27;t change the color of my nail bed.</li>
            <li> Doesnt last as long as it says.</li>
            <li> last long time...</li>
            <li> Use a clear base coat, 2 coats of Bubble Bath, and A clear top coat.</li>
            <li> only PROBLEM IS THAT IT TAKES FOREVER TO DRY WITH 3 LAYERS.</li>
            <li> The color is shiny and stays on a long time also.</li>
            <li> Anyway, next time I&#x27;ll get a darker pink.</li>
            <li> But this color stayed on for a really long time.</li>
            <li> i got several other colors</li>
            <li> The color lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> It stays on for very long without chipping or fading</li>
            <li> And, it lasts a LONG time!!!  </li>
            <li> This shade of pink is not too pink, making it flattering for all skin colors.  </li>
            <li> and it takes a few coats to get to look proper in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I had to use about three coats before it got opaque, and then it looked too pink for my tastes.</li>
            <li> Last a few days before chipping.  </li>
            <li> THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE PINK</li>
            <li> Subtle and soft, but not too pink.</li>
            <li> for my bottle, I&#x27;m not sure if its the same with all of them, but it was really runny and thin.</li>
            <li> The color is subtle and natural.</li>
            <li> Not white, yet very pale and a hint of pink.</li>
            <li> other colors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this means it is a knock off or maybe just a different batch.  </li>
            <li> This color is the softest pink!  </li>
            <li> But planning on purchase some other colors</li>
            <li> Other brands that I have tried in colors close to nude goe on chalky and streaky.  </li>
            <li> It dries very slow compared to my other polishes, including my $2 Wet N Wild colors.</li>
            <li> If you have an active life style where you have to change shoes a lot</li>
            <li> By using a base coat and ONE coat of this polish and a top coat my nails look and take on a naturally pink hue.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a slightly darker pink though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth returning the bottle, though it would seem I&#x27;ll be in the market for a UV lamp soon if I want to wear this.</li>
            <li> My nails are a mess in other words.</li>
            <li> I used in conjunction with the OPI base coat and top coat, and it lasted even longer.</li>
            <li> I put on a base coat, two coats of the polish, and a top coat</li>
            <li> I use one coat with a base coat and top coat and it lasts.</li>
            <li> I use a base coat and a top coat</li>
            <li> Too beige...not the pale pink I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without this color in my polish collection, it&#x27;s my go to versatile color when I am toning down for the week.  </li>
            <li> This brand seems to hold up a little longer than other polishes</li>
            <li> Oh, so subtle, quiet, restful.</li>
            <li> but you can use less depending on your preference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black, comparable to singer Aaliyah&#x27;s complexion.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I want to be a little dark and sassy and sometimes I want to look manicured but conservative,</li>
            <li> So while it&#x27;s not good as a stand-alone color, it can be used for a french manicure.</li>
            <li> When I first did, I was afraid it&#x27;d be \\&quot;too girly\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This little shade is the Black Dress of the OPI collection.  </li>
            <li> It needed 3 coats otherwise it looked a little streaky.  </li>
            <li> It chips after about 3 days of wear and it always takes a few coats to get the desired shade of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw my biology teacher wearing this color a few months ago and just had to have it.</li>
            <li> Now in the mean time I discover this BASE COAT called &#x27;Stickey&#x27; by Creative Nail Design.  </li>
            <li> Not a good value for the money spent.</li>
            <li> It is a very delicate pink.</li>
            <li> It is subdued enough to not look flashy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry... I usually buy OPI</li>
            <li> Same color, but wrong item</li>
            <li> I have used this product and this same shade of OPI polish for quite sometime now and because I had run out and was unable to get to a salon, decided to purchase it thru here.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what happened.</li>
            <li> so they usually don&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> This shade of pink is very subtle and natural-looking.</li>
            <li> Could possibly be used as the base color for a French manicure.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard on painted nails and don&#x27;t paint mine often but decided to try this color.  </li>
            <li> It makes one&#x27;s nails hard as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, as it may have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> What I like is that it give my nail a bit of &#x27;pop&#x27;, yet it makes them look delicate.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need at least three coats to get the look that is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> You need to put on at least 2 layers.</li>
            <li> Here is my theory: she had a cold undertone to her skin, and the pale pink just popped on her!</li>
            <li> I am very lazy and do not tend to my nails like I should.  </li>
            <li> Too dark, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> Sorry for the uneven nails in the picture!</li>
            <li> I have worn this color on and off for at least 20 years!  </li>
            <li> This product has arrived broken.</li>
            <li> I needed a white base coat and two coats of this polish to even register a colour.</li>
            <li> The shade is very subtle.</li>
            <li> Very subtle color goes with everything.</li>
            <li> Might be fake OPI?  </li>
            <li> I must have gotten the wrong one.</li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> Is there something I&#x27;m doing wrong?  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI Bubble Bath.  </li>
            <li> This nail polish is very thin.</li>
            <li> Instead of popping, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable on me :(.</li>

            <li> DIRTY</li>
            <li> My nails look like they&#x27;ve been done in an expensive nail salon!</li>

            <li> I am always disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> You put this base coat on and while base coat is drying you immediately put on OPI nail polish and it adheres instantaneously to the polish.  </li>

            <li> Opi is always wonderful</li>
            <li> I love the soft color. I&#x27;m hard on painted nails and don&#x27;t paint mine often but decided to try this color.  The feature I like is the chips aren&#x27;t very noticeable.  A really good feature for a busy person with little time for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I love OPI but wish this color was less sheer. It takes about 4 coats to get the color in the picture. However, it&#x27;s great to put on under glitters and shimmery nail polish!</li>
            <li> great color for my nails.  i got several other colors but this is the one i use in my fingernails</li>
            <li> This did the best and believe I have tried every brand cheap and lots of money. Great buy. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty color. I have to put about 2 coats on, but it makes your nails look really pretty.</li>
            <li> The polish is so pretty just by looking at it through the bottle. It&#x27;s like a very soft peach pink nude color. One thing that I just LIVE for is that it has NO streaking. With colors like this the streaking can be bluntly obviously. If you want a solid color of this then go with 3 coats but its really good with just one or two costs because it nude with peach-pink undertone to it.</li>
            <li> This shade of pink is not too pink, making it flattering for all skin colors.  The pigment is true to what you see in the bottle and the quality of the polish itself is very good.  It goes on not too thick and not too thin, just the right amount of coat - you should be good with just 2.  It dries quickly as well.  I don&#x27;t like to use top coat if I don&#x27;t have to, and you can get away without applying with this nail polish.  Nice for French manicures but lovely just on its own. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Cute natural color for when you´re giving your nails a break from gels!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color! Not white, yet very pale and a hint of pink. Currently using it for the second time. It held up for a week with no touch ups at all. My new foavorite!</li>
            <li> Howdy all, saw on some review that Lisa Robertson on QVC wears OPI-bubble gum color. I immedicately watch next show &amp; sure enough there is the color bubble gum so I go searching for it and discovered it here at Amazon.  Now in the mean time I discover this BASE COAT called &#x27;Stickey&#x27; by Creative Nail Design.  You put this base coat on and while base coat is drying you immediately put on OPI nail polish and it adheres instantaneously to the polish.  My manicures last 8 days without chipping.  Thats it claim to fame and it works girls.     I am using now (3) coats, color is more intense.  Top coat too, a must.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish color for fingernails!!!  It is subdued enough to not look flashy, rather it makes you look polished and refined.</li>
            <li> This is THE greatest everyday (and travel) shade!  With a very light coat it looks almost like you had a french manicure.  When I travel I&#x27;ll use this shade b/c if it chips you barely notice.  One of my favorites/go to shades for all seasons!</li>
            <li> Makes me look a bit more polished.  Not gaudy, very classy.  A step up from clear.</li>
            <li> Opaque in four coats, a very pale nude that looks like a cool tinted cream on the hand. It&#x27;s quite a bit darker in the bottle than it is on your nail.</li>
            <li> Very light but nice product</li>
            <li> The color Bubble Bath is a very nice light pink that gives your nails a look of a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Elegant and understated color, one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I generally do not wear nude shades on my nails and feet, however, this is pretty for the natural look.  You do have to put several coats (I used 5) of the polish on for it to give you the best coverage, but overall I thought it was pretty.</li>
            <li> Great color but it won&#x27;t stay on so what good is it?</li>
            <li> Great everyday polish. Very natural. I recommend. Get it now. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Great basic color. Love it. Smile</li>
            <li> After applying this polish, my nails have never looked better!  My cousin first recommended this polish and after reading various reviews I decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did because now my nails have such a professional look.  This look is definitely a step above natural and judging by this brand I will be purchasing future OPI products.  Thank you Amazon and OPI!</li>
            <li> Love it! Beautiful colour! Love the soft hue..</li>
            <li> Love this color.  It would work great for a french manicure. It needed 3 coats otherwise it looked a little streaky.  But 3 coats and it looks very nice.  I use it for those days that I feel like being neutral.  Color is pretty similar to the pictures.</li>
            <li> This shade of pink is very subtle and natural-looking. I highly recommend it for a polished elegant look. Great for french manicures!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colors to wear. Great color for anyone to wear.</li>
            <li> If you have ever watched Giada De Laurentiis on the Food Network and said \\&quot;I wish I had nails like that.\\&quot; or \\&quot;How do her nails always look so damn good?\\&quot; or \\&quot;What nail polish does she use?\\&quot;...this is it. She has always seemed to use the same color. Its a soft, neutral pinky beige. Elegant and beautiful. Now you can have the same nails as Giada! Use a clear base coat, 2 coats of Bubble Bath, and A clear top coat. Semplice! Grazie Giada!</li>
            <li> Simple and perfect for a natural polish.  My favorites brand is Opi, it stays on longer and they have the best colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> I loved the color but it wasn&#x27;t much better then other good nail polish&#x27;s.  I guess I expected OPI to be super wonderful.  But I&#x27;ll tell you I would for sure buy from this company again.  It arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> Love this polish, its the same polish that the nail shop use. the polish goes on smooth apply 2 coats and your good to go. the price is great and the shipping experience was good 2 because nothing came in broke thank goodness.</li>
            <li> for the name brand and cost, I expected better.  You have to use at least 4 coats to get good overall coverage with no brush marks.  Starts coming off the day following application.  Not a good value for the money spent.</li>
            <li> Love OPI brand nail polish, you don&#x27;t have to re-polish as often.  This color is aptly named, it gives a beautiful clean looking look to your nails as if you have just taken a nice long bubble bath.  The more coats you apply the more \\&quot;milky pink\\&quot; becomes. I find that the white edges of my nails seem whiter giving my nails a French manicure look.</li>
            <li> Oh, so subtle, quiet, restful. Looks great on young and flawless hands as well as my knarley ones that I really don&#x27;t want to call&lt;br /&gt;attention to, anymore! Works best with OPI base coat and topcoat. Would work well with summer whites or winter blacks.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a neutral color and this was perfect. I have to do more than two coats sometimes since its so light in color.</li>
            <li> My nails are not long and gorgeous like some I have seen so this natural color suits me for a finished look.</li>
            <li> Excellent color and coverage!!! AAA+++!!!</li>
            <li> Love the professional color and fantastic formula, lasts forever, well almost!&lt;br /&gt;This is the color you see on the models in all magazines. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast postage.</li>
            <li> This is a great neutral color nail polish.  Have several colors in OPI and find it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This nail polish has a nice shiny finish, however to get the look advertised in the image it takes about 5 coats. This is good polish for an at-home french manicure, but beware! I have found that for the price, OPI isn&#x27;t really worth it. It chips after about 3 days of wear and it always takes a few coats to get the desired shade of color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This IS a pretty color, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend spending the money. Maybe try to find it in your local salon before buying, all of their polishes have the name on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a great color when you don&#x27;t want much color....just enough to look great and work with anything/for anything. It&#x27;s my basic go-to color.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do a French manicure and I chose Opi Bubble Bath after reading the reviews. Very nice for French manicure. I included a picture in the image gallery. I used Orly French Tip Pointe Blanche for the white tips and 2 coats of Bubble Bath. I wanted a sheer pink for manicure, and the Bubble Bath was perfect. Like all Opi nail polishes, it dries fast.</li>
            <li> This color did not look like in the sample picture. Its very milky and it takes a few coats to get to look proper in my opinion.  I honestly gave up after 3 coats and kept getting thicker lines of color.&lt;br /&gt;This color was featured in a video on youtube and I thought it looked nice.  Perhaps I just need a easier 1 or 2 coat type polish...&lt;br /&gt;Sorry... I usually buy OPI but this one I gave to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came in the mail extremely fast I would buy from this company again, just in a diff color. :)</li>
            <li> I got this because Giada di laurentiis favorite color.  My nails didn&#x27;t look like hers though.  I like it but don&#x27;t love it.  Bought another color instead.</li>
            <li> I so love the subtle color. I love the consistency as well, of course it&#x27;s OPI. Looks best when used with OPI Base and Top Coat. :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, stays on for a long time. I used in conjunction with the OPI base coat and top coat, and it lasted even longer. Very professional and clean looking.</li>
            <li> Opi is the best and the color is as depicted .  The price is also reasonable . This brand seems to hold up a little longer than other polishes</li>
            <li> I do not know how many coats I have to apply for this polish to look as it looks on the picture, so far I have applied 3 coats and cannot achieve that creamy color. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love love this natural color I pretty use this for the whole summer or pink that I order as well but I love it</li>
            <li> I love this polish! I have medium skin tone and it pairs well with skin color.  It only requires one coat but two if you really want that pinkish tint.</li>
            <li> The OPI Bubble Bath shade gives you a great step above natural.  It&#x27;s a polished(no pun intended) and a beautiful color on dark and light skin tones.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is good quality. However, you will have to apply several coats to make it look like in the picture (at least 3), otherwise the color is super light -almost translucent. I really like OPI products, but in this particular color, I like much better Sally Hansen&#x27;s polish color 230 \\&quot;Royal blush\\&quot;. Much more coverage, and the best rosie-beige polish I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I love this color--it is sheer enough to give a clean look to nails and OPI polish is among the best for wear.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, looks great in any season.</li>
            <li> It is a very light pink and for summer and when one wants to use something light.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good neutral nail color that I can wear all the time and stumbled upon this shade. It is very sheer so I apply two coats for that barely there look. It last a very long time without chipping, so I will be purchasing more nail colors from this brand.</li>
            <li> Pretty and professional nude color looks good for my office job! OPI is a excellent brand will buy again thank you!</li>
            <li> Once again, wonderful product and superior service! American Discount packages the product well and the shipment is fast, well ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item under the impression that it was a standard, OPI nail lacquer like the picture indicated.  The description didn&#x27;t say anything about it being anything else... but I received a gel polish instead.  Same color, but wrong item and I do not have the UV light to set the gel polish.  It&#x27;s not worth returning the bottle, though it would seem I&#x27;ll be in the market for a UV lamp soon if I want to wear this.</li>
            <li> I am completly in love with this color it looks fab on my skin tone and does not chip easily...I did 2-3 coats and it looks like a salon manicure!! When I head also that Giada wears this...and I have always wondered what nail polish she wore, I knew that it was perfect! I will recommend this to everyone I know. It&#x27;s a great staple to own!</li>
            <li> This is the color you see on the nails of the actresses in so many shows these days! This is it! Subtle and soft, but not too pink. A light coat provides the look of healthy, soft pick nails. Stays on forever and true OPI quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived quickly and bubble wrapped. Will purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of OPI nail lacquer having first experience it at my beauty salon. OPI was the only brand my manicurist  would use and  it offered such an array of colors from very white to such bizarre colors that being a woman who is well into my senior years, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try. Both of my granddaughters love the dark blues, deep purples, oranges and greens.  Looks good on them and they have such fun changing things up.  I do like to change the color pallet up from season to season but always rely on the soft pinks as I think they compliment any skin tones, no matter what the season.  Those who are much more adventurist will probably gag at such a bland color (my manicurist did just that when I first tried this Bubble Bath shade) but since I was the one paying for the color, did my own thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPI makes such a strong lacquer that glides on very smoothly and if having used the base coat and top coat, find it lasts and lasts.  If using for my pedicure, this is truly a long lasting product.  I love the new gel line with it&#x27;s glossy look.  Makes a female feel very girly.</li>
            <li> This polish goes on as shown in pic.  Amazingly it also seems to last quite a bit longer than regular polish which in my case is chipping within three days. I&#x27;ve had the lacquer on for 5 days and so far no chips. I think it&#x27;s definitely stronger than regular polish.</li>
            <li> Probably needs 3 coats to show.  Could possibly be used as the base color for a French manicure.  My nail girl hates it when I bring it with me.  It is practically translucent.</li>
            <li> A nude color with a hint of pink, this polish is perfect for a wedding.</li>
            <li> I just love this color!  It is perfect for spring/summer time over french manicure!  Love OPI&#x27;s colors!</li>
            <li> I love this color!  I am very lazy and do not tend to my nails like I should.  When the polish starts to chip, it does not look obvious.  When it&#x27;s freshly painted on, the nails look so clean, shiny, and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always have this color in my supplies.</li>
            <li> Love this color and this brand, but it takes 4 or more coats to be opaque.</li>
            <li> This is a neutral color that works well with different skin tones. It is not too &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34;. The shade is very subtle.</li>
            <li> So pretty. Nearly naked look.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful neutral color of nail polish ~ just a hint of pink.  I like it alot...adds just enough natural-looking color to nails.</li>
            <li> this is just enough to add a hint of nude color and cover any imperfections on my nails. they look neat and clean with this polish</li>
            <li> This is my go to color in between professional manicures. It&#x27;s hard to mess up and is just a beautiful nude color that is refined and suttle.</li>
            <li> This polish is really glossy and nice, beautiful for Spring. It stays on for very long without chipping or fading</li>
            <li> Ilove neurtal colors. I wear this color year around 24/7!!  I have been wearing this color for over 5 years! I love it!!! I goes great with everything!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this color when I purchased it but now I know why so many people like and purchase it. It looks really nice when it goes on. It is good for a French manicure, if I paint white tips over it. The color is shiny and stays on a long time also. It sort of looks like the natural color of the nail bed but gives a smooth even color to the entire nail.</li>
            <li> Same as above - love it</li>
            <li> Everytime I fall in love with a new shade from OPI I am always disappointed.  Always vibrate, in their advertisements, I find OPI to be very streaky when applied.  And although some would advise to &amp;#34;use a base coat&amp;#34; I find with this product it never seems to help.  I&#x27;m probably one out of every hundred thousand that isn&#x27;t a big fan if this nailpolish... But truthfully I just don&#x27;t see what the big deal is!</li>
            <li> Terrific color and quick dry. Excellent.  I kept some and gave some as a gift. Very pretty. I would buy again. I&#x27;m sold on this brand.</li>
            <li> A late review, got this polish as expected, and I love OPI, couldn&#x27;t pass up the price!</li>
            <li> I love the neutral color. It makes me feel feminine and elegant.</li>
            <li> This polish is a great shade on all skin tones!! It&#x27;s great for French manicures or just a simply beautiful clean look. I would definitely buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Holds up Great. If you have an active life style where you have to change shoes a lot this is what you need. It last long holds up great.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly. Have been getting lots of compliments on the color!!</li>
            <li> Love love this color.  Very neutral.  Long lasting.  Very nice color.  Great price. Quick shipment.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I like opac color and it is  easy to maintain. Can not beat opi can not beat this color, stay on a long time and low maintance.Love opi as a treat for myself</li>
            <li> I thought this would be more opaque. I couldn&#x27;t tell which finger (on the photo) the paint was, but I think it&#x27;s the pinky or middle finger. In any case, I wasn&#x27;t happy with this color.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect nude color.  I love it so much that I will be buying more when my bottle is finished.</li>
            <li> Even my trendy teenagers like this one. With one or two coats its a translucent natural look. Takes three coats for opaque.</li>
            <li> During the warmer months I prefer I nude sheer color. This is perfect. Hint of blush pink with high gloss. Very sheer after 2 coats. Exactly what I wanted. This is to replace China Glaze Passion which I can no longer find. If you&#x27;re familiar with this color they are identical.</li>
            <li> It is just a nice color for me.  Shipped FAST and it was a good choice for me, so if you like pale pinks this would be a good choice for you too.</li>
            <li> I had to use about three coats before it got opaque, and then it looked too pink for my tastes. I&#x27;m a little darker skinned, and it just didn&#x27;t look right to me. Maybe with french tips it&#x27;ll look better</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for color</li>
            <li> Excellent neutral color and wear! This is the color that is used in the salon I go to to have the french manicure. 2 coats perfect.</li>
            <li> Great color! Fast shipping! Good price!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to deal with high maintenance polish but love a classy manicured look this color is for you! I bought it for my favorite friend and now need one for myself!</li>
            <li> Love this color and did not chip like other polishes. Goes on great.</li>
            <li> This color is great for the spring and summer. I am a med brown complexion and it looks awesome on my skin tone</li>
            <li> This nail polish is simply the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. I use two coats of it and it looks like you just got a manicure. It makes your nails look natural but so much healthier and flawless!</li>
            <li> I found that this polished flaked easily. The color on the tips peeled within an hour or two after using that I had to reapply a coat to several nails. Lovely color though. It goes with anything in the wardrobe.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because my hands are in constant water. My nails are a mess in other words. By using a base coat and ONE coat of this polish and a top coat my nails look and take on a naturally pink hue. My nail stylist suggested this to me. Wow, it made a difference. You can&#x27;t tell that I have on any nail polish. Try this, you will be surprised at the results. I like natural looking colors. I have used this &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34; for awhile now. I love the color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Fast shipping. Very happy with this purchase at such a great price. This is a great color for every day.</li>
            <li> Less pink than &amp;#34;Coney Island Cotton Candy&amp;#34; but more pink than &amp;#34;Bare my Soul&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A great soft neutral pink!</li>
            <li> I love this color!  Its shear so it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; other colors well but its perfect for me.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter.  Apparently she loved the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen it personally, but OPI is a pretty good brand.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect nude color.  I get tons of compliments on it!  Great for summer and very mellow and classy.</li>
            <li> I went back and forth about buying this for a while and am happy I finally did.  It only requires one coat for me but two if I really want that pinkish tint.  I have medium skin and it pairs well for that natural look.  Received my order in good time and the polish was in good condition.  Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This is a great polish for a sheer nude manicure.  I used three coats to get the coverage I wanted but you can use less depending on your preference.  OPI makes great polish, they never let me down.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color if one is looking for a natural or &amp;#34;French Look&amp;#34; manicure. Soft, lovely color!  Would also recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish color on my nails. It is very feminine and matches all my outfits. What I like is that it give my nail a bit of &#x27;pop&#x27;, yet it makes them look delicate.</li>
            <li> It Looks clean soft and I love it! You need to try this color soft and it doesn&#x27;t chip !</li>
            <li> Great summer shade which lasts a long time with clear topcoat.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Great natural color and price.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color, may need 3 coats for this to pop or white paint first.</li>
            <li> Good color for all occasions and any time of year.</li>
            <li> Love the color, great polish.</li>
            <li> I love this color! It&#x27;s so natural looking. I always get compliments on my nails when I wear it!</li>
            <li> Excellent staying power  and lovely  natural shade that make one&#x27;s nails look healthy.  It makes one&#x27;s nails hard as well.</li>
            <li> Love on the days when I want a more natural look.  Very light, even after 2 coatings.  Stays on nails well.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Great color in look Amazing! !  Good price! In I can wait to get more colors, tks :)</li>
            <li> Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don&#x27;t.  Sometimes I want to be a little dark and sassy and sometimes I want to look manicured but conservative, etc.  this is the nearly nude one.  Like able and made by Opi, a good product name.</li>
            <li> This was a gift,I received it quickly and at a good price.</li>

            <li> This is the perfect shade if you want a slight hint of color and great shine for your nails!  There is a slight hint of pink which is perfect!  My nails have a nice manicured look without a lot of color - which I love!</li>
            <li> This is a very neutral shade yet provides some coverage.  Easy to throw on between manicures gives your nails a healthy finished look</li>
            <li> It dries very slow compared to my other polishes, including my $2 Wet N Wild colors. I think I&#x27;d rather stick with them instead of this very sheer color. 3 coats won&#x27;t even do the trick. Great for someone looking for more natural color. Sorry for the uneven nails in the picture!</li>
            <li> This is great polish.  It goes on easily and stays on.  The color is exactly as pictured.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Almost pink and lovely. I love OPI polish and this is one of the favorite colors I have in my collection</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without this color in my polish collection, it&#x27;s my go to versatile color when I am toning down for the week.  Always feel dressed with this color on my nails.  Everyone should have this color in their collection</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this polish so much but it just didn&#x27;t flatter my nails or hands.  It was so super sheer that I had to put about 6 to 7 coats on.  After that, it looked better but it really didn&#x27;t grab me like a fabulous polish should.  Then it started to chip off because I had so many coats on -- ugh!  I&#x27;m an Essie girl and I think mademoiselle or ballet slippers is a better bet than this.  Disappointing -- oh well...</li>
            <li> I wear Bubble Bath when I do French manis. I was expecting a slightly darker pink though. On me, you can barely tell I&#x27;m wearing pink nail polish at all. For me, it&#x27;s kind of inconvenient because if I brush this over the white tip of my nail, the tip turns pink, but it doesn&#x27;t change the color of my nail bed. Anyway, next time I&#x27;ll get a darker pink. And it&#x27;s OPI, so it&#x27;s a fantastic product regardless of my color expectations.</li>
            <li> Doesnt last as long as it says.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; this polish is, I put on about 3-4 coats to be a light pink color. It&#x27;s still a pretty nail polish, though.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product based on the picture and the color is exactly as pictured. Also, I just noticed this product and color in a beauty magazine. I purchased it even before it was &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34;. Excellent overall. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My favorite opi color</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Painted my nails right away (with 2 coats of base and top), and the manicure has lasted 6 days already! Offers a clean neutral yet polished look (even on my tan Indian hands!).</li>
            <li> the color is very light. i will probably never use it. waist  of money</li>
            <li> OPI is always a winner.  The color is more of a nude than the pink in the picture. It was exactly what I wanted. I wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle pink and a nice summer color.</li>
            <li> Very feminine and sophisticated color.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like the picture</li>
            <li> It is chip t resistant..color is nice neutral..last long time...lots of compliments..looks good..days nice..would recommend to anyone to try and use</li>
            <li> Very light and natural looking if that&#x27;s what your looking for!</li>
            <li> Very natural looking .. Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> allways happy with OPI products</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very nice color but you have to add a bunch of coats on before you actually see the color</li>
            <li> I wanted a pale shade that wouldn&#x27;t draw attention and this is great.  OPI is the best.</li>
            <li> Nice color and prompt delivery</li>
            <li> I got a manicure with this color and loved it.  The color is pale enough that the polish is very unobtrusive.  Since it&#x27;s light any chips barely are visible.  And best of all the manicure lasted 10 days.  I just got a bottle of this color from Amazon and can&#x27;t wait to try it out on my own.</li>
            <li> This color has al ittle more color than just a clear finish, but not too much that its matte. It is more on the tan side, not pink. Great basic. Could also be used for a french/american manicure.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nude/pink color and OPI&#x27;s brush allows me to paint my nails so effortlessly. I am currently switching off between OPI&#x27;s Bubble Bath and Essie&#x27;s Lollipop because the colors are so classic and gorgeous! Must-have nail polish color!</li>
            <li> I have used this product and this same shade of OPI polish for quite sometime now and because I had run out and was unable to get to a salon, decided to purchase it thru here. It goes on like OPI but somehow has more pink than the previous bottles that I have purchased from salons. I&#x27;m not sure if this means it is a knock off or maybe just a different batch.  Overall it works just as well, its just a slightly different shade.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. You&#x27;ll need at least three coats to get the look that is shown in the picture. My 12-year old loves it.</li>
            <li> This color is the softest pink!  Another really great color from OPI.  Better prices and availability than in my salon.</li>
            <li> The nail polish was to light.  The picture is very different than what I received. I gave it to my daughter and she liked it.</li>
            <li> love the color! beautiful for the office setting.</li>
            <li> Might be fake OPI?  My fiancé says it is not the same coverage thickness and chips very easily.</li>
            <li> OPI is a great polish for all reasons. This color is the best. It goes with everything and a manicure lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Lovely color just as pictured. Needs two coats to get it just right (for me that&#x27;s a translucent, slightly pink shade) and a top coat to seal it in. I stopped painting my nails a long time ago and simply used a transparent top coat, but I was looking for a light shade that would be unobtrusive and yet leave a sheen. This shade makes my nails look luminous...love it!</li>
            <li> Very pretty shade.  Just a little more than nude.  Makes your nails look nicely groomed w/o looking overdone.  Not quite as long-lasting as I wanted but perhaps I didn&#x27;t apply enough coats</li>
            <li> This color is such a good clean light neutral color.  When I travel, I&#x27;ll wear this color on my natural nails so that when the edges start to wear or if I should break a nail, it is not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Love this color and it shipped very quickly! Ordered on Saturday and received by Wednesday. I am very pleased with this purchase and I love nail polish so much. The color is true to the picture just a very light baby pink</li>
            <li> After comparing many different shades of neutral colors, I decided to purchase OPI Bubble Bath. I painted my nails on the same day the nail polish arrived! I absolutely love this color. My nails look like they&#x27;ve been done in an expensive nail salon! :) It&#x27;s a classy glossy neutral. I am going to upload a picture of my nails with Bubble Bath polish over them to give you a better idea as to how it looks on one&#x27;s nails. My nails have two coats of Bubble Bath on them.</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails but in my line of work my nails constantly keep chipping. But this color stayed on for a really long time. Love the simplicity and elegance of this color.</li>
            <li> If you want a little sheen and subtle color, this is great. The picture shows it looking more solid pink, probably with lots of layers, but with a single coat you get a much more transparent effect which I like.  So if it chips it&#x27;s not the end of the world.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any other polish worth buying, I threw out all that weren&#x27;t OPI.</li>
            <li> I like OPI nail polishes.  I thought this would be much more opaque than it is....I was going by the photo in the ad.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite sheer.</li>
            <li> Love how my nails looked! Felt pretty! Thank you 💋. Fast shipping too! Was impressed.</li>
            <li> nail polish so natural every day perfect</li>
            <li> Awesome nail polish, I received so many compliments on this polish and looks so great on.</li>
            <li> I like but it&#x27;s way more pink and pale than pictured. A great nude and I get compliments every time I wear this color.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Perfect condition. Great price. I love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice nail polish.  Love the color and it applies very nicely on the nail.  I also tried this on my daughter&#x27;s nails and she loves it.  Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This color is simple but nice in so many ways. I was pleased when it arrived and was happy to have a neutral color for my hands when I wanted a break from colors . You can dress this up,use it for special occasions,or just leave it as is. Either way you want to get a hold of this.</li>
            <li> The color was a little too light, too transparent,even after 2-3 coats on it. I must have gotten the wrong one.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish over the summer because I know it&#x27;s one of OPI&#x27;s best sellers. I put on a base coat, two coats of the polish, and a top coat like I always do and I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed with it so it went in my nail polish drawer and was forgotten about. Last week, I was in Washington, DC on vacation and asked a girl what nail polish she was wearing and she told me Bubble Bath. I just HAD to have it. When I got home, I rushed to my local Ulta and picked it up straight away. Then realized I already had it........ and I tried it again. This time with three coats. I liked it better... but it&#x27;s no where near as cute as it was on her. But why?!?! Here is my theory: she had a cold undertone to her skin, and the pale pink just popped on her! I have a warm undertone, and the three coats of pale pink almost exactly matches my skin. Instead of popping, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable on me :(. My boyfriend agrees that this is the reason, he said it was a lot more noticeable on her (bless his heart for listening to my nail polish trials and tribulations). My search for my favorite &amp;#34;nude-ish&amp;#34; nail continues...</li>
            <li> Great color  for a natural look</li>
            <li> Nice color &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> If your looking for a soft nude pink nail polish this is the one for you. I absolutely love this color, it doesn&#x27;t chip as fast as other nail polishes I have from OPI. You can build this color up to make it darker. The polish dries pretty fast, I applied 3 coats and it didn&#x27;t take very long to dry.</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish - it looks great and last longer than most compatible brands.  This color happens to be one of my staples!</li>
            <li> I thought that this color would be nice on me but just did not like it  on me. Just seems to disappear against my skin color so it looks like I have nothing on the nails. But planning on purchase some other colors so there&#x27;s hope for me.</li>
            <li> Sweet and neutral, but nothing Spectacular.I wanted to know what all the hype was about with this particular color.I suppose it would suit someone who wanted an added french design over it.Very innocent color.My opinion is, this is nice if you like natural and want a toned down look in a simple way.For me, its just okay..</li>
            <li> YOU CAN PLAY WITH IT.  yOU CAN DO TWO LAYERS FOR A MODERTE NEUTRAL LOOK AND 3 LAYERS FOR  MORE INTENSITY.  only PROBLEM IS THAT IT TAKES FOREVER TO DRY WITH 3 LAYERS.</li>
            <li> for my bottle, I&#x27;m not sure if its the same with all of them, but it was really runny and thin. I needed a white base coat and two coats of this polish to even register a colour. I&#x27;m not too happy with it the texture, but the colour is okay</li>
            <li> Too beige...not the pale pink I was looking for.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this, I wanted something that would look natural but be more pink then my natural nails.  This has gone beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> I heard of this color on YouTube and loved how it looked on all the girls. No matter what skin tone you are ... it matches.</li>
            <li> This is a very light colored nail polish, but I really like how subtle it is.  OPI makes a great product, and the nail polish is good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic.  I have worn this color on and off for at least 20 years!  It is timeless and tasteful and professional.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a perfect summer color.  OPI&#x27;s Bubble Bath fits the bill.  I use one coat with a base coat and top coat and it lasts.</li>
            <li> Great color that lasts and even when it chips, doesn&#x27;t look bad. Very subtle color goes with everything. Use it often!</li>
            <li> This is a great neutral color for nails.  Easy to apply and holds up beautifully!  Try it you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Prett color but you need 4 coats and a top coat for it to get like the picture! Otherwise nice color</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish. It gives my nails a nice, clean look and the color goes with everything.</li>
            <li> Adds a lovely finish, I wanted my nails to looks like Giada DiLaurentis does on her cooking show! LOL, and this is the color. Love it.</li>
            <li> I liked this polish because it was subtle and not frosted or glittered. It is a very delicate pink. It went on smoothly and two coats gave a perfect finish.</li>
            <li> This polish is very pretty and I am hoping it suites me also the shipping was awesome and the timing was great. I would tell everyone to rush and get this it looks so pretty.&lt;br /&gt;  Brenda</li>
            <li> I love opi polishes. This polish is not apink color .it is more peachy pink in color. I like it because it gives nails a natural color.will order again.i</li>
            <li> OPI is an awsome nail color brand. It applys so nicely and evenly, that a second coat is not needed. Bubble bath is the second color of their huge collection that I have purchased and I have to admit that I won&#x27;t buy any other brand than OPI in the future. This polish lasts and lasts. Then lasts some more. No chips, no fading, just perfect!!!! Delivery... as promised!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color but chips in one day.</li>
            <li> I love soft colors on my nails.  This color is so perfect.  It matches with anything you wear.  It looks very soft, yet very chic.  I am in love with my new \\&quot;Sugar Daddy\\&quot;..lol.. I highly recommend:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy:)</li>
            <li> OPI has done it again!  The polish goes on smoothly &amp; easily, especially for a polish of this color.  Other brands that I have tried in colors close to nude goe on chalky and streaky.  Vey happy with this color and the OPI brand.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply but not colour from the picture,  very pearl not the pink colour I want.  Don&#x27;t believe from the picture.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Giado wears this and I love it on her and that&#x27;s why I bought it and it looks great.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. I used if for the French style manicure. Doesn&#x27;t chip easy with a good top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually thrilled with OPI products, however, this particular shade would take about 5 coats to look the way it does in the photo. It goes on clear with just a tint of pink. So while it&#x27;s not good as a stand-alone color, it can be used for a french manicure. Paint the white tips on first, then 1 or 2 coats of this color.</li>
            <li> The color is more like the ring finger and on the pink side (not peach or nude. ) You need to put on at least 2 layers. That would give it a translucent color. It is meant to look neutral so it does what it&#x27;s meant to do.  It  stayed on without chipping for two weeks.</li>
            <li> Looking for a nice neutral color this is the winner! ! I&#x27;m actually a China Glaze/Essie nailpolish person but O.P.I. seems to appeal to me more.  I was looking for a neutral base for a background i was making on my nails and this was the perfect color. if you want to use it on its own a couple of layers will do it perfect.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and a great, neutral shade.</li>
            <li> OPI is my favorite brand of polish. This particular color is very subdued and a nice change from the brights. Will definitely enjoy.</li>
            <li> Buying nail polish online is always risky because you just can&#x27;t be sure of the color unless it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ve ordered before.  Even when you compare pictures of the same color side-by-side but from different vendors, they can look like totally different shades.  You just can&#x27;t tell what the polish is going to look like on you.  The best way to proceed, I think, is to go to Opi&#x27;s web site.  They have a virtual &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; that you can adjust to match your skin tone (even that&#x27;s just a guess) and then &amp;#34;try on&amp;#34; different shades.  If you order one that is too light, like Bubble Bath, then next time you&#x27;ll know how to adjust and get a slightly darker shade.  This shade was, as I said, just a little too light for me.  I was going for a sort of sheer peach that would add some color but still be somewhat translucent.  So next time I went a bit darker.  Too dark, unfortunately.  But the great thing is that most of these shades are quite wearable, and what I found out was that if you use the darker shade as a base and use Bubble Bath on top, it lightens the whole thing quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to know that my wife loves this colour.  It looks great on her and she just keeps complimenting the shade of OPI Bubble Bath.  She gets lots of compliments with it and I would truly recommend this !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This color is the perfect neutral and works great with my fair skin. I have also seen it on darker skin tones and it&#x27;s just as nice.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  It makes my nails look so polished and fresh.  The color lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> This is a great classy neutral color.  Love it for every day wear and even for formal events because it&#x27;s such a classic color.</li>
            <li> For interviews, weddings, dates, work.  You name it.  This little shade is the Black Dress of the OPI collection.  Goes with literally everything.</li>
            <li> Perfect neutral color. I&#x27;ve gone through three bottles. It&#x27;s hard to find in stores, as it may have been discontinued. Thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite nail polish brands and colors.  Sometimes I like to wear fun nail polish colors - and for that I usually buy Sally Hansen because it&#x27;s cheaper.  But, on a regular basis, I always turn to Bubble Bath by OPI for my fingernails.  It is so pretty.  Don&#x27;t be deceived when you see the polish in the bottle.  When I first did, I was afraid it&#x27;d be \\&quot;too girly\\&quot;.  But, it is not.  Instead, it is a very light pink and makes your nails look very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need 2 coats of this polish to make it look good (along with a base and top coat).  But, I don&#x27;t mind with this polish because it dries pretty quickly.  And, it lasts a LONG time!!!  It never peels off and doesn&#x27;t chip easily - and, I am not particularly careful with my nails.  If it does chip - all you need to do is fill in the area with a quick stroke of the polish.  Because of the light color, you can get away with this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after looking up some light shade polishes, which are the only kinds I like on my toes. When I got it, it seemed like your normal neutral shade. Today I got my fingers done and decided to try it on my hands. It is light, even with two coats, and im tan latina, but it looks gorgeous. My nails look beautiful. Im very happy, its classy. I also purchased opi its a girl which is more pink, cant wait to try it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a nice light color when i am in the mood for a nude polish. I have finally found it ! very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a good color for french manicures.  You may need to work with the formula a couple of times before you get the look in the photos.  FYI, the first photo has two different colors on the nails.  The fore and ring fingers are Bubble Bath swatches, and the middle and pinkie fingers are China Glaze Blushing.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth the color is...and everybody thinks that ive got my nail done at the salon LoL....:)....its a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this color as a nude, professional go-to.  I did notice that the last time I wore this that the color faded into an almost yellowish color.  I use a base coat and a top coat so I&#x27;m not sure what happened.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite work color, it&#x27;s sheer but gives you that girly feel if you can&#x27;t wear color to work.</li>
            <li> disappointed as its More of a very light clear. but  Quality of polish is nice though as OPI typically is.</li>
            <li> This is for cool skin tones.  I thought this would be on the warmer side, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping/great product</li>
            <li> Love it. The color is true to the picture shown and looks beautifully nude on my caramel skin.</li>
            <li> Such a pretty natural color.  Color goes on easy, dries quickly, and the nails look clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have yet to get my nails to look like this. Three coats and I still don&#x27;t have this creamy look! Sorry.  Is there something I&#x27;m doing wrong?  Should a basecoat be used first? How do you get this opaque look?</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, beautiful color</li>
            <li> I love the nail polish it stays chip free for ten days iI will always use OPI it is the greatest</li>
            <li> This polish came fast and is perfect!!! I love neutral tones and the opaque-ness of this is incredible. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and seller!</li>
            <li> I saw my biology teacher wearing this color a few months ago and just had to have it. I&#x27;ve only worn it once since then but I like it. It gives your nails a clean, chic look. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so sheer though.</li>
            <li> Its been one of my faves for years.  Goes with everything.  OPI is great polish.  Last a few days before chipping.  Great toe color too.</li>
            <li> This is fab!!!!  It is a very natural color and makes your hands look so gorgeous. I am a big fan of OPI and this is one of my favorites! Try Hawaiian orchid if you haven&#x27;t. That&#x27;s also beautiful if you like a natural tone on your hands.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect base color for a French Manicure. It&#x27;s also great alone. Great product for anyone! I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The nail polish shows in the pic that it covers. It really doesn&#x27;t, and its goopy on the nails. Love the clear opi but never buy this stuff again</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING. THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE PINK BUT ITS CLOSER TO A BEIGE AND JUST LOOOKKKS DIRTY ON.. I DIDNT LIKE THIS POLISH FOR ME.</li>
            <li> Very Sheer. Perfect for French manicure.</li>
            <li> one of the best nail polishes and color for everyday use</li>
            <li> Love this nail color and use it lots!!  Great shipping &amp; packaging too.</li>
            <li> Very feminine, neutral color with just a hint of pink.  Two coats of this with base and top coat give a nice, finished look but NOT opaque.  Maybe that would take another coat.  Looks good anytime of the year.</li>
            <li> In my years of using nail polish, this is the best I have ever used.  I am so relieved and delighted!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone I know.  T&#x27;is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is very thin. If you want a result like the one on the picture you need a lot of layers and a lot of time. I personally prefer when you only have to add one layer, but if you have a lot of time to adds tons of layers it might work for you.</li>
            <li> I have worn this colr for the last 9 years, It give a very clean sophisticated look. It goes anywhere</li>
            <li> I like OPI lacquer nail polish period!  this is too light for my hands, but still a beautiful color for softness,</li>
            <li> I live this color......I have been using OPI for year and it still continues to surprise me with new colors...</li>
            <li> I put 2 coats  And surprisingly it stayed on for almost 8 full days with only 1 minor chip after a 6 jr water park visit haha. I think this is a great quickie way to add a hint of color. I&#x27;ve not put more than 2 coats on....yet. I would buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> i get compliments all the time !</li>
            <li> This color polish makes my nails look so natural which I like and adds that shine. OPI is my favorite brand so they usually don&#x27;t disappoint. If you want that neutral and natural look, this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Love the color.  Great color for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Ok...let me just say that if you want your nails to look really nice with a buff color, this is it. I love OPI nail polish. It not only looks great but it also lasts for several days and in many cases, two weeks without chipping. Great nail polish, beautiful color!</li>
            <li> I opened the bottle as soon as it was delivered and the bristles on the brush were all bent and ruined. Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> Very nice clean look. Translucent, pretty pink. I get compliments every time I wear this. Us 3 coats if you want more coverage, but you&#x27;re not going to get that solid color that you see on the model&#x27;s hands.  I&#x27;m black, comparable to singer Aaliyah&#x27;s complexion. This would look great on any skin tone.</li>
            <li> This color is perfect for a french manicure base.  If you need to do your own nails quickly, without worrying about color smudging, this is the color for you.  I have received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped and received very quickly.  I got it probably more than a month ago and used it for the first time today.  When you put on one coat of this polish, it does NOT look like the nails in the picture.  You need to apply 3-4 coats to get it opaque.  I applied 2 because I was in a rush and it still looks as if I am wearing no polish at all.  I like the color, but you will use up a lot of the bottle painting all ten nails in one sitting.</li>
            <li> I really like this color, it looks so natural and I received a lot of compliments on it, I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Love this neutral. It is very light and natural and goes great with everything. I put black and brown leopard over it and its gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Was very impressed with the shade and stays on for a long time :) just simply love it! Will definitely keep buying from Opi!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this color.  I didn&#x27;t expect to like it that much when I got it in the mail but once I put it on I fell in love.  It makes your nails look really classy.  Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrog with OPI</li>
            <li> Bought this color about 2 years ago and wear it often. Love the color, sort of a light peachy-flesh tone.</li>
            <li> The perfect nude/neutral color.  Be prepared for plenty of complements on your clean, beautiful nails.  I have lots of nail polish (more bottles than I care to admit), and this is one of the two that I have actually finished the whole bottle of-which really tells how attractive it is, and what a great neutral it is.</li>
            <li> This is the most beautiful nude color ever!!! This is a color I have searched for since my 20s!!! It is that beautiful color that seems as though you are not wearing anything but have the most beautiful nude nails. Like Giada from the food Network channel!</li>
            <li> I love this color it is light. I sometimes use two or three coats and it still has a nice color</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to buy this color for about 5 years. I do not like spending so much on nail polish, but after receiving another color of OPI polish as a gift I realized it is worth the investment. 1 coat goes on shiny and mostly clear, 2 coats starts to look like a transparent pinkish color. Really versatile! I use it as a top coat on occasion.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI Bubble Bath.  Easy applicator and a great, long wearing product.  The color is subtle and natural.</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polishes in general and this Bubble Bath color in particular. It is a great nude shade that gives your nails a well tended look without clashing with your clothes or brightly colored toe nails!</li>
