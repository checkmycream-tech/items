            <li>Use it every day, happy every day!</li>
            <li>Greatest shampoo.  </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>I love Pantene, works great and is best for my hair.</li>
            <li>Well, in good faith I tried it for a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>scent is good for him too, not too girly.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed works amazing.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Organic just doesn&#x27;t seem to have any 2 in 1, so this is really nice to have for an alternative.</li>
            <li>Just one more thing that I love, discontinued once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo because it already has conditioner on it</li>
            <li>Without going to organic, which I also use, this is pretty good stuff for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
            <li>I am super pissed!</li>
            <li>I am also sensitive to scents and I am happy to say there is nothing too perfumy in this, and the fragrance they use seems to rinse out fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and sensitive, and I must say I settled on the Pantene Volume line after trying a LOT of others...</li>
            <li>yeah right, talk him into using a conditioner?  </li>
            <li>I use it religiously for my long hair and my hair always looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>Like it, makes my hair feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Because I always have it available for guests, Several of them have commented they really like it and have started using it themselves.</li>
            <li>Not as good as previous version - does give body but hair flies all over the place instead of sleek and smooth as in the past.</li>
            <li>They have discontinued that line in favor of this \\&quot;new &amp; improved\\&quot; line.</li>
            <li>Even the new name shows lack of respect to their consumers.</li>
            <li>I find a new product line that works, you may rest assured that I will NEVER buy another Pantene product ever again.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair a little flyaway, but doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>From a HUGE selection of speciality product lines, that showed they recognized that all hair types and conditions are not the same, and showed respect for consumers&#x27; preferences and choices, down to only 4 sub-standard choices...</li>
            <li>I barely even have to use a comb after I use this 2 in 1 shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I never use a hairdryer on my hair and let it dry naturally.  </li>

            <li> I bought this for me. I use it regularly and find a noticeable difference in how my hair looks and feels. Some shampoos leave my hair feeling like someone replaced my hair with a bundle of loose sticks, but this one does well.</li>
            <li> Use it every day, happy every day!</li>
            <li> Not as good as previous version - does give body but hair flies all over the place instead of sleek and smooth as in the past.</li>
            <li> I have been a faithful user of the Pantene Volume line for a very LONG time. They have discontinued that line in favor of this \\&quot;new &amp; improved\\&quot; line. Well, in good faith I tried it for a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SORRY PANTENE, THIS STUFF DOES **NOT** WORK. This \\&quot;new\\&quot; formula leaves my hair dull and super staticky and extremely flyaway...what a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. No volume, no shine, no manageability. My hair is very fine and sensitive, and I must say I settled on the Pantene Volume line after trying a LOT of others...from off the shelf to salon lines. Believe me...been there, done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How incredibly stupid and short-sighted of Pantene to discontinue this line, and all the others. From a HUGE selection of speciality product lines, that showed they recognized that all hair types and conditions are not the same, and showed respect for consumers&#x27; preferences and choices, down to only 4 sub-standard choices...well. Even the new name shows lack of respect to their consumers. \\&quot;Flat\\&quot; indeed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will now have to stock up on my regular Volume favorites at premium prices from elsewhere and try and find something else that works when that runs out. I am super pissed! Just one more thing that I love, discontinued once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I find a new product line that works, you may rest assured that I will NEVER buy another Pantene product ever again.</li>
            <li> I love Pantene, works great and is best for my hair. I like saving water and time, so the 2-in-1 is a bonus!</li>
            <li> Like it, makes my hair feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I prefer a 2-in-1, it saves me a step and the conditioner in them is usually lighter (which is what I need). I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s different about this one. Possibly the conditioner. Or maybe just my hair type. I honestly don&#x27;t know. But after washing, my hair feels sticky, looks and feels like it has...wax all over it. I&#x27;ve used just the shampoo by itself and it works terrific. Leaves my hair a little flyaway, but doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, which is important to me. But I ran out of my conditioner and decided to give this a try. This stuff leaves a weird residue on my hair, which I don&#x27;t like. My hair feels worse after washing.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo because it already has conditioner on it and it  give me volume on my hair.</li>
            <li> makes my hair smell like fruit cakes. great product.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed works amazing.</li>
            <li> Greatest shampoo.  I use it religiously for my long hair and my hair always looks and feels great.  I never use a hairdryer on my hair and let it dry naturally.  I barely even have to use a comb after I use this 2 in 1 shampoo.  Because I always have it available for guests, Several of them have commented they really like it and have started using it themselves.</li>
            <li> Number one, I&#x27;m grateful they took the glycol out of this because I am allergic to it and I could not use it. Especially because I&#x27;ve lost so much hair due to medication I was taking, This shampoo plumps up my meager locks to an extent that I can at least tolerate looking in a mirror. I&#x27;m grateful for that too. I am also sensitive to scents and I am happy to say there is nothing too perfumy in this, and the fragrance they use seems to rinse out fairly quickly. Without going to organic, which I also use, this is pretty good stuff for me. Organic just doesn&#x27;t seem to have any 2 in 1, so this is really nice to have for an alternative.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good I think, I buy it for my dad who&#x27;s got thinning hair. it makes a noticeable difference!  I get him 2 in 1 because, yeah right, talk him into using a conditioner?  he just wouldn&#x27;t go for that LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is good for him too, not too girly.  To me it smells a bit synthetic.</li>
