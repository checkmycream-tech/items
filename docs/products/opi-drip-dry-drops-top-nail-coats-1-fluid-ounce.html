            <li>Love love love this stuff.</li>

            <li>Love that it can be purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I love this drip drop.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, won&#x27;t do my nails without it.</li>
            <li>Although one caveat is to make sure you wait a full minute after you are done with your top coat to apply this, or it will make ripples in the top coat!</li>
            <li>One of the best dry coat for nails when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li>This drip dry has become my best friend when doing nails!</li>
            <li>OPI Drip Dry finishes a great manicure with a silky, quick-drying top!  </li>
            <li>it has been an amazing product from day 1 and there isn&#x27;t a penny that isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails shiny, smooth, and looking better than the results I see at some nail salons.</li>
            <li>Its not crazy shinny so make sure you sand and buff your nails b4</li>
            <li>Works great, I put this on and give it an extra five minutes</li>
            <li>If you are someone who is impatient when it comes to painting your nails, this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s important.  </li>
            <li>This product is what you need when time is important.</li>
            <li>is very economical.  </li>
            <li>Dries your nail polish SUPER quick, with no smudging!</li>
            <li>This is a great product, and I will probably keep using it as long as I&#x27;m painting my nails.</li>
            <li>My original review is below, and it&#x27;s true - these drops do work.</li>
            <li>This stuff is SO cool.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have to wait an hour + after painting to have full use of my hands either.  </li>
            <li>it dries your manicure in 5 second, really good</li>
            <li>At a nail salon, they charge a $1.00 extra to apply this product,so this really is a good buy.</li>
            <li>This product quickly dries the nail polish and is inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Dries nails quickly.</li>
            <li>For a quick nail fix</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Its not a thick top coat.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t run out as fast!!</li>
            <li>Then I apply clear top coat,</li>
            <li>I simply cannot believe I tried to do my own manicures without it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it right before going to bed and got up without sheet marks on my nails.</li>
            <li>its description could not be more accurate you get COMPLETELY DRY nails in 1 to 2 max minutes</li>
            <li>The only downside is, you feel like you need to put more than three drops, so it drains the jar quickly.</li>
            <li>Very efficient for a quick drying nail.</li>
            <li>It allows top coats to dry quickly.</li>
            <li>In Florida (hot and humid)</li>
            <li>Keeps my nail polish fresh much much longer.</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve given it higher stars if the rubber bulb worked.</li>
            <li>Aveda Brown in Mentor Ohio has an inferior product and they only apply it on the top coat.  </li>
            <li>Love it,  dries nail polish in seconds, definitely recommend this purchase!</li>
            <li>Love these &amp;#34;Drip Dry&amp;#34; by OPI - I was buying the smaller bottle</li>
            <li>Just put a drop or two on each nail after the top coat and wait a short while.  </li>
            <li>It dries the nail so fast!</li>
            <li>Dries so fast!</li>
            <li>but it was totally worth the money because your polish dries quickly and for a busy mom</li>
            <li>OPI is the best for traditional nail polishes and this Drip Dry is a must have and actually works!</li>
            <li>As a drip dry product it&#x27;s great as it works well to dry my nails fast.</li>
            <li>They work far better than all the quick dry sprays.</li>
            <li>Well let say I still have to wait 10-15 mins for the top layer to dry to touch</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, and use it every single time I do my nails.</li>
            <li>I will most likely be ordering a new bottle or two when these are gone.</li>
            <li>Love drip dry!  </li>
            <li>then I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This really speeds up the drying process and seems to prolong the length of time the polish stays on the nails.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Absolutely works as advertised.</li>
            <li>To me, this works better than other spray nail dryers.</li>
            <li>I still have to wait about 30 mins or an hour more to a complete dry.</li>
            <li>I wear a compression stocking and am able to put it back on immediately following my pedicure no smudges at all!</li>
            <li>you can even feel free to do them right before leaving the house with 1-2 little drops.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>A friend turned me on to this awesome nail &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s not a brush or a spray, but an eye dropper that lets you put a little drop right on your finger, so you tilt your hand down when you apply it and it runs down the nail.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails late at night while watching TV.</li>
            <li>My nail salon normally carries this and without it I have to sit forever under the dryer, but they&#x27;ve been out for quite a while</li>
            <li>something that would normally take hours.</li>
            <li>My nails dry so quickly when using this opi quick dry.</li>
            <li>It dries my nails very quickly since I have a tendency to mess up.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you were using a matte finish polish, or had multi-step nail art that you didn&#x27;t want to seal in yet then Drip Dry would be the way to go, but otherwise, I&#x27;d say go with a rapid dry top coat for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This time of year, its hard to get to a salon to get my nails done, so I find most weeks</li>
            <li>I have my nails done at home by a professional manicurist and the size of this bottle</li>
            <li>Finally a product that dries the nail polish fast</li>
            <li>OPI Drip Dry does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>With the drops, I often found myself painting, use Drip Dry, then maybe the next day applying top coat and applying Drip Dry to that...</li>
            <li>I also love that a little bit of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I can use it at home and not mess my nails up.  </li>
            <li>It actually works and dries the color extra fast!</li>
            <li>I typically wait another 20-30 minutes though, just so I dont get those creases you get from going to bed with freshly painted nails.  </li>
            <li>However, after a while of playing around with Drip Dry versus a Quick Dry Topcoat (I use Sally Hanson), I haven&#x27;t found a situation where it was beneficial to use the drops instead of the topcoat.  </li>
            <li>A quick dry topcoat also provides \\&quot;ding proofing\\&quot; fairly quickly, but additionally, later dries to a hard topcoat.  </li>
            <li>It really does dry it instantly - and leaves your cuticles moisturized.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t understand the reviews saying this doesn&#x27;t work, because I find the drops function exactly as the package says - mostly dry after a few minutes, and completely dry after 30 minutes.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> OPI is the best for traditional nail polishes and this Drip Dry is a must have and actually works!</li>
            <li> As a drip dry product it&#x27;s great as it works well to dry my nails fast.</li>
            <li> They work far better than all the quick dry sprays.</li>
            <li> Well let say I still have to wait 10-15 mins for the top layer to dry to touch</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, and use it every single time I do my nails.</li>
            <li> I will most likely be ordering a new bottle or two when these are gone.</li>
            <li> Love drip dry!  </li>
            <li> then I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This really speeds up the drying process and seems to prolong the length of time the polish stays on the nails.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Absolutely works as advertised.</li>
            <li> To me, this works better than other spray nail dryers.</li>
            <li> I still have to wait about 30 mins or an hour more to a complete dry.</li>
            <li> I wear a compression stocking and am able to put it back on immediately following my pedicure no smudges at all!</li>
            <li> you can even feel free to do them right before leaving the house with 1-2 little drops.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> A friend turned me on to this awesome nail &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s not a brush or a spray, but an eye dropper that lets you put a little drop right on your finger, so you tilt your hand down when you apply it and it runs down the nail.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails late at night while watching TV.</li>
            <li> My nail salon normally carries this and without it I have to sit forever under the dryer, but they&#x27;ve been out for quite a while</li>
            <li> something that would normally take hours.</li>
            <li> My nails dry so quickly when using this opi quick dry.</li>
            <li> It dries my nails very quickly since I have a tendency to mess up.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if you were using a matte finish polish, or had multi-step nail art that you didn&#x27;t want to seal in yet then Drip Dry would be the way to go, but otherwise, I&#x27;d say go with a rapid dry top coat for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This time of year, its hard to get to a salon to get my nails done, so I find most weeks</li>
            <li> I have my nails done at home by a professional manicurist and the size of this bottle</li>
            <li> Finally a product that dries the nail polish fast</li>
            <li> OPI Drip Dry does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> With the drops, I often found myself painting, use Drip Dry, then maybe the next day applying top coat and applying Drip Dry to that...</li>
            <li> I also love that a little bit of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I can use it at home and not mess my nails up.  </li>
            <li> It actually works and dries the color extra fast!</li>
            <li> I typically wait another 20-30 minutes though, just so I dont get those creases you get from going to bed with freshly painted nails.  </li>
            <li> However, after a while of playing around with Drip Dry versus a Quick Dry Topcoat (I use Sally Hanson), I haven&#x27;t found a situation where it was beneficial to use the drops instead of the topcoat.  </li>
            <li> A quick dry topcoat also provides \\&quot;ding proofing\\&quot; fairly quickly, but additionally, later dries to a hard topcoat.  </li>
            <li> It really does dry it instantly - and leaves your cuticles moisturized.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t understand the reviews saying this doesn&#x27;t work, because I find the drops function exactly as the package says - mostly dry after a few minutes, and completely dry after 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I bought one of the small bottles and used it up so fast</li>
            <li> I can do my nails and dry &#x27;em at the same time without using it!</li>
            <li> No, it is not absolutely perfect, if you it won&#x27;t dry your nails completely (especially if you put several coats on in a short period of time), but it does firm up the top coat</li>
            <li> Overall, not really impress with this product.</li>
            <li> Good grief, I wish I&#x27;d tried this product years ago.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your polish quite as fast as it says (at least not in my climate)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually not really a COMPLETE dry..</li>
            <li> but I originally bought it from those expensive salons/makeup counters.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re dry to the touch in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> it takes for your base/color/top coat to dry</li>
            <li> I put it on and within a minute my nails are touch dry.</li>
            <li> OPI Drip Dry Drops</li>
            <li> I think the opi drip dry didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> Nails dry within seconds if you squeeze just a drop or two on them.</li>
            <li> so you do not have to sit and wait for 25 minutes for the polish to dry.</li>
            <li> so it will resist smudges until the polish is completely dry.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s completely dry).  </li>
            <li> Drip Dry drops again, and wait 20-ish minutes until I feel like I can go to bed without imprinting them.  </li>
            <li> but no where near as long as I have had to wait in the past.</li>
            <li> What formerly took me an hour (base coat, 2 coats of color, top coat) and even then wasn&#x27;t thoroughly dry, now took me 25 minutes and it&#x27;s DRY.  </li>
            <li> underneath its still kinda wet.</li>
            <li> Faster then I expected.</li>
            <li> using base coat, 2 polishes, and top coat, wait about 3 mins then apply the drip dry.</li>
            <li> I prefer OPI products over any other nail products.  </li>
            <li> Wait about 60 seconds after polishing your nails, apply and your nails are dry to touch in about 1 minute and hard dry in about 10 minutes with no smudges.  </li>
            <li> and when I say dry, I mean REALLY dry!</li>
            <li> I mean, I tried to smudge it on purpose, about 3 minutes after the \\&quot;totally</li>
            <li> I tried to press the polish a little bit hard to see whether it&#x27;s totally dry, and i could still see a finger print mark on the nail.</li>
            <li> Just use a little a couple of times and it does wonders.</li>
            <li> This little bottle saves me tons of $$ in manicures.  </li>
            <li> I have always had problems getting my nail polish to dry before I went to bed and would wake up with indents all over my nails, NO MORE!</li>
            <li> For me, it was fully dried in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> you paint your nails and in a few minutes you do not have to worry about spoiling the manicure</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dried hard.  </li>
            <li> It was a tiny, expensive bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use the dropper.</li>
            <li> No more pushed-away color!  </li>
            <li> My routine the past few weeks has been a base coat, 2 coats of color, Drip Dry drops, and wait 30 minutes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it works.</li>
            <li> Hate that.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is SO cool.  I bought one of the small bottles and used it up so fast I had to get this larger bottle.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your polish quite as fast as it says (at least not in my climate) but I don&#x27;t have to wait an hour + after painting to have full use of my hands either.  In Florida (hot and humid) I put this on about 1-2 minutes after painting.  About 5 minutes later I can touch the polish without leaving a mark and about 20 minutes later it&#x27;s dried hard.  I&#x27;ve even used it right before going to bed and got up without sheet marks on my nails.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It dries your nails within 2 minutes max - and when I say dry, I mean REALLY dry! I use this with the Seviche fast drying top coat, and it works great! Although one caveat is to make sure you wait a full minute after you are done with your top coat to apply this, or it will make ripples in the top coat!</li>
            <li> veryyyyyyyyyyyy good it dries your manicure in 5 second, really good, everything from opi is amazing i will order again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  My nail tech uses it on my nails so I ordered some for at home when I do my own nails.  I&#x27;ve been using this for several years.  Wait a minute after your final coat of nail polish and drip one drop onto the nail and they&#x27;re dry to the touch in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to try this and thought it was a joke when I got it, I need to get out more, this stuff is amazing. Its not a thick top coat. Its an amazing binding coat that adheres to your nails and or nail polish. It doesnt stick to your skin like nail polish. Just use a little a couple of times and it does wonders. My nail polish no longer chips! Hate that. Keeps my nail polish fresh much much longer. Its not crazy shinny so make sure you sand and buff your nails b4 you paint them etc. use sparingly but often.</li>
            <li> This is my one go-to product whenever I do a home manicure.  This time of year, its hard to get to a salon to get my nails done, so I find most weeks I do my own nails late at night while watching TV. If you dont want to wait the hour or two it takes for your base/color/top coat to dry then I would absolutely recommend this product. I put it on and within a minute my nails are touch dry. I typically wait another 20-30 minutes though, just so I dont get those creases you get from going to bed with freshly painted nails.  I also love that a little bit of the product goes a long way. Invest in the 1oz bottle and you wont be reordering for a year!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. Works great, I put this on and give it an extra five minutes and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> This really speeds up the drying process and seems to prolong the length of time the polish stays on the nails.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a MUST to have when you are doing your nails. It dries your polish in seconds and moisturizes your cuticles as well!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. OPI Drip Dry does exactly what it says it does.  Wait about 60 seconds after polishing your nails, apply and your nails are dry to touch in about 1 minute and hard dry in about 10 minutes with no smudges.  I have even used this about 1/2 hour before going to bed and no sheet marks in the morning.  Great product for women on the go!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I bought the small size first with the eye dropper and use that for applications and refil with this larger size as needed.</li>
            <li> Am loving this drying drops!!! Love Amazon and the sellers on here...they ROCK!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Thank you so much. My nails dry so quickly when using this opi quick dry. Best nail dryer</li>
            <li> Great product and service from the seller!</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve given it higher stars if the rubber bulb worked. It&#x27;s hard to use the dropper. As a drip dry product it&#x27;s great as it works well to dry my nails fast.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it frequently and is very happy with the results. So, of course, I&#x27;m happy. That says it all.</li>
            <li> This product quickly dries the nail polish and is inexpensive.  Aveda Brown in Mentor Ohio has an inferior product and they only apply it on the top coat.  I have found that if applying it after each application of nail polish and then the top coat works best.</li>
            <li> Love it,  dries nail polish in seconds, definitely recommend this purchase! One of the best dry coat for nails when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li> My nail salon normally carries this and without it I have to sit forever under the dryer, but they&#x27;ve been out for quite a while so I took it upon myself to get my own and now it&#x27;s all good again (well, except for the jealous patrons who wish they had their own).  This is the best quick-dry for nails that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This drip dry has become my best friend when doing nails! It allows top coats to dry quickly. The only downside is, you feel like you need to put more than three drops, so it drains the jar quickly. i would still buy it again and again though!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It actually works and dries the color extra fast! I use couple of drops in each  nail after applying nail color and topcoat and the result is very good.</li>
            <li> OPI Drip Dry Drops Top Nail Coat is the best!!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for years!!  OPI Is The Best!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic.....dries nails lickety split!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Love this product.  Polishes off my at-home manicure.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> This product is heaven sent! Dries nails quickly. Every female should purchase a bottle!</li>
            <li> Dries your nail polish SUPER quick, with no smudging! I would definitely reccommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have used for years,dries  polish to touch instantly. I wear a compression stocking and am able to put it back on immediately following my pedicure no smudges at all!</li>
            <li> Love these &amp;#34;Drip Dry&amp;#34; by OPI - I was buying the smaller bottle but this is much more of a bargain for the price and I don&#x27;t run out as fast!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Just apply two drops on each nail and you are done within minutes. For a quick nail fix and you are set to go. Love this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent. Lets just say I didnt expect it to work THIS great! I am so satisfied. For me, it was fully dried in about 10 minutes. I was actually able to do things with my hands after doing my nails! I am so, so happy!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly. Doesn&#x27;t take a lot of drops.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!  Dries my polish in no time!</li>
            <li> If you are someone who is impatient when it comes to painting your nails, this is the perfect solution. This stuff dries your nail polish in about 30 seconds. It is a miracle! I absolutely love it, and use it every single time I do my nails. ALSO it is a nice treatment for your cuticles!</li>
            <li> This little bottle saves me tons of $$ in manicures.  I can use it at home and not mess my nails up.  It really does dry it instantly - and leaves your cuticles moisturized.  Win/Win.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last couple of years but I originally bought it from those expensive salons/makeup counters.  It was a tiny, expensive bottle but it was totally worth the money because your polish dries quickly and for a busy mom that&#x27;s important.  Then I found this size which is the best bargain ever!</li>
            <li> I have my nails done at home by a professional manicurist and the size of this bottle is very economical.  I prefer OPI products over any other nail products.  It dries my nails very quickly since I have a tendency to mess up.  At a nail salon, they charge a $1.00 extra to apply this product,so this really is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff. Works great does just what it is supposed to do. Have bought this item again and again.</li>
            <li> This liquid is a miracle. you paint your nails and in a few minutes you do not have to worry about spoiling the manicure</li>
            <li> BUY THIS. NOW. I bought the larger bottle because of all of the good reviews it was getting, and I&#x27;m sooooo happy I did. I have always had problems getting my nail polish to dry before I went to bed and would wake up with indents all over my nails, NO MORE! This is amazing. I&#x27;m so thankful for Amazon. I would have never known about this if I weren&#x27;t browsing through nail polish stuff. Every girl who paints their nails all the time needs this.</li>
            <li> This product is what you need when time is important.It only takes a couple of minutes to set and then you can go where ever without your nails getting messed up.</li>
            <li> Good grief, I wish I&#x27;d tried this product years ago.  What formerly took me an hour (base coat, 2 coats of color, top coat) and even then wasn&#x27;t thoroughly dry, now took me 25 minutes and it&#x27;s DRY.  I mean, I tried to smudge it on purpose, about 3 minutes after the \\&quot;totally dry\\&quot; time, and it did not budge.  No more pushed-away color!  This is a must-have for me, from now on.</li>
            <li> These drops are awesome. They work far better than all the quick dry sprays. I won&#x27;t paint my nails with out using these drops!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the good reviews I read. So I gave it a try...using base coat, 2 polishes, and top coat, wait about 3 mins then apply the drip dry. Well let say I still have to wait 10-15 mins for the top layer to dry to touch but it&#x27;s actually not really a COMPLETE dry..underneath its still kinda wet. I tried to press the polish a little bit hard to see whether it&#x27;s totally dry, and i could still see a finger print mark on the nail. I still have to wait about 30 mins or an hour more to a complete dry. I think the opi drip dry didn&#x27;t help at all. I can do my nails and dry &#x27;em at the same time without using it! Overall, not really impress with this product.</li>
            <li> OPI Drip Dry finishes a great manicure with a silky, quick-drying top!  Just put a drop or two on each nail after the top coat and wait a short while.  It makes my nails shiny, smooth, and looking better than the results I see at some nail salons.</li>
            <li> OPI is the best for traditional nail polishes and this Drip Dry is a must have and actually works! OMG...I&#x27;m almost out...time to reorder ASAP!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. It&#x27;s works wonders!</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly. Faster then I expected. Also the product works fairly well. It does take a bit of time even after it has been applied but no where near as long as I have had to wait in the past. Love this product and I would order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it works. Nails dry within seconds if you squeeze just a drop or two on them. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to painting my nails without this!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using this for many years. It does what it says, drys in about 5 minutes. To me, this works better than other spray nail dryers. Highly recommend this product... Love that it can be purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt; I will most likely be ordering a new bottle or two when these are gone. HAPPY HAPPY.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that dries the nail polish fast so you do not have to sit and wait for 25 minutes for the polish to dry. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> I learned about this product from my manicurist.  It works great.  Does just as advertised</li>
            <li> Love drip dry!  Can&#x27;t believe how well it works and dries my polish almost instantly.  Saves me from blanket marks in my manicure when I go to bed soon after finishing my nails.</li>
            <li> A friend turned me on to this awesome nail &amp;#34;dryer&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s not a brush or a spray, but an eye dropper that lets you put a little drop right on your finger, so you tilt your hand down when you apply it and it runs down the nail. No, it is not absolutely perfect, if you it won&#x27;t dry your nails completely (especially if you put several coats on in a short period of time), but it does firm up the top coat so it will resist smudges until the polish is completely dry. I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very efficient for a quick drying nail. Works even!</li>
            <li> Absolutely works as advertised. The best drier I ever used. And no noxious smells as in some spray driers</li>
            <li> Helps seal my polish to keep me from messing it up!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: My original review is below, and it&#x27;s true - these drops do work. However, after a while of playing around with Drip Dry versus a Quick Dry Topcoat (I use Sally Hanson), I haven&#x27;t found a situation where it was beneficial to use the drops instead of the topcoat.  A quick dry topcoat also provides \\&quot;ding proofing\\&quot; fairly quickly, but additionally, later dries to a hard topcoat.  With the drops, I often found myself painting, use Drip Dry, then maybe the next day applying top coat and applying Drip Dry to that... I still wanted my color to be protected. Perhaps if you were using a matte finish polish, or had multi-step nail art that you didn&#x27;t want to seal in yet then Drip Dry would be the way to go, but otherwise, I&#x27;d say go with a rapid dry top coat for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t understand the reviews saying this doesn&#x27;t work, because I find the drops function exactly as the package says - mostly dry after a few minutes, and completely dry after 30 minutes.  My routine the past few weeks has been a base coat, 2 coats of color, Drip Dry drops, and wait 30 minutes (it&#x27;s completely dry).  Then I apply clear top coat, Drip Dry drops again, and wait 20-ish minutes until I feel like I can go to bed without imprinting them.  When I wake up, my nails are perfect, and drying both the color and top coat with the drops works perfectly. This is a great product, and I will probably keep using it as long as I&#x27;m painting my nails.</li>
            <li> I love this drip drop. I was at the nail salon and they put it on but didn&#x27;t tell me what it was. I started searching and found it and I absolutely love it. It dries the nail so fast!</li>
            <li> it has been an amazing product from day 1 and there isn&#x27;t a penny that isn&#x27;t worth it. its description could not be more accurate you get COMPLETELY DRY nails in 1 to 2 max minutes something that would normally take hours. yes every bottle comes with a dropper. it is amazing now there is no hesitation to doing my nails you can even feel free to do them right before leaving the house with 1-2 little drops.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, won&#x27;t do my nails without it. Dries so fast!</li>
            <li> I am notorious (around my living room at least) for ruining a fresh coat of nail polish minutes after applying, and this is a must-have.  I simply cannot believe I tried to do my own manicures without it.</li>
