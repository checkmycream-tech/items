    <ol>
            <li>but it is an excellent sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Awesome product.</li>
            <li>If in the ocean for longer than an hour then the best protection is Vaseline.</li>
            <li>Badger offered me the best.</li>
            <li>Love it a lot!!</li>
            <li>Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best since I am in and out of sun which washes away the mix in the oceans’ salty water.</li>

            <li>The smell is great, like a cocoa butter scent, and it has been good to my skin, not causing any blemishes or rashes.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned.</li>
            <li>I will be honest</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I got sunburned - while I burn very easily, he doesn&#x27;t, and he&#x27;s almost as burned as I am, so it doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since you can get protection by adding more zinc with fewer ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am extremely comfortable and very satisfied with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>am VERY fair and so far this sun screen has done its job.</li>
            <li>ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions.</li>
            <li>was top of the list.</li>
            <li>BUT I also want a sunscreen that will safely work/protect my children/family.</li>
            <li>make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need as close as formula to clean ingredients in the mix as my organic sunscreen formula mix.</li>
            <li>kind is a bit pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>My sister, who has olive-colored skin and tans easily also got burned using this product, although not as severely as me.</li>
            <li>It has no perfume smell, which I like and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>When I first apply it, I swear it smells like peanut butter (and not in a &amp;#34;ooh that smells yummy&amp;#34; kind of way.)</li>
            <li>and she has a huge list of her faves and badger</li>
            <li>My wife and I bought this because we believe in using chemical free products for our children&#x27;s sake.</li>
            <li>PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.&lt;br</li>
            <li>PABA free; It must spell out on the face of the container.</li>
            <li>So far this sun lotion seems good.</li>
            <li>The higher the ZO, the more SPF.</li>
            <li>THE HIGHER THE ZINC, THE MORE PROTECTION.&lt;br</li>
            <li>means better protection although I will look like a ghost since the white ZO will stay on till I take a bath so for real light days</li>
            <li>If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since it is less ingredient with more protection since I control the zinc.</li>
            <li>SO THE ZO SHOULD STAY ON THE SKIN NOT TO BE ABSORBED BY THE SKIN AND PROCESSED BY LIVER.</li>
            <li>, I make my own sunscreen as well so for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix.</li>
            <li>I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
            <li>I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time</li>
            <li>WITH THE RIGHT SIZE ZO, YOU WILL HAVE TO WASH YOUR SKIN SINCE EVEN THE OCEAN&#x27;S SALT WATER WILL NOT REMOVE OF YOUR SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BADGER</li>
            <li>READ TO GET THE RIGHT MIX INCLUDING THE SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc</li>
            <li>Still working on the right amount to use ;)</li>
            <li>I normally use Burnout Sunscreen (also a natural zinc oxide) and have never gotten burned using it, despite spending many hours each time in the sun.</li>
            <li>I remember as a teenager when people would apply various vegetable / seed oils to their skin in order to get MORE sun.</li>
            <li>This works really well for me!  </li>
            <li>This is the only brand of sunscreen I feel ok about putting on my child</li>
            <li>First, I researched at safemama.com</li>
            <li>You can definitely feel its on because its a bit greasy, for lack of a better word, but again didn&#x27;t bother me at all</li>
            <li>This sunscreen goes on white and stays that way - it doesn&#x27;t rub in, but it does rub off easily.</li>
            <li>Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream.</li>
            <li>But works well on kids and because it is organic we like it more than other brands</li>
            <li>look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;</li>

            <li>This sunscreen is ok but, not very easy to put on.  </li>

            <li>New product I am using.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to over apply, as it spreads very nicely, but it doesn&#x27;t dry up too quickly like some other brands, making them hard to spread</li>
            <li>This one tube lasted for a week at Disney world for a 5 year old and twin 2 year olds!</li>
            <li>you want chamomile, then get Baby Badger exactly with the same formula without vanilla but with chamomile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to not use it, but it is something to be aware of if you are sensitive to smells.</li>

            <li>the cream did go on white but with only a small bit of rubbing it in most of the whiteness fades.</li>
            <li>-- lotion is thick, a little goes a long way -- very effective.</li>

            <li>This stuff is super thick and you won&#x27;t burn however, when you are on the beach sand</li>

            <li>will get into the process of appling sunblock and because of this combined with the super thick consistancy, I only used this stuff a couple of times before I went back to the spray on sunblock.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only sunscreen tht doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout.</li>
            <li> This review is about Badger (unscented) Broad Spectrum SPF34 Sunscreen (the picture is of SPF 15).  I will not buy this again. It is so thick it was difficult to apply although the directions say to apply liberally, to which there is no alternative it is so thick.  Then it is impossible to rub in and look alive; you look like a cadaver.  I&#x27;d rather not go out in the sun than to apply this stuff.  I found out that my daughter also had a tube of it in her closet and she too chooses not to use it.</li>
            <li> my son has very sensitive skin, and i also don&#x27;t like all the nasty stuff they put in other sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;this kind is a bit pricey, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy. On darker skin it is difficult to blend without it appearing as if your skin is dry but it is an excellent sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love it a lot!! New product I am using. Was looking for a safer sunblock. I blend the sunblock well into my skin so I don&#x27;t see any white residue. I also use oil as my face cream, maybe that helps.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is GARBAGE! I normally use Burnout Sunscreen (also a natural zinc oxide) and have never gotten burned using it, despite spending many hours each time in the sun. I decided to try this sunscreen because it is less expensive and has decent reviews. I applied liberally, in the same manner as I do the other natural sunscreen products, then was out in the sun for only 2 hours. I got completely fried. I have not had a sunburn this bad in my adult life. I am fair skinned. My sister, who has olive-colored skin and tans easily also got burned using this product, although not as severely as me. After this horrible experience, I took another look at the ingredients and realized that SOYBEAN OIL is the first listed ingredient. Who would put that in a sunscreen? I remember as a teenager when people would apply various vegetable / seed oils to their skin in order to get MORE sun. I will definitely never buy any Badger products again!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My wife and I bought this because we believe in using chemical free products for our children&#x27;s sake. We have tried several different types of sunscreen over the past 5 years, and this one is by far our favorite. This one tube lasted for a week at Disney world for a 5 year old and twin 2 year olds! You don&#x27;t need to over apply, as it spreads very nicely, but it doesn&#x27;t dry up too quickly like some other brands, making them hard to spread/apply. We will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Works well.  It&#x27;s a bit thick when aplying and leave a white mark if not rubbed in well.  But works well on kids and because it is organic we like it more than other brands</li>
            <li> SUNSCREENS ARE NOT BEAUTY PRODUCTS. I USE TO PROTECT MY SKIN SO THE ZO SHOULD STAY ON THE SKIN NOT TO BE ABSORBED BY THE SKIN AND PROCESSED BY LIVER. WITH THE RIGHT SIZE ZO, YOU WILL HAVE TO WASH YOUR SKIN SINCE EVEN THE OCEAN&#x27;S SALT WATER WILL NOT REMOVE OF YOUR SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BADGER offers different ZOs so 22.5%, 18%, 10%... The higher the ZO, the more SPF. I want the highest ZO especially when it is priced right since ZO is expensive and more means better protection although I will look like a ghost since the white ZO will stay on till I take a bath so for real light days the low ZO works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;22.5% ZO MIX FORMULA:&lt;br /&gt;Active Sport Sunscreen Ingredient: Non-Nano Uncoated Zinc Oxide 22.5%&lt;br /&gt;Other Sport Sunscreen Ingredients: *Helianthus Annuus (Organic Sunflower) Oil, *Cera Alba (Organic Beeswax), *Simmondsia Chinensis (Organic Jojoba) Oil, Tocopherol (Sunflower Vitamin E)&lt;br /&gt;100% Certified Natural by NPA, 98% Certified Organic by NSF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18.7% ZO MIX FORMULA:&lt;br /&gt;Active Sunscreen Ingredient: Non-Nano, Uncoated Zinc Oxide 18.75%&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Sunscreen Ingredients: *Helianthus Annus (Organic Sunflower) Oil, *Cera Alba (Organic Beeswax), Tocopherol (Sunflower Vitamin E), and CO2 Extract of *Hippophae Rhamnoides (Organic Seabuckthorn).&lt;br /&gt;100% Certified Natural by NPA, 98% Certified Organic by NSF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ INGREDIENTS. THE HIGHER THE ZINC, THE MORE PROTECTION.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I make my own sunscreen as well so for times when I do not, I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix. If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since it is less ingredient with more protection since I control the zinc. Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want vanilla then it is the same Badger but get the Kids Sunscreen which comes with Vanilla. BADGER KIDS FORMULA: Inactive Sunscreen Ingredients: *Helianthus Annuus (Organic Sunflower) Oil, *Cera Alba (Organic Beeswax), Essential Oils of *Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Organic Sweet Orange) and *Citrus Tangerina (Organic Tangerine), Tocopherol (Sunflower Vitamin E), CO2 Extracts of *Hippophae Rhamnoides (Organic Seabuckthorn) and *Vanilla Planifolia (Organic Vanilla). * &#x3D; Certified Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want chamomile, then get Baby Badger exactly with the same formula without vanilla but with chamomile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAY ATTENTION TO THE CIRCLES ON THE FACE OF LABELING. READ TO GET THE RIGHT MIX INCLUDING THE SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one, blocks both UVA (320-400 nm) and UVB (280-320 nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks. ZO is insoluble in water, used in many industries, in ointments, creams and lotions. Non-irritating, non-allergenic and non-comedogenic, used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts. ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm, when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body, do not enter the bloodstream, and are not a threat to human health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin&#x27;s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not, I need as close as formula to clean ingredients in the mix as my organic sunscreen formula mix. If you use a lot of sunscreen, then you may consider mixing your own since you can get protection by adding more zinc with fewer ingredients. ZO is what surfers put on their nose for protection, the white looking chalk. If in the ocean for longer than an hour then the best protection is Vaseline. Majority of sun screens with ZOs are creams. Creams are more difficult to apply than lotions. Producers of sunscreens sells their products for what they think they can get for each ounce of sunscreen based on their formula and ingredients that they put in that particular sunscreen, especially the percentage of the ZO varies by different production. More ZO cost more, less ZO cost less but then again, less ZO offers less protection. Producers write whatever they want to push a mix and it is up to consumers to read ingredients and compare facts. Unless you happen to be a marathon swimmer who is going to be soaked for hour and hours in the oceans&#x27; salty water without any shade, then Vaseline will act as the best sealer there is, but for a surfer like me, usually higher organic ingredients are the best since I am in and out of sun which washes away the mix in the oceans’ salty water. What I put on my skin is the same as consuming it through my skin since it is absorbed by the skin. I don&#x27;t intend to have the sunscreen for snack but it is good to know that when I choose one, it offers the least amount of chemicals in the mix. Quality sunscreens are not over 30 SPF and if any above 30 SPF, it is a simple marketing, meaning positively worthless. I wear a rash guard when surfing which covers my upper body so I am protected all the time. What worries me is my face. For a small investment, sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn, pain, cancer, medical bills, pain killers, etc. that come with exposure to the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look for clean formulas all the time with following pointers;&lt;br /&gt;1. ACTIVE INGREDIENTS of more zinc less titanium, the best-rated mineral sun blocks. Majority have many different ingredients than zinc and titanium as ACTIVE INGREDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;2. Must have the blessing of the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s annual Sunscreen Guide.&lt;br /&gt;3. I do not pay attention to water proof or water resistant. How stupid, I am going in the ocean, in salt water under the sun. Unless I put a deck coating or a roof on my head, it will not last. Anyone looking for those wordings should avoid sun and ocean. Producers like to spin the facts and challenge our knowledge and intelligence by claiming it as WITHOUT any harsh chemical or chemical FREE or without chemical ABSORBERS. Chemical is a chemical regardless.&lt;br /&gt;4. Majority have fragrance which I avoid. After all, I am going in the ocean not on a date. Why do I need fragrance on my skin which is alcohol regardless, and this is from an athlete where I consume fresh garlic napping in vinegar every single day. If I want any perfume, I will apply the perfume I purchase separately.&lt;br /&gt;5. I never leave the sunscreen in the sun. I keep it refrigerated till I use and always go for a fresh sunscreen all the time so I never worry about few months old mix. Freshness is a priority in any mix especially when it comes to oil. I insure to check the expiration date and purchase anything that I consume especially anything that it goes on my skin which is absorbed by the skin and processed by the liver.&lt;br /&gt;6.

            <li> I bought the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sun block thinking I would be avoiding nasty cancer chemicals. This stuff is super thick and you won&#x27;t burn however, when you are on the beach sand will get into the process of appling sunblock and because of this combined with the super thick consistancy, I only used this stuff a couple of times before I went back to the spray on sunblock.</li>
            <li> This works really well for me!  It has no perfume smell, which I like and is easy to apply.  I have really sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t get a rash from using it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is ok but, not very easy to put on.  It is very thick and takes a long time to spread when trying to cover your body.  I wanted the organic quality of the sunscreen, but with how hard it is to put on I don&#x27;t even want to use it anymore.  I have even tried putting a little water in it to thin it out some and still have a hard time rubbing it on.</li>
            <li> Ordered this mid-summer and still have 75% of the tube.  We use it once a week at the waterpark and since it is so expensive just use for the smallest child who has special needs.  It is very thick so warming it up in your hands helps thin it some to spread further.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand of sunscreen I feel ok about putting on my child</li>
            <li> So far this sun lotion seems good. It only takes a small amount to apply, otherwise it leaves your skin white-ish. The smell is great, like a cocoa butter scent, and it has been good to my skin, not causing any blemishes or rashes. I did notice when I apply too much though, it will dry my skin out. Still working on the right amount to use ;) So far I&#x27;ve been protected by the sun, with no burns so it seems to do the job well!</li>
            <li> Works but white paste gets on clothes even if it does not look white on skin if you rub in well.</li>
            <li> A family member was getting nauseous after applying name-brand sunscreens so we tried Badger, no more nausea! -- lotion is thick, a little goes a long way -- very effective.</li>
            <li> a little thick but covers great! I&#x27;ve used this on myself and my 2 children for the past 3 summers and never have had a burn.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on white and stays that way - it doesn&#x27;t rub in, but it does rub off easily. Both my husband and I got sunburned - while I burn very easily, he doesn&#x27;t, and he&#x27;s almost as burned as I am, so it doesn&#x27;t do the job. The packaging failed as well - I squeezed the tube (yes, I pulled the tab from under the lid first), and the sunscreen came out through the crimped end instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three strikes and I&#x27;m out. I hope I can return it.</li>
            <li> I know I am listed doing this review under a slightly different badger sunscreen. I believe it&#x27;s just the SPF that&#x27;s different. After an enormous amount of research on sunscreens I chose badger for various reasons. First, I researched at safemama.com and she has a huge list of her faves and badger was top of the list. Second, Ewg rated it very well also.  Third, I wanted a sunscreen I could buy at a local store versus ordering online and paying shipping. Badger offered me the best. Reviews were all A1 and I was able to purchase at Wegmans, local grocery store for less than what it was online. Now for my review of the sunscreen itself. I was hoping to get the kids tangerine scented but Wegmans did not have that one. I bought Active Badger Broad Spectrum SPF 30 unscented Zinc Oxide sunscreen cream. I will be honest I truly wanted a sunscreen without any white BUT I also want a sunscreen that will safely work/protect my children/family. After applying as a test to my leg the cream did go on white but with only a small bit of rubbing it in most of the whiteness fades. Immediately, I was very pleased with the little amount of white. The day after purchasing my son had a pool party. I applied all over him including face and not one burn!! No noticeably whiteness - maybe a tiny tiny bit but not concerned with that at all!! You can definitely feel its on because its a bit greasy, for lack of a better word, but again didn&#x27;t bother me at all be a use I knew it was working. I was careful not to get on clothes and after washing hands no more feel of cream on hands. I am extremely comfortable and very satisfied with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> On my quest to try to eliminate harmful chemicals from my every day &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; regimen, I often turn to Badger products.&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY fair and so far this sun screen has done its job. I do feel that calling it &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; is pushing it. When I first apply it, I swear it smells like peanut butter (and not in a &amp;#34;ooh that smells yummy&amp;#34; kind of way.) That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it only 4 stars. It doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to not use it, but it is something to be aware of if you are sensitive to smells.</li>
