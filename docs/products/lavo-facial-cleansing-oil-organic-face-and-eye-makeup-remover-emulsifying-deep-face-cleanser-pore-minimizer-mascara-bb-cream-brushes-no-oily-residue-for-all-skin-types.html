            <li>I primarily bought it because it is organic and the price is very good, but I find that it cleanses well, rinses beautifully and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>Very nice cleanser and quick delivery, very happy all around.</li>
            <li>Since it removes EVERYTHING, that&#x27;s not always a good thing</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this a night and feeling how wonderful it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li>hopefully you guys will have a sale where i can get a good deal.  </li>

            <li>Cleans good, takes off my waterproof mascara.  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love this cleansing oil!</li>
            <li>I love that this product is full of some wonderful organic products and made inn the USA.</li>
            <li>The customer service I received, and the speed with which it came, was simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>All opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been effective at removing my makeup at the end of the day</li>
            <li>but the whole experience is so luxurious and best of all it works like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li>I use the cleansing oil to make my own sugar scrub for my body.</li>
            <li>Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li>- i recieved this item in exchange for an Honest review</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this wonderful make up remover and face wash I will continue to buy love love love!</li>
            <li>I have used Lavo for about a week or more now and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>so this is a pretty good value I think!</li>
            <li>btw, my skin is a bit sensitive, but Lavo fits perfect.</li>
            <li>Once I have massaged the oil in, I splash some water on my face and the oil works itself into a nice lather which helps cleanse my face while also removing the more stubborn makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks nice and healthy, no irritation.  </li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>The fact that it is all organic and natural makes it so much better because I know I am getting the best for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light scent close to a citrus smell.</li>
            <li>It does have a very light scent, and lathers up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Takes off water proof eye make up like magic.</li>
            <li>I really love this company and will continue to use their products.  </li>
            <li>Smells herbal, earthy and healthy.</li>
            <li>and I am really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>but some are definitely better than others.  </li>
            <li>Deep Cleansing Oil is a great choice!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I would love to try your  face mask</li>
            <li>this is such a great product!</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I was looking primarily for a mascara remover and wanted something with nice healthy, organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>it magically turns milky and washes away everything.</li>
            <li>I received this free to try out in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>One thing that would make it better would be a pump</li>
            <li>Love the cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>Cruelty-free and even better than Shu Eumura.</li>
            <li>I love that it cleans my face and takes off my makeup (even if it&#x27;s waterproof).</li>
            <li>Thinner than DHC so it spreads more.  </li>
            <li>and i love the way</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>but this worked even better because it rinsed a lot faster then</li>
            <li>Also as a makeup remover it works a lot better than the brand I have been using, which was also an oil based makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Lovely, just lovely.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>and I think this works better</li>
            <li>love this cleanser</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot of makeup, mostly foundation</li>
            <li>I love the color and fragrance of the cleanser</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural, ideally organic, makeup remover/cleanser that could take off waterproof makeup without stinging my skin or drying me out.</li>
            <li>Nice, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I rinse with warm water and it rinses clean with no oily residue and no left-over make</li>
            <li>And, my skin feels (and is) very clean after washing, not greasy.</li>
            <li>The makeup softly melts away and when you wash it off (warm water really works best)</li>
            <li>Was a joy to use and to see the results of how soft my face feels.</li>
            <li>im just getting around to seeing this message, i do like this cleansing oil its so light and refreshing on the skin i have breakout prone skin</li>
            <li>I l just love is that LAVO is especially gentle.</li>
            <li>I guess I will stick to my favorite, DHC; it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for in most cases.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser that leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>This would be a good cleanser for the drier months of the year as it was very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trying to buy USA whenever possible and glad this product has been so successful for me.  </li>
            <li>so that is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>and it is a huge bottle at 6 oz for just $19.97.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received a free sample to inspect, try and review.</li>
            <li>It does leave my face glowing and it feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, removes the stingiest makeup but is still gentle.</li>
            <li>It helps get rid of all my makeup, dirt, and grime from the day.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li>and i primarily i use it for makeup removal and</li>
            <li>Light but takes off grime and makeup.</li>
            <li>It does have a light creamy feel.</li>
            <li>all honesty, this product works great, a lot better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>that is natural and safe to use while being so effective and</li>
            <li>I love how clean, fresh and hydrated my skin feels after cleansing with this oil</li>
            <li>did!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also super easy to use and no scrubbing is needed.  </li>
            <li>So I was excited to get to review this product.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because I&#x27;ve never used an oil based cleanser before.  </li>
            <li>Keep it up!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to have found my go to make up remover and feel safe about what I am putting on my skin since I now have almost 100% all natural and organic products!</li>
            <li>It is and oil, but once you put it on you face and hands with a tiny bit of water it becomes lovely and milky, It does a great job at gently removing make up, and leaves me feeling clean and not a bit oily.</li>
            <li>as I use it to remove make up and follow with a cleanser to get my skin extra clean although I am sure by it self its cleaning everything off), after months of research, trying many products and wasting a lot of money I am so glad to have found a make up remover</li>
            <li>It also has a very sweet floral smell that isn&#x27;t too overpowering, just the right amount.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised that this cleansing oil is definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>(I already have an oily skin type) but was happy that it left my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it against my skin, especially when it works into a nice frothy lather.</li>
            <li>I used it to clean my makeup brushes as well</li>
            <li>Found this and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this because I applied make up this</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>He offered a full refund, which I hadn&#x27;t even requested.  </li>
            <li>I think the price is fair considering how tiny an amount you need (5-10 drops).</li>
            <li>I purchased this in place of my beloved DHC deep cleansing oil which i&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li>The fact is that it comes off easily with just water of course being used as a skin cleanser and does leave your face feeling very moisturized but not oily at all!</li>
            <li>this is perfect, not too oily (washes off cleanly, no oily residue) and really cleans without stripping.  </li>
            <li>and luckily I have been able to try quite a few and they have all done a pretty great job at removing my makeup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll tell you though, I sure will order it again because it definitely works! : )</li>
            <li>I prefer using Lavo&#x27;s Facial Oil Cleanser because not only does it work great as a makeup remover, it also purifies my pores and pampers my skin!</li>
            <li>I was specifically because I&#x27;ve bought so many products that never seem to  live up to their claims...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has a nice light citrus smell and i have had no ill effects from it such as breakouts.i</li>
            <li>This is a super nice cleansing oil and therefore, I&#x27;m a repeat customer on my third bottle.  </li>
            <li>Use it exactly as directions note, you will be amazed at how clean your skin will be and feel softened and stay hydrated.</li>
            <li>on a really lazy night it will suffice until in the morning when i will clean my face properly lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a happy customer of Tarte&#x27;s maracuja Fresh Eyes wipes, but those little guys are spendy and I was looking for an alternative.  </li>
            <li>Very silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many makeup removers without finding one that would remove my waterproof mascara and eyeliner completely.</li>
            <li>The deep cleansing oil has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I use this at night and simply rinse my face with warm water in the morning.</li>
            <li>So far I love the product.</li>
            <li>It does not make my skin feel oily at all, it feels fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li>but honestly I will never go back!</li>
            <li>Love it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are far better than DHC</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li>And sure enough, my mascara is now easily removed, my skin feels clean and soft, and I am a believer in LAVO products!</li>
            <li>I read and followed the directions carefully and thought it was kind of cool that a separate email had come from Daniel Kang, the CEO of LAVO, with tips for the product&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>and I found that it really made my face clean</li>
            <li>Works fast and is really good at getting off waterproof mascara without stinging in the eyes or having to rub your eyes for a long time.</li>
            <li>*Apply to skin when dry, massage in, then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>I wipe my face with the cotton pad, then rinse with warm water and pat dry.</li>
            <li>I use a few drops of this oil and massage it in with my fingertips (even though you should use a cloth), this allows me to get the coverage I want and bing able to focus more on the areas that have heavier/darker makeup.</li>
            <li>Put it on dry skin and rub in before rinsing away with warm water.</li>
            <li>So...I decided to keep trying and after a few more smeary sessions, was able to figure out what technique works for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and breaks out easily</li>
            <li>have compared this cleansing oil to some more well known and more expensive cleansing oils and it works just as good and in some cases better than those other brands.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean but doesn&#x27;t strip it entirely of oils, which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and soft after</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several oil cleansers and this one is in my top 2.</li>
            <li>I love trying out different cleansing oils</li>
            <li>I can admit, I had some hesitation at first but decided to give it a try anyway.</li>
            <li>This is one of my first reviews</li>
            <li>No problems works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I LOVE not having to use extra cotton pads or towlettes-</li>
            <li>This makes things so much easier!</li>
            <li>It was ok as a facial cleanser for my face</li>
            <li>and it worked, very well in fact!</li>
            <li>It even works very well on the eye makeup which for me has always been a pain to remove, going through three cotton rounds per eye sometimes!</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better is a pump dispenser bottle.  </li>
            <li>It did clean my face but it burned my eyes more than any other makeup remover.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has natural ingredients that works well for my ultra sensitive</li>
            <li>Lightweight, fragrance free (? or barely fragranced?)</li>
            <li>but i have to be honest and say its a little pricey</li>
            <li>and so far i have experienced no kind of skin issues with this oil</li>
            <li>Rinses clean and easy without trouble.</li>
            <li>My skin has benefited so much.</li>
            <li>so I prefer one step anything really.  </li>
            <li>After repeating the step for the second time, my eyes were completely free from the mascara and eye liner.</li>
            <li>Removes make up very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight for an oil-based cleanser</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>It performed really well and out preformed all of my expectations.</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle against the skin and does not clog my pores which is another added plus.</li>
            <li>Hi Daniel thanks for much for reaching out to me</li>
            <li>AND I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It cleanses skin gently.</li>
            <li>Would prefer a pop top or pump top...much easier with wet hands</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use the toner much at all.</li>
            <li>If you are ready to revolutionize your makeup remover routine and you have 2 hands and a sink</li>
            <li>I will be upfront when I say I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li>It has a scent I cannot really put my finger on but would describe as earthy.  </li>
            <li>It doesnâ€™t foam up much at all even with added water.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really did not expect to like this oil as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>It works very well on both fronts and the day after massaging my face with this oil, I could see a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>I just take off the makeup with this and go straight to shower.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to receiving this oil cleanser.  </li>
            <li>But to my surprise, it really works.</li>
            <li>It really has helped me with my acne problem as well because it cleans the pores out.  </li>
            <li>You can use this with your washrag or you can use a pouf, I have found that the pouf works better because it exfoliates your skin to remove the dead skin cells while it is cleaning :)  Definitely recommend this product, hop over to Amazon and grab a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>However this brand does not rinse off very well and leaves a residue.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>So far I am getting good results, I use it with the Lavo Facial Brush which I bought at the same time.</li>
            <li>After the first use my mom, without knowing I bought this, asked what I used because my skin actually looked so clean and vibrant.</li>
            <li>It truly dissolves away makeup, rinses off completely, and leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as well as many other cleansing oils</li>
            <li>I feel that this product definitely gets my face thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>I definitely like it and would recommend it to help keep your face clean.</li>
            <li>However, because I have oily skin I still like to use a traditional cleanser to clean my face after I use the cleansing oil to remove my makeup.  </li>
            <li>As a cleanser this also left her skin feeling oily and felt that it didnâ€™t clean the skin well and felt it clogged pores instead.</li>
            <li>Washes clean with no oily film left on face.  </li>
            <li>I am white with medium-oily fair skin and have noticed a considerable reduction in breakouts due to makeup clogging and infecting my skin during the night.</li>
            <li>These are my better halfâ€™s observations of the oil.</li>
            <li>It has a slight &amp;quot;woodsy&amp;quot; smell compared to Tatcha&#x27;s more mild scent, but I love this nevertheless, and I actually think it rinses off slightly easier than Tatcha&#x27;s cleanser.</li>
            <li>feel for the price you get a decent amount because you do not need a lot at once-</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>A small amount is sufficient to get my face make up free and clean and soft.</li>
            <li>sent me on a quest to find something that removes make-up, ALL make-up including waterproof eye, without rubbing and that leaves my skin clean but doesn&#x27;t dry or clog pores.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too much for my sensitive skin, I can say though that if you get it too close to your eyes, it does sting from the scent.</li>
            <li>It cleanses very well and leaves my face supple and soft.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it is made with organic materials and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>dry skin w/eczema and adult acne breakouts and this has made a huge difference in the texture and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I greatly prefer this to other oils I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>Its my first time to use Lavo, and I noticed it makes my skin smoother, and not dry out at all.</li>
            <li>have never used a makeup remover or cleanser that was oil before so this was a completely new experience for me.</li>
            <li>IS my new cleanser.  </li>
            <li>and I can see that any lines and pores are much smaller (about half) and my skin stays nice and soft despite my lack of wearing sunscreen when I go walking/running.</li>
            <li>My skin is cleaner and feels very soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and if I develop an allergy it takes a week.  </li>
            <li>It was discontinued which is good because I discovered it was filled with dangerous chemicals and actual known carcinogens.  </li>
            <li>It also arrived early!</li>
            <li>My face felt amazingly soft!</li>
            <li>I have tried many makeup removers and cleansers in the past and none match up to LAVO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My skin was still dewey (even though I had used soap the morning after to cleanse) and fine lines were less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of DHC in the past, this is a better buy.</li>
            <li>This is the second product from LAVO I have tried - the first was a skincare product, this one is a cleansing makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase again and look forward to purchasing other products from this fabulous brand!</li>
            <li>However, this particular bottle was either old or near to expire.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this facial cleansing oil for several weeks and have seen a tremendous improvement in my winter-dry skin.</li>
            <li>I never thought an Oil as a facial cleanser would be a smart idea.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really worried that the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil would leave my skin feeling oily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it twice so far</li>
            <li>Made Simple for over a year and much prefer it.  </li>
            <li>Planning to get one for my sister since she has a sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the suggestion of washing my face with oil.</li>
            <li>too greasy - oily for my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>WOW I have been blown away by the efficacy of this product.</li>
            <li>Takes off all my makeup including mascara and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take off my mascara or eyeliner very well compared to something like Bobbie Brown&#x27;s eye makeup remover, but then its focus is facial cleansing not makeup removal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using just this and tamanu oil on my 39-year old face for a couple of months now</li>
            <li>Finally, something that really works.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;I put a dime size in my hand</li>
            <li>All natural and no</li>
            <li>So far have used it every day and have had no reactions.  </li>
            <li>Takes off all traces of make up and leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>: If you don&#x27;t use this fast enough, it will start to separate or develop some soapy looking residue on the bottom and, it can not be remixed.</li>
            <li>I have combination, sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>it does just what it says - takes off heavy makup and leaves skin soft and clean</li>
            <li>moisterizing which is very important for me as I suffer of rocesea/Ezcema, this product has kept my skin calmed and hasn&#x27;t triggered any irritations which is very hard for me to achieve since my skin is so sensitive and reacts to almost everything!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making this product!</li>
            <li>I was using the Tatcha facial cleanser, which I loved, until I discovered it has some questionable preservatives.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin; especially around the eyes</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>the LAVO arrived, my first thought was that I wished it was in a pump bottle, but the bottle it&#x27;s in actually works really well, dispensing a few drops at a time.  </li>
            <li>It usually has a citrus-scent, which is not too weak and not too overwhelming - it&#x27;s just right!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shocked at great this cleansing oil is.  </li>
            <li>The bottle inside is clear and has a yellow colored oil inside.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is a yellow oil (appears almost clear when dispensed).  </li>
            <li>The Lavo cleansing oil is yellow in color and came in a clear bottle with no label on it for some reason.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually smell any scent when it is on my face, and I am sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They should be releasing a toner and moisturizer in the near future.</li>
            <li>Also 30 years old and wear makeup daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for years for an all natural product to replace my DHC deep cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>I love how it removes even the toughest makeup without irritating or reddening my skin.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way here and this is terrific for getting off makeup and making your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fought with very dry skin, which we know makes you look older than you are.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do it the first few times</li>
            <li>So...I have to say that the first few times I used the LAVO oil</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very faint so good for those that have problems with fragrances.</li>
            <li>I used a clean and dry facial cloth to place a few drops of the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil on it.</li>
            <li>I started using facial oils a little over a year ago and have been a real convert ever since.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not know if this is good because it was probably providing some extra moisture to my skin; or if it was bad that it didn&#x27;t rinse off and was just sitting there like the remnants of my mascara.  </li>

            <li> I decided to purchase this because of the great reviews and the price was $10 cheaper than dhc.</li>
            <li> The oil smells great</li>
            <li> This is a very nice lightweight oil.  </li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the best rated cleansing oil from Japan, but decided to try this one because the price was better.</li>
            <li> Now I will say I was concerned about using this on my face as a cleanser because honestly, its oily!</li>
            <li> I primarily bought it because it is organic and the price is very good, but I find that it cleanses well, rinses beautifully and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li> Very nice cleanser and quick delivery, very happy all around.</li>
            <li> Since it removes EVERYTHING, that&#x27;s not always a good thing</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this a night and feeling how wonderful it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> hopefully you guys will have a sale where i can get a good deal.  </li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>

            <li> and I love it!  </li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s been effective at removing my makeup at the end of the day</li>
            <li> but the whole experience is so luxurious and best of all it works like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li> I use the cleansing oil to make my own sugar scrub for my body.</li>
            <li> Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> - i recieved this item in exchange for an Honest review</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this wonderful make up remover and face wash I will continue to buy love love love!</li>
            <li> I have used Lavo for about a week or more now and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> so this is a pretty good value I think!</li>
            <li> btw, my skin is a bit sensitive, but Lavo fits perfect.</li>
            <li> Once I have massaged the oil in, I splash some water on my face and the oil works itself into a nice lather which helps cleanse my face while also removing the more stubborn makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin looks nice and healthy, no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> The fact that it is all organic and natural makes it so much better because I know I am getting the best for my skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light scent close to a citrus smell.</li>
            <li> It does have a very light scent, and lathers up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> Takes off water proof eye make up like magic.</li>
            <li> I really love this company and will continue to use their products.  </li>
            <li> Smells herbal, earthy and healthy.</li>
            <li> and I am really enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> but some are definitely better than others.  </li>
            <li> Deep Cleansing Oil is a great choice!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I would love to try your  face mask</li>
            <li> this is such a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I was looking primarily for a mascara remover and wanted something with nice healthy, organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> it magically turns milky and washes away everything.</li>
            <li> I received this free to try out in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> One thing that would make it better would be a pump</li>
            <li> Love the cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> Cruelty-free and even better than Shu Eumura.</li>
            <li> I love that it cleans my face and takes off my makeup (even if it&#x27;s waterproof).</li>
            <li> Thinner than DHC so it spreads more.  </li>
            <li> and i love the way</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> but this worked even better because it rinsed a lot faster then</li>
            <li> Also as a makeup remover it works a lot better than the brand I have been using, which was also an oil based makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Lovely, just lovely.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> and I think this works better</li>
            <li> love this cleanser</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of makeup, mostly foundation</li>
            <li> I love the color and fragrance of the cleanser</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural, ideally organic, makeup remover/cleanser that could take off waterproof makeup without stinging my skin or drying me out.</li>
            <li> Nice, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I rinse with warm water and it rinses clean with no oily residue and no left-over make</li>
            <li> And, my skin feels (and is) very clean after washing, not greasy.</li>
            <li> The makeup softly melts away and when you wash it off (warm water really works best)</li>
            <li> Was a joy to use and to see the results of how soft my face feels.</li>
            <li> im just getting around to seeing this message, i do like this cleansing oil its so light and refreshing on the skin i have breakout prone skin</li>
            <li> I l just love is that LAVO is especially gentle.</li>
            <li> I guess I will stick to my favorite, DHC; it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for in most cases.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser that leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> This would be a good cleanser for the drier months of the year as it was very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trying to buy USA whenever possible and glad this product has been so successful for me.  </li>
            <li> so that is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> and it is a huge bottle at 6 oz for just $19.97.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received a free sample to inspect, try and review.</li>
            <li> It does leave my face glowing and it feels smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, removes the stingiest makeup but is still gentle.</li>
            <li> It helps get rid of all my makeup, dirt, and grime from the day.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li> and i primarily i use it for makeup removal and</li>
            <li> Light but takes off grime and makeup.</li>
            <li> It does have a light creamy feel.</li>
            <li> all honesty, this product works great, a lot better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> that is natural and safe to use while being so effective and</li>
            <li> I love how clean, fresh and hydrated my skin feels after cleansing with this oil</li>
            <li> did!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also super easy to use and no scrubbing is needed.  </li>
            <li> So I was excited to get to review this product.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because I&#x27;ve never used an oil based cleanser before.  </li>
            <li> Keep it up!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to have found my go to make up remover and feel safe about what I am putting on my skin since I now have almost 100% all natural and organic products!</li>
            <li> It is and oil, but once you put it on you face and hands with a tiny bit of water it becomes lovely and milky, It does a great job at gently removing make up, and leaves me feeling clean and not a bit oily.</li>
            <li> as I use it to remove make up and follow with a cleanser to get my skin extra clean although I am sure by it self its cleaning everything off), after months of research, trying many products and wasting a lot of money I am so glad to have found a make up remover</li>
            <li> It also has a very sweet floral smell that isn&#x27;t too overpowering, just the right amount.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised that this cleansing oil is definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> (I already have an oily skin type) but was happy that it left my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it against my skin, especially when it works into a nice frothy lather.</li>
            <li> I used it to clean my makeup brushes as well</li>
            <li> Found this and so far I love it!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this because I applied make up this</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> He offered a full refund, which I hadn&#x27;t even requested.  </li>
            <li> I think the price is fair considering how tiny an amount you need (5-10 drops).</li>
            <li> I purchased this in place of my beloved DHC deep cleansing oil which i&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
            <li> The fact is that it comes off easily with just water of course being used as a skin cleanser and does leave your face feeling very moisturized but not oily at all!</li>
            <li> this is perfect, not too oily (washes off cleanly, no oily residue) and really cleans without stripping.  </li>
            <li> and luckily I have been able to try quite a few and they have all done a pretty great job at removing my makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you though, I sure will order it again because it definitely works! : )</li>
            <li> I prefer using Lavo&#x27;s Facial Oil Cleanser because not only does it work great as a makeup remover, it also purifies my pores and pampers my skin!</li>
            <li> I was specifically because I&#x27;ve bought so many products that never seem to  live up to their claims...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a nice light citrus smell and i have had no ill effects from it such as breakouts.i</li>
            <li> This is a super nice cleansing oil and therefore, I&#x27;m a repeat customer on my third bottle.  </li>
            <li> Use it exactly as directions note, you will be amazed at how clean your skin will be and feel softened and stay hydrated.</li>
            <li> on a really lazy night it will suffice until in the morning when i will clean my face properly lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a happy customer of Tarte&#x27;s maracuja Fresh Eyes wipes, but those little guys are spendy and I was looking for an alternative.  </li>
            <li> Very silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many makeup removers without finding one that would remove my waterproof mascara and eyeliner completely.</li>
            <li> The deep cleansing oil has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and simply rinse my face with warm water in the morning.</li>
            <li> So far I love the product.</li>
            <li> It does not make my skin feel oily at all, it feels fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li> but honestly I will never go back!</li>
            <li> Love it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are far better than DHC</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> And sure enough, my mascara is now easily removed, my skin feels clean and soft, and I am a believer in LAVO products!</li>
            <li> I read and followed the directions carefully and thought it was kind of cool that a separate email had come from Daniel Kang, the CEO of LAVO, with tips for the product&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> and I found that it really made my face clean</li>
            <li> Works fast and is really good at getting off waterproof mascara without stinging in the eyes or having to rub your eyes for a long time.</li>
            <li> *Apply to skin when dry, massage in, then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li> I wipe my face with the cotton pad, then rinse with warm water and pat dry.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops of this oil and massage it in with my fingertips (even though you should use a cloth), this allows me to get the coverage I want and bing able to focus more on the areas that have heavier/darker makeup.</li>
            <li> Put it on dry skin and rub in before rinsing away with warm water.</li>
            <li> So...I decided to keep trying and after a few more smeary sessions, was able to figure out what technique works for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and breaks out easily</li>
            <li> have compared this cleansing oil to some more well known and more expensive cleansing oils and it works just as good and in some cases better than those other brands.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin clean but doesn&#x27;t strip it entirely of oils, which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft after</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several oil cleansers and this one is in my top 2.</li>
            <li> I love trying out different cleansing oils</li>
            <li> I can admit, I had some hesitation at first but decided to give it a try anyway.</li>
            <li> This is one of my first reviews</li>
            <li> No problems works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I LOVE not having to use extra cotton pads or towlettes-</li>
            <li> This makes things so much easier!</li>
            <li> It was ok as a facial cleanser for my face</li>
            <li> and it worked, very well in fact!</li>
            <li> It even works very well on the eye makeup which for me has always been a pain to remove, going through three cotton rounds per eye sometimes!</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better is a pump dispenser bottle.  </li>
            <li> It did clean my face but it burned my eyes more than any other makeup remover.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has natural ingredients that works well for my ultra sensitive</li>
            <li> Lightweight, fragrance free (? or barely fragranced?)</li>
            <li> but i have to be honest and say its a little pricey</li>
            <li> and so far i have experienced no kind of skin issues with this oil</li>
            <li> Rinses clean and easy without trouble.</li>
            <li> My skin has benefited so much.</li>
            <li> so I prefer one step anything really.  </li>
            <li> After repeating the step for the second time, my eyes were completely free from the mascara and eye liner.</li>
            <li> Removes make up very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight for an oil-based cleanser</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> It performed really well and out preformed all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle against the skin and does not clog my pores which is another added plus.</li>
            <li> Hi Daniel thanks for much for reaching out to me</li>
            <li> AND I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It cleanses skin gently.</li>
            <li> Would prefer a pop top or pump top...much easier with wet hands</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use the toner much at all.</li>
            <li> If you are ready to revolutionize your makeup remover routine and you have 2 hands and a sink</li>
            <li> I will be upfront when I say I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> It has a scent I cannot really put my finger on but would describe as earthy.  </li>
            <li> It doesnâ€™t foam up much at all even with added water.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really did not expect to like this oil as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> It works very well on both fronts and the day after massaging my face with this oil, I could see a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I just take off the makeup with this and go straight to shower.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this oil cleanser.  </li>
            <li> But to my surprise, it really works.</li>
            <li> It really has helped me with my acne problem as well because it cleans the pores out.  </li>
            <li> You can use this with your washrag or you can use a pouf, I have found that the pouf works better because it exfoliates your skin to remove the dead skin cells while it is cleaning :)  Definitely recommend this product, hop over to Amazon and grab a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> However this brand does not rinse off very well and leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> So far I am getting good results, I use it with the Lavo Facial Brush which I bought at the same time.</li>
            <li> After the first use my mom, without knowing I bought this, asked what I used because my skin actually looked so clean and vibrant.</li>
            <li> It truly dissolves away makeup, rinses off completely, and leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as many other cleansing oils</li>
            <li> I feel that this product definitely gets my face thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li> I definitely like it and would recommend it to help keep your face clean.</li>
            <li> However, because I have oily skin I still like to use a traditional cleanser to clean my face after I use the cleansing oil to remove my makeup.  </li>
            <li> As a cleanser this also left her skin feeling oily and felt that it didnâ€™t clean the skin well and felt it clogged pores instead.</li>
            <li> Washes clean with no oily film left on face.  </li>
            <li> I am white with medium-oily fair skin and have noticed a considerable reduction in breakouts due to makeup clogging and infecting my skin during the night.</li>
            <li> These are my better halfâ€™s observations of the oil.</li>
            <li> It has a slight &amp;quot;woodsy&amp;quot; smell compared to Tatcha&#x27;s more mild scent, but I love this nevertheless, and I actually think it rinses off slightly easier than Tatcha&#x27;s cleanser.</li>
            <li> feel for the price you get a decent amount because you do not need a lot at once-</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A small amount is sufficient to get my face make up free and clean and soft.</li>
            <li> sent me on a quest to find something that removes make-up, ALL make-up including waterproof eye, without rubbing and that leaves my skin clean but doesn&#x27;t dry or clog pores.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too much for my sensitive skin, I can say though that if you get it too close to your eyes, it does sting from the scent.</li>
            <li> It cleanses very well and leaves my face supple and soft.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it is made with organic materials and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> dry skin w/eczema and adult acne breakouts and this has made a huge difference in the texture and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I greatly prefer this to other oils I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Its my first time to use Lavo, and I noticed it makes my skin smoother, and not dry out at all.</li>
            <li> have never used a makeup remover or cleanser that was oil before so this was a completely new experience for me.</li>
            <li> IS my new cleanser.  </li>
            <li> and I can see that any lines and pores are much smaller (about half) and my skin stays nice and soft despite my lack of wearing sunscreen when I go walking/running.</li>
            <li> My skin is cleaner and feels very soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and if I develop an allergy it takes a week.  </li>
            <li> It was discontinued which is good because I discovered it was filled with dangerous chemicals and actual known carcinogens.  </li>
            <li> It also arrived early!</li>
            <li> My face felt amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> I have tried many makeup removers and cleansers in the past and none match up to LAVO&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My skin was still dewey (even though I had used soap the morning after to cleanse) and fine lines were less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of DHC in the past, this is a better buy.</li>
            <li> This is the second product from LAVO I have tried - the first was a skincare product, this one is a cleansing makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase again and look forward to purchasing other products from this fabulous brand!</li>
            <li> However, this particular bottle was either old or near to expire.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial cleansing oil for several weeks and have seen a tremendous improvement in my winter-dry skin.</li>
            <li> I never thought an Oil as a facial cleanser would be a smart idea.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really worried that the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil would leave my skin feeling oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered it twice so far</li>
            <li> Made Simple for over a year and much prefer it.  </li>
            <li> Planning to get one for my sister since she has a sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the suggestion of washing my face with oil.</li>
            <li> too greasy - oily for my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> WOW I have been blown away by the efficacy of this product.</li>
            <li> Takes off all my makeup including mascara and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take off my mascara or eyeliner very well compared to something like Bobbie Brown&#x27;s eye makeup remover, but then its focus is facial cleansing not makeup removal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using just this and tamanu oil on my 39-year old face for a couple of months now</li>
            <li> Finally, something that really works.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural and it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;I put a dime size in my hand</li>
            <li> All natural and no</li>
            <li> So far have used it every day and have had no reactions.  </li>
            <li> Takes off all traces of make up and leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> : If you don&#x27;t use this fast enough, it will start to separate or develop some soapy looking residue on the bottom and, it can not be remixed.</li>
            <li> I have combination, sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> it does just what it says - takes off heavy makup and leaves skin soft and clean</li>
            <li> moisterizing which is very important for me as I suffer of rocesea/Ezcema, this product has kept my skin calmed and hasn&#x27;t triggered any irritations which is very hard for me to achieve since my skin is so sensitive and reacts to almost everything!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making this product!</li>
            <li> I was using the Tatcha facial cleanser, which I loved, until I discovered it has some questionable preservatives.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin; especially around the eyes</li>
            <li> No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> the LAVO arrived, my first thought was that I wished it was in a pump bottle, but the bottle it&#x27;s in actually works really well, dispensing a few drops at a time.  </li>
            <li> It usually has a citrus-scent, which is not too weak and not too overwhelming - it&#x27;s just right!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at great this cleansing oil is.  </li>
            <li> The bottle inside is clear and has a yellow colored oil inside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is a yellow oil (appears almost clear when dispensed).  </li>
            <li> The Lavo cleansing oil is yellow in color and came in a clear bottle with no label on it for some reason.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually smell any scent when it is on my face, and I am sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They should be releasing a toner and moisturizer in the near future.</li>
            <li> Also 30 years old and wear makeup daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for an all natural product to replace my DHC deep cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> I love how it removes even the toughest makeup without irritating or reddening my skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way here and this is terrific for getting off makeup and making your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fought with very dry skin, which we know makes you look older than you are.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do it the first few times</li>
            <li> So...I have to say that the first few times I used the LAVO oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very faint so good for those that have problems with fragrances.</li>
            <li> I used a clean and dry facial cloth to place a few drops of the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil on it.</li>
            <li> I started using facial oils a little over a year ago and have been a real convert ever since.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not know if this is good because it was probably providing some extra moisture to my skin; or if it was bad that it didn&#x27;t rinse off and was just sitting there like the remnants of my mascara.  </li>
            <li> I tried at least 12 different cleansers trying to find the right one.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle but pleasent, it feels very natural and moisterizing while massaging your face which is very soothing, even before applying water you can see all the make up and sunscreencoming off, and once you add water it becomes milky while still feeling moisterizing and soothing!</li>
            <li> The oil itself has a very fine and thin consistency so it does not feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> It does not clean nearly as well as the more expensive brands</li>
            <li> I will say that I do happen to have skin on the dry side, so I&#x27;m only speaking for myself.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin as well as rosacea and have to be very careful about cleansers as they often strip natural oils from my skin and leave it feeling tight, dry, and irritated.</li>
            <li> Most makeup removers that I have used in the past were too harsh for my skin and my face ends up feeling raw, irritated and dry.</li>
            <li> and I have normally dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> to relieve some of my dry winter skin this winter</li>
            <li> My skin is a combination of oily and dry.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re struggling with dry skin, I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is difficult to clean off my face even after showering.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll do a second round when I wear lots of eyeshadow or especially waterproof liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> and I can see this this bottle will last for a few months, even though I use it religiously twice day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT</li>
            <li> I discontinued for a few days and tried it last night again - same effect.</li>
            <li> It left my face extremely dry with small pimples, and the smell itself indicate that it&#x27;s old as it was not fresh.</li>
            <li> It usually required two washes to completely remove all makeup.  </li>
            <li> The LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil Make Up Remover came in a black box.</li>
            <li> I have tried the pricier brands and was hoping this would do the same thing for less.  </li>
            <li> I previously used Garnier cleansing oil and found I had to follow it with a regular cleanser.</li>
            <li> Some of my other makeup removers took way too much of the product to get even just a little bit of makeup, requiring me to practically rub my skin raw.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a gross mess</li>
            <li> The cleanser is very thin but your don&#x27;t need much at all so this bottle should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For my eye make up, I dropped a few drops of the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil on my fingers.</li>
            <li> I rubbed it on my eyes, with eyes closed of course</li>
            <li> This cleaned off all of my makeup minus the remnants of my waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I had to wet a q-tip to get under my eyes and get the rest off.  </li>
            <li> my face iching, sore, all rashes, this is not for sensitive skin, seriously  very careful !!!!</li>
            <li> The LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil emulsified producing a subtle white foam upon contact with the water.</li>
            <li> I also like that its not full of strange chemicals.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> little goes a long way</li>
            <li> LAVO takes off my waterproof mascara and all other makeup in one step.</li>
            <li> Also beware all the other reviews on this product appear to be bought.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to other people.</li>
            <li> I wear heavy makeup for long hours at work</li>
            <li> but I didnâ€™t like it as much as other face cleansers for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the other stuff I use.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin is cleaner and clearer - yet less stripped - than with any other product.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have been testing out the Deep Cleansing Oil Makeup Remover that LAVO sent me to review for my blog</li>
            <li> In addition to the oil that breaks down the layers of makeup, this also turns into a milky cleanser when water is added.</li>
            <li> Check out LAVOs other products while you are there!  </li>
            <li> Gets off even my waterproof black mascara.</li>
            <li> Much less costly then the DHC oil I was using</li>
            <li> Even after using an eyemakeup remover this still didn&#x27;t break down the little mascara left behind.</li>
            <li> It dissolves eye make up in seconds with little effort.   </li>
            <li> When I was sent this product to review I was a little scared it would leave my face oily after using.</li>
            <li> I expected oily residue and to have to come in with a cotton pad to scrub away the hard to get makeup around my eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> but there are a few reasons why I didn&#x27;t:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser on a round cotton pad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me but just know this does leave your face feeling like some of the product is left behind even after rinsing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to skin care</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve since learned that it&#x27;s been a growing trend for the past 5 or 6 years.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it the Georgia pollen or the Lavo itself.</li>
            <li> But their is no oily residue left behind and it even takes eye makeup off!</li>
            <li> Because I like to wear a lot of makeup, I use a generous amount to cleanse (three small squirts); however, when I cleanse in the morning when I have no makeup on, I use a nickel size and it is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cleanser was very messy once you added the water to emulsify it.  </li>
            <li> but after a few times of using it, I developed really bad rush around my eyes.</li>
            <li> She feels it is too harsh on the skin as both a cleanser and as a makeup remover which is unfortunate as she likes Lavoâ€™s other products.</li>
            <li> it is so hard to find a product that can replace Boots Botanics Oil Makeup Remover that they stopped making.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions thoroughly and I felt as though this left my face with a slight greasy film which I hate.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and wIth frequent use, it dried it out bad!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little weird to get used to</li>
            <li> Made my wife break out quite bad the next morning after both times</li>
            <li> I woke up with red bumps around my eyes :-(((</li>
            <li> This guy stands behind his product.  </li>
            <li> Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> No way did LAVO leave any makeup behind!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed and sad</li>
            <li> boy was I wrong!</li>

            <li> Amazing! Will never go back to anything else. My skin has benefited so much. Takes off water proof eye make up like magic.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Literally, it removes EVERYTHING! It even removes waterproof/sweat proof face and eye makeup. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wish I could rate this 5 stars but there are a few reasons why I didn&#x27;t:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Though it removed my eye makeup like nothing, it also irritated my eyes. It didn&#x27;t do it the first few times but after awhile I noticed my eyes were red and not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Since it removes EVERYTHING, that&#x27;s not always a good thing lol. I have combination skin and wIth frequent use, it dried it out bad! I realized you must moisturize after using this ( in my case). I was developng whiteheads because my skin was drying out. With a moisturizer, it went back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what happened to me, but it may not be that way for someone else. I&#x27;ll tell you though, I sure will order it again because it definitely works! : )</li>
            <li> Freakin awesome product.  I thought it would be a gross mess but it&#x27;s so not! It takes off my makeup and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. It&#x27;s a really great product and works as it says it does.  I really love this company and will continue to use their products.  I am a very happy customer. It also arrived early! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as many other cleansing oils</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to skin care so I prefer one step anything really.  LAVO takes off my waterproof mascara and all other makeup in one step. I use it in the shower* in the morning and then before bed.  *Apply to skin when dry, massage in, then rinse with warm water. Follow up with moisturizer and that&#x27;s it! My skin feels smooth and soft after and I have normally dry skin.  A little goes a long way so this is a pretty good value I think!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love using this product when Iâ€™m removing my makeup! Most makeup removers that I have used in the past were too harsh for my skin and my face ends up feeling raw, irritated and dry. At one point, I had to resort to using baby oil to remove my makeup. I prefer using Lavo&#x27;s Facial Oil Cleanser because not only does it work great as a makeup remover, it also purifies my pores and pampers my skin! I love the fact that it has natural ingredients that works well for my ultra sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. Iâ€™m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end userâ€™s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many makeup removers without finding one that would remove my waterproof mascara and eyeliner completely. So I was excited to get to review this product. I was so surprised that this cleansing oil is definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried. I love how it removes even the toughest makeup without irritating or reddening my skin. I love how clean, fresh and hydrated my skin feels after cleansing with this oil</li>
            <li> It did clean my face but it burned my eyes more than any other makeup remover. Also beware all the other reviews on this product appear to be bought.</li>
            <li> works great I love the product!</li>
            <li> The LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil Make Up Remover came in a black box. The bottle inside is clear and has a yellow colored oil inside. The deep cleansing oil has a nice scent. I was super excited to try this because I applied make up this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions were fairly simple. I used a clean and dry facial cloth to place a few drops of the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil on it. I spread it all over my face using the facial cloth. I then ran my hands under running water and then proceeded to massage my face around. The LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil emulsified producing a subtle white foam upon contact with the water. I then rinsed it off with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my eye make up, I dropped a few drops of the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil on my fingers. I rubbed it on my eyes, with eyes closed of course, then let it stand for about 30 seconds. I rinsed it off but had to repeat the procedure since there were mascara and eye liner on the sides of my eyes. After repeating the step for the second time, my eyes were completely free from the mascara and eye liner. I was happy because it didn&#x27;t irritate the area around my eyes and I didn&#x27;t have to scrub my lids to remove the eyeliner and the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really worried that the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil would leave my skin feeling oily (I already have an oily skin type) but was happy that it left my skin feeling clean and fresh. IT didn&#x27;t cause me any breakouts and didn&#x27;t clog my pores either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample to inspect, try and review. No other form of compensation was received. All opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is full of some wonderful organic products and made inn the USA. I use this cleanser on a round cotton pad. I wipe my face with the cotton pad, then rinse with warm water and pat dry. It does not leave my face greasy. It does leave my face glowing and it feels smooth and silky. I feel that this product definitely gets my face thoroughly clean. It removes all makeup and dirt leftover from the day. I really enjoy using this a night and feeling how wonderful it leaves my skin. The cleanser is very thin but your don&#x27;t need much at all so this bottle should last a very long time. It has a very light scent close to a citrus smell. It&#x27;s very faint so good for those that have problems with fragrances. I also like that this product is back with a 100% money back guarantee. So it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try this product. I definitely like it and would recommend it to help keep your face clean. I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Just used the oil. My face felt amazingly soft! I used it with Oleavine French Red Clay sponge. Absolutely love this cleanser! Smells herbal, earthy and healthy. Was a joy to use and to see the results of how soft my face feels. Review by Sherri!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the best rated cleansing oil from Japan, but decided to try this one because the price was better. Definitely recommend trying this cleansing oil!</li>
            <li> This does not work. cvs $2 makeup remover works better than this!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, removes the stingiest makeup but is still gentle.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;great product - I like that it is organic and cleans the face very&lt;br /&gt;well. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My wife has combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Feels oily on your skin&lt;br /&gt;- Made my wife break out quite bad the next morning after both times she used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Removes make up very well. She is going to use it to remove her eye make up only.</li>
            <li> This is my second review of this product.  I&#x27;ve ordered it twice so far and I am really enjoying it.  It&#x27;s very lightweight for an oil-based cleanser and it&#x27;s been effective at removing my makeup at the end of the day (I wear foundation, concealer, powder and mascara, so ALOT of makeup).  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because I have noticed that the smell can change.  It usually has a citrus-scent, which is not too weak and not too overwhelming - it&#x27;s just right!  However, this last bottle seemed to have turned a bit.  It could be because I had it for quite awhile, but either way, I would recommend the LAVO cleanser.</li>
            <li> This works very well. It takes off all my makeup including my Urban Decay eyeliner. I&#x27;ve tried several oil cleansers and this one is in my top 2.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a makeup remover/facial cleanser.  It usually required two washes to completely remove all makeup.  I used this product for about 2-3 months before figuring out that it was causing my skin to break out.  I have been using Philosophy&#x27;s Purity Made Simple for over a year and much prefer it.  It removes my makeup and cleanses my skin without over drying.</li>
            <li> The idea of using oil on my face made NO sense, but I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance on this product! It truly dissolves away makeup, rinses off completely, and leaves my skin clean and soft. I feel my skin is cleaner and clearer - yet less stripped - than with any other product. I use this at night and simply rinse my face with warm water in the morning. I definitely recommend this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love trying out different cleansing oils and luckily I have been able to try quite a few and they have all done a pretty great job at removing my makeup but some are definitely better than others.  However, because I have oily skin I still like to use a traditional cleanser to clean my face after I use the cleansing oil to remove my makeup.  Lately, I have been testing out the Deep Cleansing Oil Makeup Remover that LAVO sent me to review for my blog and I love it!  It does a really great job and stripping away all my makeup, even waterproof mascara.  That&#x27;s is what sets this cleansing oil apart from others that I have tried, not all of the take off waterproof mascara but the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil did!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also super easy to use and no scrubbing is needed.  Just massage into skin for about a minute, yes, even onto your eyes!  You will end up looking hideous with makeup smeared all over your face but just splash your face with water to emulsify the oil and use a cloth (I like to use muslin cloths from Pai) to finish washing off.  You can use this cleansing oil by itself but like I said, because I have oily skin I still choose to use my regular cleanser after I remove my makeup with the cleansing oil.&lt;br /&gt;I have compared this cleansing oil to some more well known and more expensive cleansing oils and it works just as good and in some cases better than those other brands.  So, if you are in the market for a cleansing oil the LAVO Deep Cleansing Oil is a great choice!</li>
            <li> prefer the DHC or Philosophy cleansing oil</li>
            <li> great customer service from this product, and great product. Its my first time to use Lavo, and I noticed it makes my skin smoother, and not dry out at all. Before when I used to use Shu Uemura makeup remover, I also used my facial cleanser after removing my make up. But this product, I don&#x27;t have to use facial cleanser, just one simple step. Love it. btw, my skin is a bit sensitive, but Lavo fits perfect. Planning to get one for my sister since she has a sensitive skin too. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I went by all the awesome reviews, but this product does NOT take mascara away! So disappointed and sad it is so hard to find a product that can replace Boots Botanics Oil Makeup Remover that they stopped making.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the suggestion of washing my face with oil. I have dry skin w/eczema and adult acne breakouts and this has made a huge difference in the texture and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many makeup removers and cleansers in the past and none match up to LAVO&#x27;s. Some of my other makeup removers took way too much of the product to get even just a little bit of makeup, requiring me to practically rub my skin raw. Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a makeup remover or cleanser that was oil before so this was a completely new experience for me. I can admit, I had some hesitation at first but decided to give it a try anyway. The oil itself has a very fine and thin consistency so it does not feel heavy on the skin. It also has a very sweet floral smell that isn&#x27;t too overpowering, just the right amount. I use a few drops of this oil and massage it in with my fingertips (even though you should use a cloth), this allows me to get the coverage I want and bing able to focus more on the areas that have heavier/darker makeup. Once I have massaged the oil in, I splash some water on my face and the oil works itself into a nice lather which helps cleanse my face while also removing the more stubborn makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, this product works great, a lot better than I had expected. It performed really well and out preformed all of my expectations. I love the feel of it against my skin, especially when it works into a nice frothy lather. It is extremely gentle against the skin and does not clog my pores which is another added plus. I have noticed my skin feels and looks smoother as well. It helps get rid of all my makeup, dirt, and grime from the day.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review</li>
            <li> Hi Daniel thanks for much for reaching out to me im just getting around to seeing this message, i do like this cleansing oil its so light and refreshing on the skin i have breakout prone skin and so far i have experienced no kind of skin issues with this oil and i primarily i use it for makeup removal and on a really lazy night it will suffice until in the morning when i will clean my face properly lol. I would love to try your  face mask but i have to be honest and say its a little pricey hopefully you guys will have a sale where i can get a good deal.  Have a great day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at great this cleansing oil is.  Takes off my stubborn waterproof mascara, my face makeup AND I have very oily skin and it has NOT caused any breakouts!  Use it exactly as directions note, you will be amazed at how clean your skin will be and feel softened and stay hydrated. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great cleansing oil. Light but takes off grime and makeup. I have dry skin and it is moisturizing as well.  Nice, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
            <li> it does just what it says - takes off heavy makup and leaves skin soft and clean</li>
            <li> This is a very nice lightweight oil.  It melts off makeup in seconds.</li>
            <li> So far I love the product. It leaves my skin clean but doesn&#x27;t strip it entirely of oils, which is fantastic. I also love the fact that it is made with organic materials and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals. I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve used several different cleansing oils and this is the best--no doubt!!!</li>
            <li> I was using the Tatcha facial cleanser, which I loved, until I discovered it has some questionable preservatives. Found this and so far I love it! Put it on dry skin and rub in before rinsing away with warm water. It has a slight &amp;quot;woodsy&amp;quot; smell compared to Tatcha&#x27;s more mild scent, but I love this nevertheless, and I actually think it rinses off slightly easier than Tatcha&#x27;s cleanser. All and all, I am very impressed and will re-order. Very happy about the price, too!</li>
            <li> too greasy - oily for my sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. It cleanses skin gently. I like this oil.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this wonderful make up remover and face wash I will continue to buy love love love! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Seems to work as advertised and because it&#x27;s oil based, I&#x27;m hopeful it won&#x27;t have drying effect or be a skin irritant.</li>
            <li> excellent  product&lt;br /&gt;did not irritate my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;help to relieve some of my dry winter skin this winter</li>
            <li> This is one of my first reviews but I felt compelled bc this is such a great product! Especially for the winter, although I plan to cont using through the seasons and see how it is. It is and oil, but once you put it on you face and hands with a tiny bit of water it becomes lovely and milky, It does a great job at gently removing make up, and leaves me feeling clean and not a bit oily. I will say that I do happen to have skin on the dry side, so I&#x27;m only speaking for myself.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser and makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> No problems works exactly as described. Would prefer a pop top or pump top...much easier with wet hands</li>
            <li> It works very well.  I would recommend to other people.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Mary Kay product for 25 years and it was discontinued, so I decided to try this. My skin is a combination of oily and dry. I love this oil. It does not make my skin feel oily at all, it feels fresh and hydrated. I use a bit on a cotton circle, rub oil over my face and then water. It does have a light creamy feel. I don&#x27;t actually smell any scent when it is on my face, and I am sensitive to fragrances. I bought the toner to go with it but I don&#x27;t use the toner much at all.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service!</li>
            <li> I was looking primarily for a mascara remover and wanted something with nice healthy, organic ingredients.  After all, I was going to be using it on my eyes!  I&#x27;ve been a happy customer of Tarte&#x27;s maracuja Fresh Eyes wipes, but those little guys are spendy and I was looking for an alternative.  The idea of using oil for cleansing my face simply never occurred to me.  (I&#x27;ve since learned that it&#x27;s been a growing trend for the past 5 or 6 years.  Doh!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the LAVO arrived, my first thought was that I wished it was in a pump bottle, but the bottle it&#x27;s in actually works really well, dispensing a few drops at a time.  I read and followed the directions carefully and thought it was kind of cool that a separate email had come from Daniel Kang, the CEO of LAVO, with tips for the product&#x27;s use.  So...I have to say that the first few times I used the LAVO oil, I was underwhelmed.  It just did not seem to be removing my mascara (which isn&#x27;t even waterproof).  I responded to the Daniel Kang instructions email, explaining what was happening and why I wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.  The customer service I received, and the speed with which it came, was simply amazing.  This guy stands behind his product.  He offered a full refund, which I hadn&#x27;t even requested.  So...I decided to keep trying and after a few more smeary sessions, was able to figure out what technique works for me.  And sure enough, my mascara is now easily removed, my skin feels clean and soft, and I am a believer in LAVO products!</li>
            <li> WOW I have been blown away by the efficacy of this product. I wear heavy makeup for long hours at work and I&#x27;ve used makeup remover pads, oils, cloths but nothing compares to this stuff. I expected oily residue and to have to come in with a cotton pad to scrub away the hard to get makeup around my eyes and nose. No way did LAVO leave any makeup behind! I just tilt my head back and squeeze a bunch of drops out onto my face and begin rubbing by face with my hands. It&#x27;s a little weird to get used to but honestly I will never go back! The makeup softly melts away and when you wash it off (warm water really works best) it magically turns milky and washes away everything. Sometimes I&#x27;ll do a second round when I wear lots of eyeshadow or especially waterproof liquid eyeliner (that otherwise stays on for days yuck!) but the whole experience is so luxurious and best of all it works like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before. I LOVE not having to use extra cotton pads or towlettes- so wasteful! I think the price is fair considering how tiny an amount you need (5-10 drops). After the first use my mom, without knowing I bought this, asked what I used because my skin actually looked so clean and vibrant. I am white with medium-oily fair skin and have noticed a considerable reduction in breakouts due to makeup clogging and infecting my skin during the night. If you are ready to revolutionize your makeup remover routine and you have 2 hands and a sink this is ALL you need!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Takes off all my makeup including mascara and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Very nice cleanser and quick delivery, very happy all around.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because I&#x27;ve never used an oil based cleanser before.  I will be upfront when I say I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. It&#x27;s is a yellow oil (appears almost clear when dispensed).  It has a scent I cannot really put my finger on but would describe as earthy.  While not overpowering, it isn&#x27;t light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pro of this Deep Cleansing Oil is that it did not strip my skin or irritate it at all.  I have dry, sensitive skin as well as rosacea and have to be very careful about cleansers as they often strip natural oils from my skin and leave it feeling tight, dry, and irritated. This cleaned off all of my makeup minus the remnants of my waterproof mascara. This hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores either so that is a huge plus.  This would be a good cleanser for the drier months of the year as it was very gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons I would say are 1. Even after using an eyemakeup remover this still didn&#x27;t break down the little mascara left behind. I had to wet a q-tip to get under my eyes and get the rest off.  2. This did burn my eyes a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neutral thing is I could still feel the oil on my face even after rinsing.  I do not know if this is good because it was probably providing some extra moisture to my skin; or if it was bad that it didn&#x27;t rinse off and was just sitting there like the remnants of my mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me but just know this does leave your face feeling like some of the product is left behind even after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel for the price you get a decent amount because you do not need a lot at once- a dime to nickle size.  I received this free to try out in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Great cleansing oil for face. Gets off even my waterproof black mascara. Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes or cause facial breakouts.  I use the cleansing oil to make my own sugar scrub for my body. Love it&#x27;s all natural. My 2nd purchase of this &amp; will keep buying. One thing that would make it better would be a pump</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of long-wearing and waterproof makeup, so a cleansing oil is an essential part of my makeup removal routine. I greatly prefer this to other oils I&#x27;ve tried in the past. In addition to the oil that breaks down the layers of makeup, this also turns into a milky cleanser when water is added. This makes things so much easier! This product has become a staple in my daily routine. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face without over drying but doesn&#x27;t at all feel greasy or oily.  My skin looks nice and healthy, no irritation.  I also like that its not full of strange chemicals.  It doesn&#x27;t take off my mascara or eyeliner very well compared to something like Bobbie Brown&#x27;s eye makeup remover, but then its focus is facial cleansing not makeup removal.  I&#x27;ve been using just this and tamanu oil on my 39-year old face for a couple of months now and I can see that any lines and pores are much smaller (about half) and my skin stays nice and soft despite my lack of wearing sunscreen when I go walking/running.</li>
            <li> Love the cleansing oil. Cruelty-free and even better than Shu Eumura.</li>
            <li> The Lavo cleansing oil is yellow in color and came in a clear bottle with no label on it for some reason. These are my better halfâ€™s observations of the oil. From all the products that she has tried from Lavo, this cleansing oil is the only one that she didnâ€™t like at all. It doesnâ€™t foam up much at all even with added water. She tried the oil as both a cleanser and as a makeup remover. She found that it burns the eyes each time she has tried this product. As a cleanser this also left her skin feeling oily and felt that it didnâ€™t clean the skin well and felt it clogged pores instead. She feels it is too harsh on the skin as both a cleanser and as a makeup remover which is unfortunate as she likes Lavoâ€™s other products. Since she didnâ€™t like it, I decided to try it as well as a facial cleanser for my skin. It was ok as a facial cleanser for my face but I didnâ€™t like it as much as other face cleansers for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works fast and is really good at getting off waterproof mascara without stinging in the eyes or having to rub your eyes for a long time. Will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a super nice cleansing oil and therefore, I&#x27;m a repeat customer on my third bottle.  I primarily bought it because it is organic and the price is very good, but I find that it cleanses well, rinses beautifully and leaves no residue.  It dissolves eye make up in seconds with little effort.   A small amount is sufficient to get my face make up free and clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It cleans really good n leaves my skin feeling great!!!</li>
            <li> Very good cleaning agent.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff.  Just learned about oil cleansing ... this is perfect, not too oily (washes off cleanly, no oily residue) and really cleans without stripping.  My face feels clean and soft afterwards.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love love love! The smell is very subtle but pleasent, it feels very natural and moisterizing while massaging your face which is very soothing, even before applying water you can see all the make up and sunscreencoming off, and once you add water it becomes milky while still feeling moisterizing and soothing! It took me a lot of time and research to find a make up remover/pre-cleanser (as I use it to remove make up and follow with a cleanser to get my skin extra clean although I am sure by it self its cleaning everything off), after months of research, trying many products and wasting a lot of money I am so glad to have found a make up remover that is natural and safe to use while being so effective and moisterizing which is very important for me as I suffer of rocesea/Ezcema, this product has kept my skin calmed and hasn&#x27;t triggered any irritations which is very hard for me to achieve since my skin is so sensitive and reacts to almost everything!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making this product! Keep it up!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to have found my go to make up remover and feel safe about what I am putting on my skin since I now have almost 100% all natural and organic products!</li>
            <li> I really did not expect to like this oil as much as I do.  I had been using cleaning towelettes and felt like they were drying my skin out and not cleaning my skin well.  I followed the directions for how to use and I am very pleased.  My skin is cleaner and feels very soft.  I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to remove make up and also hydrate my skin.  It works very well on both fronts and the day after massaging my face with this oil, I could see a noticeable difference.  My skin was still dewey (even though I had used soap the morning after to cleanse) and fine lines were less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love that it cleans my face and takes off my makeup (even if it&#x27;s waterproof). I do use my cleanser afterward because water is not enough to get rid of the oiliness. I just take off the makeup with this and go straight to shower. My skin is sensitive and breaks out easily but this oil makeup remover doesn&#x27;t make my skin irritated or breakout.</li>
            <li> Thinner than DHC so it spreads more.  Washes clean with no oily film left on face.  Cleans good, takes off my waterproof mascara.  I especially like the ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial cleansing oil for several weeks and have seen a tremendous improvement in my winter-dry skin. I started using facial oils a little over a year ago and have been a real convert ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I l just love is that LAVO is especially gentle. And, my skin feels (and is) very clean after washing, not greasy. But now it&#x27;s SO SOFT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way and I can see this this bottle will last for a few months, even though I use it religiously twice day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT Product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way here and this is terrific for getting off makeup and making your skin silky smooth. I use this with my facial brush system and it gets off 99% of my foundation and mascara, the rest o nust pat off with a towel afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a nice light citrus smell and i have had no ill effects from it such as breakouts.i use a moisturizer after and i love the way my skin feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - i recieved this item in exchange for an Honest review</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this oil cleanser.  I have tried the pricier brands and was hoping this would do the same thing for less.  I was wrong.  This cleanser was very messy once you added the water to emulsify it.  It does not clean nearly as well as the more expensive brands and I had to use an additional cleanser afterwards, which defeats the entire purpose..  I guess I will stick to my favorite, DHC; it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for in most cases.</li>
            <li> Excellent hydrating and moisturizing cleanser. I went on a limb to try this cleanser and I&#x27;m glad I did. I was specifically because I&#x27;ve bought so many products that never seem to  live up to their claims... And figured this is just another plastic bottle of serum that would end up in the back of the cabinet, along with the others. But to my surprise, it really works. I&#x27;ve fought with very dry skin, which we know makes you look older than you are.  If you&#x27;re struggling with dry skin, I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should be releasing a toner and moisturizer in the near future. I can&#x27;t wait to add that to my daily regiment. Finally, something that really works. Thank you LAVO!  ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft and clean. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Really great cleansing oil.  No extra junk in it!</li>
            <li> I have used Origins cleansing oil prior to buying this.  I bought this because it was a cheaper option.  I started experiencing breakouts while using this.  I am not sure if it the Georgia pollen or the Lavo itself.</li>
            <li> So okay this product is a makeup remover, and face cleanser, but you know what!? I used it to clean my makeup brushes as well and it worked, very well in fact! I have a really good brush cleaner already but this worked even better because it rinsed a lot faster then the other stuff I use. Now I will say I was concerned about using this on my face as a cleanser because honestly, its oily! The fact is that it comes off easily with just water of course being used as a skin cleanser and does leave your face feeling very moisturized but not oily at all! Also as a makeup remover it works a lot better than the brand I have been using, which was also an oil based makeup remover. It even works very well on the eye makeup which for me has always been a pain to remove, going through three cotton rounds per eye sometimes! With LAVO I only needed one pad per eye!&lt;br /&gt;Oh also, I am in love with the way this stuff smells but that is no shock considering the ingredients! Lovely, just lovely.</li>
            <li> Love this. Lightweight, fragrance free (? or barely fragranced?) oil. Rinses clean and easy without trouble. I&#x27;ve been a fan of DHC in the past, this is a better buy. The oil is thinner, therefore easier to rub in. So far I am getting good results, I use it with the Lavo Facial Brush which I bought at the same time.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! When I was sent this product to review I was a little scared it would leave my face oily after using. But their is no oily residue left behind and it even takes eye makeup off! It also does not irritate my skin which is a big plus and I don&#x27;t have to use moisturizer after using! Love it!</li>
            <li> Like this product!  Great cleanser that leaves my skin soft.  Much less costly then the DHC oil I was using and I think this works better</li>
            <li> I used Mary Kay cleansing cream for years. It was discontinued which is good because I discovered it was filled with dangerous chemicals and actual known carcinogens.  I have very sensitive skin; especially around the eyes and my eyes burn easily.&lt;br /&gt;This sent me on a quest to find something that removes make-up, ALL make-up including waterproof eye, without rubbing and that leaves my skin clean but doesn&#x27;t dry or clog pores.  I tried at least 12 different cleansers trying to find the right one.  Well, I found it!!&lt;br /&gt;I can NOT say enough about Lavo.  The ingredients are natural and it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;I put a dime size in my hand and I massage it using my fingertips all over my face, focusing on my eye make-up.  It removes every bit of mascara.  I rinse with warm water and it rinses clean with no oily residue and no left-over make up.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS my new cleanser.  I am a fan of HOW it cleans make-up and removes mascara and I am a bigger fan of the ingredient list.  All natural and no carcinogens.&lt;br /&gt;I love this cleanser and I love the ingredients!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are far better than DHC and it&#x27;s cheaper too</li>
            <li> Great cleanser.  So far have used it every day and have had no reactions.  My skin is very sensitive and if I develop an allergy it takes a week.  Very happy with this product and also happy it is made in the USA.  Trying to buy USA whenever possible and glad this product has been so successful for me.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This is the second product from LAVO I have tried - the first was a skincare product, this one is a cleansing makeup remover.  I don&#x27;t use a lot of makeup, mostly foundation but it is difficult to clean off my face even after showering.  So I tried this in the shower and I found that it really made my face clean and it felt so refreshed.  The fact that it is all organic and natural makes it so much better because I know I am getting the best for my skin.  It really has helped me with my acne problem as well because it cleans the pores out.  I love the color and fragrance of the cleanser and it is a huge bottle at 6 oz for just $19.97.  You can use this with your washrag or you can use a pouf, I have found that the pouf works better because it exfoliates your skin to remove the dead skin cells while it is cleaning :)  Definitely recommend this product, hop over to Amazon and grab a bottle.  Check out LAVOs other products while you are there!  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> Very silky smooth. Takes off all traces of make up and leaves your skin so soft. I have very oily skin but it 100% did not make my face greasy</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a cheaper alternative to dermalogica&#x27;s precleanse. I am a fan of oil cleansing and I think it is the best way to remove makeup and sunscreen. However this brand does not rinse off very well and leaves a residue. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I never thought an Oil as a facial cleanser would be a smart idea..... boy was I wrong! Now, it doesn&#x27;t fully remove all my makeup, but it does remove it. It isn&#x27;t too much for my sensitive skin, I can say though that if you get it too close to your eyes, it does sting from the scent. That goes away after a couple of seconds. It does have a very light scent, and lathers up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: If you don&#x27;t use this fast enough, it will start to separate or develop some soapy looking residue on the bottom and, it can not be remixed.</li>
            <li> This stuff too strong, oh my god!! my face iching, sore, all rashes, this is not for sensitive skin, seriously  very careful !!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in place of my beloved DHC deep cleansing oil which i&#x27;ve used for years. I decided to purchase this because of the great reviews and the price was $10 cheaper than dhc. I followed the directions thoroughly and I felt as though this left my face with a slight greasy film which I hate. I have to double cleanse afterwards and tone to get it off. Thankfully I have no breakouts so i will use it until it finishes but I will be going back to dhc</li>
            <li> I bought this oil and was hoping it will do what it claims. However, this particular bottle was either old or near to expire. It left my face extremely dry with small pimples, and the smell itself indicate that it&#x27;s old as it was not fresh.</li>
            <li> I have combination, sensitive and acne prone skin. I. Also 30 years old and wear makeup daily. I wanted a natural, ideally organic, makeup remover/cleanser that could take off waterproof makeup without stinging my skin or drying me out. I have used Lavo for about a week or more now and have been very pleased. It cleanses very well and leaves my face supple and soft. I previously used Garnier cleansing oil and found I had to follow it with a regular cleanser. This isn&#x27;t the case with Lavo. Because I like to wear a lot of makeup, I use a generous amount to cleanse (three small squirts); however, when I cleanse in the morning when I have no makeup on, I use a nickel size and it is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issues I have are the product i s a bit pricey for its size and the bottle would benefit from a pump dispenser. CEO Daniel Kang provided personal customer service and upon hearing that, informed that they had tried a pump dispenser but it would leak during delivery and so he&#x27;s in the process of finding an alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years for an all natural product to replace my DHC deep cleansing oil. I have finally found it! This product cleans without drying, without leaving a greasy feeling, and without all those added chemicals.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleansing oil! The texture, scent and feel on my skin is wonderful and the price point is incredible. It removes all of my makeup and does not leave a residue or cause any eye irritation.  I will definitely purchase again and look forward to purchasing other products from this fabulous brand!</li>
            <li> It works very well. The only thing that would make it better is a pump dispenser bottle.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> The oil smells great but after a few times of using it, I developed really bad rush around my eyes. I discontinued for a few days and tried it last night again - same effect. I woke up with red bumps around my eyes :-(((</li>
