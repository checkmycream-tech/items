            <li>B00365YY62 Kukui Nut Skin and Hair Care- Sampler - Gift - Travel Set - Oils of Aloha]]The Oils of Aloha Hawaiian Kukui Nut cream is one of my favorite skin products after finding it on a trip to Maui.</li>

            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I hope they never change the formula, like so many manufacturers do.</li>
            <li>I do not blister at all when using the Kukui moisturizing cream, love it and have ordered it every summer since.  </li>
            <li>I used this product on my sensitive skin and it was great.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and refreshing -- not overpowering.</li>
            <li>If you sunburn easily, then you NEED this cream.</li>
            <li>It rubs in smoothly and isn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li>Fabulous cream.</li>
            <li>It leaves one feeling refreshed &amp; hands and elbows smooth.</li>
            <li>I love it and the fresh scent is so cooling.  </li>
            <li>It has healing properties and is light and quickly absorbed by your skin, so no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer for my face, I have mild rosacea and this helps.  </li>
            <li>Shipment was quick.</li>
            <li>The cream is light, leaving my skin soft and smooth -- not sticky!</li>
            <li>Great product, works well on dry skin, first bought in Hawaii</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very moisturized and smooth</li>
            <li>Just Okay as far as moisturizers go.</li>
            <li>wish I knew how this stuff worked, and I am surprised that more people don&#x27;t know about this life-saving lotion.</li>
            <li>my skin felt cool, smooth, and soft.  </li>
            <li>BUT the smell was pretty off.</li>
            <li>Hot and burning went looking for relief.  </li>
            <li>From the first time i used the cream</li>
            <li>I was so excited about trying this product for the benefits of the natural oils it contains.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product when i visited Maui, Hawaii and had too much sun.  </li>
            <li>It is a light, non greasy cream and has a nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of extremely dry, scaly patches that nothing has been able to help until now.</li>
            <li>I have also tried the fragrance free, but I actually prefer this</li>
            <li>My wife really loves this product.</li>
            <li>thanks for letting me have the chance to review this product.</li>
            <li>I expect to buy more in the near future.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and figured the lines I was developing were just part of growing older.</li>
            <li>I then used it the whole summer and the following summer after returning home needed more as the hot Indiana sun tends to make a persons skin dry and blister.  </li>
            <li>I apply maybe 1-2 more coats of this kukui cream during the next day and by the following morning, I am HEALED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If this is normal it makes the product even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First tried it while on vacation in Maui, several yeaars ago,and returned home with 4 jars.  </li>
            <li>The price is equivilent to any other high quality product so depending on how much you are willing to spend for something that works, I would recommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever like to be without this cream, since my sensitive skin needs care after sun and garden</li>
            <li>I will most likely return this product because I don&#x27;t think I can get past the smell lingering on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not thick enough.</li>
            <li>It really does work on dry skin and scaly patches.  </li>
            <li>for the product itself, I went ahead and used it sparingly on my face and will say I noticed about an hour later that it left my skin very soft.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, from the immediate opening of the jar the smell is quite unappealing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have spent 27 miserable summers without this miracle</li>
            <li> Then go to bed, be miserable and stick to the sheets with this painful burn only to wake up in the morning even redder than I was before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly shocked to see that this product helped reduce those lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> have returned this product, I am very disappointed in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> A very good and soothing cream.  I use it as a moisturizer for my face, I have mild rosacea and this helps.  Being from the Hawaiian Islands, I believe in the medicinal qualities of the kukui nut along with the macadamia nut oil also.  It is a light, non greasy cream and has a nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of extremely dry, scaly patches that nothing has been able to help until now. I&#x27;ve tried Aquaphor and a wide variety of lotions and creams. Two days of using kukui moisturizing cream has restored the patches to baby-bum smoothness. And it smells great, a light and fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about trying this product for the benefits of the natural oils it contains. Unfortunately, from the immediate opening of the jar the smell is quite unappealing. When you think of Hawaiian aromas they are fragrant, flowering and quite appealing however, this product smells more like a nasty body or foot odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I went ahead and used it sparingly on my face and will say I noticed about an hour later that it left my skin very soft. I will most likely return this product because I don&#x27;t think I can get past the smell lingering on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  August 30, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should have returned this product, I am very disappointed in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought since I kept it I would try to use it and today makes the 3rd time. The fragrance still offends my nose. Worse than the smell is when I apply this cream and it absorbs into the skin a white, gritty substance starts to appear on the surface so much so that I have to get a towel and brush it off. If this is normal it makes the product even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a sticker on the bottom of the jar that reads \\&quot;Best by March 2014\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know if this was put on the jar at the factory or by this seller on Amazon. I&#x27;m wondering if the cream is old and beginning to break down causing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my skin feels moisturized after using it I will give this product an overall grade of...D+</li>

            <li> I tried this cream while vacationing in Hawaii and loved it!  It really does work on dry skin and scaly patches.

The price is equivilent to any other high quality product so depending on how much you are willing to spend for something that works, I would recommend giving this a try.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using kukui nut oil from Oils of Aloha for about 7 years. I have very oily skin and figured the lines I was developing were just part of growing older. I was pleasantly shocked to see that this product helped reduce those lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Shipment was quick. I very much love the moisturizer. It works great on my skin. I expect to buy more in the near future.</li>
            <li> If you sunburn easily, then you NEED this cream. I can&#x27;t believe I have spent 27 miserable summers without this miracle cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will literally take away the redness from your sunburn within 24 to 36 hours.&lt;br /&gt;In the past I would get pink, apply some &amp;#34;after sun lotion&amp;#34; or aloe vera and get all sticky. Then go to bed, be miserable and stick to the sheets with this painful burn only to wake up in the morning even redder than I was before going to bed. The redness would last about 2 to 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after a day at the beach or pool if I notice I am a little pink, I apply this cream before going to bed.

            <li> Fabulous cream. The best body cream I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my sensitive skin and it was great. BUT the smell was pretty off. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing cream, my skin just drinks it in!</li>
            <li> only down fall pricing keeps going up. Great product, works well on dry skin, first bought in Hawaii glad I found some more.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and discovered this cream in Hawaii a few years ago.  It works great on my face and neck where I shouldn&#x27;t be putting any cortisone product.  My sister says my skin is so beautiful so I am now buying it for her too.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell and the cream was like liquid.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again for the price I paid.  Not thick enough.</li>
            <li> it is very good. very pleased with results.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for Eczema and Rosacea.  My son has eczema on his arms and I rub a little bit on each day and it went away in a few weeks.  Works much better then the cream the doctor prescribed to him.  I use it on my face every night for my rosacea and it works as a moisturer as well.  I would totally recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Found this product when went to Hawaii this past May. So glad to be able to find it on line. Love everything about this product</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very moisturized and smooth</li>
            <li> Love this cream. It leaves one feeling refreshed &amp; hands and elbows smooth. Have used it for about 5 years and it keeps my eczema at bay.</li>
            <li> My wife really loves this product. We usually purchase it in Hawaii, but this year we ran out .Mahalo, or thank you in Hawaiian..</li>
            <li> I bought this product on vacation last year, because I got a sunburn and needed something for it. I had purchased another fragrance at the time. When my jar was low, I ordered this scent and I&#x27;m thrilled! The fragrance is light and refreshing -- not overpowering. The cream is light, leaving my skin soft and smooth -- not sticky! It feels great, even hours after use.&lt;br /&gt;I use Kukui Cream all over - face, hands, feet, legs - you name it! I love this product. I hope they never change the formula, like so many manufacturers do. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that I could use every day, and at night. This is it! Sold!</li>
            <li> Great for sunburn, eczema and burn from cooking!</li>
            <li> I first purchased this product when i visited Maui, Hawaii and had too much sun.  Hot and burning went looking for relief.  Found Kukui Cream and also found that i could get it on line when i returned home.  From the first time i used the cream my skin felt cool, smooth, and soft.  I then used it the whole summer and the following summer after returning home needed more as the hot Indiana sun tends to make a persons skin dry and blister.  I do not blister at all when using the Kukui moisturizing cream, love it and have ordered it every summer since.  I love it and the fresh scent is so cooling.  thanks for letting me have the chance to review this product.</li>
