            <li>Great product, shipped on time:-)</li>
            <li>I use this for bonding weft hair to hair tape when making my own &#x27;skin&#x27; or &#x27;tape&#x27; extensions.</li>
            <li>Loved it &amp; I&#x27;m Going to buy more.</li>
            <li>i was sure this would work amazingly</li>
            <li>Wow what a great glue!</li>
            <li>not so Liquid Gold by far is the best on the market for holding.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Make sure you put a piece of paper under it while its being used.</li>
            <li>Feel free to contact me if you&#x27;d like to know how to make your own hair extensions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard many good things about this glue but for me it hasn&#x27;t healed up very well.</li>
            <li>It removed easily with baby oil.</li>
            <li>but hopefully that will be easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it is easy to put on my extensions</li>
            <li>easy to use and easy to remove</li>
            <li>Super sticky!  </li>
            <li>Will not be using glue of any kind on my real hair.</li>
            <li>My full lace wig holds for weeks or longer.</li>
            <li>I am new to bonding hair to my head, but this is VERY strong stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like the product I have use a lot of different products that were supposed to be a good bonding glue however</li>
            <li>The heat activates this Glue to make an extremely strong seamless tape in extension that does not come apart.</li>
            <li>but the glue got pretty gooey.</li>
            <li>Would love to get my money back!</li>
            <li>it holds very well and doesn&#x27;t seep through the cap.</li>
            <li>but it didnt really do</li>
            <li>It went straight to where I wanted to go.</li>
            <li>Works really well...</li>
            <li>Works really well, lasts long and easy to remove without breakage.</li>
            <li>It can be very very messy though, so make sure when you do get it you get it in the tube with the needle nose applicator, and not the brush on type.</li>
            <li>I use this product in making seamless tape in hair extensions.  </li>
            <li>it really holds the only thing is that its really sticky and hard to get off unless you have the remover stuff for iy</li>
            <li>keeps em in real tight till then but the reviews saying it last DAYS and MULTIPLE washes doesnt seem like thats exactly true</li>

            <li> Compared to a couple other adhesives I&#x27;m trying out, this holds the longest so far and holds tightest.</li>
            <li> Then just apply heat to the tape/glue using your flat iron.</li>
            <li> a whole let better than the stupid elmers like glue</li>
            <li> They usually slip and release after the first shampoo when you use that way; but for making seamless weft hair extensions for tape in application, there is not a better product out there.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use this product a few times to just Glue weft extensions directly to hair, but this does not work so well even though I believe that is specifically what this product is sold for.</li>
            <li> very strong, long lasting adhesive, but has tendency to harden after a few uses making it difficult to apply glue, can be very messy and stick to/harden on counter tops.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li> it starts coming out just like other glues.</li>
            <li> I apply it to the hair Wefting tape before I stick the hair weft to it, and then I put another line of it on of the other side and sandwich the hair in between the two strips of tape.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it&#x27;s very messy.  </li>
            <li> Once you squeeze the tube it continues to come out even after setting it down.  </li>
            <li> It was very hard to get out of my hair, but that&#x27;s probably because I messed up on the placement and had to get it taken out the next day.  </li>
            <li> ive always used and hated it stays in the same and ther moment</li>
            <li> Awful, isn&#x27;t any stronger than any other bonding glue.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this on a dome cap in order to place my tracks for a u-part wig. it holds very well and doesn&#x27;t seep through the cap. When I use latex glue, it would seep through the cap and make my scalp itch. not the case with this product. It&#x27;s a keeper</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even hold for one day.</li>
            <li> I use this for bonding weft hair to hair tape when making my own &#x27;skin&#x27; or &#x27;tape&#x27; extensions.</li>
            <li> the reviews were so good i was sure this would work amazingly but it didnt really do a whole let better than the stupid elmers like glue ive always used and hated it stays in the same and ther moment u wash ur hair it starts coming out just like other glues. keeps em in real tight till then but the reviews saying it last DAYS and MULTIPLE washes doesnt seem like thats exactly true</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than latex, but the hold isn&#x27;t a great as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I am new to bonding hair to my head, but this is VERY strong stuff. Compared to a couple other adhesives I&#x27;m trying out, this holds the longest so far and holds tightest. It removed easily with baby oil.</li>
            <li> It went straight to where I wanted to go. it is not enough oz&#x27;s tho. it is great!!!! keep up the good work</li>
            <li> I liked the usage of this product! It served the purpose and was easy to work with!! I&#x27;d use it again and buy it in the future!!  :)</li>
            <li> Wow what a great glue!</li>
            <li> Only use this glue to bond my tape to my extensions. It works great. Will not be using glue of any kind on my real hair.</li>
            <li> very strong, long lasting adhesive, but has tendency to harden after a few uses making it difficult to apply glue, can be very messy and stick to/harden on counter tops. probably apply glue on wefts over newspaper or disposable towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard many good things about this glue but for me it hasn&#x27;t healed up very well. I used it on a weft and that fell out after one wash. I also used it on feather extensions and they stayed in longer but the glue got pretty gooey. Haven&#x27;t tried removing it but hopefully that will be easy.</li>
            <li> Super sticky!  It was very hard to get out of my hair, but that&#x27;s probably because I messed up on the placement and had to get it taken out the next day.  It would probably last for a month or two without a problem.  The only downside is that it&#x27;s very messy.  Once you squeeze the tube it continues to come out even after setting it down.  Make sure you put a piece of paper under it while its being used.</li>
            <li> Awful, isn&#x27;t any stronger than any other bonding glue. This one just burns your scalp.</li>
            <li> Great product, shipped on time:-)</li>
            <li> I really like the product I have use a lot of different products that were supposed to be a good bonding glue however not so Liquid Gold by far is the best on the market for holding. My full lace wig holds for weeks or longer. I do have problems with the back holding and I need your help( around the neck line) to tell me what to do to add extra hold</li>
            <li> Great stuff it really holds the only thing is that its really sticky and hard to get off unless you have the remover stuff for iy</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hold for 24 hours on blonde hair. Would not recommend on platinum blonde hair. Would love to get my money back!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It can be very very messy though, so make sure when you do get it you get it in the tube with the needle nose applicator, and not the brush on type. I use this product in making seamless tape in hair extensions.  I apply it to the hair Wefting tape before I stick the hair weft to it, and then I put another line of it on of the other side and sandwich the hair in between the two strips of tape. Then just apply heat to the tape/glue using your flat iron. It only takes a few seconds. The heat activates this Glue to make an extremely strong seamless tape in extension that does not come apart. This product is absolutely ideal for that. You can use it to create taped in hair extensions that last for multiple installs. I have tried to use this product a few times to just Glue weft extensions directly to hair, but this does not work so well even though I believe that is specifically what this product is sold for. They usually slip and release after the first shampoo when you use that way; but for making seamless weft hair extensions for tape in application, there is not a better product out there. Feel free to contact me if you&#x27;d like to know how to make your own hair extensions.</li>
            <li> excellent, first time buying this in tube, excellent for touch ups</li>
            <li> Loved it &amp; I&#x27;m Going to buy more. Best glue I&#x27;ve used it is easy to put on my extensions</li>
            <li> easy to use and easy to remove</li>
            <li> Works really well...I will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> Works really well, lasts long and easy to remove without breakage.</li>
