    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I purchased these eyebrow shapes to have the perfect eyebrows</li>
            <li>so you get the best out of the shape(s).</li>
            <li>I am very happy with these stencils.</li>
            <li>both combined &amp; I have great looking brows.</li>
            <li>Although this product wasn&#x27;t mine, the seller did a great job with the service.&lt;br /&gt;Received as advertised.</li>
            <li>Worked very nice, I&#x27;m helping myself get my eyebrows even</li>
            <li>but it works really good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my friend is happy, otherwise I would have heard something</li>
            <li>and i love the stencils!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>These stencils are nice.</li>
            <li>Also the range of shapes are not the best - they could offer longer ones and bushier ones as the options given are on the dainty (small brow) side.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I would suggest for you to buy if you like the shapes, also make sure you let your eyebrows grow in a bit before you use</li>
            <li>Make sure you know how to place them before you try to use them.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer has said this is ok to use as a guide for where to pluck/trim your brows</li>
            <li>but it could be better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it</li>
            <li>I think ELF is better, but for the price its okay</li>
            <li>love it the item has helped me shorten the time to doing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>glad I purchased the item.</li>
            <li>They come with instructions on how to line them up, but you can find more detailed information on the internet, and in videos on youtube.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use with eyebrow pencils.</li>
            <li>and I can measure them really accurately.</li>
            <li>THIS SELLER IS NOT GIVING YOU THE WHOLE STORY!!!</li>
            <li>THIS SELLER IS NOT GIVING YOU THE WHOLE STORY!!!</li>
            <li>The stencils are reusable and you can wipe them clean.</li>
            <li>Again, I wouldn&#x27;t have minded - it would have been nice to have been able to order extra sets of the stencils without the powders, but not disclosing it in the advertising</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just recently gotten into this phase of using stencils to outline and accentuate my eyebrows, so I was trying a number of products to expand the range of what I thought might work and what could do a good job.</li>
            <li>so it was worth the purchase</li>
            <li>I like the product, came faster than expected, good quality.</li>
            <li>I found the one that was right for me</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that you cannot use a brow pencil with this stencil, it will slice right through it.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s because I obviously need more practice and have never used stencils before.</li>
            <li>umm the delivery was fast</li>
            <li>but i dont really like it</li>
            <li>I really do recommend these stencils.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product because it showed me different ways to possibly shape my eyebrow.  </li>
            <li>and hey, they&#x27;re stamped from the same imprint machine and named the same kind of brow arch.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to clean and come in a little pocket/holder so I won&#x27;t lose them!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, but it did not work for me ~</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Christian comestics for years and love it, but I want to add new style for but this product doesn&#x27;t hold to the Christian stencils that I have.</li>
            <li>I really only like the one with the highest arch, and I messed up my eyebrows the first day I got them!</li>
            <li>The description seemed to fit right along with the other items I was trying, so I invested in two \\&quot;sets\\&quot; of five; I always like to have a double set on hand - one for my purse, one for at home.</li>
            <li>It has helped me define a new and pleasing shape for plucking (as I was struggling to just wing it myself)</li>
            <li>i was there where more small ones</li>
            <li>Also, I can shade how dark or light</li>
            <li>And the \\&quot;wallet\\&quot; is just cheap; a black piece of plastic with a clear front to show you your stencils within.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have minded so much, if I had been told that in the actual advertising.</li>
            <li>Whomever wrote this should go back to the drawing board and start again, reading a course in ethical advertising.</li>
            <li>The only difference is a cheap plastic black \\&quot;wallet\\&quot; to keep the stencils in.</li>
            <li>They kinda big but other than tht its cool.</li>
            <li>Its a useless cheap piece of plastic that wont fit your face since its tiny and would work on a 2 years old only!</li>
            <li>They are small enough to fit in a cosmetic case.</li>
            <li>Nice shapes for eyebrows but no colouring provided for shading in the eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Please make up a complete kit with proper directions and instructions on usage.&lt;br /&gt;Could not use it and was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Wasted my money and postage too expensive.</li>
            <li>This is basically the EXACT set of stencils you get with the Christian Eyebrow sets, minus the actual brow brush and color.</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s not exactly the easiest placement for using it as intended.</li>
            <li> but if you like think eyebrows than this is for you i dont like mean big</li>
            <li> Just type in \\&quot;using eyebrow stencils\\&quot; ....you could really mess up your eyebrows otherwise.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> but I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> and I tried it once, threw it away and realized it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Could no longer see my usual lady to get the brows done.  </li>
            <li> They worked for an amateur like me.</li>
            <li> These are definitely NOT for people with very thin brows.</li>
            <li> It was hard for me to use</li>
            <li> To hard to hold and draw eyebrows</li>
            <li> just rings a little false with me.</li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;ve held the stencils up against one another</li>
            <li> I usually choose peaked or dramatic and i also bought an eyebrow kit so i can fill in some color,</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I found the product to be too expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because i wanted to get some for quite awhile and i love the stencils! I usually choose peaked or dramatic and i also bought an eyebrow kit so i can fill in some color, both combined &amp; I have great looking brows.</li>
            <li> My schedule changed at work...Could no longer see my usual lady to get the brows done.  These definitely help a LOT.  Love them.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it did not work for me ~ Very frustrating trying to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m missing one piece of the item and the stencils material are too soft to stay in place. I&#x27;ve been using the Christian comestics for years and love it, but I want to add new style for but this product doesn&#x27;t hold to the Christian stencils that I have.</li>
            <li> These stencils are nice. I use them everyday. They are easy to use with eyebrow pencils. They are small enough to fit in a cosmetic case.</li>
            <li> I purchased these eyebrow shapes to have the perfect eyebrows but I wasted my money.  They are extremely small probably would work well on a child but not an adult.  A total waste of money please do not purchase this regret.</li>
            <li> I really only like the one with the highest arch, and I messed up my eyebrows the first day I got them! But that&#x27;s because I obviously need more practice and have never used stencils before. I would suggest for you to buy if you like the shapes, also make sure you let your eyebrows grow in a bit before you use so you get the best out of the shape(s). They&#x27;re easy to clean and come in a little pocket/holder so I won&#x27;t lose them! Love them!</li>
            <li> umm the delivery was fast but i dont really like it theres only 2 that i like from this but if you like think eyebrows than this is for you i dont like mean big but it works really good i was there where more small ones</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these stencils. Make sure you know how to place them before you try to use them. They come with instructions on how to line them up, but you can find more detailed information on the internet, and in videos on youtube. Just type in \\&quot;using eyebrow stencils\\&quot; ....you could really mess up your eyebrows otherwise. These are definitely NOT for people with very thin brows.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer has said this is ok to use as a guide for where to pluck/trim your brows but it&#x27;s not exactly the easiest placement for using it as intended. It has helped me define a new and pleasing shape for plucking (as I was struggling to just wing it myself) so it was worth the purchase but it could be better. The difficulty lies in holding it and doing what you have to do. Also the range of shapes are not the best - they could offer longer ones and bushier ones as the options given are on the dainty (small brow) side. All in all I&#x27;m glad I got it but beware of its limitations before you buy.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product because it showed me different ways to possibly shape my eyebrow.  I found the one that was right for me and now I can do it without the stencils.</li>
            <li> Cheap....cheap...cheap. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> stencils a bit too big for me - have used the \\&quot;rounded\\&quot; stencil some but basically too big and am a bit clumsy in using.</li>
            <li> did not like this item. difficult to line up both sides  would not order this product again would not recommend</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  It leaves a lot of room for error.  It was hard for me to use and I tried it once, threw it away and realized it was a waste of money.  Just go to the salon or draw with eyeliner before buying these.</li>
            <li> Dont buy it! Its a useless cheap piece of plastic that wont fit your face since its tiny and would work on a 2 years old only!</li>
            <li> The stencils are reusable and you can wipe them clean. They worked for an amateur like me. Therefore, I wear a different shape every other day. Also, I can shade how dark or light I want my eyebrows to look and I can measure them really accurately. I really do recommend these stencils.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it.  Didn&#x27;t send it back because the cost was to little.  To hard to hold and draw eyebrows</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that you cannot use a brow pencil with this stencil, it will slice right through it. After several attempts, I simply gave up. I don&#x27;t know how to make this work.</li>
            <li> They kinda big but other than tht its cool. I think ELF is better, but for the price its okay</li>
            <li> love it the item has helped me shorten the time to doing my eyebrows. glad I purchased the item. thank you</li>
            <li> BUYERS BEWARE!!! THIS SELLER IS NOT GIVING YOU THE WHOLE STORY!!! I&#x27;ve just recently gotten into this phase of using stencils to outline and accentuate my eyebrows, so I was trying a number of products to expand the range of what I thought might work and what could do a good job. The description seemed to fit right along with the other items I was trying, so I invested in two \\&quot;sets\\&quot; of five; I always like to have a double set on hand - one for my purse, one for at home. This is basically the EXACT set of stencils you get with the Christian Eyebrow sets, minus the actual brow brush and color. The only difference is a cheap plastic black \\&quot;wallet\\&quot; to keep the stencils in. I wouldn&#x27;t have minded so much, if I had been told that in the actual advertising. I mean, I&#x27;ve held the stencils up against one another and hey, they&#x27;re stamped from the same imprint machine and named the same kind of brow arch. Again, I wouldn&#x27;t have minded - it would have been nice to have been able to order extra sets of the stencils without the powders, but not disclosing it in the advertising just rings a little false with me. And the \\&quot;wallet\\&quot; is just cheap; a black piece of plastic with a clear front to show you your stencils within. Sleeve, maybe, but no wallet. I did get five stencils that are useable and I will use them, but this ad was completely filled with false advertising. Whomever wrote this should go back to the drawing board and start again, reading a course in ethical advertising. It&#x27;s not worth the price, knowing what I know now, at nearly $6.00 apiece. Not when I purchased OFFICIAL extra Christian stencil sets for $2.37. BUYERS BEWARE!!! THIS SELLER IS NOT GIVING YOU THE WHOLE STORY!!!</li>
            <li> I like the product, came faster than expected, good quality. But...now I&#x27;m getting a lot of spam in Spanish. Not good.</li>
            <li> Nice shapes for eyebrows but no colouring provided for shading in the eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Please make up a complete kit with proper directions and instructions on usage.&lt;br /&gt;Could not use it and was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Wasted my money and postage too expensive.</li>
            <li> Worked very nice, I&#x27;m helping myself get my eyebrows even and this is def helping for regrowth  and my patience.</li>
            <li> Although this product wasn&#x27;t mine, the seller did a great job with the service.&lt;br /&gt;Received as advertised. I&#x27;m sure my friend is happy, otherwise I would have heard something already&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
