            <li> The only reason i&#x27;m not giving it five stars is because it doesn&#x27;t quite last as long as i would like.</li>
            <li> It has a strange floral fragrance that I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> This smells exactly like the honeysuckle that grew by the creek behind my house, and it brings me back!</li>
            <li> It have received several compliments, I will definitely be trying out some of the other scents!</li>
            <li> I have sampled at least 5 other products and none of them came even close the the real scent of honeysuckle..</li>
            <li> I have only had this item for less than a day</li>
            <li> I live around wild honey suckle and this perfume oil, unfortunately, DOES NOT smell like it.</li>
            <li> It does not last all day on me because I just use a little bit.</li>
            <li> Careful with this method, it can stain and harm some fabrics.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I put a dab on my wrists and I had to wash about half a dozen times with dish detergent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feminine without being old or stale.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my coworker who has sentimental memories of the honeysuckle scent.  </li>
            <li> I can use it sparingly....and its not overwhelming either...pretty and subtle.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Fragrances rated we&#x27;ll have smelled artificial &amp; usually give me a headache due to my sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I like a subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this is that they&#x27;re selling, but it smells like urinal cleaner and made me nauseated.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sadly, she&#x27;s gone, but I realized I could start wearing perfume again and wanted something feminine and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Or create a trail a blind person can follow.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> I have ordered scent oils on line &amp; have not had luck until today.  Fragrances rated we&#x27;ll have smelled artificial &amp; usually give me a headache due to my sensitivity.  This was my last try on a scent &amp; I must say I absolutely Love this fragrance!  So delicate, clean &amp; natural smelling!  I finally found a fragrance I LOVE!</li>
            <li> When I first put some on my wrists and forearm I wasnt prepared for the BURST of intense scent...it was powerful....a bit strong at first but it became a heavenly aroma of sweet honeysuckle light and lingering..t ....I dont have to use much of this an the bottle size for the price is terrific. I can use it sparingly....and its not overwhelming either...pretty and subtle.</li>
            <li> I live around wild honey suckle and this perfume oil, unfortunately, DOES NOT smell like it. I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent-not overpowering at all. I have only had this item for less than a day and I have already fell in love with it. I even had several co-workers ask what I was wearing. The package arrived on time and in good condition. I love also that the purchase supports a small family business, which makes the fragrance all the more enjoyable. I will definitely order this again!</li>
            <li> Grew up with honeysuckle in the backyard, love the smell of it.  This perfume oil smells nothing like honeysuckle, although it is a floral smell of some kind. Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> must buy. aw some fragrance in very low price i would definitely recommend to all people. Better than spending all money on all kinds of perfumes ;)</li>
            <li> I love going on long car rides with the windows down and smelling wild honeysuckle and this does not smell like that at all. I am in my early 20&#x27;s and I tried it on and it smells like that old lady cheap perfume. I like that it is organic and stuff but it did not smell at all like honeysuckle. I was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling pure honeysuckle I have ever found. I have sampled at least 5 other products and none of them came even close the the real scent of honeysuckle..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the one. It&#x27;s feminine without being old or stale. It has some exotic properties that make it a perfect blend for a lady that likes to feel feminine but not be girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have better lasting results if I put it on my clothing. Especially coats and sweaters. Careful with this method, it can stain and harm some fabrics. I also wear it on my body and put it on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also very sensitive to smells and often get migraines. I have been wearing this daily since and it has not triggered even a headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a slight issue with the shipping but the seller quickly responded and remedied the issue without hesitation. I will buy again and will consider stocking up if the next batch smells as good as this one.</li>
            <li> This smells exactly like the honeysuckle that grew by the creek behind my house, and it brings me back! I have tried several other oils and this one is far and away the best.  Thank you! Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> this has such a wonderful delicate scent that it just makes you feel happy using this product. I will definitely  recommend this product and company to my friends and relatives. thanks</li>
            <li> This smells lovely as if if was made from fresh picked honeysuckle the moment you put it on. It works nicely as a light summer fragrance but can really be worn all year long. It smells beautiful.</li>
            <li> I never actually used this product, but I did breathe in the sweet aroma, and it is so beautiful, calm and relaxing. I am planning to give it to my future sister-in-law, and I think it will add to her sweetness.</li>
            <li> I had to go for many years without wearing a scent because of a close friend who was VERY sensitive to fragrances. Sadly, she&#x27;s gone, but I realized I could start wearing perfume again and wanted something feminine and not overpowering. This oil is perfect for me. I love the fragrance and don&#x27;t feel overpowered by it at all. A most lovely reintroduction to having my own special fragrance when I want to wear it.</li>
            <li> This is what pure honeysuckle smells like - sweet, addictive and wonderfully feminine! It reminds me of the deep South. I absolutely love this scent!</li>
            <li> This really smells like honeysuckle! I was a bit surprised. I don&#x27;t know how they replicated the smell but it is just like the flower. The dispenser is a roll-on which allows great control of how much you want to apply, a tiny bit or a whole bunch. It does not last all day on me because I just use a little bit. The bottle is glass, which I love--don&#x27;t like plastic containers for perfume oils--and is three inches tall. The smell makes me smile, so I am happy with my purchase. It arrived quickly also. I feel like spring.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself &amp; my mother. We BOTH love the smell of honey suckle. I just opened it tonight and fell in love. It isn&#x27;t to strong, yet not weak at all !!! It is exactly what I was hoping for !!! !!! !!! It smells so fresh. Just like when I would admire and smell fresh honey suckle as a child ! This is perfect ! Thank you for creating this. It even rolls on perfectly/easily. I will be ordering my mother and I more!!!!!  Also, just the simple fact that this is created without harsh chemicals makes it even more wonderful. Please don&#x27;t stop making this! Xo</li>
            <li> This smells great. Just like honeysuckle! My husband thinks I smell wonderful. Really fresh and clean. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with a great natural smell that&#x27;s cheery and a little flirty. A little goes a long way. Perfect scent packaged in the perfect size to keep handy in your purse.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Smelled like soap.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Smell And Great Price. My Boyfriend Loves It On Me!</li>
            <li> I did not think this smelled like honeysuckle. I used to buy bath and bodyworks honeysuckle and I&#x27;ve been searching for a replacement ever since they stopped selling it. This product had a strong tangy smell that was not my favorite. Couldn&#x27;t stand to be near it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product because of its classy scent and quality. Every time I wear it I get compliments which are definitely positive. The product represents the finest quality with a great reasonable price. I found this Perfume oil as an absolute divine!</li>
            <li> Very realistic and long lasting! My husband like it, usually very finicky.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this oil! One tiny drop goes a long way and this bottle will last a while! The fragrance is pure and brings back the wonderful memories of wild honeysuckle blooming in the woods of my East Texas home. Price was great, product is superior to others I&#x27;ve tried, and I will be ordering more from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I love this Honey Suckle Perfume oil.  The first time I put it on, it was amazing.  I never smelt anything like this before.  That was four months ago.  I have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments when i wear this</li>
            <li> Product stinks very bad does not smell like honey suckle</li>
            <li> Smell is great!!! Literally smells crisp, sweet just like fresh honey suckle. Everyone tells me I smell so good or delicious.</li>
            <li> I like this--get a lot for the money, and it smells heavenly; just a dab on wrists, and I&#x27;m good to go all day!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Not over powering scent. Lite fragrance that does not cause me headaches. Strong enough to remind of my honeysuckle vine&#x27;s that grow outside my window at home. If you&#x27;re looking for a lite perfume that lingers and doesn&#x27;t make you smell like you took a bath in it this for you. Perfume should not be over powering and still be smelled five minutes after you left. Or create a trail a blind person can follow.</li>
            <li> Received it today and I must say the scent is Amazing! Just Love it!!💜</li>
            <li> VERY STRONG!  Smells like honeysuckle x 1,000. Too strong to do anything with.  Would not purchase again. I like a subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells just like honeysuckle, and it came VERY thoroughly wrapped in bubble wrap inside the mailing envelope. it was sent quickly too! The only reason i&#x27;m not giving it five stars is because it doesn&#x27;t quite last as long as i would like.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  It does not smell like the wild honeysuckles in Maryland.  It has a strange floral fragrance that I don&#x27;t like.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is not honeysuckle oil. I don&#x27;t know what this is that they&#x27;re selling, but it smells like urinal cleaner and made me nauseated. Someone has a lot of nerve to sell this as perfume. I put a dab on my wrists and I had to wash about half a dozen times with dish detergent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! Smells exactly l like the scent I ordered (Which was wild honeysuckle) and I&#x27;m very much looking for ordering other scents!!!</li>
            <li> It is true to scent love it</li>
            <li> Wonderful. It took a while to arrive, but I was in no hurry. This perfume is very strong, but not over powering. It have received several compliments, I will definitely be trying out some of the other scents!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; for years that my husband can tolerate. He has MCS (multiple chemical sensitivity). This is perfect. It smells NATURAL and he feels comfortable when I am using it. The perfume oil is longlasting, easy to use and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. A little goes a long way. I highly recommend this to everyone, even those who are not sensitive to alcohol based perfumes.  It is a great product. The price is almost shamefully too cheap.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I can put it on in the evening and still smell it when I wake up the next morning. Smells wonderful and not strong enough to bother anyone.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my coworker who has sentimental memories of the honeysuckle scent.  She loved it and it did smell awesome!</li>
            <li> Great smell!! Vegan!! and fast service!!!  Would definitely order from GreenPlanet-Organics again!!</li>
            <li> Received my package super fast. The essence of honeysuckle stays with me all day. Get lots of compliments on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;.</li>
