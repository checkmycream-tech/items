    <ol>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0031UZ6VY Alter Ego Bio Styling Revitalizing Lotion (Lozione Rivitalizzante) 125ml]]I can&#x27;t rate this item when I don&#x27;t know how to apply it! There are no directions in any language.</li>
            <li> I love it,it make my hair grow fast and beautiful .i use this drops once every week it make magic to my hair all the people ask  me how my hair grow so fast and I tell them the I use this drops.bye you feel the different the 1st time u use it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using this off and on for about 5 years, but I have no complaints (except maybe a bigger bottle). It&#x27;s easy to use and it actually works.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product, because it made my hair very dry. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again... too much money for this product with no results</li>
            <li> I am sure that this was working but then I started using HairFinity. Which I think has halted my growth. I stop using Hairfinity so I am sure I will start to see the growing again. I do like this product though for some strange reason I really do!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few days so I cannot say if it made my hair grow.  I am African American and I press my hair I will say after putting this on my scalp the next morning when I combed my hair it was silky soft.  When I finish this bottle I will write an update on the results of this product.</li>
            <li> It really works! within 2-3 weeks i noticed hair growth and I&#x27;ve now had it for almost 5 weeks and it has lived up to my expectations. Purchase it, you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> The product was recommended by a friend.  But, there is a smaller more concentrated version.  Which you do not carry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it long enough to recommend its claims.</li>
            <li> I have bought at least 4 bottles of this stuff. I started using this last summer (2012) after being advised by my Dominican stylist. She said it would really make my hair grow and thicken, but I didn&#x27;t believe it. I started wearing my natural hair again because of horrible damage caused by sew-ins. All of my friends knew I had long hair and were aware that I had it cut (because of the damage), so as the year progressed, many noticed that my hair began to grow, and I did as well! My stylist told me to apply it 2-3 times/week, which I initially did, but after a couple of weeks I began to use it every day since there&#x27;s no instructions on the product. Also I applied it vertically down my hair (in a cornrow type pattern...? lol) and applied a couple of drops to the center and back of my hair where most of my hair got ripped out :(. I got tired of my short hair and did more damage all over again in December (stupid me) so a year later I&#x27;m back trying it again. I&#x27;m using clip-ins daily now and I&#x27;m not sure if the tension/pulling is not causing my hair to grow, but the product does work WITH TIME AND PATIENCE! Give it 3 months before you have a final verdict!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to whoever wants their hair to grow. The seller I bought it from certainly did a great job on their sales and they were very helpful on answering all my questions. It truly deserve a 5 star rate I am very very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This product always helps my hair grow.  I love the way it feels on my scalp..it takes time but you will see the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alter Ego for several months and have recommended to several people. My hair is much thicker and longer. My hair was in bad shape for using weave and chemicals in my hair. When I stop using this product I can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years now and it has never let me down.  I love it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any  thickening of my hair after 4 months of use.</li>
            <li> It works pretty fine. I have notice a few hair growth but idk if its because of this. Its a very good product and hopefully will keep continuing using this to see good results</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. MY HAIR STYLIST USES THIS PRODUCT IN THE SALON. SHE SELLS IT FOR $35.00 A BOTTLE. I AM SAVING SOME MONEY BY ORDERING THIS ITEM OFF AMAZON. WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN SOON. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR WOMEN WHO WANTS LONGER, STRONGER HAIR GROWTH.</li>
            <li> My hair has been growing after having my baby, I needed something like this so bad!!! Everyone tells me that my hair looks a lot longer! I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product...... My hair is extremely damaged  and now I see it differentty .  I will continue using. I recommend it to everyone......</li>
            <li> This product is very effective. I noticed a difference in only two months. Not only does the product encourage hair growth, its smells fabulous and also thickens the hair.</li>
