    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>The size of the cloth is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Great item...</li>
            <li>Great product, arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I love it, the perfect size at a great price.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best one ever!  </li>
            <li>Korean girlfriend introduced me to this product, which is feels kind of like a scouring pad for the skin.</li>
            <li>but it is more efficient when bathing than the mitts.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I have washed the towel twice in the washing machine and many times by hand.  </li>
            <li>Really happy to have found it on Amazon and for a decent price.</li>
            <li>Even more effective after soaking in a very warm bath for about half an hour.</li>
            <li>I follow this procedure with Neutrogena Light Sesame Formula Body Oil also available from AZ.  </li>
            <li>Use lightly on face, never scrub or you will get  hyper pigmentation</li>
            <li>Fair enough, honey :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m clean.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no cleaner showering than one that entails a full body exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s an Asian thing, but you will never feel cleaner using another kind of shower towel.  </li>
            <li>great for the back scrub and removal of dead skin cells, my skin glows and is super smooth.</li>
            <li>It is something many asians use and is commonplace in public spas in asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My whole family uses these!</li>
            <li>Just when I think the odor is gone, as soon as it gets wet again, there it is, strong as ever!  </li>
            <li>Love this cloth and use it every day to get rid of dry skin</li>
            <li>Fantastic staple in my home, when I travel and definitely when I am getting ready for swimsuit time!</li>
            <li>so my skin can really absorb my body products.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>I first used one of these exfoliating bath scrubs at a Korean bath house a few years back and loved the exfoliating qualities.</li>
            <li>Now I can finally get my back acne scars scrubbed so they can fade :)</li>
            <li>Now that I found these special cloths, I will not be without and will even go with me traveling long distance or overnight.</li>
            <li>Most fabulous way to remove dead skin cells from your body after you are wet and sudsy using them like a an elongated towel going back and forth across body.  </li>
            <li>Also, when exfoliating, you can clearly see the skin that rubs off on the towel.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soooo soft after using it.</li>
            <li>Works very well for exfoliating, I like it a lot, well made and will practically last for years.</li>
            <li>Might be a bit rough for some but just right for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy the smaller &amp;#34;mittens&amp;#34; (which are just square pockets) for the body, and this one to scrub your back.</li>
            <li>My old exfoliating towel was getting pretty limp</li>
    </ol>

            <li> At first it may feel a little rough, but you won&#x27;t regret using it!  </li>
            <li> I like the texture of this back scrubber,it doesn&#x27;t  feel plastic like other items I&#x27;ve ordered similar to this.</li>
            <li> Just try not the rub too hard, this towel is very abrasive.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel polished and alive without irritating my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so rough</li>
            <li> it damages the skin but just enough to slough off the dead cells.</li>
            <li> The cloth has substance and doesn&#x27;t end up in a narrow strip while washing my back.</li>
            <li> and I admit it does tell you how dirty was and clean your body</li>
            <li> Miles ahead of any other.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, keep looking for other options.</li>
            <li> When wet it shrinks to half its size almost.  </li>
            <li> It does &#x27;wear down&#x27; over time with use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as an upgrade from the mitts purchased a few years before.</li>
            <li> Do not use everyday bec the towel can irritate and scrape your skin off.</li>
            <li> She says there&#x27;s a satisfaction in seeing the dead skin is scoured off your body into rolleds she calls &amp;#34;noodles&amp;#34; .  </li>
            <li> I made some gloves out of this material but, the seams fall apart after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I like the effect of the roughness of the fabric on the skin when wet,  but find it difficult to use because of the shrinking.  </li>
            <li> Way to harsh !!</li>
            <li> Bath for like 20 minutes, air dry for a minute and when you&#x27;re still damp, rub this on you in long strokes and you will be amazed (and disgusted) by what happens.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy any expensive exfoliates.</li>
            <li> I think you will be really disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> The problem is the awful smell that emanates from the cloth.  </li>

            <li> I love it, the perfect size at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived on time. Just like the Korean viscose cloths but in the form of a towel! Now I can finally get my back acne scars scrubbed so they can fade :)</li>
            <li> Way to harsh !! For me anyways.</li>
            <li> not as coarse as the ones I bought on a Korean SPA here in LA!</li>
            <li> I first used one of these exfoliating bath scrubs at a Korean bath house a few years back and loved the exfoliating qualities. Really happy to have found it on Amazon and for a decent price. Love this cloth and use it every day to get rid of dry skin so my skin can really absorb my body products. Very pleased. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an upgrade from the mitts purchased a few years before. The material is the same but it is more efficient when bathing than the mitts. I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> My old exfoliating towel was getting pretty limp so I thought I would try this one.  This is the absolute best one ever!  Miles ahead of any other.  If you use it you will have the softest, smoothest skin of your life.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> great for the back scrub and removal of dead skin cells, my skin glows and is super smooth. Do not use everyday bec the towel can irritate and scrape your skin off. Use lightly on face, never scrub or you will get  hyper pigmentation</li>

It&#x27;s not so rough it damages the skin but just enough to slough off the dead cells. It is something many asians use and is commonplace in public spas in asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use soap with this product however my wife uses it in the traditional way, which is without soap, after which she applies moisturizing lotion.  She says there&#x27;s a satisfaction in seeing the dead skin is scoured off your body into rolleds she calls &amp;#34;noodles&amp;#34; .  I tried it and I admit it does tell you how dirty was and clean your body is when you&#x27;re done.  I like to use it with soap because I&#x27;m just used my Zest smell, plus I don&#x27;t get the unsightly noodles.  She says I don&#x27;t do it that way I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m clean.  Fair enough, honey :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I HIGHLY recommend everyone buy the smaller &amp;#34;mittens&amp;#34; (which are just square pockets) for the body, and this one to scrub your back.</li>
            <li> This works very well. My skin feels soooo soft after using it. Also, when exfoliating, you can clearly see the skin that rubs off on the towel. Just try not the rub too hard, this towel is very abrasive.</li>

            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s an Asian thing, but you will never feel cleaner using another kind of shower towel.  I have converted over 20 people into using this item!  At first it may feel a little rough, but you won&#x27;t regret using it!  While deployed my co-workers purchased several so that they wouldn&#x27;t be without one when they turned in their laundry.  My whole family uses these!</li>
            <li> Fantastic staple in my home, when I travel and definitely when I am getting ready for swimsuit time!</li>
            <li> Works very well for exfoliating, I like it a lot, well made and will practically last for years.</li>
            <li> Does the scrubber do what it states?  Yes, of course.  The size of the cloth is perfect.  The amount of abrasion is also spot on.  The problem is the awful smell that emanates from the cloth.  It smells like sulphur, and the odor NEVER goes away!  I have washed the towel twice in the washing machine and many times by hand.  Just when I think the odor is gone, as soon as it gets wet again, there it is, strong as ever!  I have no idea what chemicals this is made from, but I don&#x27;t trust it one bit.  Do yourself a favor, keep looking for other options. I think you will be really disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy any expensive exfoliates. This is all you will need. Follow the directions I found on here. Bath for like 20 minutes, air dry for a minute and when you&#x27;re still damp, rub this on you in long strokes and you will be amazed (and disgusted) by what happens.</li>
