            <li>Love this brand shellac.  </li>
            <li>Great Shipping Thanks...</li>
            <li>Much better option to wrapping my nails in acrylic or fibre glass</li>
            <li>Lovely colors matched expectations.</li>

            <li>I work in a professional job setting and even though it is my hearts desire to wear orange and lime green, I have to stick to something more neutral and these work.  </li>

            <li> Pink is pink, but beige, orange and brown are almost the same.</li>
            <li> All but one of the colors in this pack require at least 3 to 4 coats to cover the nail properly which means you will use up these colors at twice the rate of CND&#x27;s regular colors.  </li>

            <li> Also my set has issue with small pieces of debris in the polish.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this was a manufacturing issue or not</li>
            <li> If applied correctly it lasts for t least two weeks.</li>

            <li> This collection is absolutely beautiful! I&#x27;ve been obsessed with cnd shellac for the past couple of years and my only complaint was that they didn&#x27;t have a true opaque nude. I achieved the colors I wanted by layering, but it&#x27;s a pain. This set is the perfect set of nudes and blush pinks with full, -can&#x27;t see through my nails coverage.</li>
            <li> Long wearing, beautiful color and shine, soaks off within 10 minutes. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> First, let me say CND is the BEST! I&#x27;ve been using CND gel polish for over 2 years (saving a ton doing my own nails). These nudes are super versatile.</li>
            <li> It looks like pink, orange, beige and brown.Pink is pink, but beige, orange and brown are almost the same. But quality od CND shellac is great!</li>
            <li> Love the colors! Exactly what I was expecting.  Arrived on time, no problems at all. Perfect nude tones for everyday looks.</li>
            <li> Shellac is  wonderful product - been using it on my nails for about 3 years.  The colors in this collection are ok - basically look the same.  I attempted to return them unopened however the vendor has such a strict return policy that it was not to my benefit.  Now am stuck with 4 polishes that look pretty much the same.  I will continue to order Shellac however will no order from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Love these.  The colors are varied and are very different when painted.  Love this brand shellac.  Easy to apply and soaks right off.</li>
            <li> All the colors are just perfect! I highly recommend this set for anyone. When I run out I will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Great Product.. Great Shipping Thanks...</li>
            <li> I love the nudes great deal</li>
            <li> Shellac gel polish is one of the best you can find. Very happy with this product. If applied correctly it lasts for t least two weeks. Much better option to wrapping my nails in acrylic or fibre glass</li>
            <li> These are great subtle colors.  I work in a professional job setting and even though it is my hearts desire to wear orange and lime green, I have to stick to something more neutral and these work.  If you are light skinned you will have no trouble telling the difference between these products.  They also stay on for about a week before they start to lose their shine.</li>
            <li> While I normally like lighter colors to match my skin tone.  All but one of the colors in this pack require at least 3 to 4 coats to cover the nail properly which means you will use up these colors at twice the rate of CND&#x27;s regular colors.  Also my set has issue with small pieces of debris in the polish.  Not sure if this was a manufacturing issue or not but it made one bottle totally unusable.</li>
            <li> These are all pretty colors if you are a light color person. If not, they are all about the same. I have read you can layer them to get other effects but I feel they just look layered. I am going to try to actually mix the colors and see if I come out with anything different....who knows....</li>
            <li> Perfect for fall. Last weeks without chips.</li>
            <li> Great colors and quality!</li>
            <li> Lovely colors matched expectations.</li>
