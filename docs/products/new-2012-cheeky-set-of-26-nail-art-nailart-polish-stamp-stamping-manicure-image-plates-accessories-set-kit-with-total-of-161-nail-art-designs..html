            <li>You will love these plates.</li>
            <li>The plates are well made with images that appeal to many age groups and dealing with this company has been a breeze.</li>
            <li>I just started stamping and did not want to invest in Konad until I tried more affordable ones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna follow you on Facebook :)</li>
            <li>I love these plates.</li>
            <li>It works better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already looking for more of their plates to purchase.</li>
            <li>thats why I bought one more to give it to my sister</li>
            <li>The packaging is adorable and the designs are diverse.</li>
            <li>i just felt in love with them....</li>
            <li>this came in a really cute packaging with a magnetic snap.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>But otherwise i love the product.</li>
            <li>So I just got my set of Cheeky summer plates, and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of time to figure out the colors that will work, you can have cute finger nails.</li>
            <li>LOVE it...</li>
            <li>I love this collection.  </li>
            <li>Designs are cute.</li>
            <li>patterns are fun and there are so many of them, there is something for everyone and every event here!</li>
            <li>I like this plate set because of the large variety of fun, attractive and elegant patterns.</li>
            <li>I just love the little box they come in, it&#x27;s really cute and perfect for storing your plates.</li>
            <li>One of the best thing is you get a variety of full nail size images and cute single images and</li>
            <li>The images are unique and cute .</li>
            <li>the stamping plates are great worth the price , fast shipping item as describe</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>very quick to do fancy nail art.</li>
            <li>Stamping isn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li>I am still getting the hang out it, these plates are as easy as any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the whole thing as if it was my own set.  </li>
            <li>they have unique, interesting and beautiful imagens, the plates are really big</li>
            <li>The first few images I tried came out perfectly and I was VERY pleased.</li>
            <li>The full nail images will even cover your thumbs :)</li>
            <li>These plates are deeply carved and stamp beautifully.  </li>
            <li>if one to buy a set just make sure that you get full plates</li>
            <li>loved this collection because of designs, they are so Funny, Rare, and Cute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is just what it describes.&lt;br /&gt;Con - is they don&#x27;t fit in the carrying case.</li>
            <li>Even fits my big toe LOL</li>
            <li>Any who doubt the quality should check Cheeky&#x27;s FB page and see how others too enjoy this set with no issues.</li>
            <li>When I received the plates, I noticed that the protective sticker (used to secure box) was cut.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother to contact cheeky either, fortunate for me someone sold me plate 55 which they didn&#x27;t want from their set.</li>
            <li>I have had some luck, and some really cute results once I got the color thing right.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s best to get a quick rolling technique down when using it.  </li>
            <li>but and the other hand are very nice designs I love it</li>
            <li>The packaging is very nice, the plates are bigger in size and the designs are so fun and rock!</li>
            <li>I love how large the full nail images are!</li>
            <li>super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the buy!</li>
            <li>user friendly.</li>
            <li>they re sent my original order, it took 3 days to get to me....</li>
            <li>Excited as i had received my summer collection plates today</li>
            <li>but they were totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>Originally I wanted to contact the seller about this but upon searching for ages, I couldn&#x27;t find a way to contact them.</li>
            <li>Having never used Cheeky plates before I used these as the benchmark as to whether i would then purchase the set I had originally ordered.</li>
            <li>, I get very clear images from them and they clean up nice.</li>
            <li>The images come out clear &amp; my daughters love the images too!</li>
            <li>In the reviews from other customers there is no reference to the beautiful story in the inside cover.  </li>
            <li>I think that for a set this large there are many plates that I just will not use.</li>
            <li>and they are large in size and cute designs.  </li>
            <li>i own konad, bundle monster, dashica (sdp), fauxnad and the first collection of cheeky plates the vibrant collection!</li>
            <li>The plates are etched well, so it picks up a nice clear image.</li>
            <li>ALL but 5 of the plates are full nail designs.</li>
            <li>The impressions were deep, insuring good stamp detail.  </li>
            <li>These are so cool like the selection</li>
            <li>I love all the different images and everything I&#x27;ve tried so far has worked great.</li>
            <li>Firstly, some of the plates had scratched up looking plastic covers, but after removing the covers the plates seemed fine.</li>
            <li>Plates came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>price is super.</li>
            <li>After contacting them through Amazon, I received a quick response.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really hd the opportunity to test these plates yet but all of the images are definitely cute and worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and shipped without a scratch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase more Cheeky plates, and I recommend it to everyboby. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in the new Cheeky packaging which is a nice little flip top box with a place for the plates to sit nice and snug.</li>
            <li>actually come in lovely carton box (which I think is a great plus) along with a plastic card that you can replace your regular scraper with, and avoid leaving scratches on the plates</li>
            <li>Very crisp stamping plates</li>
            <li>there was one image plate that was defective, but Cheeky fixed the problem very quickly!</li>
            <li>and I have used several plates, clean prints, easy clean up, no jagged edges on the plates either!</li>
            <li>A must have for everyone interested in nail art stamping!</li>
            <li>The etchings are pretty deep too, so that is something I had to get used to, but makes the pattern transfer better and gives you more time to line it up with your nail before the polish</li>
            <li>thanks cheeky you rock!!</li>
            <li>However, in this set, the plates are too large and they don&#x27;t fit inside the slots.</li>
            <li>The presentation of this product is amazing, and the little scrapping card that is included is so cute.  </li>
            <li>But these plates are SO WORTH</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this will keep them busy.</li>
            <li>good quality plates, images are larger than most which works for larger nail beds and longer nails.</li>
            <li>I was expected something better and better customer service.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely give a five stars after I have try out the plates and the most important part</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Sort of fun.  </li>
            <li>Some of the images are too small and detailed to pick up with a stamper, but overall the  quality and variety of designs are excellent.</li>
            <li>As with anything new play with it a couple of times, there are certain polishes that work better than others</li>
            <li>I love these discs and all because of one previous ordered I decided to buy more cheeky design plates.</li>
            <li>So...not only would I recommend the plates, but the seller is super lovely as well.  </li>
            <li>In the last few ours I tried all the plates (not all images) and I was very happy how they turned out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything I expected and will order more from this company!</li>
            <li>I like cheeky and i am a huge fan but the images wont come out clear on my nails</li>
            <li>I love the designs and the LARGER IMAGE SIZE!!!, and they stamp so well.</li>
            <li>Going back to these, the designs are cute</li>
            <li>I am gonna buy them all and probably give them as gifts next year at X-mas  :)</li>
            <li>But the variety means I am never bored.</li>
            <li>image has been designed with so much thought!</li>
            <li>But the full nail images are HUGE, so I don&#x27;t have to double stamp.</li>
            <li>These plates are my favorite of my 10 plus collection of different manufacturers.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li>These are pretty close to the quality of the Konad plates.</li>
            <li>This was my first time ever using and getting plates for stamping&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First time using them, I really like them, will order more, but takes a long time to get them, you will be waiting over 30 days but worth it.</li>
            <li>Although the box arrived a little worn, the condition of the plates are more important.</li>
            <li>but I have tried other Cheeky plates and they are quite nice.</li>
            <li>They have protective backing no sharp edges and come in a fantastic box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mostly got this for CH-33 which has the gears stamp but also excited about the pirate plate and a few of the others.</li>
            <li>The blue  protective tape was so easy to peel it off.</li>
            <li>because the discs are lightly bigger than the first ones I bought and don&#x27;t fit in my design case I bought to hold all my discs.</li>
            <li>do not have many single images</li>
            <li>Very well etched.</li>
            <li>Plus fast service..</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Now I really don&#x27;t have anywhere to store them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before I could never cover my whole nail with the image.</li>
            <li>but it takes too much time)</li>
            <li>(its happened to me haha).</li>
            <li>But it really is hit or miss.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still pretty new to stamping</li>
            <li>Some are very easy to use, others take a little bit of practice.</li>
            <li>I wish it was packaged better as the other item was damanged on the case but</li>
            <li>Some of the other images included \\&quot;I love my boyfriend\\&quot; and \\&quot;God is a DJ\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>have told many people where I got them from and a few were interested.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and clean and look flawless on, but it&#x27;s not really good enough to make me purchase from cheeky again.</li>
            <li>They are crisp and clear on the nail.</li>
            <li>My images always come out crisp and clear.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 29 yrs old and married)</li>
            <li>love the designs, big enough to cover all my nails.</li>
            <li>I bought the Bundle Monster storage book and the Cheeky Vibrant Collection</li>
            <li>this set in particular ...</li>
            <li>I ordered Cheeky&#x27;s Vibrant Collection of plates but received these instead.</li>
            <li>important is that I have small natural nails (but not tiny as my sister&#x27;s) and I wear them short, and these plates fit just fine, and if you have wider and longer nails that is fine, but if you have very long nails</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to store with other polishes</li>
            <li>the plates with smaller thinner more defined details might need pure acetone at time because it is harder to wipe it off.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughters birthday, she likes most of the images, some are just a little weird, but shes happy</li>
            <li>They are fun and not your standard plate designs.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully I will be able to get that missing plate.</li>
            <li>I like how big the plates are, and how the full nail images are bigger too ;D</li>
            <li>love the design except for a few which are sort of tacky looking.</li>
            <li>They are carved deep enough, even most of my regular polishes stamp really well.</li>
            <li>The plates are bigger than your usual Konad or Bm plates but that allows for bigger designs which is soo great.</li>
            <li>I am new to nail stamping</li>
            <li>I am new at doing the stamping</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my new go to scraper.</li>
            <li>Another thing to point out is that the images are wide and large which I love since I have large nail beds and usually have to double stamp to get to the edges of my nails and most of the time I can&#x27;t match up the stamp properly.</li>
            <li>These plates were so easy to use, they had such fun designs, and the images were big enough to fit my whole fingernail unlike a few Konad plates I ordered with a smaller design on them.  </li>
            <li>I bought this set for my young daughter (she is a teenager!)  </li>
            <li>The patterns actually cover my whole nail!  </li>
            <li>full image designs are big enough to cover even the longest nails.</li>
            <li>This plates are design for young people (and those that feel young too!)  </li>
            <li>These images are larger than previous Cheeky images, so they will work better for longer nails.</li>
            <li>the pates are just what is shown in the picture, no duplicates or missing plates and specially the exact same designs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I find classy things that I like.</li>
            <li>But these are the sharpest edges of any plates by far.</li>
            <li>I would say about 50% of the ones I have tried have not printed properly and I am very unimpressed with this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have ever received a package so fast, they came the next day!</li>
            <li>I really liked it, but there&#x27;s one plate that was duplicated, and the package was broken</li>
            <li>While this is a summer themed set, these plates are easily used year round!</li>
            <li>As a brand I&#x27;ve adored Cheeky, their image plates for me are the clearest and best to use, but recently after ordering the smear collection and waiting patiently for 4weeks for it to arrive before even raising the subject of its non arrival with them, I was confused as to how to contact them, their actual page (at the time) did NOT have a &#x27;contact us&#x27; section</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be looking forward to new sets!</li>
            <li>all with a blue cover that you have to remove, and sure that that blue cover may be torn for some of then (just a few)</li>
            <li>I just hope they don&#x27;t start making their new plates in the larger size.</li>
            <li>and these are the first ones that are really mean for big and large nails!!</li>
            <li>They would be worth it if they were half the price that they are.</li>
            <li>They are bigger than the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; round plates but still fit into my baseball card page protector inside my 3 ring binder.</li>
            <li>Also, all of the plates have a backing and they are not sharp at all.</li>
            <li>This set does come with a protective backing so there is no Sharp edges.</li>
            <li>despite of being bigger the designs are not bigger than usual, just more spacing between the designs.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>so I did what I thought to be the next natural step....</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait for my daughter to get old enough to paint her nails so that we can do this together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues stamping from these plates, when I have had issues I actually know it has been because of the nail polish, because not all nail polish will stamp</li>
            <li>These are super small plates.</li>
            <li>The design itself really deserve high rating as it is so much different from other random brand :)</li>
            <li>but you cant wish for bigger full imagens in a little plate!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it really depends on your nail</li>
            <li>The range of styles is big enough that my 6 yr old finds thngs she likes (unicorns)</li>
            <li>I have a hard time with those even using the special stamping polishes.</li>
            <li>it was obvious that the box had been opened previously, and one of the plates (unfortunately not the sports one) was damaged.</li>
            <li>And because store them on top of each other like we do common cds these disc tend to scratch and lose their design after to may scratches and get flaws.</li>
            <li>Seriously, im half excited and half worried.</li>

            <li> The plates are well made with images that appeal to many age groups and dealing with this company has been a breeze.</li>
            <li> I just started stamping and did not want to invest in Konad until I tried more affordable ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna follow you on Facebook :)</li>
            <li> I love these plates.</li>
            <li> It works better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already looking for more of their plates to purchase.</li>
            <li> thats why I bought one more to give it to my sister</li>
            <li> The packaging is adorable and the designs are diverse.</li>
            <li> i just felt in love with them....</li>
            <li> this came in a really cute packaging with a magnetic snap.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> But otherwise i love the product.</li>
            <li> So I just got my set of Cheeky summer plates, and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of time to figure out the colors that will work, you can have cute finger nails.</li>
            <li> LOVE it...</li>
            <li> I love this collection.  </li>
            <li> Designs are cute.</li>
            <li> patterns are fun and there are so many of them, there is something for everyone and every event here!</li>
            <li> I like this plate set because of the large variety of fun, attractive and elegant patterns.</li>
            <li> I just love the little box they come in, it&#x27;s really cute and perfect for storing your plates.</li>
            <li> One of the best thing is you get a variety of full nail size images and cute single images and</li>

            <li> the stamping plates are great worth the price , fast shipping item as describe</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> very quick to do fancy nail art.</li>
            <li> Stamping isn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li> I am still getting the hang out it, these plates are as easy as any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the whole thing as if it was my own set.  </li>
            <li> they have unique, interesting and beautiful imagens, the plates are really big</li>
            <li> The first few images I tried came out perfectly and I was VERY pleased.</li>
            <li> The full nail images will even cover your thumbs :)</li>
            <li> These plates are deeply carved and stamp beautifully.  </li>
            <li> if one to buy a set just make sure that you get full plates</li>
            <li> loved this collection because of designs, they are so Funny, Rare, and Cute.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is just what it describes.&lt;br /&gt;Con - is they don&#x27;t fit in the carrying case.</li>
            <li> Even fits my big toe LOL</li>
            <li> Any who doubt the quality should check Cheeky&#x27;s FB page and see how others too enjoy this set with no issues.</li>
            <li> When I received the plates, I noticed that the protective sticker (used to secure box) was cut.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to contact cheeky either, fortunate for me someone sold me plate 55 which they didn&#x27;t want from their set.</li>
            <li> I have had some luck, and some really cute results once I got the color thing right.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s best to get a quick rolling technique down when using it.  </li>
            <li> but and the other hand are very nice designs I love it</li>
            <li> The packaging is very nice, the plates are bigger in size and the designs are so fun and rock!</li>
            <li> I love how large the full nail images are!</li>
            <li> super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the buy!</li>
            <li> user friendly.</li>
            <li> they re sent my original order, it took 3 days to get to me....</li>
            <li> Excited as i had received my summer collection plates today</li>
            <li> but they were totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> Originally I wanted to contact the seller about this but upon searching for ages, I couldn&#x27;t find a way to contact them.</li>
            <li> Having never used Cheeky plates before I used these as the benchmark as to whether i would then purchase the set I had originally ordered.</li>
            <li> , I get very clear images from them and they clean up nice.</li>
            <li> The images come out clear &amp; my daughters love the images too!</li>
            <li> In the reviews from other customers there is no reference to the beautiful story in the inside cover.  </li>
            <li> I think that for a set this large there are many plates that I just will not use.</li>
            <li> and they are large in size and cute designs.  </li>
            <li> i own konad, bundle monster, dashica (sdp), fauxnad and the first collection of cheeky plates the vibrant collection!</li>
            <li> The plates are etched well, so it picks up a nice clear image.</li>
            <li> ALL but 5 of the plates are full nail designs.</li>
            <li> The impressions were deep, insuring good stamp detail.  </li>
            <li> These are so cool like the selection</li>
            <li> I love all the different images and everything I&#x27;ve tried so far has worked great.</li>
            <li> Firstly, some of the plates had scratched up looking plastic covers, but after removing the covers the plates seemed fine.</li>
            <li> Plates came quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> price is super.</li>
            <li> After contacting them through Amazon, I received a quick response.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really hd the opportunity to test these plates yet but all of the images are definitely cute and worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and shipped without a scratch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase more Cheeky plates, and I recommend it to everyboby. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in the new Cheeky packaging which is a nice little flip top box with a place for the plates to sit nice and snug.</li>
            <li> actually come in lovely carton box (which I think is a great plus) along with a plastic card that you can replace your regular scraper with, and avoid leaving scratches on the plates</li>
            <li> Very crisp stamping plates</li>
            <li> there was one image plate that was defective, but Cheeky fixed the problem very quickly!</li>
            <li> and I have used several plates, clean prints, easy clean up, no jagged edges on the plates either!</li>
            <li> A must have for everyone interested in nail art stamping!</li>
            <li> The etchings are pretty deep too, so that is something I had to get used to, but makes the pattern transfer better and gives you more time to line it up with your nail before the polish</li>
            <li> thanks cheeky you rock!!</li>
            <li> However, in this set, the plates are too large and they don&#x27;t fit inside the slots.</li>
            <li> The presentation of this product is amazing, and the little scrapping card that is included is so cute.  </li>
            <li> But these plates are SO WORTH</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure this will keep them busy.</li>
            <li> good quality plates, images are larger than most which works for larger nail beds and longer nails.</li>
            <li> I was expected something better and better customer service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely give a five stars after I have try out the plates and the most important part</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Sort of fun.  </li>
            <li> Some of the images are too small and detailed to pick up with a stamper, but overall the  quality and variety of designs are excellent.</li>
            <li> As with anything new play with it a couple of times, there are certain polishes that work better than others</li>
            <li> I love these discs and all because of one previous ordered I decided to buy more cheeky design plates.</li>
            <li> So...not only would I recommend the plates, but the seller is super lovely as well.  </li>
            <li> In the last few ours I tried all the plates (not all images) and I was very happy how they turned out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected and will order more from this company!</li>
            <li> I like cheeky and i am a huge fan but the images wont come out clear on my nails</li>
            <li> I love the designs and the LARGER IMAGE SIZE!!!, and they stamp so well.</li>
            <li> Going back to these, the designs are cute</li>
            <li> I am gonna buy them all and probably give them as gifts next year at X-mas  :)</li>
            <li> But the variety means I am never bored.</li>
            <li> image has been designed with so much thought!</li>
            <li> But the full nail images are HUGE, so I don&#x27;t have to double stamp.</li>
            <li> These plates are my favorite of my 10 plus collection of different manufacturers.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li> These are pretty close to the quality of the Konad plates.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ever using and getting plates for stamping&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First time using them, I really like them, will order more, but takes a long time to get them, you will be waiting over 30 days but worth it.</li>
            <li> Although the box arrived a little worn, the condition of the plates are more important.</li>
            <li> but I have tried other Cheeky plates and they are quite nice.</li>
            <li> They have protective backing no sharp edges and come in a fantastic box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mostly got this for CH-33 which has the gears stamp but also excited about the pirate plate and a few of the others.</li>
            <li> The blue  protective tape was so easy to peel it off.</li>
            <li> because the discs are lightly bigger than the first ones I bought and don&#x27;t fit in my design case I bought to hold all my discs.</li>
            <li> do not have many single images</li>
            <li> Very well etched.</li>
            <li> Plus fast service..</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Now I really don&#x27;t have anywhere to store them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I could never cover my whole nail with the image.</li>
            <li> but it takes too much time)</li>
            <li> (its happened to me haha).</li>
            <li> But it really is hit or miss.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still pretty new to stamping</li>
            <li> Some are very easy to use, others take a little bit of practice.</li>
            <li> I wish it was packaged better as the other item was damanged on the case but</li>
            <li> Some of the other images included \\&quot;I love my boyfriend\\&quot; and \\&quot;God is a DJ\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> have told many people where I got them from and a few were interested.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and clean and look flawless on, but it&#x27;s not really good enough to make me purchase from cheeky again.</li>
            <li> They are crisp and clear on the nail.</li>
            <li> My images always come out crisp and clear.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 29 yrs old and married)</li>
            <li> love the designs, big enough to cover all my nails.</li>
            <li> I bought the Bundle Monster storage book and the Cheeky Vibrant Collection</li>
            <li> this set in particular ...</li>
            <li> I ordered Cheeky&#x27;s Vibrant Collection of plates but received these instead.</li>
            <li> important is that I have small natural nails (but not tiny as my sister&#x27;s) and I wear them short, and these plates fit just fine, and if you have wider and longer nails that is fine, but if you have very long nails</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s easy to store with other polishes</li>
            <li> the plates with smaller thinner more defined details might need pure acetone at time because it is harder to wipe it off.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters birthday, she likes most of the images, some are just a little weird, but shes happy</li>
            <li> They are fun and not your standard plate designs.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I will be able to get that missing plate.</li>
            <li> I like how big the plates are, and how the full nail images are bigger too ;D</li>
            <li> love the design except for a few which are sort of tacky looking.</li>
            <li> They are carved deep enough, even most of my regular polishes stamp really well.</li>
            <li> The plates are bigger than your usual Konad or Bm plates but that allows for bigger designs which is soo great.</li>
            <li> I am new to nail stamping</li>
            <li> I am new at doing the stamping</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my new go to scraper.</li>
            <li> Another thing to point out is that the images are wide and large which I love since I have large nail beds and usually have to double stamp to get to the edges of my nails and most of the time I can&#x27;t match up the stamp properly.</li>
            <li> These plates were so easy to use, they had such fun designs, and the images were big enough to fit my whole fingernail unlike a few Konad plates I ordered with a smaller design on them.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set for my young daughter (she is a teenager!)  </li>
            <li> The patterns actually cover my whole nail!  </li>
            <li> full image designs are big enough to cover even the longest nails.</li>
            <li> This plates are design for young people (and those that feel young too!)  </li>
            <li> These images are larger than previous Cheeky images, so they will work better for longer nails.</li>
            <li> the pates are just what is shown in the picture, no duplicates or missing plates and specially the exact same designs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I find classy things that I like.</li>
            <li> But these are the sharpest edges of any plates by far.</li>
            <li> I would say about 50% of the ones I have tried have not printed properly and I am very unimpressed with this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have ever received a package so fast, they came the next day!</li>
            <li> I really liked it, but there&#x27;s one plate that was duplicated, and the package was broken</li>
            <li> While this is a summer themed set, these plates are easily used year round!</li>
            <li> As a brand I&#x27;ve adored Cheeky, their image plates for me are the clearest and best to use, but recently after ordering the smear collection and waiting patiently for 4weeks for it to arrive before even raising the subject of its non arrival with them, I was confused as to how to contact them, their actual page (at the time) did NOT have a &#x27;contact us&#x27; section</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be looking forward to new sets!</li>
            <li> all with a blue cover that you have to remove, and sure that that blue cover may be torn for some of then (just a few)</li>
            <li> I just hope they don&#x27;t start making their new plates in the larger size.</li>
            <li> and these are the first ones that are really mean for big and large nails!!</li>
            <li> They would be worth it if they were half the price that they are.</li>
            <li> They are bigger than the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; round plates but still fit into my baseball card page protector inside my 3 ring binder.</li>
            <li> Also, all of the plates have a backing and they are not sharp at all.</li>
            <li> This set does come with a protective backing so there is no Sharp edges.</li>
            <li> despite of being bigger the designs are not bigger than usual, just more spacing between the designs.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> so I did what I thought to be the next natural step....</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait for my daughter to get old enough to paint her nails so that we can do this together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues stamping from these plates, when I have had issues I actually know it has been because of the nail polish, because not all nail polish will stamp</li>
            <li> These are super small plates.</li>
            <li> The design itself really deserve high rating as it is so much different from other random brand :)</li>
            <li> but you cant wish for bigger full imagens in a little plate!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it really depends on your nail</li>
            <li> The range of styles is big enough that my 6 yr old finds thngs she likes (unicorns)</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with those even using the special stamping polishes.</li>
            <li> it was obvious that the box had been opened previously, and one of the plates (unfortunately not the sports one) was damaged.</li>
            <li> And because store them on top of each other like we do common cds these disc tend to scratch and lose their design after to may scratches and get flaws.</li>
            <li> Seriously, im half excited and half worried.</li>
            <li> Not the right polish or maybe I pressed too hard on the rubber stamper.</li>
            <li> the same.&lt;br /&gt;The edges of the designs are always clear and SHARP, which is something you should care when looking for plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very small fingernails and wanted to do something fun with them.</li>
            <li> it also did not include the &amp;#34;emergency scraper&amp;#34; and as silly as it may seem i was actually excited for that!</li>
            <li> You have to use white on dark colors or dark on white to really see the stamp.  </li>
            <li> the only thing that I dont like was that the little pink box come broke and in a very poor condition,  but everything else is good</li>
            <li> My hands and nails are much too small to ever use the designs Since I don&#x27;t have access to a printer at this time</li>
            <li> Short or long nails</li>
            <li> I bought these because all other brands designs&#x27; are not big enough for my thumbs and big toe nails.</li>
            <li> plates are a little bigger than usual but they have the same amount of designs per plate compared to other 3 brands that I purchased: either 7 singles or 4 full nails with 2 singles.</li>
            <li> I bought the Vibrant Collection (green) and the Summer Collection (pink).</li>
            <li> (although so far I have also encountered NO PROBLEMS with the small scratches left by my scraper).&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see a duplicate set and a missing plate</li>
            <li> As long as the designs are not damaged, I do not mind.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t really work unless the nail polishes you use are really thick.</li>
            <li> If they were only the same size as previous discs I have bought i would truly give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The plates are slightly larger than the other set but its accommodating the image sizes and avoiding plate crowding.</li>
            <li> but it is a little more expensive if you buy thru amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the Summer Collection and these plates are larger than the other set.</li>
            <li> Only thing a little disappointing about these is the plates are larger and won&#x27;t fit in my nail plate binder.</li>
            <li> Some of the designs are a little small and my Konad stamper doesn&#x27;t always pick up the whole image.</li>
            <li> Over half of my images wont work properly also.</li>
            <li> totally recommend Cheecky plates if you&#x27;re looking for something less girly&lt;br /&gt;Something</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are designed for girls with long and wide nails - and each full nail pattern and a moon underneath making it impossible to create French manicures with them too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> They are also a little wider so they should cover your entire thumb.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter and it is too hard for her to work with.  </li>
            <li> The box was crushed and the plates were all scratched up.</li>
            <li> I would say only a few didn&#x27;t work that well, but that could be user error too.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Konad stamper set and had absolutely no problem getting the design onto my fingernail.</li>
            <li> I provided them with necessary information and was assured that I would receive my missing plate.</li>
            <li> Everything as expected.</li>
            <li> I spoke with amazon to do a replacement but the card used to purchase was damaged and it was going to be a hassle to receive a refund on a card that had been closed by the bank.</li>
            <li> so use the ones that is partially diluted in water that they sell at walmart and stuff.</li>
            <li> the image plates are also larger than other round nail plates which i like.  </li>
            <li> finally a set that doesn&#x27;t include those ridiculous french tip designs.</li>
            <li> I other Cheeky plates also.</li>
            <li> I used Konad polish and the images do not lift off as nicely as my other brand plates.</li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> If not, I wouldn&#x27;t bother with any other product from this company.&lt;br /&gt;Out</li>
            <li> I only ended up keeping 14 plates since I thought the other 12 were a bit juvenile for me.</li>
            <li> Now, luckily, I am not interested in the pizza stamp on plate 41, which is half cut off due to deformed metal.  </li>
            <li> my advice for this is to NOT use pure acetone on this because it will leave a weird smearing on it (which can be  cleaned of with water</li>
            <li> What let down that would be.</li>
            <li> Yes, they seem to be slightly scratched, but I can understand the difficulty of keeping the surfaces pristine.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these round plates DO NOT FIT in the Bundle Monster binder, they are too large for the pockets.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan in returning the product, but I am really annoyed by the extra sharp edge that I have to watch out for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the listing is a little unclear</li>
            <li> in the estimated time, one of my plates did have a little bump in the edge of it</li>
            <li> It comes with a little Cheeky member card that states can be used as a scraper if needed.  </li>
            <li> It also came with a little card and let me tell you</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get here and some of the plates are scratched.</li>
            <li> It will not fit on the bundle monster stamping plate organizer.</li>
            <li> these do not fit in the plate wallet i bought ...</li>
            <li> None of the image plate is missing.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> So far I am not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> They will not fit in the Bundle Monster plate holder.</li>
            <li> When they arrived I was missing plate 55.</li>
            <li> I received the plates in the mail and within a few weeks I had tried a few of them.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> because of this order but because of the 4 other orders that have LATE JUNE &amp; JULY delivery date.</li>
            <li> Once you peal off the blue protector sheet, they&#x27;re very sharp and I&#x27;m afraid that they&#x27;re going to scratch each other now.</li>
            <li> because of the plates are bigger and are difficult to store.</li>
            <li> And as usual, these are so well cut that there is no bleeding of the polish</li>
            <li> ask a polite question on their Facebook page, I was told off and subsequently banned from their page for enquiring about my missing order because it was &#x27;bad publicity&#x27; not my choice of words btw!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but wth!!???&lt;br /&gt;The company in my eyes is shoddy, and extremely rude</li>
            <li> but thats the only thing why I&#x27;m unhappy whit</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing considering they are the same brand as the other set.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll see what i mean</li>
            <li> finally got to speak to someone via the cheeky page, where they informed me that they were very sorry that I had been treated</li>
            <li> do poorly</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> of the 26 plates there are a lot of difficult images.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> , that make me mad, i&#x27;m losing one plates that was suposed to be in this set</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great customer service, ordered the summer collection and within 24 hours it was shipped and arrived a day ahead of estimated delivery. I love the designs and the transfer to my stamp was a breeze im highly impressed with cheeky and gladly recommend &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great selection of designs, although I would&#x27;ve liked more basics like stripes. Some of the images are too small and detailed to pick up with a stamper, but overall the  quality and variety of designs are excellent.</li>
            <li> I am loving the stamping plates! The images come out clear &amp; my daughters love the images too! I haven&#x27;t used them all but the girls and I have used several plates, clean prints, easy clean up, no jagged edges on the plates either!</li>
            <li> I love cheeky plates! This is the second time I have purchased a product from them, and both products were excellent! The designs are really cute! Totally worth the buy!</li>
            <li> The cuality of the stamping plates is great. The only thing is that the stamping plate is bigger than the konad stamping plates. It will not fit on the bundle monster stamping plate organizer. Otherthat it is a great product. I do recommend buying this set.</li>
            <li> was so excited how quick i got them and in perfect condition!!  I wish it was packaged better as the other item was damanged on the case but not the disks thankfully!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting on my stamper to test them!</li>
            <li> I received this product a week or so ago.  I am very pleased with the nail art. It&#x27;s everything I expected and will order more from this company!</li>
            <li> it was a simple to use product. super easy to use. it is just what it describes.&lt;br /&gt;Con - is they don&#x27;t fit in the carrying case. they are over sized.&lt;br /&gt;PRO - the designs are a GREAT size. Even fits my big toe LOL</li>
            <li> This is the Summer Collection for 2012. I think the listing is a little unclear but I just received it and it is indeed the Summer Collection as see here: [...] Includes plates CH30-55. Plates came quickly and well packaged. It&#x27;s in the new Cheeky packaging which is a nice little flip top box with a place for the plates to sit nice and snug. I haven&#x27;t tried them out yet but I have tried other Cheeky plates and they are quite nice. I mostly got this for CH-33 which has the gears stamp but also excited about the pirate plate and a few of the others. Very nice!</li>
            <li> the stamping plates are great worth the price , fast shipping item as describe</li>
            <li> The designs are great. They are crisp and clear on the nail. I think that for a set this large there are many plates that I just will not use. I&#x27;m not into gambling or golf, so those are out. I wish they had included some of the more &amp;#34;common&amp;#34; designs like bows and stripes. That would have made this a perfect beginner&#x27;s set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my plates it was obvious that the box had been opened previously, and one of the plates (unfortunately not the sports one) was damaged.</li>
            <li> I love the designs and the LARGER IMAGE SIZE!!!, and they stamp so well. These were my first Cheeky plates and now I am hooked on Cheeky because of the excellent quality. Unfortunately these round plates DO NOT FIT in the Bundle Monster binder, they are too large for the pockets. But these plates are SO WORTH HAVING anyway!!!</li>
            <li> I love this set from Cheeky! Again very satisfied with the images. Very well etched. I enjoy using them on my nails every time!</li>
            <li> I love the variety of patterns this set has. They work very well with any polish, but the thicker polishes work best.</li>
            <li> Love the variety that cheeky provides. I have lots of different nail plates from different brands and cheeky is one of the best. My images always come out crisp and clear. Only thing a little disappointing about these is the plates are larger and won&#x27;t fit in my nail plate binder. They do come in a box that&#x27;s easy to store with other polishes so it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> Love these ones work perfect and some nice designs. Plus a great price for great products.</li>
            <li> Love it... Plus fast service.. Thanks a bunch...</li>
            <li> cause i love them. coverage was great. excellent size. user friendly. easy to use. very quick to do fancy nail art.</li>
            <li> Easy to use really good</li>
            <li> So I gave these 5 stars because the stamps work great almost every time. For the most part they work with any polish brand. Winstonia plates have really cute designs but they don&#x27;t really work unless the nail polishes you use are really thick. I have a hard time with those even using the special stamping polishes. Going back to these, the designs are cute too sand way easier to do.</li>
            <li> I like the plates. I have not used many of them yet. I other Cheeky plates also.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters birthday, she likes most of the images, some are just a little weird, but shes happy so I&#x27;m happy. Her friends love to do makeup and nails together and I&#x27;m sure this will keep them busy.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Its a VERY good price, it has awesome designs and very nice packaging to store them in. I am gonna buy them all and probably give them as gifts next year at X-mas  :)</li>
            <li> good quality plates, images are larger than most which works for larger nail beds and longer nails. because of the plates are bigger and are difficult to store. the only reason im not giving it 5 stars is i was expecting different packaging, the one shown would double as storage , instead the one i received was nothing like it , it broke as soon as i opened it. it also did not include the &amp;#34;emergency scraper&amp;#34; and as silly as it may seem i was actually excited for that! if you Google cheeky summer 2012 you&#x27;ll see what i mean</li>
            <li> these do not fit in the plate wallet i bought ...&lt;br /&gt;and do not have many single images</li>
            <li> I like this plate set because of the large variety of fun, attractive and elegant patterns. There are aliens, swirly vine patterns, geometric lines and shapes etc.  The range of styles is big enough that my 6 yr old finds thngs she likes (unicorns) and I find classy things that I like. There are stamps that i wont use such as &amp;#34;I heart BFF&amp;#34; or I heart (nail polish). But the variety means I am never bored. I am new to nail stamping and i use this set and a mash set and that is all i need!</li>
            <li> Stamping isn&#x27;t easy.  I am still getting the hang out it, these plates are as easy as any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, plate 41 came damaged.  Now, luckily, I am not interested in the pizza stamp on plate 41, which is half cut off due to deformed metal.  I don&#x27;t plan in returning the product, but I am really annoyed by the extra sharp edge that I have to watch out for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have rated the product 4 stars if the plate wasn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li> This is the Summer Collection 2012 set. It has awesome designs and they all transfer perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;The full image designs are big enough to cover even the longest nails. A must have for everyone interested in nail art stamping!</li>
            <li> Images transfer well and great price although I prefer cheeky&#x27;s XL plates, these are still good for selection of images</li>
            <li> Great set but arrived bent and scratched</li>
            <li> The images are unique and cute . But these are the sharpest edges of any plates by far. Over half of my images wont work properly also. I was expected something better and better customer service.</li>
            <li> As a brand I&#x27;ve adored Cheeky, their image plates for me are the clearest and best to use, but recently after ordering the smear collection and waiting patiently for 4weeks for it to arrive before even raising the subject of its non arrival with them, I was confused as to how to contact them, their actual page (at the time) did NOT have a &#x27;contact us&#x27; section so I did what I thought to be the next natural step....ask a polite question on their Facebook page, I was told off and subsequently banned from their page for enquiring about my missing order because it was &#x27;bad publicity&#x27; not my choice of words btw!&lt;br /&gt;I finally got to speak to someone via the cheeky page, where they informed me that they were very sorry that I had been treated do poorly but the fb page was &#x27;out sourced&#x27; ...they re sent my original order, it took 3 days to get to me....sorry but wth!!???&lt;br /&gt;The company in my eyes is shoddy, and extremely rude, I will NOT be a returning customer!!</li>
            <li> These are the best stamping plates ever made.(I own over one thousand image plates) The size of the full nail designs are perfect. The plates stamp well and are bigger than Konad images. The packaging on this set is also amazing. It will make a great gift. If you ordered from China it may take a while to get to you...but then again it&#x27;s also coming from China. I have used many of the designs and they all work well. Also, all of the plates have a backing and they are not sharp at all. The price is amazing as well. I just hope that Cheeky never stops making plates.</li>
            <li> Seriously, im half excited and half worried. Excited as i had received my summer collection plates today and it comes with the lovely box, great! None of the image plate is missing.  The blue  protective tape was so easy to peel it off. I like that. As for the worried part, I had made my purchased for both 2012 collections plates on the same day but I had only received one set today. I had emailed cheeky and they gave me a satisfied replied :D Now, I&#x27;ll just patiently wait for it to arrive since they are different order number despite I had ordered on the same day so I can&#x27;t expect that my both parcel will come together heh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely give a five stars after I have try out the plates and the most important part is get my another set safely. The design itself really deserve high rating as it is so much different from other random brand :)</li>
            <li> I am new at doing the stamping but I have used the Mash plates and Shany plates. I thought that with the cost of these that they would be awesome. The box was crushed and the plates were all scratched up. After I took the protective paper off they had deep scratches in them. I used Konad polish and the images do not lift off as nicely as my other brand plates. Don&#x27;t waste your money. They would be worth it if they were half the price that they are. So far I am not impressed at all. I have used about 7 different images and they do not seem deep enough to lift the image. I honestly like the Mash plates much better and they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Cheeky has once again gone above and beyond with this newest plate set! While this is a summer themed set, these plates are easily used year round! I personally love the nautical themed ones best but there are so many cute stamps to choose from-- monsters, music themes, etc!&lt;br /&gt;These images are also LARGE, which is perfect for those of us who have longer nails or wider nail beds. And as usual, these are so well cut that there is no bleeding of the polish and they stamp beautifully! Great plates for a beginner, too!&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to be a huge Cheeky supporter!</li>
            <li> well done cheeky - your summer collection set is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the summer collection gives such a massive variety of Images for all occasions. They have protective backing no sharp edges and come in a fantastic box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each image has been designed with so much thought! - they also stamp beautifully. Ive had no issues what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are designed for girls with long and wide nails - and each full nail pattern and a moon underneath making it impossible to create French manicures with them too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great work cheeky - I cant wait for further Image plates from you!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this set! the images are original and really good quality!  the image plates are also larger than other round nail plates which i like.  there was one image plate that was defective, but Cheeky fixed the problem very quickly! i will defiantly order more from them!!</li>
            <li> i love this 26 piece set of stamping plates the images transfer clear and the image patterns are a great selection! price is super. i recomend this set totally!</li>
            <li> I got these plates very quickly and I love the designs! The stamping quality is great, just as good as my Konad plates. I have another set of cheeky plates and some mash plates, but these are the best! Some of the designs are a little small and my Konad stamper doesn&#x27;t always pick up the whole image. But the full nail images are HUGE, so I don&#x27;t have to double stamp. Money well spent!</li>
            <li> I love this set... the images are big enough to cover all my nail... so beautiful&lt;br /&gt;can wait to try ALL of these designs!!!</li>
            <li> love the designs, big enough to cover all my nails. did my sister&#x27;s and my nails. we love it. definitely will re-purchase from CHEEKY</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my young daughter (she is a teenager!)  This plates are design for young people (and those that feel young too!)  The presentation of this product is amazing, and the little scrapping card that is included is so cute.  In the reviews from other customers there is no reference to the beautiful story in the inside cover.  I enjoyed the whole thing as if it was my own set.  GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d say you get a ton of images at a great price. I&#x27;ve tried 90% of my plates, stamped some on my nails, others on paper. I would say only a few didn&#x27;t work that well, but that could be user error too. Not the right polish or maybe I pressed too hard on the rubber stamper. Over all I&#x27;m very very happy with these plates and I recommend them. I&#x27;ve purchased the XL plates as well, great images.</li>
            <li> Cheeky has the most variety in images. I Love my sets. This set does come with a protective backing so there is no Sharp edges. The full nail images will even cover your thumbs :) I have used most of these images already and have had \\&quot;no \\&quot;issues the transferring. The plates are slightly larger than the other set but its accommodating the image sizes and avoiding plate crowding. Any who doubt the quality should check Cheeky&#x27;s FB page and see how others too enjoy this set with no issues. :)  [...]  Short or long nails these plates do the job.</li>
            <li> These plates were so easy to use, they had such fun designs, and the images were big enough to fit my whole fingernail unlike a few Konad plates I ordered with a smaller design on them.  I ordered the Konad stamper set and had absolutely no problem getting the design onto my fingernail.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st time buying cheeky products. I absolutely love the quality of these stamping plates. I will definately be purchasing cheeky products again.</li>
            <li> These plates are my favorite of my 10 plus collection of different manufacturers.  All images test stamped beautifully with great original images that others are not providing.  RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> These plates are deeply carved and stamp beautifully.  They are fun and not your standard plate designs.  They are also a little wider so they should cover your entire thumb.  I already have my next five manicures planned out after testing a bunch of images on my nails.  Also, I had a problem with one plate and the seller (I bought from Cheeky through Amazon) e-mailed me back within an hour!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  So...not only would I recommend the plates, but the seller is super lovely as well.  :)</li>
            <li> When I received the plates, I noticed that the protective sticker (used to secure box) was cut. I counted 26 plates but when I tried to put them in numerical order I was surprised to see a duplicate set and a missing plate( 2x CH36&lt;br /&gt;0x CH46). I suggest everyone to account for every plate. Hopefully I will be able to get that missing plate. If not, I wouldn&#x27;t bother with any other product from this company.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the 26 plates there are a lot of difficult images. Some plates are really nice to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 8/7:&lt;br /&gt;Cheeky has came through for me. After contacting them through Amazon, I received a quick response. I provided them with necessary information and was assured that I would receive my missing plate. Well today my plate was delivered along with a supplemental nail item.</li>
            <li> This set is amazing!  The patterns actually cover my whole nail!  The etchings are pretty deep too, so that is something I had to get used to, but makes the pattern transfer better and gives you more time to line it up with your nail before the polish dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The patterns are fun and there are so many of them, there is something for everyone and every event here! An excellent product with a great price!  What more could anyone want?</li>
            <li> I get this set and the Designs are very beautiful the only thing that I dont like was that the little pink box come broke and in a very poor condition,  but everything else is good</li>
            <li> Everything as expected. Love the plates</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really hd the opportunity to test these plates yet but all of the images are definitely cute and worth the price.  The only thing to mention is the seller \\&quot;Cheeky Beauty\\&quot; is in China so it is international shipping and has to go thru customs.  Still, even with sitting in customs for one week, the plates arrived sooner than the estimated delivery time.  I think you can now buy them thru amazon but it is a little more expensive if you buy thru amazon.</li>
            <li> Although the box arrived a little worn, the condition of the plates are more important. Yes, they seem to be slightly scratched, but I can understand the difficulty of keeping the surfaces pristine. As long as the designs are not damaged, I do not mind. The designs are well cut and there are a variety of images. I can&#x27;t wait to use more of these!</li>
            <li> Love these plates!! I love how large the full nail images are! It took a while for them to get to me but they were totally worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I like how Cheeky images pick up for stamping. The plates are etched well, so it picks up a nice clear image. These images are larger than previous Cheeky images, so they will work better for longer nails. They will not fit in the Bundle Monster plate holder.</li>
            <li> Finally plates that are great in quality and size! They are bigger than the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; round plates but still fit into my baseball card page protector inside my 3 ring binder. They have a nice backing and are engraved perfectly. They came in a cute box with a plastic card that can be used as a scraper. I only ended up keeping 14 plates since I thought the other 12 were a bit juvenile for me. (I&#x27;m 29 yrs old and married) Some of the other images included \\&quot;I love my boyfriend\\&quot; and \\&quot;God is a DJ\\&quot;. Don&#x27;t get me wrong all the images are very cute but I didn&#x27;t see myself using 12 of the plates and the box and scraper which I ended up selling. Another thing to point out is that the images are wide and large which I love since I have large nail beds and usually have to double stamp to get to the edges of my nails and most of the time I can&#x27;t match up the stamp properly. But these babies are perfect! I included 2 pictures (1 Nautical, 1 Leaves) You will love these plates. Well worth the money. Would make an awesome gift or a fantastic addition to your collection.</li>
            <li> I really liked it, but there&#x27;s one plate that was duplicated, and the package was broken, that make me mad, i&#x27;m losing one plates that was suposed to be in this set</li>
            <li> Cute designs that work great on my nails. These are super small plates. It was exactly what I wanted and needed. I have very small fingernails and wanted to do something fun with them. I purchased nail polish from Julep and use those with the Cheeky plates and the Konad scraper. Great price for the set.</li>
            <li> NOT what I thought it was going to be! ALL but 5 of the plates are full nail designs. My hands and nails are much too small to ever use the designs Since I don&#x27;t have access to a printer at this time I can&#x27;t return them so I&#x27;m stuck with them. Will never order from this company again not only&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; because of this order but because of the 4 other orders that have LATE JUNE &amp; JULY delivery date. VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> im really in love with these plates! i own konad, bundle monster, dashica (sdp), fauxnad and the first collection of cheeky plates the vibrant collection! and these are the first ones that are really mean for big and large nails!! they have unique, interesting and beautiful imagens, the plates are really big but you cant wish for bigger full imagens in a little plate! they came in perfect condition! in the estimated time, one of my plates did have a little bump in the edge of it but i contacted them and they already sent me a replacement!! i definitly will buy and reccomend them again!! thanks cheeky you rock!!</li>
            <li> My reviews for cheeky are starting to sound like a broken record. Time and time again when I reach for a plate to do my nails I turn it over and see it is a cheeky product. The plates are well made with images that appeal to many age groups and dealing with this company has been a breeze.</li>
            <li> These stamping plates are really good.  I just started stamping and did not want to invest in Konad until I tried more affordable ones.  I purchased three different sets.  Cheeky had the nicest packaging.  The protective film was easiest to remove.  The size of their plates were the largest, which was great because all the images fit all size nails.  The impressions were deep, insuring good stamp detail.  It comes with a little Cheeky member card that states can be used as a scraper if needed.  I wound up using it for my scraper because the scraper I purchased separately, Scratches the plates.  Thanks Cheeky! I&#x27;m gonna follow you on Facebook :)</li>
            <li> I bought 2 Cheeky plate sets. I bought the Vibrant Collection (green) and the Summer Collection (pink). This is the Summer Collection and these plates are larger than the other set. I bought the Bundle Monster storage book and the Cheeky Vibrant Collection fits perfectly inside the slots. However, in this set, the plates are too large and they don&#x27;t fit inside the slots. This is very disappointing considering they are the same brand as the other set. Why would they do this? Now I really don&#x27;t have anywhere to store them.&lt;br /&gt;The plates do stamp well and for the price it&#x27;s great. These are pretty close to the quality of the Konad plates. I just hope they don&#x27;t start making their new plates in the larger size. What let down that would be.</li>
            <li> I like how big the plates are, and how the full nail images are bigger too ;D Before I could never cover my whole nail with the image.</li>
            <li> I ordered and received the set. When they arrived I was missing plate 55. I spoke with amazon to do a replacement but the card used to purchase was damaged and it was going to be a hassle to receive a refund on a card that had been closed by the bank. I didn&#x27;t bother to contact cheeky either, fortunate for me someone sold me plate 55 which they didn&#x27;t want from their set. In the end I am happy with the stamping images.</li>
            <li> I love these plates. They arrived fast and in perfect condition. I just love the little box they come in, it&#x27;s really cute and perfect for storing your plates. It also came with a little card and let me tell you it&#x27;s my new go to scraper. It works better that anything else I&#x27;ve used. The plates are grooved perfectly and even the smallest details transfer with no problem. The plates are bigger than your usual Konad or Bm plates but that allows for bigger designs which is soo great. I&#x27;m already looking for more of their plates to purchase. I&#x27;d definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> hello I bought this set for second time for a gift I just received today but i miss one plate and one comes repeated why???? I have no idea but thats the only thing why I&#x27;m unhappy whit this set in particular ... but and the other hand are very nice designs I love it thats why I bought one more to give it to my sister but I get repeated with 2 plates and one miss ... if one to buy a set just make sure that you get full plates no one miss or repeated cause the designs are so nice and pritty</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them all yet and I&#x27;m still pretty new to stamping but these are great! The packaging is adorable and the designs are diverse. Quick delivery and shipped without a scratch. Can&#x27;t wait to order my next set!</li>
            <li> I received the plates in the mail and within a few weeks I had tried a few of them. Some are very easy to use, others take a little bit of practice. Once you peal off the blue protector sheet, they&#x27;re very sharp and I&#x27;m afraid that they&#x27;re going to scratch each other now. So that&#x27;s a concern for me. Other than that, it really depends on your nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait for my daughter to get old enough to paint her nails so that we can do this together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have told many people where I got them from and a few were interested. Hope you enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> these work with any type of nail polish they are amazing the quality is impressive i just felt in love with them....great great stamping plates you want the best out there then this is it!</li>
            <li> this came in a really cute packaging with a magnetic snap. the plate were cover with a blue sticker sheet to prevent scratching on the plates. my advice for this is to NOT use pure acetone on this because it will leave a weird smearing on it (which can be  cleaned of with water but it takes too much time) so use the ones that is partially diluted in water that they sell at walmart and stuff. the plates with smaller thinner more defined details might need pure acetone at time because it is harder to wipe it off. love the design except for a few which are sort of tacky looking.</li>
            <li> Like always Cheeky is one of the best brands make the most beautiful nail plates&lt;br /&gt;one more time I very happy to buy it</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product.  I love this product. The quality is good and the designs are adorable.</li>
            <li> The packaging is very nice, the plates are bigger in size and the designs are so fun and rock! I reccomend you get this because everyone will ask you if you got your nails done professionally/who did them (its happened to me haha). It&#x27;s that good! :D</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t order this product. I ordered Cheeky&#x27;s Vibrant Collection of plates but received these instead. Originally I wanted to contact the seller about this but upon searching for ages, I couldn&#x27;t find a way to contact them. However after looking through the plates I thought some of the images were very cute and decided to keep it and try it out. Having never used Cheeky plates before I used these as the benchmark as to whether i would then purchase the set I had originally ordered. Firstly, some of the plates had scratched up looking plastic covers, but after removing the covers the plates seemed fine. The first few images I tried came out perfectly and I was VERY pleased. However as time has passed and i have tried out different images I have found that not all of them will print. I have tried different polishes to try and get them to work and still nothing. I would say about 50% of the ones I have tried have not printed properly and I am very unimpressed with this. The images that do print are gorgeous! They are sharp and clean and look flawless on, but it&#x27;s not really good enough to make me purchase from cheeky again.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ever using and getting plates for stamping&lt;br /&gt;I tried reading a lot of reviews and comparing quality to pricing.&lt;br /&gt;I loved this collection because of designs, they are so Funny, Rare, and Cute.&lt;br /&gt;So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues stamping from these plates, when I have had issues I actually know it has been because of the nail polish, because not all nail polish will stamp the same.&lt;br /&gt;The edges of the designs are always clear and SHARP, which is something you should care when looking for plates.&lt;br /&gt;The plates are a little bigger than usual but they have the same amount of designs per plate compared to other 3 brands that I purchased: either 7 singles or 4 full nails with 2 singles. despite of being bigger the designs are not bigger than usual, just more spacing between the designs.&lt;br /&gt;They all with a blue cover that you have to remove, and sure that that blue cover may be torn for some of then (just a few) but it affects in NO WAY the performance of the plates.&lt;br /&gt;They actually come in lovely carton box (which I think is a great plus) along with a plastic card that you can replace your regular scraper with, and avoid leaving scratches on the plates (although so far I have also encountered NO PROBLEMS with the small scratches left by my scraper).&lt;br /&gt;Also the pates are just what is shown in the picture, no duplicates or missing plates and specially the exact same designs.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend Cheecky plates if you&#x27;re looking for something less girly&lt;br /&gt;Something important is that I have small natural nails (but not tiny as my sister&#x27;s) and I wear them short, and these plates fit just fine, and if you have wider and longer nails that is fine, but if you have very long nails these may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get here and some of the plates are scratched. But otherwise i love the product.</li>
            <li> So I just got my set of Cheeky summer plates, and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. In the last few ours I tried all the plates (not all images) and I was very happy how they turned out. They are carved deep enough, even most of my regular polishes stamp really well. The packaging is very cute and a great storage for the plates. I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase more Cheeky plates, and I recommend it to everyboby. :)</li>
            <li> Sort of fun.  I have used the &amp;#34;stamping polish&amp;#34; and my regular Sally Hanson Salon finish and both are not showing up in the process.  You have to use white on dark colors or dark on white to really see the stamp.  I bought this for my 11 year old daughter and it is too hard for her to work with.  I have had some luck, and some really cute results once I got the color thing right.  But it really is hit or miss.  If you have a lot of time to figure out the colors that will work, you can have cute finger nails.</li>
            <li> LOVE it... I love this collection.  The stamps are great, they provide excellent fun art to add to your manicures and they are easy to use.  I am a licensed nail tech but this would be something that anyone could use.  As with anything new play with it a couple of times, there are certain polishes that work better than others and it&#x27;s best to get a quick rolling technique down when using it.  I&#x27;ll definitely be looking forward to new sets!</li>
            <li> This box had lots of really great designs, easy clean up and great quality. I would defintely buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> just as they described them. plates work just like konad plates. its nice to have more designs. nice that its in a bundle too.</li>
            <li> I love these discs and all because of one previous ordered I decided to buy more cheeky design plates. Designs are cute. However as you see I rated it 4 stars instead of 5... Why? because the discs are lightly bigger than the first ones I bought and don&#x27;t fit in my design case I bought to hold all my discs. If they were only the same size as previous discs I have bought i would truly give it 5 stars. And because store them on top of each other like we do common cds these disc tend to scratch and lose their design after to may scratches and get flaws.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get them to work</li>
            <li> These are so cool like the selection</li>
            <li> Love Cheeky stamp plates!</li>
            <li> I like cheeky and i am a huge fan but the images wont come out clear on my nails but maybe because i am a begginer</li>
            <li> I bought these because all other brands designs&#x27; are not big enough for my thumbs and big toe nails. Cheeky makes their designs bigger just for that reason. These work well, I get very clear images from them and they clean up nice. I don&#x27;t think I have ever received a package so fast, they came the next day! I will only order Cheeky designs from now on because of their size.</li>
            <li> First time using them, I really like them, will order more, but takes a long time to get them, you will be waiting over 30 days but worth it.</li>
            <li> Great plates! I love all the different images and everything I&#x27;ve tried so far has worked great. No complaints whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Cheeky has done an awesome job with this set of plates.  Very crisp stamping plates and they are large in size and cute designs.  One of the best thing is you get a variety of full nail size images and cute single images and finally a set that doesn&#x27;t include those ridiculous french tip designs.</li>
